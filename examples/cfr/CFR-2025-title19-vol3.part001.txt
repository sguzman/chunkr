(a)
Introduction.
Section 751(a)(2)(B) of the Act provides a procedure by which so-called “new shippers” can obtain their own individual dumping margin or countervailable subsidy rate on an expedited basis. In general, a new shipper is an exporter or producer that did not export, and is not affiliated with an exporter or producer that did export, to the United States during the period of investigation. Furthermore, section 751(a)(2)(B)(iv) requires that the Secretary make a determination of whether the sales under review are bona fide. This section contains rules regarding requests for new shipper reviews and procedures for conducting such reviews, as well as requirements for determining whether sales are bona fide under section 751(a)(2)(B)(iv) of the Act. In addition, this section contains rules regarding requests for expedited reviews by non-investigated exporters in certain countervailing duty proceedings and procedures for conducting such reviews.

(iii)(A) A certification that, since the investigation was initiated, such exporter or producer has never been affiliated with any exporter or producer who exported the subject merchandise to the United States (or in the case of a regional industry, who exported the subject merchandise for sale in the region concerned) during the period of investigation, including those not individually examined during the investigation; and
(B) In an antidumping proceeding involving imports from a nonmarket economy country, a certification that the export activities of such exporter or producer are not controlled by the central government;
(iv) Certain information regarding the unaffiliated customer:
(A) A certification from the exporter or producer that it will provide, to the fullest extent possible, necessary information related to the unaffiliated customer in the United States during the new shipper review; and

(ii) An expansion of the normal period of review to include an entry and sale to an unaffiliated customer in the United States of subject merchandise
would be likely to prevent the completion of the review within the time limits set forth in paragraph (i) of this section;
(3)
Absence of bona fide sale to an unaffiliated customer.
The Secretary may rescind a new shipper review, in whole or in part, if the Secretary concludes that:

(k)
Determinations based on bona fide sales.
In determining whether the U.S. sales of an exporter or producer made during the period covered by the review are bona fide, the Secretary shall consider the factors identified at section 751(a)(2)(B)(iv) of the Act.

§ 351.215
Expedited antidumping review and security in lieu of estimated duty under section 736(c) of the Act.
(a)
Introduction.
Exporters and producers individually examined in an investigation normally cannot obtain a review of entries until an administrative review is requested. In addition, when an antidumping order is published, importers normally must begin to make a cash deposit of estimated antidumping duties upon the entry of subject merchandise. Section 736(c),
however, establishes a special procedure under which exporters or producers may request an expedited review, and bonds, rather than cash deposits, may continue to be posted for a limited period of time if several criteria are satisfied. This section contains rules regarding requests for expedited antidumping reviews and the procedures applicable to such reviews.
(b)
In general.
If the Secretary determines that the criteria of section 736(c)(1) of the Act are satisfied, the Secretary:
(1) May permit, for not more than 90 days after the date of publication of an antidumping order, the posting of a bond or other security instead of the deposit of estimated antidumping duties required under section 736(a)(3) of the Act; and
(2) Will initiate an expedited antidumping review. Before making such a determination, the Secretary will make business proprietary information available, and will provide interested parties with an opportunity to file written comments, in accordance with section 736(c)(4) of the Act.
(c)
Procedures.
The Secretary will conduct an expedited antidumping review under this section in accordance with § 351.221.
§ 351.216
Changed circumstances review under section 751(b) of the Act.
(a)
Introduction.
Section 751(b) of the Act provides for what is known as a “changed circumstances” review. This section contains rules regarding requests for changed circumstances reviews and procedures for conducting such reviews.
(b)
Requests for changed circumstances review.
At any time, an interested party may request a changed circumstances review, under section 751(b) of the Act, of an order or a suspended investigation. Within 45 days after the date on which a request is filed, the Secretary will determine whether to initiate a changed circumstances review.
(c)
Limitation on changed circumstances review.
Unless the Secretary finds that good cause exists, the Secretary will not review a final determination in an investigation (
see
section 705(a) or section 735(a) of the Act) or a suspended investigation (
see
section 704 or section 734 of the Act) less than 24 months after the date of publication of notice of the final determination or the suspension of the investigation.
(d)
Procedures.
If the Secretary decides that changed circumstances sufficient to warrant a review exist, the Secretary will conduct a changed circumstances review in accordance with § 351.221.
(e)
Time limits.
The Secretary will issue final results of review (
see
§ 351.221(b)(5)) within 270 days after the date on which the changed circumstances review is initiated, or within 45 days if all parties to the proceeding agree to the outcome of the review.
§ 351.217
Reviews to implement results of subsidies enforcement proceeding under section 751(g) of the Act.
(a)
Introduction.
Section 751(g) provides a mechanism for incorporating into an ongoing countervailing duty proceeding the results of certain subsidy-related disputes under the WTO Subsidies Agreement. Where the United States, in the WTO, has successfully challenged the “nonactionable” (
e.g.,
noncountervailable) status of a foreign subsidy, or where the United States has successfully challenged a prohibited or actionable subsidy, the Secretary may conduct a review to determine the effect, if any, of the successful outcome on an existing countervailing duty order or suspended investigation. This section contains rules regarding the initiation and conduct of reviews under section 751(g).
(b)
Violations of Article 8 of the Subsidies Agreement.
If:
(1) The Secretary receives notice from the Trade Representative of a violation of Article 8 of the Subsidies Agreement;
(2) The Secretary has reason to believe that merchandise subject to an existing countervailing duty order or suspended investigation is benefiting from the subsidy or subsidy program found to have been in violation of Article 8; and
(3) No administrative review is in progress, the Secretary will initiate an Article 8 violation review of the order or suspended investigation to determine whether the subject merchandise benefits from the subsidy or subsidy program found to have been in violation of Article 8 of the Subsidies Agreement.
(c)
Withdrawal of subsidy or imposition of countermeasures.
If the Trade Representative notifies the Secretary that, under Article 4 or Article 7 of the Subsidies Agreement:
(1)(i)(A) The United States has imposed countermeasures; and
(B) Such countermeasures are based on the effects in the United States of imports of merchandise that is the subject of a countervailing duty order; or
(ii) A WTO member country has withdrawn a countervailable subsidy provided with respect to merchandise subject to a countervailing duty order, then
(2) The Secretary will initiate an Article 4/Article 7 review of the order to determine if the amount of estimated duty to be deposited should be adjusted or the order should be revoked.
(d)
Procedures.
The Secretary will conduct an Article 8 violation review or an Article 4/Article 7 review under this section in accordance with § 351.221.
(e)
Expedited reviews.
The Secretary will conduct reviews under this section on an expedited basis.
§ 351.218
Sunset reviews under section 751(c) of the Act.
(a)
Introduction.
The URAA added a new procedure, commonly referred to as “sunset reviews,” in section 751(c) of the Act. In general, no later than once every five years, the Secretary must determine whether dumping or countervailable subsidies would be likely to continue or resume if an order were revoked or a suspended investigation were terminated. The Commission must conduct a similar review to determine whether injury would be likely to continue or resume in the absence of an order or suspended investigation. If the determinations under section 751(c) of both the Secretary and the Commission are affirmative, the order (or suspended investigation) remains in place. If either determination is negative, the order will be revoked (or the suspended investigation will be terminated). This section contains rules regarding the procedures for sunset reviews.
(b)
In general.
The Secretary will conduct a sunset review, under section 751(c) of the Act, of each antidumping and countervailing duty order and suspended investigation, and, under section 752(b) or section 752(c) (whichever is applicable), will determine whether revocation of an antidumping or countervailing duty order or termination of a suspended investigation would be likely to lead to continuation or recurrence of dumping or a countervailable subsidy.
(c)
Notice of initiation of review; early initiation
—(1)
Initial sunset review.
No later than 30 days before the fifth anniversary date of an order or suspension of an investigation (
see
section 751(c)(1) of the Act), the Secretary will publish a notice of initiation of a sunset review (
see
section 751(c)(2) of the Act).
(2)
Subsequent sunset reviews.
In the case of an order or suspended investigation that is continued following a sunset review initiated under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, no later than 30 days before the fifth anniversary of the date of the last determination by the Commission to continue the order or suspended investigation, the Secretary will publish a notice of initiation of a sunset review (
see
section 751(c)(2) of the Act).
(3)
Early initiation.
The Secretary may publish a notice of initiation at an earlier date than the dates described in paragraph (c) (1) and (2) of this section if a domestic interested party demonstrates to the Secretary's satisfaction that an early initiation would promote administrative efficiency. However, if the Secretary determines that the domestic interested party that requested early initiation is a related party or an importer under section 771(4)(B) of the Act and § 351.203(e)(4), the Secretary may decline the request for early initiation.
(4)
Transition orders.
The Secretary will initiate sunset reviews of transition orders, as defined in section 751(c)(6)(C) of the Act, in accordance with section 751(c)(6) of the Act.
(d)

§ 351.219
Reviews of countervailing duty orders in connection with an investigation under section 753 of the Act.
(a)
Introduction.
Section 753 of the Act is a transition provision for countervailing duty orders that were issued under section 303 of the Act without an injury determination by the Commission. Under the Subsidies Agreement, one country may not impose countervailing duties on imports from another WTO Member without first making a determination that such imports have caused injury to a domestic industry. Section 753 provides a mechanism for providing an injury test with respect to those “no-injury” orders under section 303 that apply to merchandise from WTO Members. This section contains rules regarding requests for section 753 investigations by a domestic interested party; and the procedures that the Department will follow in reviewing a countervailing duty order and providing the Commission with advice regarding the amount and nature of a countervailable subsidy.
(b)
Notification of domestic interested parties.
The Secretary will notify directly domestic interested parties as soon as possible after the opportunity arises for requesting an investigation by the Commission under section 753 of the Act.
(c)
Initiation and conduct of section 753 review.
Where the Secretary deems it necessary in order to provide to the Commission information on the amount or nature of a countervailable subsidy (
see
section 753(b)(2) of the Act), the Secretary may initiate a section 753 review of the countervailing duty order in question. The Secretary will conduct a section 753 review in accordance with § 351.221.
§ 351.220
Countervailing duty review at the direction of the President under section 762 of the Act.
At the direction of the President or a designee, the Secretary will conduct a review under section 762(a)(1) of the Act to determine if a countervailable subsidy is being provided with respect to merchandise subject to an understanding or other kind of quantitative restriction agreement accepted under section 704(a)(2) or section 704(c)(3) of the Act. The Secretary will conduct a review under this section in accordance with § 351.221. If the Secretary's final results of review under this section and the Commission's final results of review under section 762(a)(2) of the Act are both affirmative, the Secretary will issue a countervailing duty order and order suspension of liquidation in accordance with section 762(b) of the Act.
§ 351.221

de minimis
duties; and
(7) If the review involves a revision to the cash deposit rates for estimated antidumping duties or countervailing duties, instruct U.S. Customs and Border Protection to collect cash deposits at the revised rates on future entries.

§ 351.222
Revocation of orders; termination of suspended investigations.
(a)
Introduction.
“Revocation” is a term of art that refers to the end of an antidumping or countervailing proceeding in which an order has been issued. “Termination” is the companion term for the end of a proceeding in which the investigation was suspended due to the acceptance of a suspension agreement. Generally, a revocation or termination may occur only after the Department or the Commission has conducted one or more reviews under section 751 of the Act. This section contains rules regarding requirements for a revocation or termination; and procedures that the Department will follow in determining whether to revoke an order or terminate a suspended investigation.
(b)
Revocation or termination based on absence of dumping.
(1) In determining whether to revoke an antidumping duty order or terminate a suspended antidumping investigation, the Secretary will consider:
(i) Whether all exporters and producers covered at the time of revocation by the order or the suspension agreement have sold the subject merchandise at not less than normal value for a period of at least three consecutive years; and
(ii) Whether the continued application of the antidumping duty order is otherwise necessary to offset dumping.
(2) If the Secretary determines, based upon the criteria in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section, that the antidumping duty order or suspension of the antidumping duty investigation is no longer warranted, the Secretary will revoke the order or terminate the investigation.
(c)
Revocation or termination based on absence of countervailable subsidy.
(1)(i) In determining whether to revoke a countervailing duty order or terminate a suspended countervailing duty investigation, the Secretary will consider:
(A) Whether the government of the affected country has eliminated all countervailable subsidies on the subject merchandise by abolishing for the subject merchandise, for a period of at least three consecutive years, all programs that the Secretary has found countervailable;
(B) Whether exporters and producers of the subject merchandise are continuing to receive any net countervailable subsidy from an abolished program referred to in paragraph (c)(1)(i)(A) of this section; and
(C) Whether the continued application of the countervailing duty order or suspension of countervailing duty investigation is otherwise necessary to offset subsidization.
(ii) If the Secretary determines, based upon the criteria in paragraphs (c)(1)(i)(A) through (C) of this section, that the countervailing duty order or suspension of the countervailing duty investigation is no longer warranted, the Secretary will revoke the order or terminate the suspended investigation.
(2)(i) In determining whether to revoke a countervailing duty order or terminate a suspended countervailing duty investigation, the Secretary will consider:
(A) Whether all exporters and producers covered at the time of revocation by the order or the suspension agreement have not applied for or received any net countervailable subsidy on the subject merchandise for a period of at least five consecutive years; and
(B) Whether the continued application of the countervailing duty order or suspension of the countervailing duty investigation is otherwise necessary to offset subsidization.
(ii) If the Secretary determines, based upon the criteria in paragraphs (c)(2)(i)(A) and (B) of this section, that the countervailing duty order or the suspension of the countervailing duty investigation is no longer warranted, the Secretary will revoke the order or terminate the suspended investigation.
(d)
Treatment of unreviewed intervening years
—(1)
In general.
The Secretary will not revoke an order or terminate a suspended investigation under paragraphs (b) or (c) of this section unless the Secretary has conducted a review under this subpart of the first and third (or fifth) years of the three-and five-year consecutive time periods referred to in those paragraphs. The Secretary need not have conducted a review of an intervening year (
see
paragraph (d)(2) of this section). However, except in the case of a revocation or termination under paragraph (c)(1) of this section (government abolition of countervailable subsidy programs), before revoking an order or terminating a suspended investigation, the Secretary must be satisfied that, during each of the three (or five) years, there were exports to the United States in commercial quantities of the subject merchandise to which a revocation or termination will apply.

§ 351.223
Procedures for initiation of downstream product monitoring.
(a)
Introduction.
Section 780 of the Act establishes a mechanism for monitoring imports of “downstream products.” In general, section 780 is aimed at situations where, following the issuance of an antidumping or countervailing duty order on a product that is used as a component in another product, exports to the United States of that other (or “downstream”) product increase. Although the Department is responsible for determining whether trade in the downstream product should be monitored, the Commission is responsible for conducting the actual monitoring. The Commission must report the results of its monitoring to the Department, and the Department
must consider the reports in determining whether to self-initiate an antidumping or countervailing duty investigation on the downstream product. This section contains rules regarding applications for the initiation of downstream product monitoring and decisions regarding such applications.
(b)
Contents of application.
An application to designate a downstream product for monitoring under section 780 of the Act must contain the following information, to the extent reasonably available to the applicant:
(1) The name and address of the person requesting the monitoring and a description of the article it produces which is the basis for filing its application;
(2) A detailed description of the downstream product in question;
(3) A detailed description of the component product that is incorporated into the downstream product, including the value of the component part in relation to the value of the downstream product, and the extent to which the component part has been substantially transformed as a result of its incorporation into the downstream product;
(4) The name of the country of production of both the downstream and component products and the name of any intermediate country from which the merchandise is imported;
(5) The name and address of all known producers of component parts and downstream products in the relevant countries and a detailed description of any relationship between such producers;
(6) Whether the component part is already subject to monitoring to aid in the enforcement of a bilateral arrangement within the meaning of section 804 of the Trade and Tariff Act of 1984;
(7) A list of all antidumping or countervailing duty investigations that have been suspended, or antidumping or countervailing duty orders that have been issued, on merchandise that is related to the component part and that is manufactured in the same foreign country in which the component part is manufactured;
(8) A list of all antidumping or countervailing duty investigations that have been suspended, or antidumping or countervailing duty orders that have been issued, on merchandise that is manufactured or exported by the manufacturer or exporter of the component part and that is similar in description and use to the component part; and
(9) The reasons for suspecting that the imposition of antidumping or countervailing duties has resulted in a diversion of exports of the component part into increased production and exportation to the United States of the downstream product.
(c)
Determination of sufficiency of application.
Within 14 days after an application is filed under paragraph (b) of this section, the Secretary will rule on the sufficiency of the application by making the determinations described in section 780(a)(2) of the Act.
(d)
Notice of determination.
The Secretary will publish in the
Federal Register
notice of each affirmative or negative “monitoring” determination made under section 780(a)(2) of the Act, and if the determination under section 780(a)(2)(A) of the Act and a determination made under any clause of section 780(a)(2)(B) of the Act are affirmative, will transmit to the Commission a copy of the determination and the application. The Secretary will make available to the Commission, and to its employees directly involved in the monitoring, the information upon which the Secretary based the initiation.
§ 351.224
Disclosure of calculations and procedures for the correction of ministerial errors.
(a)
Introduction.
In the interests of transparency, the Department has long had a practice of providing parties with the details of its antidumping and countervailing duty calculations. This practice has come to be referred to as a “disclosure.” This section contains rules relating to requests for disclosure and procedures for correcting ministerial errors.
(b)
Disclosure.
The Secretary will disclose to a party to the proceeding calculations performed, if any, in connection with a preliminary determination under section 703(b) or section 733(b) of the Act, a final determination under section 705(a) or section 735(a) of the
Act, and a final results of a review under section 736(c), section 751, or section 753 of the Act, normally within five days after the date of any public announcement or, if there is no public announcement of, within five days after the date of publication of, the preliminary determination, final determination, or final results of review (whichever is applicable). The Secretary will disclose to a party to the proceeding calculations performed, if any, in connection with a preliminary results of review under section 751 or section 753 of the Act, normally not later than ten days after the date of the public announcement of, or, if there is no public announcement, within five days after the date of publication of, the preliminary results of review.
(c)
Comments regarding ministerial errors
—(1)
In general.
A party to the proceeding to whom the Secretary has disclosed calculations performed in connection with a preliminary determination may submit comments concerning a significant ministerial error in such calculations. A party to the proceeding to whom the Secretary has disclosed calculations performed in connection with a final determination or the final results of a review may submit comments concerning any ministerial error in such calculations. Comments concerning ministerial errors made in the preliminary results of a review should be included in a party's case brief.
(2)
Time limits for submitting comments.
A party to the proceeding must file comments concerning ministerial errors within five days after the earlier of:
(i) The date on which the Secretary released disclosure documents to that party; or
(ii) The date on which the Secretary held a disclosure meeting with that party.
(3)
Replies to comments.
Replies to comments submitted under paragraph (c)(1) of this section must be filed within five days after the date on which the comments were filed with the Secretary. The Secretary will not consider replies to comments submitted in connection with a preliminary determination.
(4)
Extensions.
A party to the proceeding may request an extension of the time limit for filing comments concerning a ministerial error in a final determination or final results of review under § 351.302(c) within three days after the date of any public announcement, or, if there is no public announcement, within five days after the date of publication of the final determination or final results of review, as applicable. The Secretary will not extend the time limit for filing comments concerning a significant ministerial error in a preliminary determination.
(d)
Contents of comments and replies.
Comments filed under paragraph (c)(1) of this section must explain the alleged ministerial error by reference to applicable evidence in the official record, and must present what, in the party's view, is the appropriate correction. In addition, comments concerning a preliminary determination must demonstrate how the alleged ministerial error is significant (
see
paragraph (g) of this section) by illustrating the effect on individual weighted-average dumping margin or countervailable subsidy rate, the all-others rate, or the country-wide subsidy rate (whichever is applicable). Replies to any comments must be limited to issues raised in such comments.
(e)
Corrections.
The Secretary will analyze any comments received and, if appropriate, correct any significant ministerial error by amending the preliminary determination, or correct any ministerial error by amending the final determination or the final results of review (whichever is applicable). Where practicable, the Secretary will announce publicly the issuance of a correction notice, and normally will do so within 30 days after the date of public announcement, or, if there is no public announcement, within 30 days after the date of publication, of the preliminary determination, final determination, or final results of review (whichever is applicable). In addition, the Secretary will publish notice of such corrections in the
Federal Register.
A correction notice will not alter the anniversary month of an order or suspended investigation for purposes of requesting an administrative review (
see
§ 351.213) or a
new shipper review (
see
§ 351.214) or initiating a sunset review (
see
§ 351.218).
(f)
Definition of “ministerial error.”
Under this section,
ministerial error
means an error in addition, subtraction, or other arithmetic function, clerical error resulting from inaccurate copying, duplication, or the like, and any other similar type of unintentional error which the Secretary considers ministerial.
(g)
Definition of “significant ministerial error.”
Under this section,
significant ministerial error
means a ministerial error (
see
paragraph (f) of this section), the correction of which, either singly or in combination with other errors:
(1) Would result in a change of at least five absolute percentage points in, but not less than 25 percent of, the weighted-average dumping margin or the countervailable subsidy rate (whichever is applicable) calculated in the original (erroneous) preliminary determination; or
(2) Would result in a difference between a weighted-average dumping margin or countervailable subsidy rate (whichever is applicable) of zero (or
de minimis
) and a weighted-average dumping margin or countervailable subsidy rate of greater than
de minimis,
or vice versa.
§ 351.225
Scope rulings.
(a)
Introduction.
Questions sometimes arise as to whether a particular product is covered by the scope of an antidumping or countervailing duty order. Such questions may arise for a variety of reasons given that the description of the merchandise subject to the scope is written in general terms. The Secretary will initiate and conduct a scope inquiry and issue a scope ruling to determine whether or not a product is covered by the scope of an order at the request of an interested party or on the Secretary's initiative. A scope ruling that a product is covered by the scope of an order is a determination that the product has always been covered by the scope of that order. This section contains rules and procedures regarding scope rulings, including scope ruling applications, scope inquiries, and standards used in determining whether a product is covered by the scope of an order. Unless otherwise specified, the procedures as described in subpart C of this part (§§ 351.301 through 351.308 and §§ 351.312 through 351.313) apply to this section.
(b)
Self-initiation of a scope inquiry.
If the Secretary determines from available information that an inquiry is warranted to determine whether a product is covered by the scope of an order, the Secretary may initiate a scope inquiry by publishing a notice of initiation in the
Federal Register
.
(c)
Scope ruling application
—(1)
Contents.
An interested party may submit a scope ruling application requesting that the Secretary conduct a scope inquiry to determine whether a product, which is or has been in actual production by the time of the filing of the application, is covered by the scope of an order.

(viii) The applicant's statement as to whether the product is covered by the scope of the order, including:
(A) An explanation with specific reference to paragraph (j) and (k) of this section, as appropriate;
(B) Citations to any applicable legal authority; and

(d)
Initiation of a scope inquiry and other actions based on a scope ruling application
—(1)
Acceptance and initiation of a scope inquiry based on a scope ruling application.
Except as provided under paragraph (d)(1)(ii) or (d)(2) of this section, within 30 days after the filing of a scope ruling application, the Secretary will determine whether to accept or reject the scope ruling application and to initiate or not initiate a scope inquiry, or, in the alternative, paragraph (d)(1)(ii) will apply.
(i) If the Secretary determines that a scope ruling application is incomplete or otherwise unacceptable, the Secretary may reject the scope ruling application and will provide a written explanation of the reasons for the rejection. If the scope ruling application is rejected, the applicant may resubmit the full application at any time, with all identified deficiencies corrected.

(iii) If the Secretary does not reject the scope ruling application or initiate the scope inquiry within 31 days after
the filing of the application or the receipt of a timely response to the Secretary's questions, the application will be deemed accepted, and the scope inquiry will be deemed initiated.
(2)
Addressing the scope issue in another segment of the proceeding.
Within 30 days after the filing of a scope ruling application, if the Secretary determines upon review of the application that the scope issue before the Secretary should be addressed in an ongoing segment of the proceeding, such as a circumvention inquiry under § 351.226 or a covered merchandise inquiry under § 351.227, rather than initiating a scope inquiry, the Secretary will notify the applicant of its intent to address the scope issue in such other segment.
(3)
Notice of scope applications.
On a monthly basis, the Secretary will publish a notice in the
Federal Register
listing scope applications filed with the Secretary.
(e)
Deadlines for scope rulings
—(1)
In general.
The Secretary shall issue a final scope ruling within 120 days after the date on which the scope inquiry was initiated under paragraph (b) or (d) of this section.
(2)
Extension.
The Secretary may extend the deadline in paragraph (e)(1) of this section by no more than 180 days, for a final scope ruling to be issued no later than 300 days after initiation, if the Secretary determines that good cause exists to warrant an extension. Situations in which good cause has been demonstrated may include:
(3)
Alignment with other segments.
If the Secretary determines it is appropriate to do so, the Secretary may align the deadlines under this paragraph with the deadlines of another segment of the proceeding.
(f)
Scope inquiry procedures.
The filing and timing restrictions of § 351.301(c) do not apply to this paragraph (f), and factual information submitted inconsistent with the terms of this paragraph may be rejected as unsolicited and untimely. (1) Within 30 days after the Secretary's self-initiation of a scope inquiry under paragraph (b) of this section, interested parties are permitted one opportunity to submit comments and factual information addressing the self-initiation. Within 14 days after the filing of such comments, any interested party is permitted one opportunity to submit comments and factual information submitted by the other interested parties.
(2) Within 30 days after the initiation of a scope inquiry under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, an interested party other than the applicant is permitted one opportunity to submit comments and factual information to rebut, clarify, or correct factual information contained in the scope ruling application. Within 14 days after the filing of such rebuttal, clarification, or correction, the applicant is permitted one opportunity to submit comments and factual information to rebut, clarify, or correct factual information submitted in the interested party's rebuttal, clarification or correction.
(3) Following initiation of a scope inquiry under paragraph (b) or (d) of this section, the Secretary may issue questionnaires and verify submissions received, where appropriate. The Secretary may limit issuance of questionnaires to a reasonable number of respondents. Questionnaire responses are due on the date specified by the Secretary. Within 14 days after a questionnaire response has been filed with the Secretary, an interested party other than the original submitter is permitted one opportunity to submit comments and factual information to rebut, clarify, or correct factual information contained in the questionnaire response. Within seven days of the filing of such rebuttal, clarification, or correction, the original submitter is permitted one opportunity to submit comments and factual information to rebut, clarify, or correct factual information submitted in the interested party's rebuttal, clarification or correction.
(4) If the Secretary issues a preliminary scope ruling under paragraph (g) of this section, which is not issued concurrently with the initiation of the scope inquiry, the Secretary will establish a schedule for the filing of scope comments and rebuttal comments. Unless otherwise specified, any interested party may submit scope comments within 14 days after the issuance of the preliminary scope ruling, and any interested party may submit rebuttal comments within 7 days thereafter.
Unless otherwise specified, no new factual information will be accepted in the scope or rebuttal comments.
(5) If the Secretary issues a preliminary scope ruling concurrently with the initiation of a scope inquiry under paragraph (g) of this section, paragraphs (f)(1) through (4) of this section will not apply. In such a situation, the Secretary will establish appropriate procedures on a case-specific basis.
(6) If the Secretary determines it is appropriate to do so, the Secretary may rescind, in whole or in part, a scope inquiry under this section and will notify interested parties.
(7) If the Secretary determines it is appropriate to do so, the Secretary may alter or extend any time limits under this paragraph or establish a separate schedule for the filing of comments and/or factual information during the scope inquiry.
(g)
Preliminary scope ruling.
The Secretary may issue a preliminary scope ruling, based upon the available information at the time, as to whether there is a reasonable basis to believe or suspect that the product subject to a scope inquiry is covered by the scope of the order. In determining whether to issue a preliminary scope ruling, the Secretary may consider the complexity of the issues and arguments raised in the scope inquiry. The Secretary may issue a preliminary scope ruling concurrently with the initiation of a scope inquiry under paragraph (b) or (d) of this section.
(h)
Final scope ruling.
The Secretary will issue a final scope ruling as to whether the product that is the subject of the scope inquiry is covered by the scope of the order, including an explanation of the factual and legal conclusions on which the final scope ruling is based. The Secretary will promptly convey a copy of the final scope ruling in the manner prescribed by section 516A(a)(2)(A)(ii) of the Act to all parties to the proceeding (
see
§ 351.102(b)(36)), subject to the notice requirements for Governments of an FTA country under § 356.6 and § 356.7.
(i)
Other segments of the proceeding.
(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the Secretary may, but is not required to, address scope issues in another segment of the proceeding, such as an administrative review under § 351.213, a circumvention inquiry under § 351.226, or a covered merchandise inquiry under § 351.227 without conducting or completing a scope inquiry under this section. For example, the Secretary may rescind a scope inquiry under paragraph (f)(6) of this section and determine whether the product at issue is covered by the scope of the order in another segment of the proceeding (including another scope inquiry).
(2) During the pendency of a scope inquiry or upon issuance of a final scope ruling under paragraph (h) of this section, the Secretary may take any further action, as appropriate, with respect to another segment of the proceeding. For example, if the Secretary considers it appropriate, the Secretary may request information concerning the product that is the subject of the scope inquiry for purpose of an administrative review under § 351.213.
(j)
Country of origin determinations.
In considering whether a product is covered by the scope of the order at issue, the Secretary may need to determine the country of origin of the product. To make such a determination, the Secretary may use any reasonable method and is not bound by the determinations of any other agency, including tariff classification and country of origin marking rulings issued by U.S. Customs and Border Protection.
(1) In determining the country of origin, the Secretary may conduct a substantial transformation analysis that considers relevant factors that arise on a case-by-case basis, including:
(i) Whether the processed downstream product is a different class or kind of merchandise than the upstream product;
(ii) The physical characteristics (including chemical, dimensional, and technical characteristics) of the product;
(iii) The intended end-use of the downstream product;
(iv) The cost of production/value added of further processing in the third country or countries;
(v) The nature and sophistication of processing in the third country or countries; and
(vi) The level of investment in the third country or countries.
(2) In conducting a country of origin determination, the Secretary also may consider where the essential component of the product is produced or where the essential characteristics of the product are imparted.
(k)
Scope rulings.
(1) In determining whether a product is covered by the scope of the order at issue, the Secretary will consider the language of the scope and may make its determination on this basis alone if the language of the scope, including the descriptions of merchandise expressly excluded from the scope, is dispositive.
(i) The following primary interpretive sources may be taken into account under paragraph (k)(1) introductory text of this section, at the discretion of the Secretary:
(A) The descriptions of the merchandise contained in the petition pertaining to the order at issue;
(B) The descriptions of the merchandise contained in the initial investigation pertaining to the order at issue;
(C) Previous or concurrent determinations of the Secretary, including prior scope rulings, memoranda, or clarifications pertaining to both the order at issue, as well as other orders with same or similar language as that of the order at issue; and
(D) Determinations of the Commission pertaining to the order at issue, including reports issued pursuant to the Commission's initial investigation.
(ii) The Secretary may also consider secondary interpretive sources under paragraph (k)(1) introductory text of this section, such as any other determinations of the Secretary or the Commission not identified above, Customs rulings or determinations, industry usage, dictionaries, and any other relevant record evidence. However, in the event of a conflict between these secondary interpretive sources and the primary interpretive sources under paragraph (k)(1)(i) of this section, the primary interpretive sources will normally govern in determining whether a product is covered by the scope of the order at issue.
(2)(i) If the Secretary determines that the sources under paragraph (k)(1) of this section are not dispositive, the Secretary will then further consider the following factors:
(A) The physical characteristics (including chemical, dimensional, and technical characteristics) of the product;
(B) The expectations of the ultimate users;
(C) The ultimate use of the product;
(D) The channels of trade in which the product is sold; and
(E) The manner in which the product is advertised and displayed.
(ii) In the event of a conflict between the factors under paragraph (k)(2)(i) of this section, paragraph (k)(2)(i)(A) will normally be allotted greater weight than the other factors.
(3) If merchandise contains or consists of two or more components and the product at issue in the scope inquiry is a component of that merchandise as a whole, the Secretary may adopt the following analysis:
(i) The Secretary will analyze the scope language under paragraph (k)(1) of this section, and, if necessary, the factors under paragraph (k)(2) of this section, to determine if the component product, standing alone, would be covered by an order;
(ii) If the Secretary determines that the component product would otherwise be covered by the scope of an order as a result of the analysis under (k)(3)(i) of this section, the Secretary will consider the scope language under paragraph (k)(1) of this section to determine whether the component product's inclusion in the merchandise as a whole results in its exclusion from the scope of the order; and
(iii) If the Secretary determines the analysis under (k)(3)(ii) of this section does not resolve whether the component product's inclusion in the merchandise as a whole results in its exclusion from the scope of the order, then the Secretary will consider, as appropriate, the following relevant factors that may arise on a product-specific basis:
(A) The practicability of separating the in-scope component for repackaging or resale, considering the relative difficulty and expense of separating the components;
(B) The measurable value of the in-scope component as compared to the
measurable value of the merchandise as a whole; and
(C) The ultimate use or function of the in-scope component relative to the ultimate use or function of the merchandise as a whole.
(l)
Suspension of liquidation.
(1) When the Secretary initiates a scope inquiry under paragraph (b) or (d) of this section, the Secretary will notify U.S. Customs and Border Protection of the initiation and direct U.S. Customs and Border Protection to continue the suspension of liquidation of entries of products subject to the scope inquiry that were already subject to the suspension of liquidation, and to apply the cash deposit rate that would be applicable if the product were determined to be covered by the scope of the order. Such suspension shall include, but shall not be limited to, entries covered by the final results of administrative review of an antidumping or countervailing duty order pursuant to § 351.212(b), automatic assessment pursuant to § 351.212(c), and a rescinded administrative review pursuant to § 351.213(d), as well as any other entries already suspended by U.S. Customs and Border Protection under the antidumping and countervailing duty laws which have not yet been liquidated in accordance with 19 CFR part 159.
(2) If the Secretary issues a preliminary scope ruling under paragraph (g) of this section that the product at issue is covered by the scope of the order, the Secretary will take the following actions:
(i) The Secretary will direct U.S. Customs and Border Protection to continue the suspension of liquidation of previously suspended entries and apply the applicable cash deposit rate;
(ii) The Secretary will direct U.S. Customs and Border Protection to begin the suspension of liquidation and require a cash deposit of estimated duties, at the applicable rate, for each unliquidated entry of the product not yet suspended, entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the date of initiation of the scope inquiry; and
(iii)(A)
In general.
Subject to paragraph (l)(2)(iii)(B) of this section, the Secretary normally will direct U.S. Customs and Border Protection to begin the suspension of liquidation and require a cash deposit of estimated duties, at the applicable rate, for each unliquidated entry of the product not yet suspended, entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption prior to the date of initiation of the scope inquiry.
(B)
Exception.
If the Secretary determines it is appropriate to do so, the Secretary may, at the timely request of an interested party or at the Secretary's discretion, direct U.S. Customs and Border Protection to begin the suspension of liquidation and apply the applicable cash deposit rate under paragraph (l)(2)(iii)(A) of this section at an alternative date. In response to a timely request from an interested party, the Secretary will only consider an alternative date based on a specific argument supported by evidence establishing the appropriateness of that alternative date.
(3) If the Secretary issues a final scope ruling under paragraph (h) of this section that the product at issue is covered by the scope of the order, the Secretary will take the following actions:
(i) The Secretary will direct U.S. Customs and Border Protection to continue the suspension of liquidation of previously suspended entries and apply the applicable cash deposit rate until appropriate liquidation instructions are issued;
(ii) The Secretary will direct U.S. Customs and Border Protection to begin the suspension of liquidation and require a cash deposit of estimated duties, at the applicable rate, for each unliquidated entry of the product not yet suspended, entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the date of initiation of the scope inquiry until appropriate liquidation instructions are issued; and
(iii)(A)
In general.
Subject to paragraph (l)(3)(iii)(B) of this section, the Secretary normally will direct U.S. Customs and Border Protection to begin the suspension of liquidation and require a cash deposit of estimated duties, at the applicable rate, for each unliquidated entry of the product not yet suspended, entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption prior to
the date of initiation of the scope inquiry until appropriate liquidation instructions are issued.
(B)
Exception.
If the Secretary determines it is appropriate to do so, the Secretary may, at the timely request of an interested party or at the Secretary's discretion, direct U.S. Customs and Border Protection to begin the suspension of liquidation and apply the applicable cash deposit rate under paragraph (l)(3)(iii)(A) of this section at an alternative date until appropriate liquidation instructions are issued. In response to a timely request from an interested party, the Secretary will only consider an alternative date based on a specific argument supported by evidence establishing the appropriateness of that alternative date.
(4) If the Secretary issues a final scope ruling under paragraph (h) of this section that the product is not covered by the scope of the order, and entries of the product at issue are not otherwise subject to suspension of liquidation as a result of another segment of the proceeding, such as a circumvention inquiry under § 351.226 or a covered merchandise inquiry under § 351.227, the Secretary will order U.S. Customs and Border Protection to terminate the suspension of liquidation and refund any cash deposits for such entries.
(5) Nothing in this section affects the U.S. Customs and Border Protection's authority to take any additional action with respect to the suspension of liquidation or related measures.
(m)
Applicability of scope rulings; companion orders
—(1)
Applicability of scope rulings.
In conducting a scope inquiry under this section, the Secretary shall consider, based on the available record evidence, whether the scope ruling should be applied:
(i) On a producer-specific, exporter-specific, importer-specific basis, or some combination thereof; or
(ii) To all products from the same country with the same relevant physical characteristics, (including chemical, dimensional and technical characteristics) as the product at issue, on a country-wide basis, regardless of the producer, exporter or importer of those products.
(2)
Companion antidumping and countervailing duty orders.
If there are companion antidumping and countervailing duty orders covering the same merchandise from the same country of origin, the requesting interested party under paragraph (c) of this section must file the scope ruling application pertaining to both orders on the records of both the antidumping duty and countervailing duty proceedings. If the Secretary accepts the scope applications on both records under paragraph (d) of this section, the Secretary will notify the requesting interested party that all subsequent filings should be filed only on the record of the antidumping duty proceeding. If the Secretary determines to initiate a scope inquiry under paragraph (b) or (d) of this section, the Secretary will initiate and conduct a single inquiry with respect to the product at issue for both orders only on the record of the antidumping duty proceeding. Once the Secretary issues a final scope ruling on the record of the antidumping duty proceeding, the Secretary will include on the record of the countervailing duty proceeding a copy of the scope ruling memoranda, a copy of the preliminary scope ruling memoranda, if one had been issued, and all relevant instructions to U.S. Customs and Border Protection.
(n)
Service of scope ruling application; annual inquiry service list; entry of appearance.
(1) The requirements of § 351.303(f) apply to this section, except that an interested party that submits a scope ruling application under paragraph (c) of this section must serve a copy of the application on all persons on the annual inquiry service list for that order, as well as the companion order, if any, as described in paragraph (m)(2) of this section. If a scope ruling application is rejected and resubmitted pursuant to paragraph (d)(1) of this section, service of the resubmitted application is not required under this paragraph, unless otherwise specified.
(2) For purposes of this section, the “annual inquiry service list” will include the petitioner(s) and those parties that file a request for inclusion on the annual inquiry service list for a proceeding, in accordance with the Secretary's established procedures.
(3) A new “annual inquiry service list” will be established on a yearly
basis. Parties filing a request for inclusion on that list must file a request during the anniversary month of the publication of the antidumping or countervailing duty order. Only the petitioner and the government of the foreign country at issue in an antidumping or countervailing duty order will be automatically placed on the new annual inquiry service list once the previous year's list has been replaced.
(4) Once a scope inquiry has been self-initiated or a scope ruling application is accepted by the Secretary, a segment-specific service list will be established and the requirements of § 351.303(f) will apply. Parties other than the scope ruling applicant under paragraph (c) of this section that wish to participate in the scope inquiry must file an entry of appearance in accordance with § 351.103(d)(1).
(o)
Publication of list of final scope rulings.
On a quarterly basis, the Secretary will publish in the
Federal Register
a list of final scope rulings issued within the previous three months. This list will include the case name, and a brief description of the ruling. The Secretary also may include complete public versions of its scope rulings on its website, should the Secretary determine such placement is warranted.
(p)
Suspended investigations; suspension agreements.
The Secretary may apply the procedures set forth in this section in determining whether a product at issue is covered by the scope of a suspended investigation or a suspension agreement (
see
§ 351.208).
(q)
Scope clarifications.
The Secretary may issue a scope clarification at any time which provides an interpretation of specific language in the scope of an order and addresses other scope-related issues but does not address or determine whether a product is covered by the scope of an order in the first instance other than in the situations listed in this paragraph (q).
(1) Scope clarifications may be used in the following situations to clarify:
(i) Whether a product is covered or excluded by the scope of an order based on two or more previous scope determinations covering products which have the same or similar physical characteristics (including chemical, dimensional, and technical characteristics);
(ii) Whether a product covered by the scope of an order, and for which coverage is not at issue, is not subject to the imposition of antidumping or countervailing duties pursuant to a statutory exception to the trade remedy laws, such as the limited governmental importation exception set forth in section 771(20)(B) of the Act;
(iii) Whether language or descriptors in the scope of an order that are subsequently updated, revised, or replaced, in the following circumstances, continue to apply to the product at issue:
(A) Modifications to the language in the scope of an order pursuant to litigation or a changed circumstances review under section 751(b) of the Act;
(B) Changes to Harmonized Tariff Schedule classifications, as administered by the Commission; and
(C) Changes to industrial standards set forth in a scope, as determined by the industry source for those standards identified in the scope; and
(iv) To clarify an analysis conducted by Commerce in a previous scope determination or scope ruling. For example, an issue may arise as to whether certain processing, observed in a segment of proceeding and conducted in a third country, falls within a stage of production previously determined by the Secretary in a country-of-origin analysis in the same proceeding, pursuant to paragraph (j)(2) of this section, to be the stage of production at which the essential component of the product is produced or where the essential characteristics of the product are imparted.
(2) Scope clarifications may take the form of an interpretive footnote to the scope when the scope is published or issued in instructions to U.S. Customs and Border Protection, or in a memorandum issued in an ongoing segment of a proceeding. At the discretion of the Secretary, a scope clarification may also take the form of preliminary and final notices of scope clarification published in the
Federal Register.
If the Secretary decides to publish preliminary and final notifications of scope clarification, it must provide interested parties at least 30 days after the publication of the preliminary notification of scope clarification to file
comments with the Secretary. The Secretary will address those comments in the final notification of scope clarification published in the
Federal Register
.
[86 FR 52374, Sept. 20, 2021, as amended at 88 FR 67077, Sept. 29, 2023; 89 FR 20833, Mar. 25, 2024]
§ 351.226
Circumvention inquiries.
(a)
Introduction.
Section 781 of the Act addresses the circumvention of antidumping and countervailing duty orders. This provision recognizes that circumvention seriously undermines the effectiveness of the remedies provided by the antidumping and countervailing duty proceedings and frustrates the purposes for which these laws were enacted. Section 781 of the Act allows the Secretary to apply antidumping and countervailing duty orders in such a way as to prevent circumvention by including within the scope of the order four distinct categories of merchandise. The Secretary will initiate and conduct a circumvention inquiry at the request of an interested party or on the Secretary's initiative, and issue a circumvention determination as provided for under section 781 of the Act and the rules and procedures in this section. Unless otherwise specified, the procedures as described in subpart C of this part (§§ 351.301 through 351.308 and 351.312 through 351.313) apply to this section.
(b)
Self-initiation of a circumvention inquiry.
If the Secretary determines from available information that an inquiry is warranted into the question of whether the elements necessary for a circumvention determination under section 781 of the Act exist, the Secretary may initiate a circumvention inquiry by publishing a notice of initiation in the
Federal Register
.
(c)
Circumvention inquiry request
—(1)
In general.
An interested party may submit a request for a circumvention inquiry that alleges that the elements necessary for a circumvention determination under section 781 of the Act exist and that is accompanied by information reasonably available to the interested party supporting these allegations. The circumvention inquiry request must be served in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (n) of this section.
(2)
Contents of request.
To the extent reasonably available to the requestor, a circumvention inquiry request must include the following requested information under paragraph (c)(1) of this section and relevant supporting documentation:
(i) A detailed description of the merchandise allegedly circumventing the antidumping or countervailing duty order, including:
(A) The physical characteristics (including chemical, dimensional or technical characteristics) of the product;
(B) The country(ies) where the product is produced, the country from where it is exported, and the declared country of origin;
(C) The product's tariff classification under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States and copies of any Customs rulings relevant to the tariff classification;
(D) The uses of the product;
(E) Clear and legible photographs, schematic drawings, specifications, standards, marketing materials, and any other exemplars providing a visual depiction of the product; and
(F) A description of parts, materials, and the production process employed in the production of the product.
(ii) A concise public summary of the product's description under paragraphs (c)(2)(i)(A) through (C) of this section.
(iii) The name and address of the producer, exporter, and importer of the product. If the full universe of parties allegedly circumventing the order(s) is unknown, then examples are sufficient.
(iv) A statement of the requestor's position as to the nature of the alleged circumvention under section 781 of the Act, such as a description of the procedures, channels of trade, and foreign countries involved (including a description of the processes occurring in each country), as appropriate.
(v) A statement of the requestor's position as to whether the circumvention inquiry, if initiated, should be conducted on a country-wide basis.
(vi) Factual information supporting this position, including import and export data relevant to the merchandise allegedly circumventing the antidumping or countervailing duty order.
(3)
Comments and information on the adequacy of the request.
Within 10 days after the filing of a circumvention inquiry request under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, an interested party other than the requestor is permitted one opportunity to submit comments and new factual information regarding the adequacy of the circumvention inquiry request. Within five days after the filing of new factual information in support of adequacy comments, the requestor is permitted one opportunity to submit comments and factual information to rebut, clarify, or correct that factual information.
(d)
Initiation of a circumvention inquiry and other actions based on a request
—(1)
Initiation of a circumvention inquiry.
Except as provided under paragraphs (d)(1)(ii) and (d)(2) of this section, within 30 days after the filing of a request for a circumvention inquiry, the Secretary will determine whether to accept or reject the request and whether to initiate or not initiate a circumvention inquiry. If it is not practicable to make such determinations within 30 days, the Secretary may extend the 30-day deadline by an additional 15 days if no interested party has filed new factual information in response to the circumvention request pursuant to paragraph (c)(3) of this section. If interested parties have filed new factual information pursuant to paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the Secretary may extend the 30-day deadline by an additional 30 days.
(i) If the Secretary determines that the request is incomplete or otherwise unacceptable, the Secretary may reject the request, and will provide a written explanation of the reasons for the rejection. If the request is rejected, the requestor may resubmit the full request at any time, with all identified deficiencies corrected.
(ii) If the Secretary issues questions to the requestor seeking clarification with respect to one or more aspects of a circumvention inquiry request, the Secretary will determine whether or not to initiate within 30 days after the requestor files a timely response to the Secretary's questions.
(iii) If the Secretary determines that a request for a circumvention inquiry satisfies the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section, the Secretary will accept the request and initiate a circumvention inquiry. The Secretary will publish a notice of initiation in the
Federal Register
.
(2)
Other actions based on a request for a circumvention inquiry.
Where applicable, the Secretary may take one of the following actions within the applicable timeline under paragraph (d)(1) of this section:
(i) If the Secretary determines upon review of a request for a circumvention inquiry that a scope ruling is warranted before the Secretary can conduct a circumvention analysis, the Secretary may either initiate the circumvention inquiry under paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section and address the scope issue in the circumvention inquiry (
see
§ 351.225(i)(1)), or defer initiation of the circumvention inquiry pending the completion of any ongoing or new segment of the proceeding addressing the scope issue. When initiation is deferred pending another segment of the proceeding, if the result of that other segment is that the product at issue is not covered by the scope of the antidumping and/or countervailing duty order(s) at issue, the Secretary may immediately initiate the circumvention inquiry upon the issuance of the final decision in that other segment; or
(ii) If the Secretary determines upon review of the request for a circumvention inquiry that the circumvention issue should be addressed in an ongoing segment of the proceeding, such as a covered merchandise inquiry under § 351.227, rather than initiating a circumvention inquiry, the Secretary will notify the requestor of its intent to address the circumvention issue in such other segment.
(e)
Deadlines for circumvention determinations
—(1)
Preliminary determination.
The Secretary will issue a preliminary determination under paragraph (g)(1) of this section no later than 150 days after the date of publication of the notice of initiation of paragraph (b) or (d) of this section. If the Secretary concludes that an extension of the preliminary determination is warranted, the Secretary may extend that deadline by no more than 90 additional days.
(2)
Final determination.
In accordance with section 781(f) of the Act, the Secretary shall, to the maximum extent practicable, issue a final determination under paragraph (g)(2) of this section no later than 300 days from the date of publication of the notice of initiation of a circumvention inquiry under paragraph (b) or (d) of this section. If the Secretary concludes that the inquiry is extraordinarily complicated and additional time is necessary to issue a final circumvention determination, then the Secretary may extend the 300-day deadline by no more than 65 days.
(3)
Alignment with other segments.
If the Secretary determines it is appropriate to do so, the Secretary may align the deadlines under this paragraph with the deadlines of another segment of the proceeding.
(f)
Circumvention inquiry procedures.
The filing and timing instructions of § 351.301(c) do not apply to this paragraph (f), and factual information submitted inconsistent with the terms of this paragraph may be rejected as unsolicited and untimely. (1) Within 30 days after the Secretary's self-initiation of a circumvention inquiry under paragraph (b) of this section, interested parties are permitted one opportunity to submit comments and factual information addressing the self-initiation. Within 14 days after the filing of such comments, any interested party is permitted one opportunity to submit comments and factual information submitted by the other interested parties.
(2) Within 30 days after the initiation of a circumvention inquiry under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, an interested party other than the applicant is permitted one opportunity to submit comments and factual information to rebut, clarify, or correct factual information contained in the scope ruling application. Within 14 days after the filing of such rebuttal, clarification, or correction, the applicant is permitted one opportunity to submit comments and factual information to rebut, clarify, or correct factual information submitted in the interested party's rebuttal, clarification, or correction.
(3) Following initiation of a circumvention inquiry under paragraph (b) or (d) of this section, the Secretary may issue questionnaires and verify submissions received, where appropriate. The Secretary may limit issuance of questionnaires to a reasonable number of respondents. Questionnaire responses are due on the date specified by the Secretary. Within 14 days after a questionnaire response has been filed with the Secretary, an interested party other than the original submitter is permitted one opportunity to submit comments and factual information to rebut, clarify, or correct factual information contained in the questionnaire response. Within 7 days of the filing of such rebuttal, clarification, or correction, the original submitter is permitted one opportunity to submit comments and factual information to rebut, clarify, or correct factual information contained in the interested party's rebuttal, clarification or correction.
(4) If the Secretary issues a preliminary circumvention determination under paragraph (g)(1) of this section, which is not issued concurrently with the initiation of the circumvention inquiry, the Secretary will establish a schedule for the filing of comments and rebuttal comments. Unless otherwise specified, any interested party may submit comments within 14 days after the issuance of the preliminary circumvention determination, and any interested party may submit rebuttal comments within 7 days thereafter. Unless otherwise specified, no new factual information will be accepted in the comments or rebuttal comments.
(5) If the Secretary issues a preliminary circumvention determination concurrently with the initiation of the circumvention inquiry under paragraph (g)(1) of this section, paragraphs (f)(1) through (4) will not apply. In such a situation, the Secretary will establish appropriate procedures on a case-specific basis.
(6) If the Secretary determines it is appropriate to do so, the Secretary may rescind, in whole or in part, a circumvention inquiry, under this section and will notify interested parties. Situations in which the Secretary may rescind a circumvention inquiry include:
(i) The requestor timely withdraws its request for a circumvention inquiry under paragraph (c) of this section;
(ii) The Secretary issues a final determination in another segment of a proceeding, and has determined that the merchandise at issue in the circumvention inquiry is covered by the scope of the antidumping or countervailing duty order;
(iii) The Secretary has initiated a circumvention inquiry under paragraph (b) or (d) of this section to examine circumvention under two or more provisions under paragraph (h), (i), (j), or (k) of this section, and determines that it is not necessary to issue a final circumvention determination with respect to one of those paragraphs. For example, if the Secretary initiates a circumvention inquiry to examine whether merchandise is altered in minor respects under paragraph (j) of this section or later-developed merchandise under paragraph (k) of this section, the Secretary may rescind the inquiry in part to address only one of those provisions; or
(iv) The Secretary has initiated a covered merchandise inquiry under § 351.227 and determined that it can address the necessary elements for a circumvention determination under section 781 of the Act in that proceeding.
(7) If the Secretary determines it is appropriate to do so, the Secretary may alter or extend any time limits under this paragraph or establish a separate schedule for the filing of comments and/or factual information during the circumvention inquiry.
(8)(i) The Secretary will notify the Commission in writing of the proposed inclusion of products in an order prior to issuing a final determination under paragraph (g)(2) of this section based on a determination under:
(A) Section 781(a) of the Act (paragraph (h) of this section) with respect to merchandise completed or assembled in the United States (other than minor completion or assembly);
(B) Section 781(b) of the Act (paragraph (i) of this section) with respect to merchandise completed or assembled in other foreign countries; or
(C) Section 781(d) of the Act (paragraph (k) of this section) with respect to later-developed products that incorporate a significant technological advance or significant alteration of an earlier product.
(ii) If the Secretary notifies the Commission under paragraph (f)(8)(i) of this section, upon the written request of the Commission, the Secretary will consult with the Commission regarding the proposed inclusion, and any such consultation will be completed within 15 days after the date of such request. If, after consultation, the Commission believes that a significant injury issue is presented by the proposed inclusion of a product within an order, the Commission may provide written advice to the Secretary as to whether the inclusion would be inconsistent with the affirmative injury determination of the Commission on which the order is based.
(9) During the pendency of a circumvention inquiry or upon issuance of a final circumvention determination under paragraph (g)(2) of this section, the Secretary may take any further action, as appropriate, with respect to another segment of the proceeding. For example, if the Secretary considers it appropriate, the Secretary may request information concerning the product that is the subject of the circumvention inquiry for purposes of an administrative review under § 351.213.
(g)
Circumvention determinations
—(1)
Preliminary determination.
The Secretary will issue a preliminary determination, based upon the available information at the time, as to whether there is a reasonable basis to believe or suspect that the elements necessary for a circumvention determination under section 781 of the Act exist. The preliminary determination will be published in the
Federal Register.
The Secretary may publish notice of a preliminary determination concurrently with the notice of initiation of a circumvention inquiry under paragraph (b) or (d) of this section.
(2)
Final determination.
The Secretary will issue a final determination as to whether the elements necessary for a circumvention determination under section 781 of the Act exist, in which case the merchandise at issue will be included within the scope of the order. As part of its determination, the Secretary will include an explanation of the factual and legal conclusions on which the final determination is based.

Introduction.
The Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015 contains Title IV—Prevention of Evasion of Antidumping and Countervailing Duty Orders (short title “Enforce and Protect Act of 2015” or “EAPA”) (Pub. L. 114-125, sections 401, 421, 130 Stat. 122, 155, 161 (2016)). The Enforce and Protect Act of 2015 added section 517 to the Act, which established a new framework by which U.S. Customs and Border Protection can
conduct civil administrative investigations of potential duty evasion of an antidumping and/or countervailing duty order (referred to herein as an “EAPA investigation”). Section 517(b)(4)(A)(i) of the Act provides a procedure whereby if, during the course of an EAPA investigation, U.S. Customs and Border Protection is unable to determine whether the merchandise at issue is covered merchandise within the meaning of section 517(a)(3) of the Act, it shall refer the matter to the Secretary to make such a determination (referred to herein as a “covered merchandise referral”). Section 517(b)(4)(B) of the Act directs the Secretary to determine whether the merchandise is covered merchandise and promptly transmit the determination to U.S. Customs and Border Protection. The Secretary will consider a covered merchandise referral and issue a covered merchandise determination in accordance with the rules and procedures in this section. Unless otherwise specified, the procedures as described in subpart C of this part (§§ 351.301 through 351.308 and 351.312 through 351.313) apply to this section.

(i) Initiate a covered merchandise inquiry; or
(ii) If the Secretary determines upon review of the covered merchandise referral that the issue can be addressed in an ongoing segment of the proceeding, such as a scope inquiry under § 351.225 or a circumvention inquiry under § 351.226, rather than initiating the covered merchandise inquiry, the Secretary will address the covered merchandise referral in such other segment.
(2) The Secretary will publish a notice of its action taken with respect to a covered merchandise referral under paragraph (b)(1) of this section in the
Federal Register
.
(c)
Deadlines for covered merchandise determinations

(ii) The Secretary has issued a preliminary covered merchandise determination (
see
paragraph (e)(1) of this section); or
(iii) The Secretary has determined to address a scope or circumvention issue from another segment of the proceeding involving the same or similar products in the covered merchandise inquiry, pursuant to § 351.225(d)(2) or (i) or § 351.226(f)(6)(iv).

# Subpart C—Information and Argument
§ 351.301
Time limits for submission of factual information.
(a)
Introduction.
This section sets forth the time limits for submitting factual information, as defined by § 351.102(b)(21). The Department obtains most of its factual information in antidumping and countervailing duty proceedings from submissions made by interested parties during the course of the proceeding. Notwithstanding paragraph (b) of this section, the Secretary may request any person to submit factual information at any time during a proceeding or provide additional opportunities to submit factual information. Section 351.302 sets forth the procedures for requesting an extension of such time limits, and provides that, unless expressly precluded by statute, the Secretary may, for good cause, extend any time limit established in the Department's regulations. Section 351.303 contains the procedural rules regarding filing (including procedures for filing on non-business days), format, translation, service, and certification of documents. In the Secretary's written request to an interested party for a response to a questionnaire or for other factual information, the Secretary will specify the following: The time limit for the response; the information to be provided; the form and manner in which the interested party must submit the information; and that failure to submit the requested information in the requested form and manner by the date specified may result in use of the facts available under section 776 of the Act and § 351.308.
(b)
Submission of factual information.
Every submission of factual information must be accompanied by a written explanation identifying the subsection of § 351.102(b)(21) under which the information is being submitted.
(1) If an interested party states that the information is submitted under § 351.102(b)(21)(v), the party must explain why the information does not satisfy the definitions described in § 351.102(b)(21)(i)-(iv).
(2) If the factual information is being submitted to rebut, clarify, or correct factual information on the record, the
submitter must provide a written explanation identifying the information which is already on the record that the factual information seeks to rebut, clarify or correct, including the name of the interested party that submitted the information and the date on which the information was submitted. The submitter must also provide a written explanation describing how the factual information provided under this paragraph rebuts, clarifies, or corrects the factual information already on the record.
(c)
Time limits.
The type of factual information determines the time limit for submission to the Department.
(1)
Factual information submitted in response to questionnaires.
During a proceeding, the Secretary may issue to any person questionnaires, which includes both initial and supplemental questionnaires. The Secretary will not consider or retain in the official record of the proceeding unsolicited questionnaire responses, except as provided under § 351.109(h)(2), or untimely filed questionnaire responses. The Secretary will reject any untimely filed or unsolicited questionnaire response and provide, to the extent practicable, written notice stating the reasons for rejection (see § 351.302(d)).
(i) Initial questionnaire responses are due 30 days from the date of receipt of suchquestionnaire. The time limit for response to individual sections of the questionnaire, if the Secretary requests a separate response to such sections, may be less than the 30 days allotted for response to the full questionnaire. In general, the date of receipt will be considered to be seven days from the date on which the initial questionnaire was transmitted.
(ii) Supplemental questionnaire responses are due on the date specified by the Secretary.
(iii) A notification by an interested party, under section 782(c)(1) of the Act, of difficulties in submitting information in response to a questionnaire issued by the Secretary is to be submitted in writing within 14 days after the date of the questionnaire or, if the questionnaire is due in 14 days or less, within the time specified by the Secretary.
(iv) A respondent interested party may request in writing that the Secretary conduct a questionnaire presentation. The Secretary may conduct a questionnaire presentation if the Secretary notifies the government of the affected country and that government does not object.
(v) Factual information submitted to rebut, clarify, or correct questionnaire responses. Within 14 days after an initial questionnaire response and within 10 days after a supplemental questionnaire response has been filed with the Department, an interested party other than the original submitter is permitted one opportunity to submit factual information to rebut, clarify, or correct factual information contained in the questionnaire response. Within seven days of the filing of such rebuttal, clarification, or correction to a questionnaire response, the original submitter of the questionnaire response is permitted one opportunity to submit factual information to rebut, clarify, or correct factual information submitted in the interested party's rebuttal, clarification or correction. The Secretary will reject any untimely filed rebuttal, clarification, or correction submission and provide, to the extent practicable, written notice stating the reasons for rejection (see § 351.302). If insufficient time remains before the due date for the final determination or final results of review, the Secretary may specify shorter deadlines under this section.
(2)

Introduction.
This section contains the procedural rules regarding filing, document identification, format, service, translation, and certification of documents and applies to all persons submitting documents to the Department for consideration in an antidumping or countervailing duty proceeding.

Filing
—(1)
In general.
Persons must address all documents to the Secretary of Commerce, Attention: Enforcement and Compliance, APO/Dockets Unit, Room 18022, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20230. An electronically filed document must be received successfully in its entirety by the Department's electronic records system, ACCESS, by 5 p.m. Eastern Time on the due date. Where applicable, a submitter must manually file a document between the hours of 8:30 a.m. and 5 p.m. Eastern Time on business days (see § 351.103(b)). For both electronically filed and manually filed documents, if the applicable due date falls on a non-business day, the Secretary will accept documents that are filed on the next business day. A manually filed document must be accompanied by a cover sheet generated in ACCESS, in accordance with § 351.303(b)(3).
(2)
Filing of documents and databases
—(i)
Electronic filing.
A person must file all documents and databases electronically using ACCESS at
https://access.trade.gov.
A person making a filing must comply with the procedures set forth in the ACCESS Handbook on Electronic Filing Procedures, which is available on the ACCESS Web site at

A person may manually file a bulky document. If a person elects to manually file a bulky document, it must be accompanied by a cover sheet described in § 351.303(b)(3). The Department both provides specifications for large data files and defines bulky document standards in the ACCESS Handbook on Electronic Filing Procedures, which is available on the ACCESS Web site at

(3)
Cover sheet.
When manually filing a document, parties must complete the cover sheet (as described in the ACCESS Handbook on Electronic Filing Procedures) online at
https://access.trade.gov
and print the cover sheet for submission to the APO/Dockets Unit.
(4)
Document identification.
Each document must be clearly identified as one of the following five document classifications and must conform with the requirements under paragraph (d)(2) of this section. Business proprietary document or business proprietary/APO version, as applicable, means a document or a version of a document containing information for which a person claims business proprietary treatment under § 351.304.
(i) Business Proprietary Document—May be Released Under APO. This business proprietary document contains single-bracketed business proprietary information that the submitter agrees to release under APO. It must contain the statement “May be Released Under APO” in accordance with the requirements under paragraph (d)(2)(v) of this section.
(ii) Business Proprietary Document—May Not be Released Under APO. This
business proprietary document contains double-bracketed business proprietary information that the submitter does not agree to release under APO. This document must contain the statement “May Not be Released Under APO” in accordance with the requirements under paragraph (d)(2)(v) of this section. This type of document may contain single-bracketed business proprietary information in addition to double-bracketed business proprietary information.
(iii) Business Proprietary/APO Version—May be Released Under APO. In the event that a business proprietary document contains both single- and double-bracketed business proprietary information, the submitting person must submit a version of the document with the double-bracketed business proprietary information omitted. This version must contain the single-bracketed business proprietary information that the submitter agrees to release under APO. This version must be identified as “Business Proprietary/APO Version” and must contain the statement “May be Released Under APO” in accordance with the requirements under paragraph (d)(2)(v) of this section.
(iv)
Public version.
The public version excludes all business proprietary information, whether single- or double-bracketed. Specific filing requirements for public version submissions are discussed in § 351.304(c).
(v)
Public document.
The public document contains only public information. There is no corresponding business proprietary document for a public document.
(c) Filing of business proprietary documents and public versions under the one-day lag rule; information in double brackets.
(1)
In general.
If a submission contains information for which the submitter claims business proprietary treatment, the submitter may elect to file the submission under the one-day lag rule described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. A petition, an amendment to a petition, and any other submission filed prior to the initiation of an investigation shall not be filed under the one-day lag rule. The business proprietary document and public version of such pre-initiation submissions must be filed simultaneously on the same day.
(2)
Application of the one-day lag rule
—(i)
Filing the business proprietary document.
A person must file a business proprietary document with the Department within the applicable time limit.
(ii)
Filing of final business proprietary document; bracketing corrections.
By the close of business one business day after the date the business proprietary document is filed under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, a person must file the complete final business proprietary document with the Department. The final business proprietary document must be identical in all respects to the business proprietary document filed on the previous day except for any bracketing corrections and the omission of the warning “Bracketing of Business Proprietary Information Is Not Final for One Business Day After Date of Filing” in accordance with paragraph (d)(2)(v) of this section.
(iii)
Filing the public version.
Simultaneously with the filing of the final business proprietary document under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, a person also must file the public version of such document (see § 351.304(c)) with the Department.
(iv)
Information in double brackets.
If a person serves authorized applicants with a business proprietary/APO version of a document that excludes information in double brackets pursuant to §§ 351.303(b)(4)(iii) and 351.304(b)(2), the person simultaneously must file with the Department the complete business proprietary/APO version of the document from which information in double brackets has been excluded.
(3)
Sales files, cost of production files and other electronic databases.
When a submission includes sales files, cost of production files or other electronic databases, such electronic databases must be filed electronically in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section. If a submitter must file the database manually pursuant to § 351.303(b)(2)(ii)(A), the submitter must file such information on the computer medium specified by the Department's request for such information. The submitter need not accompany the computer medium with a paper printout.
All electronic database information must be releasable under APO (see § 351.305). A submitter need not include brackets in an electronic database containing business proprietary information. The submitter's selection of the security classification “Business Proprietary Document—May Be Released Under APO” at the time of filing indicates the submitter's request for business proprietary treatment of the information contained in the database. Where possible, the submitter must insert headers or footers requesting business proprietary treatment of the information on the databases for printing purposes. A submitter must submit a public version of a database in pdf format. The public version of the database must be publicly summarized and ranged in accordance with § 351.304(c).
(d)
Format of submissions
—(1)
In general.
Unless the Secretary alters the requirements of this section, a document filed with the Department must conform to the specification and marking requirements under paragraph (d)(2) of this section or the Secretary may reject such document in accordance with § 351.104(a).
(2)
Specifications and markings.
If a document is filed manually, it must be on letter-size (8
1/2
× 11 inch) paper, single-sided and double-spaced, bound with a paper clip, butterfly/binder clip, or rubber band. The filing of stapled, spiral, velo, or other type of solid binding is not permitted. In accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this section, a cover sheet must be placed before the first page of the document. Electronically filed documents must be formatted to print on letter-size (8
1/2
× 11 inch) paper and double-spaced. Spreadsheets, unusually sized exhibits, and databases are best utilized in their original printing format and should not be reformatted for submission. A submitter must mark the first page of each document in the upper right-hand corner with the following information in the following format:
(i) On the first line, except for a petition, indicate the Department case number;
(ii) On the second line, indicate the total number of pages in the document including cover pages, appendices, and any unnumbered pages;
(iii) On the third line, indicate the specific segment of the proceeding, (
e.g.,
investigation, administrative review, scope inquiry, suspension agreement,
etc.
) and, if applicable, indicate the complete period of review (MM/DD/YY-MM/DD/YY);
(iv) On the fourth line, except for a petition, indicate the Department office conducting the proceeding;
(v) On the fifth and subsequent lines, indicate whether any portion of the document contains business proprietary information and, if so, list the applicable page numbers and state either: “Business Proprietary Document—May Be Released Under APO,” “Business Proprietary Document—May Not Be Released Under APO,” or “Business Proprietary/APO Version—May Be Released Under APO,” as applicable, and consistent with § 351.303(b)(4). Indicate “Business Proprietary Treatment Requested” on the top of each page containing business proprietary information. In addition, include the warning “Bracketing of Business Proprietary Information Is Not Final for One Business Day After Date of Filing” on the top of each page containing business proprietary information in the business proprietary document filed under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section (one-day lag rule). Do not include this warning in the final business proprietary document filed on the next business day under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section (see § 351.303(c)(2) and § 351.304(c)); and
(vi) For the public version of a business proprietary document required under § 351.304(c), complete the marking as required in paragraphs (d)(2)(i)-(v) of this section for the business proprietary document, but conspicuously mark the first page “Public Version.”
(vii) For a public document, complete the marking as required in paragraphs (d)(2)(i)-(v) of this section for the business proprietary document or version, as applicable, but conspicuously mark the first page “Public Document.”
(e)
Translation to English.
A document submitted in a foreign language must be accompanied by an English translation of the entire document or of only pertinent portions, where appropriate, unless the Secretary waives this
requirement for an individual document. A party must obtain the Department's approval for submission of an English translation of only portions of a document prior to submission to the Department.
(f)
Service of copies on other persons
—(1)
In general.
Generally, a person filing a document with the Department simultaneously must serve a copy of the document on all other persons on the service list. Except as provided in § 351.202(c) (filing of petition), § 351.208(f)(1) (submission of proposed suspension agreement) and paragraph (f)(2) of this section:
(i) Service of a public document or public version of a business proprietary document is effectuated on the persons on the public service list upon the electronic filing of the submission in ACCESS, unless it is filed manually in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section, or ACCESS is unavailable. If a submission is filed manually or ACCESS is unavailable, paragraph (f)(1)(iii) of this section is applicable.
(ii)(A) Service of a business proprietary document is effectuated on the persons on the APO service list upon the electronic filing of the submission in ACCESS, unless it is filed manually in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section, or ACCESS is unavailable. If a submission is filed manually or ACCESS is unavailable, paragraph (f)(1)(iii) of this section is applicable. In addition, a business proprietary document submitted under the one-day lag rule under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section must be served in accordance with paragraph (f)(1)(iii) of this section.
(B) If the document contains the business proprietary information of a person who is not included on the APO service list, then service of such documents on that person cannot be effectuated on ACCESS and the submitter must serve that person its own business proprietary information in accordance with paragraph (f)(1)(iii) of this section. In addition, specific service requirements under § 351.306(c)(2) are applicable.
(iii) If service of a public document, public version of a business proprietary document, or a business proprietary document cannot be effectuated on ACCESS, the submitter must serve the recipient by electronic transmission. Generally, a business proprietary document must be served by secure electronic transmission. If the submitter is not able to use such a method, it may use an acceptable alternative method of service, including personal service, first-class mail, or electronic mail. Electronic mail may only be used as an acceptable alternative method of service for a business proprietary document under paragraph (f)(1)(ii)(B) of this section if the business proprietary document contains the business proprietary information of either the submitter or the recipient, with the consent of the recipient.
(2)
Service requirements for certain documents
—(i)
Request for review.
In addition to the certificate of service requirements under paragraph (f)(3) of this section, an interested party that files with the Department a request for an expedited antidumping review, an administrative review, a new shipper review, or a changed circumstances review must serve a copy of the request on each exporter or producer specified in the request and on the petitioner by the end of the anniversary month or within ten days of filing the request for review, whichever is later. Service may be made by an electronic transmission method if the interested party that files the request has an electronic mail address for the recipient; otherwise, service must be made by personal service or first-class mail. If the interested party that files the request is unable to locate a particular exporter or producer, or the petitioner, the Secretary may accept the request for review if the Secretary is satisfied that the party made a reasonable attempt to serve a copy of the request on such person.
(ii)
Scope and circumvention.
In addition to the certificate of service requirements under paragraph (f)(3) of this section, an interested party that files with the Department a scope ruling application or a request for a circumvention inquiry must serve a copy of the request on all persons included in the annual inquiry service list in accordance with §§ 351.225(n) and 351.226(n), respectively.
(3)
Certificate of service.
Each document filed with the Department must include a certificate of service listing each person served (including agents), the type of document served, and the date and method of service on each person. The Secretary may refuse to accept any document that is not accompanied by a certificate of service.
(4) Notwithstanding any other paragraph in this section, until further notice, as of March 24, 2020, we are modifying the service requirements with respect to documents containing business proprietary information as follows:
(i) For BPI documents submitted with final bracketing on the due date (
i.e.,
documents not submitted under the one-day lag rule, paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section), E
C will deem service to be effectuated upon filing of the submission in ACCESS. E
C will notify interested parties that the document has been filed through daily ACCESS BPI Release Digest emails. This paragraph (f)(4)(i) does not apply to service to pro se parties or parties represented by a non-APO-authorized representative.
(ii) For BPI documents submitted under the one-day lag rule, paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, E
C is temporarily waiving the service requirement for bracketing-not-final BPI submissions filed on the due date. In addition, E
C will deem service to be effectuated upon the filing in ACCESS of the complete final BPI document on the next business day under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section. This paragraph (f)(4)(ii) does not apply to service to pro se parties or parties represented by a non-APO-authorized representative.
(iii) For case and rebuttal briefs served pursuant to paragraph (f)(3)(i) of this section, service of BPI case and rebuttal briefs will be deemed effectuated via ACCESS. This paragraph (f)(4)(iii) does not apply to service to pro se parties or parties represented by a non-APO-authorized representative.
(iv) Parties must still take active steps to serve pro se parties BPI documents containing only the pro se party's BPI and serve parties represented by a non-APO-authorized representative documents containing only that party's BPI, consistent with § 351.306(c)(2). However, E
C is temporarily modifying the electronic service provision under paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this section, so that a pro se party may give consent to another interested party to serve a document electronically on that pro se party only, provided that the document only contains the pro se party's BPI. Such a document must not contain the BPI of other parties. In addition, a party represented by a non-APO-authorized representative may give consent to another interested party to serve a document electronically on that non-APO-authorized representative only, provided that the document only contains the BPI of the party represented by that non-APO-authorized representative. Such a document must not contain the BPI of other parties. If such consent is given, then the serving party's APO-authorized representative may serve the submission on that party via electronic transmission with that recipient's consent.
(v)
Exceptions.
Notwithstanding paragraphs (f)(4)(i) through (iv) of this section, the following types of submissions and scenarios require the normal means of service as required by this paragraph (f):
(A) Requests for administrative review, new shipper review, changed circumstances review and expedited review.
(B) Requests for scope ruling or anti-circumvention inquiry.
(g)
Certifications.
Each submission containing factual information must include the following certification from the person identified in paragraph (g)(1) of this section and, in addition, if the person has legal counsel or another representative, the certification in paragraph (g)(2) of this section. The certifying party must maintain the original signed certification for a period of five years from the date of filing the submission to which the certification pertains. The original signed certification must be available for inspection by U.S. Department of Commerce officials. Copies of the certifications must be included in the submission filed at the Department.

# Effective Date Note:
At 85 FR 17007, Mar. 26, 2020, § 351.303 was amended by adding paragraph (f)(4), effective Mar. 24, 2020 through May 19, 2020. At 85 FR 29615, May 18, 2020, this amendment was extended to July 17, 2020. At 85 FR 41363, July 10, 2020, this amendment was extended indefinitely.
§ 351.304
Establishing business proprietary treatment of information.
(a)
Claim for business proprietary treatment.
(1) Any person that submits factual information to the Secretary in connection with a proceeding may:
(i) Request that the Secretary treat any part of the submission as business proprietary information that is subject to disclosure only under an administrative protective order,
(ii) Claim that there is a clear and compelling need to withhold certain business proprietary information from disclosure under an administrative protective order, or
(iii) In an investigation, identify customer names that are exempt from disclosure under administrative protective order under section 777(c)(1)(A) of the Act.
(2) The Secretary will require that all business proprietary information presented to, or obtained or generated by, the Secretary during a segment of a proceeding be disclosed to authorized applicants, except for
(i) Customer names submitted in an investigation,
(ii) Information for which the Secretary finds that there is a clear and compelling need to withhold from disclosure, and
(iii) Privileged or classified information.
(b)
Identification of business proprietary information
—(1)
Information releasable under administrative protective order
—(i)
In general.
A person submitting information must identify the information for which it claims business proprietary treatment by enclosing the information within single brackets. The submitting person must provide with the information an explanation of why each item of bracketed information is entitled to business proprietary treatment. A person submitting a request for business proprietary treatment also must include an agreement to permit disclosure under an administrative protective order, unless the submitting party claims that there is a clear and compelling need to withhold the information from disclosure under an administrative protective order.
(ii)
Electronic databases.
In accordance with § 351.303(c)(3), an electronic database need not contain brackets. The submitter must select the security classification “Business Proprietary Document—May Be Released Under APO” at the time of filing to request
business proprietary treatment of the information contained in the database. The public version of the database must be publicly summarized and ranged in accordance with § 351.304(c).
(2)
Information claimed to be exempt from disclosure under administrative protective order.
(i) If the submitting person claims that there is a clear and compelling need to withhold certain information from disclosure under an administrative protective order (see paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section), the submitting person must identify the information by enclosing the information within double brackets, and must include a full explanation of the reasons for the claim.
(ii) In an investigation, the submitting person may enclose business proprietary customer names within double brackets (see paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section).
(iii) The submitting person may exclude the information in double brackets from the business proprietary/APO version of the submission served on authorized applicants. See § 351.303 for filing and service requirements.
(c)
Public version.
(1) A person filing a submission that contains information for which business proprietary treatment is claimed must also file a public version of the submission. The public version must be filed on the filing deadline for the business proprietary document. If the business proprietary document was filed under the one-day lag rule (
see
§ 351.303(c)(2)), the public version and the final business proprietary document must be filed on the first business day after the filing deadline. The public version must contain a summary of the bracketed information in sufficient detail to permit a reasonable understanding of the substance of the information. If the submitting person claims that summarization is not possible, the claim must be accompanied by a full explanation of the reasons supporting that claim. Generally, numerical data will be considered adequately summarized if grouped or presented in terms of indices or figures within 10 percent of the actual figure. If an individual portion of the numerical data is voluminous, at least one percent representative of that portion must be summarized. A submitter should not create a public summary of business proprietary information of another person.
(2) If a submitting party discovers that it has failed to bracket information correctly, the submitter may file a complete, corrected business proprietary document along with the public version (
see
§ 351.303(c)(2)(ii) through (iii)). At the close of business on the day on which the public version of a submission is due under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, however, the bracketing of business proprietary information in the original business proprietary document or, if a corrected version is timely filed, the corrected business proprietary document will become final. Once bracketing has become final, the Secretary will not accept any further corrections to the bracketing of information in a submission, and the Secretary will treat non-bracketed information as public information.
(d)
Nonconforming submissions
—(1)
In general.
The Secretary will reject a submission that does not meet the requirements of section 777(b) of the Act and this section with a written explanation. The submitting person may take any of the following actions within two business days after receiving the Secretary's explanation:
(i) Correct the problems and resubmit the information;
(ii) If the Secretary denied a request for business proprietary treatment, agree to have the information in question treated as public information;
(iii) If the Secretary granted business proprietary treatment but denied a claim that there was a clear and compelling need to withhold information under an administrative protective order, agree to the disclosure of the information in question under an administrative protective order; or
(iv) Submit other material concerning the subject matter of the rejected information. If the submitting person does not take any of these actions, the Secretary will not consider the rejected submission.
(2)
Timing.
The Secretary normally will determine the status of information within 30 days after the day on which the information was submitted.
If the business proprietary status of information is in dispute, the Secretary will treat the relevant portion of the submission as business proprietary information until the Secretary decides the matter.
[63 FR 24401, May 4, 1998, as amended at 76 FR 39277, July 6, 2011; 88 FR 67079, Sept. 29, 2023]
§ 351.305
Access to business proprietary information.
(a)
The administrative protective order.
The Secretary will place an administrative protective order on the record as follows: within two business days after the day on which a petition is filed or an investigation is self-initiated; within five business days after the day on which a request for a new shipper review is properly filed in accordance with §§ 351.214 and 351.303, an application for a scope ruling is properly filed in accordance with §§ 351.225 and 351.303, or a request for a circumvention inquiry is properly filed in accordance with §§ 351.226 and 351.303; within five business days after the day on which a request for a changed circumstances review is properly filed in accordance with §§ 351.216 and 351.303 or a changed circumstances review is self-initiated; or within five business days after initiating any other segment of a proceeding. The administrative protective order will require the authorized applicant to:
(1) Establish and follow procedures to ensure that no employee of the authorized applicant's firm releases business proprietary information to any person other than the submitting party, an authorized applicant, or an appropriate Department official identified in section 777(b) of the Act;
(2) Notify the Secretary of any changes in the facts asserted by the authorized applicant in its administrative protective order application;
(3) Destroy business proprietary information by the time required under the terms of the administrative protective order;
(4) Immediately report to the Secretary any apparent violation of the administrative protective order; and
(5) Acknowledge that any unauthorized disclosure may subject the authorized applicant, the firm of which the authorized applicant is a partner, associate, or employee, and any partner, associate, or employee of the authorized applicant's firm to sanctions listed in part 354 of this chapter (19 CFR part 354).
(b)
Application for access under administrative protective order.
(1) Generally, no more than two independent representatives of a party to the proceeding may have access to business proprietary information under an administrative protective order. A party must designate a lead firm if the party has more than one independent authorized applicant firm.
(2) A representative of a party to the proceeding may apply for access to business proprietary information under the administrative protective order by submitting an electronic application available in ACCESS at
https://access.trade.gov
(Form ITA-367) to the Secretary. The electronic application will be filed and served in ACCESS upon submission. Form ITA-367 must identify the applicant and the segment of the proceeding involved, state the basis for eligibility of the applicant for access to business proprietary information, and state the agreement of the applicant to be bound by the administrative protective order. Form ITA-367 must be accompanied by a certification that the application is consistent with Form ITA-367 and an acknowledgment that any discrepancies will be interpreted in a manner consistent with Form ITA-367. An applicant must apply to receive all business proprietary information on the record of the segment of a proceeding in question but may waive service of business proprietary information it does not wish to receive from other parties to the proceeding.
(3) To minimize the disruption caused by late applications, an application should be filed before the first response to the initial questionnaire has been submitted. Where justified, however, applications may be filed up to the date on which the case briefs are due.
(c)
Approval of access under administrative protective order; administrative protective order service list; service of earlier-filed business proprietary submissions.
(1) The Secretary will grant access to a qualified applicant by including the
name of the applicant on an administrative protective order service list. Access normally will be granted within five days of receipt of the application unless there is a question regarding the eligibility of the applicant to receive access. In that case, the Secretary will decide whether to grant the applicant access within 30 days of receipt of the application. The Secretary will provide by the most expeditious means available the administrative protective order service list to parties to the proceeding on the day the service list is issued or amended.
(2) After the Secretary approves an application, the authorized applicant may request service of earlier-filed business proprietary submissions of the other parties that are no longer available in ACCESS.
(i) For an application that is approved before the first response to the initial questionnaire is submitted, the submitting party must serve the authorized applicant those submissions within two business days of the request. Service must be made in accordance with section 351.303(f)(1)(iii). A certificate of service is not required.
(ii) For an application that is approved after the first response to the initial questionnaire is submitted, the submitting party must serve the authorized applicant those submissions within five business days of the request. Service must be made in accordance with section 351.303(f)(1)(iii). A certificate of service is not required. Any authorized applicant who filed the application after the first response to the initial questionnaire is submitted will be liable for costs associated with the additional production and service of business proprietary information already on the record.
(d)
Additional filing requirements for importers.
If an applicant represents a party claiming to be an interested party by virtue of being an importer, then the applicant shall submit, along with the Form ITA-367, documentary evidence demonstrating that during the applicable period of investigation or period of review the interested party imported subject merchandise. For a scope segment of a proceeding pursuant to § 351.225 or a circumvention segment of a proceeding pursuant to § 351.226, the applicant must present documentary evidence that the interested party imported subject merchandise, or that it has taken steps towards importing the merchandise subject to the scope or circumvention inquiry. For a covered merchandise referral segment of a proceeding pursuant to § 351.227, an applicant representing an interested party that has been identified by U.S. Customs and Border Protection as the importer in a covered merchandise referral is exempt from the requirements of providing documentary evidence to demonstrate that it is an importer for purposes of that segment of a proceeding.
[63 FR 24402, May 4, 1998, as amended at 73 FR 3643, Jan. 22, 2008; 76 FR 39277, July 6, 2011; 86 FR 52384, Sept. 20, 2021; 88 FR 67080, Sept. 29, 2023]
§ 351.306
Use of business proprietary information.
(a)
By the Secretary.
The Secretary may disclose business proprietary information submitted to the Secretary only to:
(1) An authorized applicant;
(2) An employee of the Department of Commerce or the International Trade Commission directly involved in the proceeding in which the information is submitted;
(3) An employee of U.S. Customs and Border Protection directly involved in conducting an investigation regarding negligence, gross negligence, or fraud relating to an antidumping or countervailing duty proceeding;
(4) The U.S. Trade Representative as provided by 19 U.S.C. 3571(i);
(5) Any person to whom the submitting person specifically authorizes disclosure in writing; and
(6) A charged party or counsel for the charged party under 19 CFR part 354.
(b)
By an authorized applicant.
(1) An authorized applicant may retain business proprietary information for the time authorized by the terms of the administrative protective order (APO).
(2) An authorized applicant may use business proprietary information for purposes of the segment of the proceeding in which the information was submitted.
(3) If business proprietary information that was submitted to a segment
of the proceeding is relevant to an issue in a different segment of the same proceeding, an authorized applicant may place such information on the record of the subsequent segment as authorized by the APO of the segment where the business proprietary information was submitted.
(4) If business proprietary information that was submitted to a countervailing duty segment of the proceeding is relevant to a subsequent scope, circumvention, or covered merchandise inquiry conducted on the record of the companion antidumping duty segment of the proceeding pursuant to § 351.225(m)(2), § 351.226(m)(2), or § 351.227(m)(2), an authorized applicant may place such information on the record of the companion antidumping duty segment of the proceeding as authorized by the APO of the countervailing duty segment where the business proprietary information was submitted.
(5) If business proprietary information that was submitted to a scope, circumvention, or covered merchandise inquiry conducted on the record of a companion antidumping duty segment of the proceeding pursuant to § 351.225(m)(2), § 351.226(m)(2), or § 351.227(m)(2) is relevant to a subsequent countervailing duty segment of the proceeding, an authorized applicant may place such information on the record of the companion countervailing duty segment of the proceeding as authorized by the APO of the antidumping duty segment where the business proprietary information was submitted.
(c)
Identifying parties submitting business proprietary information.
(1) If a party submits a document containing business proprietary information of another person, the submitting party must identify, contiguously with each item of business proprietary information, the person that originally submitted the item (e.g., Petitioner, Respondent A, Respondent B). Business proprietary information not identified will be treated as information of the person making the submission. If the submission contains business proprietary information of only one person, it shall so state on the first page and identify the person that originally submitted the business proprietary information on the first page.
(2) If a party to a proceeding is not represented, or its representative is not an authorized applicant, the submitter of a document containing that party's business proprietary information must serve that party or its representative, if applicable, with a version of the document that contains only that party's business proprietary information consistent with § 351.303(f)(1)(iii). The document must not contain the business proprietary information of other parties.
(d)
Disclosure to parties not authorized to receive business proprietary information.
No person, including an authorized applicant, may disclose the business proprietary information of another person to any other person except another authorized applicant or a Department official described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. Any person that is not an authorized applicant and that is served with business proprietary information must return it to the sender immediately, to the extent possible without reading it, and must notify the Department. An allegation of an unauthorized disclosure will subject the person that made the alleged unauthorized disclosure to an investigation and possible sanctions under 19 CFR part 354.
[63 FR 24403, May 4, 1998, as amended at 88 FR 67080, Sept. 29, 2023; 89 FR 20836, Mar. 25, 2024; 89 FR 101763, Dec. 16, 2024]
§ 351.307
Verification of information.
(a)
Introduction.
Prior to making a final determination in an investigation or issuing final results of review, the Secretary may verify relevant factual information. This section clarifies when verification will occur, the contents of a verification report, and the procedures for verification.
(b)
In general.
(1) Subject to paragraph (b)(4) of this section, the Secretary will verify factual information upon which the Secretary relies in:
(i) A final determination in a continuation of a previously suspended countervailing duty investigation (section 704(g) of the Act), countervailing duty investigation, continuation of a
previously suspended antidumping investigation (section 705(a) of the Act), or antidumping investigation;
(ii) The final results of an expedited antidumping review;
(iii) A revocation under section 751(d) of the Act;
(iv) The final results of an administrative review, new shipper review, or changed circumstances review, if the Secretary decides that good cause for verification exists; and
(v) The final results of an administrative review if:
(A) A domestic interested party, not later than 100 days after the date of publication of the notice of initiation of review, submits a written request for verification; and
(B) The Secretary conducted no verification under this paragraph during either of the two immediately preceding administrative reviews.
(2) The Secretary may verify factual information upon which the Secretary relies in a proceeding or a segment of a proceeding not specifically provided for in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
(3) If the Secretary decides that, because of the large number of exporters or producers included in an investigation or administrative review, it is impractical to verify relevant factual information for each person, the Secretary may select and verify a sample.
(4) The Secretary may conduct verification of a person if that person agrees to verification and the Secretary notifies the government of the affected country and that government does not object. If the person or the government objects to verification, the Secretary will not conduct verification and may disregard any or all information submitted by the person in favor of use of the facts available under section 776 of the Act and § 351.308.
(c)
Verification report.
The Secretary will report the methods, procedures, and results of a verification under this section prior to making a final determination in an investigation or issuing final results in a review.
(d)
Procedures for verification.
The Secretary will notify the government of the affected country that employees of the Department will visit with the persons listed below in order to verify the accuracy and completeness of submitted factual information. The notification will, where practicable, identify any member of the verification team who is not an officer of the U.S. Government. As part of the verification, employees of the Department will request access to all files, records, and personnel which the Secretary considers relevant to factual information submitted of:
(1) Producers, exporters, or importers;
(2) Persons affiliated with the persons listed in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, where applicable;
(3) Unaffiliated purchasers, or
(4) The government of the affected country as part of verification in a countervailing duty proceeding.
§ 351.308
Determinations on the basis of the facts available.
(a)
Introduction.
The Secretary may make determinations on the basis of the facts available whenever necessary information is not available on the record, an interested party or any other person withholds or fails to provide information requested in a timely manner and in the form required or significantly impedes a proceeding, or the Secretary is unable to verify submitted information. If the Secretary finds that an interested party “has failed to cooperate by not acting to the best of its ability to comply with a request for information,” the Secretary may use an inference that is adverse to the interests of that party in selecting from among the facts otherwise available. This section lists some of the sources of information upon which the Secretary may base an adverse inference and explains the actions the Secretary will take with respect to corroboration of information.
(b)
In general.
The Secretary may make a determination under the Act and this part based on the facts otherwise available in accordance with section 776(a) of the Act.
(c)
Adverse inferences.
For purposes of section 776(b) of the Act, an adverse inference may include reliance on:
(1) Secondary information, such as information derived from:
(i) The petition;
(ii) A final determination in a countervailing duty investigation or an antidumping investigation;
(iii) Any previous administrative review, new shipper review, expedited antidumping review, section 753 review, or section 762 review; or
(2) Any other information placed on the record.
(d)
Corroboration of secondary information.
Under section 776(c) of the Act, when the Secretary relies on secondary information, the Secretary will, to the extent practicable, corroborate that information from independent sources that are reasonably at the Secretary's disposal. Independent sources may include, but are not limited to, published price lists, official import statistics and customs data, and information obtained from interested parties during the instant investigation or review. Corroborate means that the Secretary will examine whether the secondary information to be used has probative value. The fact that corroboration may not be practicable in a given circumstance will not prevent the Secretary from applying an adverse inference as appropriate and using the secondary information in question.
(e)
Use of certain information.
In reaching a determination under the Act and this part, the Secretary will not decline to consider information that is submitted by an interested party and is necessary to the determination but does not meet all the applicable requirements established by the Secretary if the conditions listed under section 782(e) of the Act are met.
(f)
Use of facts available in a sunset review.
Where the Secretary determines to issue final results of sunset review on the basis of facts available, the Secretary normally will rely on:
(1) Calculated countervailing duty rates or dumping margins, as applicable, from prior Department determinations; and
(2) Information contained in parties' substantive responses to the Notice of Initiation filed under § 351.218(d)(3), consistent with section 752(b) or 752(c) of the Act, as applicable.
(g)
Partial or total facts available.
In accordance with section 776(a) of the Act, if the Secretary determines to apply facts available, regardless of the use of an adverse inference under section 776(b) of the Act, the Secretary may apply facts available to only a portion of its antidumping or countervailing duty analysis and calculations, referred to as partial facts available, or to all of its analysis and calculations, referred to as total facts available, as appropriate on a case-specific basis.
(h)
Segment-specific dumping and countervailable subsidy rates.
If the Secretary has determined dumping margins or countervailable subsidy rates in separate segments of the same proceeding in which the Secretary is applying facts available, in accordance with section 776(c)(2) of the Act the Secretary may apply those margins or rates as facts available without being required to conduct a corroboration analysis.
(i)
Selection of adverse facts available.
If the Secretary determines to apply adverse facts available, in accordance with sections 776(d)(1), (2), and (3) of the Act, the following applies:
(1) In an antidumping proceeding, the Secretary may use a dumping margin from any segment of the proceeding as adverse facts, including the highest dumping margin available. The Secretary may use the highest dumping margin available if the Secretary determines that such an application is warranted after evaluating the situation that resulted in an adverse inference;
(2) In a countervailing duty segment of the proceeding, in accordance with the hierarchy set forth in paragraph (j) of this section, the Secretary may use a countervailing subsidy rate applied to the same or similar program in a countervailing duty proceeding involving the same country or, if there is no same or similar program, use a countervailing subsidy rate from a proceeding that the Secretary determines is reasonable to use. The Secretary will normally apply the highest calculated above-
de minimis
countervailing duty rate available if the Secretary determines that such an application is warranted after evaluating the situation that resulted in an adverse inference; and
(3) In applying adverse facts available, the Secretary will not be required to:
(i) Estimate what a countervailable subsidy or dumping margin would have been if an interested party that was found to have failed to cooperate under section 776(b)(1) of the Act had cooperated; or
(ii) Demonstrate that the countervailable subsidy rate or dumping margin used by the Secretary as adverse facts available reflects an alleged “commercial reality” of the interested party.
(j)
Adverse facts available hierarchy in countervailing duty proceedings.
In accordance with sections 776(d)(1)(A) and 776(d)(2) of the Act, when the Secretary applies an adverse inference in selecting a countervailable subsidy rate on the basis of facts otherwise available in a countervailing duty proceeding, the Secretary will normally select the highest program rate available using a hierarchical analysis as follows:
(1) For investigations, conducted pursuant to section 701 of the Act, the hierarchy will be applied in the following sequence:
(i) If there are cooperating respondents in the investigation, the Secretary will determine if a cooperating respondent used an identical program in the investigation and apply the highest calculated above-
de minimis
rate for the identical program;
(ii) If no rate exists which the Secretary is able to apply under paragraph (j)(1)(i), the Secretary will determine if an identical program was used in another countervailing duty proceeding involving the same country and apply the highest calculated above-
de minimis
rate for the identical program;
(iii) If no rate exists which the Secretary is able to apply under paragraph (j)(1)(ii), the Secretary will determine if there is a similar or comparable program in any countervailing duty proceeding involving the same country and apply the highest calculated above-
de minimis
rate for the similar or comparable program; and
(iv) If no rate exists which the Secretary is able to apply under paragraph (j)(1)(iii), the Secretary will apply the highest calculated above-
de minimis
rate from any non-company-specific program in a countervailing duty proceeding involving the same country that the Secretary considers the company's industry could possibly use.
(2) For administrative reviews, conducted pursuant to section 751 of the Act, the hierarchy will be applied in the following sequence:
(i) The Secretary will determine if an identical program has been used in any segment of the proceeding and apply the highest calculated above-
de minimis
rate for any respondent for the identical program;
(ii) If no rate exists which the Secretary is able to apply under paragraph (j)(2)(i), the Secretary will determine if there is a similar or comparable program within any segment of the same proceeding and apply the highest calculated above-
de minimis
rate for the similar or comparable program;
(iii) If no rate exists which the Secretary is able to apply under paragraph (j)(2)(ii), the Secretary will determine if there is an identical program in any countervailing duty proceeding involving the same country and apply the highest calculated above-
de minimis
rate for the identical program or, if there is no identical program or above-
de minimis
rate available, determine if there is a similar or comparable program in any countervailing duty proceeding involving the same country and apply the highest calculated above-
de minimis
rate for the similar or comparable program; and
(iv) If no rate exists which the Secretary is able to apply under paragraph (j)(2)(iii), the Secretary will apply the highest calculated rate for any non-company-specific program from any countervailing duty proceeding involving the same country that the Secretary considers the company's industry could possibly use.
(3) When the Secretary uses an adverse facts available countervailing duty hierarchy, the following will apply:
(i) The Secretary will treat rates less than 0.5 percent as
de minimis;
(ii) The Secretary will normally determine a program to be a similar or comparable program based on the Secretary's treatment of the program's benefit;
(iii) The Secretary will normally select the highest program rate available
in accordance with the hierarchical sequence, unless the Secretary determines that such a rate is otherwise inappropriate; and
(iv) When applicable, the Secretary will determine an adverse facts available rate selected using the hierarchy to be corroborated in accordance with section 776(c)(1) of the Act.

§ 351.313
Attorneys or representatives.
In general.
No register of attorneys or representatives who may practice before the Department is maintained. No application for admission to practice is required. Any person desiring to appear as attorney or representative before the Department may be required to show to the satisfaction of the Secretary his acceptability in that capacity. Any attorney or representative practicing before the Department, or desiring so to practice, may for good cause shown be suspended or barred from practicing before the Department, or have imposed on him such lesser sanctions (e.g., public or private reprimand) as the Secretary deems appropriate, but only after he has been accorded an opportunity to present his views in the matter. The Department will maintain a public register of attorneys and representatives suspended or barred from practice. “Attorney” pursuant to this subpart and “legal counsel” in § 351.303(g) have the same meaning. “Representative” pursuant to this
subpart and in § 351.303(g) has the same meaning.
[78 FR 22777, Apr. 17, 2013]

# Subpart D—Calculation of Export Price, Constructed Export Price, Fair Value, and Normal Value
§ 351.401
In general.
(a)
Introduction.
In general terms, an antidumping analysis involves a comparison of export price or constructed export price in the United States with normal value in the foreign market. This section establishes certain general rules that apply to the calculation of export price, constructed export price and normal value. (
See
section 772, section 773, and section 773A of the Act.)
(b)
Adjustments in general.
In making adjustments to export price, constructed export price, or normal value, the Secretary will adhere to the following principles:
(1) The interested party that is in possession of the relevant information has the burden of establishing to the satisfaction of the Secretary the amount and nature of a particular adjustment; and
(2) The Secretary will not double-count adjustments.
(c)
Use of price net of price adjustments.
In calculating export price, constructed export price, and normal value (where normal value is based on price), the Secretary normally will use a price that is net of price adjustments, as defined in § 351.102(b), that are reasonably attributable to the subject merchandise or the foreign like product (whichever is applicable). The Secretary will not accept a price adjustment that is made after the time of sale unless the interested party demonstrates, to the satisfaction of the Secretary, its entitlement to such an adjustment.
(d)
Delayed payment or pre-payment of expenses.
Where cost is the basis for determining the amount of an adjustment to export price, constructed export price, or normal value, the Secretary will not factor in any delayed payment or pre-payment of expenses by the exporter or producer.
(e)
Adjustments for movement expenses
—(1)
Original place of shipment.
In making adjustments for movement expenses to establish export price or constructed export price under section 772(c)(2)(A) of the Act, or normal value under section 773(a)(6)(B)(ii) of the Act, the Secretary normally will consider the production facility as being the “original place of shipment. However, where the Secretary bases export price, constructed export price, or normal value on a sale by an unaffiliated reseller, the Secretary may treat the original place from which the reseller shipped the merchandise as the “original place of shipment.”
(2)
Warehousing.
The Secretary will consider warehousing expenses that are incurred after the subject merchandise or foreign like product leaves the original place of shipment as movement expenses.
(f)
Treatment of affiliated parties in antidumping proceedings
—(1)
In general.
In an antidumping proceeding under this part, the Secretary will normally treat two or more affiliated parties as a single entity if the Secretary concludes that there is a significant potential for manipulation of prices, production, or other export decisions.
(2)
Significant potential for manipulation.
In identifying a significant potential for the manipulation of price, production or other export decisions, the factors the Secretary may consider for all affiliated parties include:
(i) The level of common ownership;
(ii) The extent to which managerial employees or board members of one firm sit on the board of directors of an affiliated firm; and
(iii) Whether operations are intertwined, such as through the sharing of sales and export information; involvement in production, pricing, and other commercial decisions; the sharing of facilities or employees; or significant transactions between the affiliated parties.
(3)
Additional considerations for affiliated parties with access to production facilities in determining the significant potential for manipulation.
In determining whether there is a significant potential for manipulation, if the Secretary determines that affiliated parties have, or will have, access to production facilities for similar or identical products, the Secretary shall consider if
any of those facilities would require substantial retooling in order to restructure manufacturing priorities.
(4)
Exceptions.
If the following affiliated parties do not produce similar or identical products to the subject merchandise or export subject merchandise to the United States, the Secretary will normally not treat those parties as part of a single entity for purposes of the Secretary's calculations under this provision:
(i) Input suppliers;
(ii) Sellers of the foreign like product in the home market; and
(iii) Affiliated entities for which the Secretary determines that treating those parties as a single entity would be otherwise inappropriate based on record information.
(g)
Allocation of expenses and price adjustments
—(1)
In general.
The Secretary may consider allocated expenses and price adjustments when transaction-specific reporting is not feasible, provided the Secretary is satisfied that the allocation method used does not cause inaccuracies or distortions.
(2)
Reporting allocated expenses and price adjustments.
Any party seeking to report an expense or a price adjustment on an allocated basis must demonstrate to the Secretary's satisfaction that the allocation is calculated on as specific a basis as is feasible, and must explain why the allocation methodology used does not cause inaccuracies or distortions.
(3)
Feasibility.
In determining the feasibility of transaction-specific reporting or whether an allocation is calculated on as specific a basis as is feasible, the Secretary will take into account the records maintained by the party in question in the ordinary course of its business, as well as such factors as the normal accounting practices in the country and industry in question and the number of sales made by the party during the period of investigation or review.
(4)
Expenses and price adjustments relating to merchandise not subject to the proceeding.
The Secretary will not reject an allocation method solely because the method includes expenses incurred, or price adjustments made, with respect to sales of merchandise that does not constitute subject merchandise or a foreign like product (whichever is applicable).
(h) [Reserved]
(i)
Date of sale.
In identifying the date of sale of the subject merchandise or foreign like product, the Secretary normally will use the date of invoice, as recorded in the exporter or producer's records kept in the ordinary course of business. However, the Secretary may use a date other than the date of invoice if the Secretary is satisfied that a different date better reflects the date on which the exporter or producer establishes the material terms of sale.
[62 FR 27379, May 19, 1997, as amended at 73 FR 16518, Mar. 28, 2008; 81 FR 15645, Mar. 24, 2016; 89 FR 101764, Dec. 16, 2024]
§ 351.402
Calculation of export price and constructed export price; reimbursement of antidumping and countervailing duties.
(a)
Introduction.
In order to establish export price, constructed export price, and normal value, the Secretary must make certain adjustments to the price to the unaffiliated purchaser (often called the “starting price”) in both the United States and foreign markets. This regulation clarifies how the Secretary will make certain of the adjustments to the starting price in the United States that are required by section 772 of the Act.
(b)
Additional adjustments to constructed export price.
In establishing constructed export price under section 772(d) of the Act, the Secretary will make adjustments for expenses associated with commercial activities in the United States that relate to the sale to an unaffiliated purchaser, no matter where or when paid. The Secretary will not make an adjustment for any expense that is related solely to the sale to an affiliated importer in the United States, although the Secretary may make an adjustment to normal value for such expenses under section 773(a)(6)(C)(iii) of the Act.
(c)
Special rule for merchandise with value added after importation
—(1)
Merchandise imported by affiliated persons.
In applying section 772(e) of the Act, merchandise imported by and value added by a person affiliated with the
exporter or producer includes merchandise imported and value added for the account of such an affiliated person.
(2)
Estimation of value added.
The Secretary normally will determine that the value added in the United States by the affiliated person is likely to exceed substantially the value of the subject merchandise if the Secretary estimates the value added to be at least 65 percent of the price charged to the first unaffiliated purchaser for the merchandise as sold in the United States. The Secretary normally will estimate the value added based on the difference between the price charged to the first unaffiliated purchaser for the merchandise as sold in the United States and the price paid for the subject merchandise by the affiliated person. The Secretary normally will base this determination on averages of the prices and the value added to the subject merchandise.
(3)
Determining dumping margins.
For purposes of determining dumping margins under paragraphs (1) and (2) of section 772(e) of the Act, the Secretary may use the weighted-average dumping margins calculated on sales of identical or other subject merchandise sold to unaffiliated persons.
(d)
Special rule for determining profit.
This paragraph sets forth rules for calculating profit in establishing constructed export price under section 772(f) of the Act.
(1)
Basis for total expenses and total actual profit.
In calculating total expenses and total actual profit, the Secretary normally will use the aggregate of expenses and profit for all subject merchandise sold in the United States and all foreign like products sold in the exporting country, including sales that have been disregarded as being below the cost of production. (
See
section 773(b) of the Act (sales at less than cost of production).)
(2)
Use of financial reports.
For purposes of determining profit under section 772(d)(3) of the Act, the Secretary may rely on any appropriate financial reports, including public, audited financial statements, or equivalent financial reports, and internal financial reports prepared in the ordinary course of business.
(3)
Voluntary reporting of costs of production.
The Secretary will not require the reporting of costs of production solely for purposes of determining the amount of profit to be deducted from the constructed export price. The Secretary will base the calculation of profit on costs of production if such costs are reported voluntarily by the date established by the Secretary, and provided that it is practicable to do so and the costs of production are verifiable.
(e)
Treatment of payments between affiliated persons.
Where a person affiliated with the exporter or producer incurs any of the expenses deducted from constructed export price under section 772(d) of the Act and is reimbursed for such expenses by the exporter, producer or other affiliate, the Secretary normally will make an adjustment based on the actual cost to the affiliated person. If the Secretary is satisfied that information regarding the actual cost to the affiliated person is unavailable to the exporter or producer, the Secretary may determine the amount of the adjustment on any other reasonable basis, including the amount of the reimbursement to the affiliated person if the Secretary is satisfied that such amount reflects the amount usually paid in the market under consideration.
(f)
Reimbursement of antidumping duties and countervailing duties
—(1)
In general.
(i) In calculating the export price (or the constructed export price), the Secretary will deduct the amount of any antidumping duty or countervailing duty which the exporter or producer:
(A) Paid directly on behalf of the importer; or
(B) Reimbursed to the importer.
(ii) The Secretary will not deduct the amount of any antidumping duty or countervailing duty paid or reimbursed if the exporter or producer granted to the importer before initiation of the antidumping investigation in question a warranty of nonapplicability of antidumping duties or countervailing duties with respect to subject merchandise which was:
(A) Sold before the date of publication of the Secretary's order applicable to the merchandise in question; and
(B) Exported before the date of publication of the Secretary's final antidumping determination.
(iii) Ordinarily, under paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section, the Secretary will deduct the amount reimbursed only once in the calculation of the export price (or constructed export price).
(2)
Reimbursement certification.
(i) The importer must certify with U.S. Customs and Border Protection prior to liquidation (except as provided for in paragraph (f)(2)(iii) of this section) whether the importer has or has not been reimbursed or entered into any agreement or understanding for the payment or for the refunding to the importer by the manufacturer, producer, seller, or exporter for all or any part of the antidumping and countervailing duties, as appropriate. Such certifications should identify the commodity and country and contain the information necessary to link the certification to the relevant entry or entry line number(s).
(ii) The reimbursement certification may be filed either electronically or in paper in accordance with the U.S. Customs and Border Protection's requirements, as applicable.
(iii) If an importer does not provide its reimbursement certification prior to liquidation, U.S. Customs and Border Protection may accept the reimbursement certification in accordance with its protest procedures under 19 U.S.C. 1514, unless otherwise directed.
(iv) Reimbursement certifications are required for entries of the relevant commodity that have been imported on or after the date of publication of the antidumping notice in the
Federal Register
that first suspended liquidation in that proceeding.
(3)
Presumption.
The Secretary may presume from an importer's failure to file the certificate required in paragraph (f)(2) of this section that the exporter or producer paid or reimbursed the antidumping duties or countervailing duties.
[62 FR 27379, May 19, 1997, as amended at 86 FR 52384, Sept. 20, 2021; 89 FR 20837, Mar. 25, 2024]
§ 351.403
Sales used in calculating normal value; transactions between affiliated parties.
(a)
Introduction.
This section clarifies when the Secretary may use offers for sale in determining normal value. Additionally, this section clarifies the authority of the Secretary to use sales to or through an affiliated party as a basis for normal value. (
See
section 773(a)(5) of the Act (indirect sales or offers for sale).)
(b)
Sales and offers for sale.
In calculating normal value, the Secretary normally will consider offers for sale only in the absence of sales and only if the Secretary concludes that acceptance of the offer can be reasonably expected.
(c)
Sales to an affiliated party.
If an exporter or producer sold the foreign like product to an affiliated party, the Secretary may calculate normal value based on that sale only if satisfied that the price is comparable to the price at which the exporter or producer sold the foreign like product to a person who is not affiliated with the seller.
(d)
Sales through an affiliated party.
If an exporter or producer sold the foreign like product through an affiliated party, the Secretary may calculate normal value based on the sale by such affiliated party. However, the Secretary normally will not calculate normal value based on the sale by an affiliated party if sales of the foreign like product by an exporter or producer to affiliated parties account for less than five percent of the total value (or quantity) of the exporter's or producer's sales of the foreign like product in the market in question or if sales to the affiliated party are comparable, as defined in paragraph (c) of this section.
§ 351.404
Selection of the market to be used as the basis for normal value.
(a)
Introduction.
Although in most circumstances sales of the foreign like product in the home market are the most appropriate basis for determining normal value, section 773 of the Act also permits use of sales to a third country or constructed value as the basis for normal value. This section clarifies the rules for determining the basis for normal value.
(b)
Determination of viable market
—(1)
In general.
The Secretary will consider
the exporting country or a third country as constituting a viable market if the Secretary is satisfied that sales of the foreign like product in that country are of sufficient quantity to form the basis of normal value.
(2)
Sufficient quantity.
“Sufficient quantity” normally means that the aggregate quantity (or, if quantity is not appropriate, value) of the foreign like product sold by an exporter or producer in a country is 5 percent or more of the aggregate quantity (or value) of its sales of the subject merchandise to the United States.
(c)
Calculation of price-based normal value in viable market
—(1)
In general.
Subject to paragraph (c)(2) of this section:
(i) If the exporting country constitutes a viable market, the Secretary will calculate normal value on the basis of price in the exporting country (
see
section 773(a)(1)(B)(i) of the Act (price used for determining normal value)); or
(ii) If the exporting country does not constitute a viable market, but a third country does constitute a viable market, the Secretary may calculate normal value on the basis of price to a third country (
see
section 773(a)(1)(B)(ii) of the Act (use of third country prices in determining normal value)).
(2)
Exception.
The Secretary may decline to calculate normal value in a particular market under paragraph (c)(1) of this section if it is established to the satisfaction of the Secretary that:
(i) In the case of the exporting country or a third country, a particular market situation exists that does not permit a proper comparison with the export price or constructed export price (
see
section 773(a)(1)(B)(ii)(III) or section 773(a)(1)(C)(iii) of the Act); or
(ii) In the case of a third country, the price is not representative (
see
section 773(a)(1)(B)(ii)(I) of the Act).
(d)
Allegations concerning market viability and the basis for determining a price-based normal value.
In an antidumping investigation or review, allegations regarding market viability or the exceptions in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, must be filed, with all supporting factual information, in accordance with § 351.301(c)(2)(i).
(e)
Selection of third country.
For purposes of calculating normal value based on prices in a third country, where prices in more than one third country satisfy the criteria of section 773(a)(1)(B)(ii) of the Act and this section, the Secretary generally will select the third country based on the following criteria:
(1) The foreign like product exported to a particular third country is more similar to the subject merchandise exported to the United States than is the foreign like product exported to other third countries;
(2) The volume of sales to a particular third country is larger than the volume of sales to other third countries;
(3) Such other factors as the Secretary considers appropriate.
(f)
Third country sales and constructed value.
The Secretary normally will calculate normal value based on sales to a third country rather than on constructed value if adequate information is available and verifiable (
see
section 773(a)(4) of the Act (use of constructed value)).
(g)
Special rule for certain multinational corporations.
In the course of an antidumping investigation, if the Secretary determines that the factors listed in section 773(d) of the Act are present, the Secretary will apply the special rule for certain multinational corporations and determine the normal value of the subject merchandise by reference to the normal value at which the foreign like product is sold in substantial quantities from one or more facilities outside the exporting country. In making a determination under this provision, the following will apply:
(1) Interested parties alleging that the Secretary should apply the special rule for certain multinational corporations must submit the allegation in accordance with the filing requirements set forth in § 351.301(c)(2)(i).
(2) If the Secretary determines that the non-exporting country at issue is a nonmarket economy country and, in accordance with § 351.408, normal value would be determined using a factors of production methodology if the special
rule for certain multinational corporations was applied, the Secretary will not apply the special rule for certain multinational corporations.
[62 FR 27379, May 19, 1997, as amended at 88 FR 67080, Sept. 29, 2023; 89 FR 101764, Dec. 16, 2024]
§ 351.405
Calculation of normal value based on constructed value.
(a)
Introduction.
In certain circumstances, the Secretary may determine normal value by constructing a value based on the cost of manufacturing, selling, general and administrative expenses and profit. The Secretary may use constructed value as the basis for normal value when: neither the home market nor a third country market is viable; sales below the cost of production are disregarded; sales outside the ordinary course of trade or sales for which the prices are otherwise unrepresentative are disregarded; sales used to establish a fictitious market are disregarded; no contemporaneous sales of comparable merchandise are available; or in other circumstances where the Secretary determines that home market or third country prices are inappropriate. (See section 773(e) and (f) of the Act.) This section clarifies the meaning of certain terms and sets forth certain information which the Secretary will normally consider in determining a constructed value.
(b)
Profit and selling, general, and administrative expenses.
In determining the amount to be added to constructed value for profit and for selling, general, and administrative expenses, the following rules will apply:
(1) Under section 773(e)(2)(A) of the Act, “foreign country” means the country in which the merchandise is produced or a third country selected by the Secretary under § 351.404(e), as appropriate.
(2) Under section 773(e)(2)(B) of the Act, “foreign country” means the country in which the merchandise is produced.
(3) Under section 773(e)(2)(B)(iii) of the Act, the Secretary will normally consider the following criteria in selecting sources for selling, general and administrative expenses, as well as profit, in calculating constructed value:
(i) The similarity of the potential surrogate companies' business operations and products to the examined producer's or exporter's business operations and products;
(ii) The extent to which the financial data of the surrogate company reflects sales in the home market and does not reflect sales to the United States;
(iii) The contemporaneity of the surrogate company's data to the period of investigation or review; and
(iv) The extent of similarity between the customer base of the surrogate company and the customer base of the examined producer or exporter.

§ 351.406
Calculation of normal value if sales are made at less than cost of production.
(a)
Introduction.
In determining normal value, the Secretary may disregard sales of the foreign like product made at prices that are less than the cost of production of that product. However, such sales will be disregarded only if they are made within an extended period of time, in substantial quantities, and are not at prices which permit recovery of costs within a reasonable period of time. (
See
section 773(b) of the Act.) This section clarifies the meaning of the term “extended period of time” as used in the Act.
(b)
Extended period of time.
The “extended period of time” under section 773(b)(1)(A) of the Act normally will coincide with the period in which the sales under consideration for the determination of normal value were made.
§ 351.407
Calculation of constructed value and cost of production.
(a)
Introduction.
This section sets forth certain rules that are common to the calculation of constructed value and the cost of production. (
See
section 773(f) of the Act.)
(b)
Determination of value under the major input rule.
For purposes of section 773(f)(3) of the Act, the Secretary normally will determine the value of a major input purchased from an affiliated person based on the higher of:
(1) The price paid by the exporter or producer to the affiliated person for the major input;
(2) The amount usually reflected in sales of the major input in the market under consideration; or
(3) The cost to the affiliated person of producing the major input.
(c)
Allocation of costs.
In determining the appropriate method for allocating costs among products, the Secretary may take into account production quantities, relative sales values, and other quantitative and qualitative factors associated with the manufacture and sale of the subject merchandise and the foreign like product.
(d)
Startup costs.
(1) In identifying startup operations under section 773(f)(1)(C)(ii) of the Act:
(i) “New production facilities” includes the substantially complete retooling of an existing plant. Substantially complete retooling involves the replacement of nearly all production machinery or the equivalent rebuilding of existing machinery.
(ii) A “new product” is one requiring substantial additional investment, including products which, though sold under an existing nameplate, involve the complete revamping or redesign of the product. Routine model year changes will not be considered a new product.
(iii) Mere improvements to existing products or ongoing improvements to existing facilities will not be considered startup operations.
(iv) An expansion of the capacity of an existing production line will not qualify as a startup operation unless the expansion constitutes such a major undertaking that it requires the construction of a new facility and results in a depression of production levels due to technical factors associated with the initial phase of commercial production of the expanded facilities.
(2) In identifying the end of the startup period under clauses (ii) and (iii) of section 773(f)(1)(C) of the Act:
(i) The attainment of peak production levels will not be the standard for identifying the end of the startup period, because the startup period may end well before a company achieves optimum capacity utilization.
(ii) The startup period will not be extended to cover improvements and cost reductions that may occur over the entire life cycle of a product.
(3) In determining when a producer reaches commercial production levels under section 773(f)(1)(C)(ii) of the Act:
(i) The Secretary will consider the actual production experience of the merchandise in question, measuring production on the basis of units processed.
(ii) To the extent necessary, the Secretary will examine factors in addition to those specified in section 773(f)(1)(C)(ii) of the Act, including historical data reflecting the same producer's or other producers' experiences in producing the same or similar products. A producer's projections of future volume or cost will be accorded little weight.
(4) In making an adjustment for startup operations under section 773(f)(1)(C)(iii) of the Act:
(i) The Secretary will determine the duration of the startup period on a case-by-case basis.
(ii) The difference between actual costs and the costs of production calculated for startup costs will be amortized over a reasonable period of time subsequent to the startup period over the life of the product or machinery, as appropriate.
(iii) The Secretary will consider unit production costs to be items such as depreciation of equipment and plant, labor costs, insurance, rent and lease expenses, material costs, and factory overhead. The Secretary will not consider sales expenses, such as advertising costs, or other general and administrative or non-production costs (such as general research and development costs), as startup costs.
§ 351.408
Calculation of normal value of merchandise from nonmarket economy countries.
(a)
Introduction.
In identifying dumping from a nonmarket economy country, the Secretary normally will calculate normal value by valuing the nonmarket economy producers' factors of production in a market economy country. (
See
section 773(c) of the Act.) This section clarifies when and how this special methodology for nonmarket economies will be applied.
(b)
Selecting surrogate countries
—(1)
Determining comparable economies.
The Secretary is directed by sections
773(c)(2)(B) and 773(c)(4)(A) of the Act to select surrogate countries which are at a level of economic development comparable to that of the nonmarket economy country at issue.
(i)
Measuring economic comparability.
In determining whether market economy countries are at a level of economic development comparable to the nonmarket economy at issue, the Secretary will place primary emphasis on
per capita
gross domestic product (GDP).
(ii)
Additional considerations in determining economic comparability.
When the Secretary determines that such an analysis is warranted, the Secretary may consider additional factors in determining whether certain market economy countries are at a level of economic development comparable to the nonmarket economy at issue. If the Secretary considers additional factors in its analysis, the Secretary will identify those factors and provide the reason it considered those factors along with the list of comparable market economies issued under paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section.
(iii)
Annual listing of comparable economies.
On an annual basis, the Secretary will determine market economies comparable to individual nonmarket economies and list those market economies on the Secretary's website.
(2)
Determining significant producers of comparable merchandise.
In selecting a surrogate country from those countries which the Secretary determines are economically comparable, the Secretary will consider, in accordance with section 773(c)(2)(A) and (c)(4)(B) of the Act, those countries that are significant producers of merchandise comparable to the subject merchandise.
(3)
Selecting between surrogate countries which are economically comparable and significant producers of comparable merchandise.
If more than one economically comparable country produces comparable merchandise, the Secretary will consider the totality of the information on the record in selecting a surrogate country. Among the criteria the Secretary may consider in selecting a surrogate country are the availability, accessibility, and quality of data from those countries and the similarity of products manufactured in the potential surrogate countries in comparison to the subject merchandise.
(c)
Valuation of Factors of Production.
For purposes of valuing the factors of production, general expenses, profit, and the cost of containers, coverings, and other expenses (referred to collectively as “factors”) under section 773(c)(1) of the Act the following rules will apply:
(1)
Information used to value factors.
The Secretary normally will use publicly available information to value factors. However, where a factor is produced in one or more market economy countries, purchased from one or more market economy suppliers and paid for in market economy currency, the Secretary normally will use the price(s) paid to the market economy supplier(s) if substantially all of the total volume of the factor is purchased from the market economy supplier(s). For purposes of this provision, the Secretary defines the term “substantially all” to be 85 percent or more of the total volume purchased of the factor used in the production of subject merchandise. In those instances where less than substantially all of the total volume of the factor is produced in one or more market economy countries and purchased from one or more market economy suppliers, the Secretary normally will weight-average the actual price(s) paid for the market economy portion and the surrogate value for the nonmarket economy portion by their respective quantities.
(2)
Valuation in a single country.
The Secretary normally will value all factors in a single surrogate country.
(3)
Manufacturing overhead, general expenses, and profit.
For manufacturing overhead, general expenses, and profit, the Secretary normally will use non-proprietary information gathered from producers of identical or comparable merchandise in the surrogate country.
(d)
A determination that certain surrogate value information is not otherwise appropriate
—(1)
In general.
Notwithstanding the factors considered under
paragraph (c) of this section, the Secretary may disregard a proposed market economy country value for consideration as a surrogate value if the Secretary determines that evidence on the record reflects that the use of such a value would be inappropriate.
(i) In accordance with section 773(c)(5), the Secretary may disregard a proposed surrogate value if the Secretary determines that the value is derived from a country that provides broadly available export subsidies, if particular instances of subsidization occurred with respect to that proposed surrogate value, or if that proposed surrogate value was subject to an antidumping order.
(ii) In addition, the Secretary may disregard a proposed surrogate value if the Secretary determines based on record evidence that the value is derived from a facility, party, industry, intra-country region or a country with weak, ineffective, or nonexistent property (including intellectual property), human rights, labor, or environmental protections.
(2)
Requirements to disregard a proposed surrogate value based on weak, ineffective, or nonexistent protections.
For purposes of paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section, the Secretary will only consider disregarding a proposed market economy country value as a surrogate value of production if the Secretary determines the following:
(i) The proposed surrogate value at issue is for a significant input or labor;
(ii) The proposed surrogate value is derived from one country or an average of values from a limited number of countries; and
(iii) The information on the record supports a claim that the identified weak, ineffective, or nonexistent property (including intellectual property), human rights, labor, or environmental protections undermine the appropriateness of using that value as a surrogate value.
(3)
The use of a surrogate value located in a country which is not at a level of economic development comparable to that of the nonmarket economy.
If the Secretary determines, pursuant to this section, after reviewing all proposed values on the record derived from market economy countries which are at a level of economic development comparable to the nonmarket economy, that no such proposed value is appropriate to value a specific factor of production, the Secretary may use a value on the record derived from a market economy country which is not at a level of economic development comparable to that of the nonmarket economy country as a surrogate to value that specific factor of production.
(4)
The use of a surrogate value not located in a country which is a significant producer of comparable merchandise.
If the Secretary determines, pursuant to this section, after reviewing all proposed surrogate values on the record derived from market economy countries which are significant producers of merchandise comparable to the subject merchandise, that no such proposed value is appropriate to value a specific factor of production, the Secretary may use a value on the record derived from a market economy country which is not a significant producer of merchandise comparable to the subject merchandise as a surrogate to value that specific factor of production.
[62 FR 27379, May 19, 1997, as amended at 78 FR 46804, Aug. 2, 2013; 88 FR 67080, Sept. 29, 2023; 89 FR 20837, Mar. 25, 2024; 89 FR 101765, Dec. 16, 2024]
§ 351.409
Differences in quantities.
(a)
Introduction.
Because the quantity of merchandise sold may affect the price, in comparing export price or constructed export price with normal value, the Secretary will make a reasonable allowance for any difference in quantities to the extent the Secretary is satisfied that the amount of any price differential (or lack thereof) is wholly or partly due to that difference in quantities. (
See
section 773(a)(6)(C)(i) of the Act.)
(b)
Sales with quantity discounts in calculating normal value.
The Secretary normally will calculate normal value based on sales with quantity discounts only if:
(1) During the period examined, or during a more representative period, the exporter or producer granted quantity discounts of at least the same magnitude on 20 percent or more of sales of the foreign like product for the relevant country; or
(2) The exporter or producer demonstrates to the Secretary's satisfaction that the discounts reflect savings specifically attributable to the production of the different quantities.
(c)
Sales with quantity discounts in calculating weighted-average normal value.
If the exporter or producer does not satisfy the conditions of paragraph (b) of this section, the Secretary will calculate normal value based on weighted-average prices that include sales at a discount.
(d)
Price lists.
In determining whether a discount has been granted, the existence or lack of a published price list reflecting such a discount will not be controlling. Ordinarily, the Secretary will give weight to a price list only if, in the line of trade and market under consideration, the exporter or producer demonstrates that it has adhered to its price list.
(e)
Relationship to level of trade adjustment.
If adjustments are claimed for both differences in quantities and differences in level of trade, the Secretary will not make an adjustment for differences in quantities unless the Secretary is satisfied that the effect on price comparability of differences in quantities has been identified and established separately from the effect on price comparability of differences in the levels of trade.
§ 351.410
Differences in circumstances of sale
(a)
Introduction.
In calculating normal value the Secretary may make adjustments to account for certain differences in the circumstances of sales in the United States and foreign markets. (
See
section 773(a)(6)(C)(iii) of the Act.) This section clarifies certain terms used in the statute regarding circumstances of sale adjustments and describes the adjustment when commissions are paid only in one market.
(b)
In general.
With the exception of the allowance described in paragraph (e) of this section concerning commissions paid in only one market, the Secretary will make circumstances of sale adjustments under section 773(a)(6)(C)(iii) of the Act only for direct selling expenses and assumed expenses.
(c)
Direct selling expenses.
“Direct selling expenses” are expenses, such as commissions, credit expenses, guarantees, and warranties, that result from, and bear a direct relationship to, the particular sale in question.
(d)
Assumed expenses.
Assumed expenses are selling expenses that are assumed by the seller on behalf of the buyer, such as advertising expenses.
(e)
Commissions paid in one market.
The Secretary normally will make a reasonable allowance for other selling expenses if the Secretary makes a reasonable allowance for commissions in one of the markets under considerations, and no commission is paid in the other market under consideration. The Secretary will limit the amount of such allowance to the amount of the other selling expenses incurred in the one market or the commissions allowed in the other market, whichever is less.
(f)
Reasonable allowance.
In deciding what is a reasonable allowance for any difference in circumstances of sale, the Secretary normally will consider the cost of such difference to the exporter or producer but, if appropriate, may also consider the effect of such difference on the market value of the merchandise.
§ 351.411
Differences in physical characteristics.
(a)
Introduction.
In comparing United States sales with foreign market sales, the Secretary may determine that the merchandise sold in the United States does not have the same physical characteristics as the merchandise sold in the foreign market, and that the difference has an effect on prices. In calculating normal value, the Secretary will make a reasonable allowance for such differences. (
See
section 773(a)(6)(C)(ii) of the Act.)
(b)
Reasonable allowance.
In deciding what is a reasonable allowance for differences in physical characteristics, the Secretary will consider only differences in variable costs associated with the physical differences. Where appropriate, the Secretary may also consider differences in the market value. The Secretary will not consider differences in cost of production when
compared merchandise has identical physical characteristics.
§ 351.412
Levels of trade; adjustment for difference in level of trade; constructed export price offset.
(a)
Introduction.
In comparing United States sales with foreign market sales, the Secretary may determine that sales in the two markets were not made at the same level of trade, and that the difference has an effect on the comparability of the prices. The Secretary is authorized to adjust normal value to account for such a difference. (
See
section 773(a)(7) of the Act.)
(b)
Adjustment for difference in level of trade.
The Secretary will adjust normal value for a difference in level of trade if:
(1) The Secretary calculates normal value at a different level of trade from the level of trade of the export price or the constructed export price (whichever is applicable); and
(2) The Secretary determines that the difference in level of trade has an effect on price comparability.
(c)
Identifying levels of trade and differences in levels of trade
—(1)
Basis for identifying levels of trade.
The Secretary will identify the level of trade based on:
(i) In the case of export price, the starting price;
(ii) In the case of constructed export price, the starting price, as adjusted under section 772(d) of the Act; and
(iii) In the case of normal value, the starting price or constructed value.
(2)
Differences in levels of trade.
The Secretary will determine that sales are made at different levels of trade if they are made at different marketing stages (or their equivalent). Substantial differences in selling activities are a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for determining that there is a difference in the stage of marketing. Some overlap in selling activities will not preclude a determination that two sales are at different stages of marketing.
(d)
Effect on price comparability
—(1)
In general.
The Secretary will determine that a difference in level of trade has an effect on price comparability only if it is established to the satisfaction of the Secretary that there is a pattern of consistent price differences between sales in the market in which normal value is determined:
(i) At the level of trade of the export price or constructed export price (whichever is appropriate); and
(ii) At the level of trade at which normal value is determined.
(2)
Relevant sales.
Where possible, the Secretary will make the determination under paragraph (d)(1) of this section on the basis of sales of the foreign like product by the producer or exporter. Where this is not possible, the Secretary may use sales of different or broader product lines, sales by other companies, or any other reasonable basis.
(e)
Amount of adjustment.
The Secretary normally will calculate the amount of a level of trade adjustment by:
(1) Calculating the weighted-averages of the prices of sales at the two levels of trade identified in paragraph (d), after making any other adjustments to those prices appropriate under section 773(a)(6) of the Act and this subpart;
(2) Calculating the average of the percentage differences between those weighted-average prices; and
(3) Applying the percentage difference to normal value, where it is at a different level of trade from the export price or constructed export price (whichever is applicable), after making any other adjustments to normal value appropriate under section 773(a)(6) of the Act and this subpart.
(f)
Constructed export price offset
—(1)
In general.
The Secretary will grant a constructed export price offset only where:
(i) Normal value is compared to constructed export price;
(ii) Normal value is determined at a more advanced level of trade than the level of trade of the constructed export price; and
(iii) Despite the fact that a person has cooperated to the best of its ability, the data available do not provide an appropriate basis to determine under paragraph (d) of this section whether the difference in level of trade affects price comparability.
(2)
Amount of the offset.
The amount of the constructed export price offset will be the amount of indirect selling expenses included in normal value, up
to the amount of indirect selling expenses deducted in determining constructed export price. In making the constructed export price offset, “indirect selling expenses” means selling expenses, other than direct selling expenses or assumed selling expenses (
see
§ 351.410), that the seller would incur regardless of whether particular sales were made, but that reasonably may be attributed, in whole or in part, to such sales.
(3)
Where data permit determination of affect on price comparability.
Where available data permit the Secretary to determine under paragraph (d) of this section whether the difference in level of trade affects price comparability, the Secretary will not grant a constructed export price offset. In such cases, if the Secretary determines that price comparability has been affected, the Secretary will make a level of trade adjustment. If the Secretary determines that price comparability has not been affected, the Secretary will not grant either a level of trade adjustment or a constructed export price offset.
§ 351.413
Disregarding insignificant adjustments.
Ordinarily, under section 777A(a)(2) of the Act, an “insignificant adjustment” is any individual adjustment having an
ad valorem
effect of less than 0.33 percent, or any group of adjustments having an
ad valorem
effect of less than 1.0 percent, of the export price, constructed export price, or normal value, as the case may be. Groups of adjustments are adjustments for differences in circumstances of sale under § 351.410, adjustments for differences in the physical characteristics of the merchandise under § 351.411, and adjustments for differences in the levels of trade under § 351.412.
§ 351.414
Comparison of normal value with export price (constructed export price).
(a)
Introduction.
This section explains when and how the Secretary will average prices in making comparisons of export price or constructed export price with normal value. (
See
section 777A(d) of the Act.)
(b)
Description of methods of comparison
—(1)
Average-to-average method.
The “average-to-average” method involves a comparison of the weighted average of the normal values with the weighted average of the export prices (and constructed export prices) for comparable merchandise.
(2)
Transaction-to-transaction method.
The “transaction-to-transaction” method involves a comparison of the normal values of individual transactions with the export prices (or constructed export prices) of individual transactions for comparable merchandise.
(3)
Average-to-transaction method.
The “average-to-transaction” method involves a comparison of the weighted average of the normal values to the export prices (or constructed export prices) of individual transactions for comparable merchandise.
(c)
Choice of method.
(1) In an investigation or review, the Secretary will use the average-to-average method unless the Secretary determines another method is appropriate in a particular case.
(2) The Secretary will use the transaction-to-transaction method only in unusual situations, such as when there are very few sales of subject merchandise and the merchandise sold in each market is identical or very similar or is custom-made.
(d)
Application of the average-to-average method
—(1)
In general.
In applying the average-to-average method, the Secretary will identify those sales of the subject merchandise to the United States that are comparable, and will include such sales in an “averaging group.” The Secretary will calculate a weighted average of the export prices and the constructed export prices of the sales included in the averaging group, and will compare this weighted average to the weighted average of the normal values of such sales.
(2)
Identification of the averaging group.
An averaging group will consist of subject merchandise that is identical or virtually identical in all physical characteristics and that is sold to the United States at the same level of trade. In identifying sales to be included in an averaging group, the Secretary also will take into account,
where appropriate, the region of the United States in which the merchandise is sold, and such other factors as the Secretary considers relevant.
(3)
Time period over which weighted average is calculated.
When applying the average-to-average method in an investigation, the Secretary normally will calculate weighted averages for the entire period of investigation. However, when normal values, export prices, or constructed export prices differ significantly over the course of the period of investigation, the Secretary may calculate weighted averages for such shorter period as the Secretary deems appropriate. When applying the average-to-average method in a review, the Secretary normally will calculate weighted averages on a monthly basis and compare the weighted-average monthly export price or constructed export price to the weighted-average normal value for the contemporaneous month.
(e)
Application of the average-to-transaction method
—In applying the average-to-transaction method in a review, when normal value is based on the weighted average of sales of the foreign like product, the Secretary will limit the averaging of such prices to sales incurred during the contemporaneous month.
(f)
Contemporaneous Month.
Normally, the Secretary will select as the contemporaneous month the first of the following months which applies:
(1) The month during which the particular U.S. sales under consideration were made;
(2) If there are no sales of the foreign like product during this month, the most recent of the three months prior to the month of the U.S. sales in which there was a sale of the foreign like product.
(3) If there are no sales of the foreign like product during any of these months, the earlier of the two months following the month of the U.S. sales in which there was a sale of the foreign like product.
[77 FR 8114, Feb. 14, 2012]
§ 351.415
Conversion of currency.
(a)
In general.
In an antidumping proceeding, the Secretary will convert foreign currencies into United States dollars using the rate of exchange on the date of sale of the subject merchandise.
(b)
Exception.
If the Secretary establishes that a currency transaction on forward markets is directly linked to an export sale under consideration, the Secretary will use the exchange rate specified with respect to such foreign currency in the forward sale agreement to convert the foreign currency.
(c)
Exchange rate fluctuations.
The Secretary will ignore fluctuations in exchange rates.
(d)
Sustained movement in foreign currency value.
In an antidumping investigation, if there is a sustained movement increasing the value of the foreign currency relative to the United States dollar, the Secretary will allow exporters 60 days to adjust their prices to reflect such sustained movement.
§ 351.416
Determination of a particular market situation.
(a)
Particular market situation defined.
A particular market situation is a circumstance or set of circumstances that does the following as determined by the Secretary:
(1) Prevents or does not permit a proper comparison of sales prices in the home market or third country market with export prices and constructed export prices; or
(2) Contributes to the distortion of the cost of materials and fabrication or other processing of any kind, such that the cost of production of merchandise subject to an investigation, suspension agreement, or antidumping order does not accurately reflect the cost of production in the ordinary course of trade.
(b)
Submission requirements when alleging the existence of a particular market situation.
When an interested party submits a timely allegation as to the existence of a particular market situation in an antidumping duty proceeding, relevant information reasonably available to that interested party supporting the claim must accompany the allegation. If the particular market situation being alleged is similar to an allegation of a particular market situation made in a previous or ongoing segment of the same or another proceeding, the interested party must identify the facts and arguments in the submission which are distinguishable
from those provided in the other segment or proceeding.
(c)
A determination that a particular market situation prevented or did not permit a proper comparison of prices existed during the period of investigation or review.
The Secretary may determine that a particular market situation, identified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, existed during the period of investigation or review if a circumstance or set of circumstances prevented or did not permit a proper comparison between sales prices in the home market or third country market of the foreign like product and export prices or constructed export prices of subject merchandise for purposes of an antidumping analysis.
(1)
Examples of particular market situations in the home market that may prevent or do not permit a proper comparison with U.S. price.
Examples of a circumstance or set of circumstances in the home market that may prevent or not permit a proper comparison of prices, and are therefore particular market situations, include, but are not limited to, the following:
(i) The imposition of an export tax on subject merchandise;
(ii) Limitations on exports of subject merchandise from the subject country;
(iii) The issuance and enforcement of anticompetitive regulations that confer a unique status on favored producers or that create barriers to new entrants to an industry; and
(iv) Direct government control over pricing of subject merchandise to such an extent that home market prices for subject merchandise cannot be considered competitively set.
(2)
Examples of particular market situations in a third country market that may prevent or not permit a proper comparison of prices.
In situations where third country prices may be needed to calculate normal value in a dumping calculation, the Secretary may determine that third country prices cannot be properly compared to export prices or constructed export prices for reasons similar to those listed in paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
(3)
The use of constructed value may be warranted if a proper comparison of prices is prevented or not permitted.
If the Secretary determines that a particular market situation prevented or did not permit a proper comparison of sales prices in the home market or third country market with export prices or constructed export prices during the period of investigation or review, the Secretary may conclude that it is necessary to determine normal value by constructing a value in accordance with section 773(e) of the Act and § 351.405.
(d)
A determination that a market situation existed during the period of investigation or review such that the cost of materials and fabrication or other processing of any kind does not accurately reflect the cost of production in the ordinary course of trade
—(1)
In general.
For purposes of this paragraph (d)(1), the Secretary will determine that a market situation, identified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, existed during the period of investigation or review if the Secretary determines the following, based on information on the record:
(i) A circumstance or set of circumstances existed that may have impacted the costs of producing subject merchandise, or costs or prices of inputs into the production of subject merchandise;
(ii) The cost of materials and fabrication or other processing of any kind, including the prices of inputs used to produce subject merchandise, were not in accordance with market principles or distorted, and therefore did not accurately reflect the cost of production of subject merchandise in the ordinary course of trade; and
(iii) The circumstance or set of circumstances at issue contributed to the distortion of the cost of production of subject merchandise.
(2)
The Secretary will determine if it is more likely than not that a circumstance or set of circumstances contributed to distorted costs or prices.
In accordance with paragraph (d)(1)(iii), the Secretary will weigh the information on the record and determine whether it is more likely than not that the circumstance or set of circumstances contributed to the distortion in the cost of production of subject merchandise during the period of investigation or review, and therefore, that a market situation existed during that period.
(3)
Information the Secretary may consider in determining the existence of a market situation.
In determining whether a market situation existed in the subject country such that the cost of materials and fabrication or other processing did not accurately reflect the cost of production of subject merchandise in the ordinary course of trade during the period of investigation or review, the Secretary will consider all relevant information placed on the record by interested parties, including, but not limited to, the following:
(i) Comparisons of prices paid for significant inputs used to produce subject merchandise under the alleged market situation to prices paid for the same input under market-based circumstances, either in the home country or elsewhere;
(ii) Detailed reports and other documentation issued by foreign governments or independent international, analytical, or academic organizations indicating that lower prices for a significant input in the subject country would likely result from governmental or nongovernmental actions or inactions taken in the subject country or other countries;
(iii) Detailed reports and other documentation issued by foreign governments or independent international, analytical, or academic organizations indicating that prices for a significant input have deviated from a fair market value within the subject country, as a result, in part or in whole, of governmental or nongovernmental actions or inactions;
(iv) Agency determinations or results in which the Secretary determined record information did or did not support the existence of the alleged particular market situation with regard to the same or similar merchandise in the subject country in previous proceedings or segments of the same proceeding; and
(v) Information that property (including intellectual property), human rights, labor, or environmental protections in the subject country are weak, ineffective, or nonexistent, those protections exist and are effectively enforced in other countries, and that the ineffective enforcement or lack of protections may contribute to distortions in the cost of production of subject merchandise or prices or costs of a significant input into the production of subject merchandise in the subject country. For purposes of this paragraph (d)(3)(v), the Secretary will normally look to cost effects on same or similar merchandise produced in economically comparable countries in analyzing the impact of such protections on the cost of production.
(4)
No restrictions based on lack of precise quantifiable data, hypothetical prices or actions of governments and industries in other market economies.
In determining whether a market situation exists in the subject country such that the cost of materials and fabrication or other processing do not accurately reflect the cost of production in the ordinary course of trade, the following will not preclude the finding of a market situation:
(i) The lack of precision in the quantifiable data relating to the distortion of prices or costs in the subject country;
(ii) The speculated cost of production of the subject merchandise, or the speculated prices or costs of a significant input into the production of the subject merchandise, unsupported by objective data, that a party claims would hypothetically exist in the subject country absent the alleged particular market situation or its contributing circumstances;
(iii) The actions taken or not taken by governments, government-controlled entities, or other public entities in other market economy countries in comparison with the actions taken or not taken by the government, state enterprise, or other public entity of the subject country, with the exception of information associated with the allegations addressed in paragraph (d)(3)(v) of this section; and
(iv) The existence of the same or similar government or nongovernment actions in the subject country that preceded the period of investigation or review.
(e)
Factors to consider in determining if a market situation is particular
—(1)
In general.
If the Secretary determines that a market situation exists under paragraph (c) or (d), the Secretary
must also determine if the market situation is particular. A market situation is particular if it impacts prices or costs for only certain parties or products in the subject country. In reaching this determination, the following applies:
(i) A particular market situation may exist even if a large number of certain parties or products are impacted by the circumstance or set of circumstances. The Secretary's analysis does not concern the specific number of products or parties, but whether the market situation impacts only certain parties or products, or the general population of parties or products, in the subject country;
(ii) The same or similar market situations can exist in multiple countries or markets and still be considered particular for purposes of this paragraph (e)(1) if the Secretary determines that a market situation exists which distorts sales prices or cost of production for certain parties or products specifically in the subject country; and
(iii) There are varied circumstances in which a market situation in a subject country can be determined to be particular, and a market situation may apply only to certain producers, importers, exporters, purchasers, users, industries, or enterprises, individually or in any combination.
(2)
Information the Secretary may consider in determining if a market situation is particular.
In determining if a market situation in the subject country is particular in accordance with paragraph (e)(1) of this section, the Secretary will consider all relevant information placed on the record by interested parties, including, but not limited to, the following:
(i) The size and nature of the market situation;
(ii) The volume of merchandise potentially impacted by the price or cost distortions resulting from the market situation; and
(iii) The number and nature of the entities potentially affected by the price or cost distortions resulting from a market situation.
(f)
The Secretary may adjust its calculations to address distortions to which a particular market situation under paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section has contributed
—(1)
In general.
If the Secretary determines a particular market situation exists in the subject country which has contributed to a distortion in the cost of materials and fabrication or other processing, such that those costs do not accurately reflect the cost of production of subject merchandise in the ordinary course of trade, in accordance with sections 771(15) and 773(e) of the Act, the Secretary may address such distortions to the cost of production in its calculations.
(2)
Imprecise quantification of the distortions.
If, after consideration of the information on the record, the Secretary is unable to precisely quantify the distortions to the cost of production of subject merchandise in the ordinary course of trade to which the particular market situation has contributed, the Secretary may use any reasonable methodology based on record information to adjust its calculations to address those distortions.
(3)
The Secretary may determine not to adjust its calculations.
If the Secretary determines that a particular market situation exists in the subject country which has contributed to the distortions to the cost of production, but that an adjustment to its calculations of the cost of production of subject merchandise is not appropriate based on record information, the Secretary may determine not to adjust its calculations. In determining whether an adjustment is appropriate, the Secretary may consider the following:
(i) Whether the cost distortion is already sufficiently addressed in its calculations in accordance with another statutory provision, such as the transaction disregarded and major input rules of sections 773(f)(2) and (3) of the Act;
(ii) Whether a reasonable method for quantifying an adjustment to the calculations is absent from the record; and
(iii) Whether information on the record suggests that the application of an adjustment to the Secretary's calculations would otherwise be unreasonable.
(g)
Examples of particular market situations which contribute to distortions in the cost of materials and fabrication or other processing of any kind, such that
those costs do not accurately reflect the cost of production in the ordinary course of trade.
Examples of particular market situations which may contribute to the distortion of the cost of production of subject merchandise in the subject country, alone or in conjunction with others, include, but are not limited to, the following:
(1) A significant input into the production of subject merchandise is produced in such amounts that there is considerably more supply than demand in international markets for the input and the Secretary concludes, based on record information, that regardless of the impact of such overcapacity of the significant input on other countries, such overcapacity contributed to distortions of the price or cost of that input in the subject country during the period of investigation or review;
(2) A government, government-controlled entity, or other public entity in the subject country owns or controls the predominant producer or supplier of a significant input used in the production of subject merchandise and the Secretary concludes, based on record information, that such ownership or control of the producer or supplier contributed to price or cost distortions of that input in the subject country during the period of investigation or review;
(3) A government, government-controlled entity, or other public entity in the subject country intervenes in the market for a significant input into the production of subject merchandise and the Secretary concludes, based on record information, such that the intervention contributed to price or cost distortions of that input in the subject country during the period of investigation or review;
(4) A government in the subject country limits exports of a significant input into the production of subject merchandise and the Secretary concludes, based on record information, that such export limitations contributed to price or cost distortions of that input in the subject country during the period of investigation or review;
(5) A government in the subject country imposes export taxes on a significant input into the production of subject merchandise and the Secretary concludes, based on record information, that such taxes contributed to price or cost distortions of that input in the subject country during the period of investigation or review;
(6) A government in the subject country exempts an importer, producer, or exporter of subject merchandise from paying duties or taxes associated with trade remedies established by the government relating to a significant input into the production of subject merchandise during the period of investigation or review;
(7) A government in the subject country rebates duties or taxes paid by an importer, producer or exporter of subject merchandise associated with trade remedies established by the government related to a significant input into the production of subject merchandise during the period of investigation or review;
(8) A government, government-controlled entity, or other public entity in the subject country provides financial assistance or other support to the producer or exporter of subject merchandise, or to a producer or supplier of a significant input into the production of subject merchandise and the Secretary concludes, based on record information, that such assistance or support contributed to cost distortions of subject merchandise or distortions in the price or cost of a significant input into the production of subject merchandise in the subject country during the period of investigation or review;
(9) A government, government-controlled entity, or other public entity in the subject country mandates, through law or in practice, the use of a certain percentage of domestic-manufactured inputs, the sharing or use of certain intellectual property or production processes, or the formation of certain business relationships with other entities to produce subject merchandise or a significant input into the production of subject merchandise and the Secretary concludes, based on record information, that those requirements contributed to cost distortions of subject merchandise or distortions in the price or cost of a significant input into the production of subject merchandise in the subject country during the period of investigation or review;
(10) A government, government-controlled entity, or other public entity in the subject country does not enforce its property (including intellectual property), human rights, labor, or environmental protection laws and policies, or those laws and policies are otherwise shown to be ineffective with respect to either a producer or exporter of subject merchandise, or to a producer or supplier of a significant input into the production of subject merchandise in the subject country and the Secretary concludes, based on record information, that the lack of enforcement or effectiveness of such laws and policies contributed to cost distortions of subject merchandise or distortions in the price or cost of a significant input into the production of subject merchandise during the period of investigation or review;
(11) A government, government-controlled entity, or other public entity in the subject country does not implement property (including intellectual property), human rights, labor, or environmental protection laws and policies and the Secretary concludes, based on record information, that the absence of such laws and policies contributed to cost distortions of subject merchandise, or distortions in the price or cost of a significant input into the production of subject merchandise in the subject country during the period of investigation or review; and
(12) Nongovernmental entities take actions which the Secretary concludes, based on record information, contributed to cost distortions of subject merchandise or distortions in the price or cost of a significant input into the production of subject merchandise in the subject country during the period of investigation or review. Actions that result in distortive prices and costs by nongovernmental entities covered by this example include, but are not limited to, the formation of business relationships between one or more producers of subject merchandise and suppliers of significant inputs to the production of subject merchandise, including mutually-beneficial strategic alliances or noncompetitive arrangements, as well as sales by third-country exporters of significant inputs into the subject country for prices for less than fair value.
(h)
A particular market situation which contributes to distortions in the cost of materials and fabrication or other processing of any kind, such that the costs do not accurately reflect the cost of production in the ordinary course of trade, may also contribute to a particular market situation that prevents or does not permit a proper comparison of prices.
If the Secretary determines that a particular market situation existed during the period of investigation or review such that the cost of materials and fabrication or other processing of any kind did not accurately reflect the cost of production of subject merchandise in the ordinary course of trade, the Secretary may consider, based on record information, whether that particular market situation also contributed to the circumstance or set of circumstances that prevented, or did not permit, a proper comparison of home market or third country sales prices with export prices or constructed export prices, in accordance with section 771(15)(C) of the Act.

# Subpart E—Identification and Measurement of Countervailable Subsidies

# Source:
63 FR 65407, Nov. 25, 1998, unless otherwise noted.
§ 351.501
Scope.
The provisions of this subpart E set forth rules regarding the identification and measurement of countervailable subsidies. Where this subpart E does not expressly deal with a particular type of alleged subsidy, the Secretary will identify and measure the subsidy, if any, in accordance with the underlying principles of the Act and this subpart E.
§ 351.502
Specificity of domestic subsidies.
(a)
Sequential analysis.
In determining whether a subsidy is
de facto
specific, the Secretary will examine the factors contained in section 771(5A)(D)(iii) of the Act sequentially in order of their appearance. If a single factor warrants
a finding of specificity, the Secretary will not undertake further analysis.
(b)
Characteristics of a “group.”
In determining whether a subsidy is being provided to a “group” of enterprises or industries within the meaning of section 751(5A)(D) of the Act, the Secretary is not required to determine whether there are shared characteristics among the enterprises or industries that are eligible for, or actually receive, a subsidy.
(c)
Traded goods sector.
In determining whether a subsidy is being provided to a “group” of enterprises or industries within the meaning of section 771(5A)(D) of the Act, the Secretary normally will consider enterprises that buy or sell goods internationally to comprise such a group.
(d)
Disaster relief.
The Secretary will not regard disaster relief including pandemic relief as being specific under section 771(5A)(D) of the Act if such relief constitutes general assistance available to anyone in the area affected by the disaster.
(e)
Employment assistance.
The Secretary will not regard employment assistance programs as being specific under section 771(5A)(D) if such assistance is provided solely with respect to employment of general categories of workers such as those based on age, gender, disability, long-term unemployment, veteran, rural or urban status and is available to everyone hired within those categories without any industry or enterprise restrictions.
[63 FR 65407, Nov. 25, 1998, as amended at 85 FR 6043, Feb. 4, 2020; 89 FR 101765, Dec. 16, 2024]
§ 351.503
Benefit.
(a)
Specific rules.
In the case of a government program for which a specific rule for the measurement of a benefit is contained in this subpart E, the Secretary will measure the extent to which a financial contribution (or income or price support) confers a benefit as provided in that rule. For example, § 351.504(a) prescribes the specific rule for measurement of the benefit of grants.
(b)
Other subsidies
—(1)
In general.
For other government programs, the Secretary normally will consider a benefit to be conferred where a firm pays less for its inputs (
e.g.,
money, a good, or a service) than it otherwise would pay in the absence of the government program, or receives more revenues than it otherwise would earn.
(2)
Exception.
Paragraph (b)(1) of this section is not intended to limit the ability of the Secretary to impose countervailing duties when the facts of a particular case establish that a financial contribution (or income or price support) has conferred a benefit, even if that benefit does not take the form of a reduction in input costs or an enhancement of revenues. When paragraph (b)(1) of this section is not applicable, the Secretary will determine whether a benefit is conferred by examining whether the alleged program or practice has common or similar elements to the four illustrative examples in sections 771(5)(E)(i) through (iv) of the Act.
(3)
Contingent liabilities and assets.
For the provision of a contingent liability or asset not otherwise addressed under a specific rule identified under paragraph (a) of this section, the Secretary will treat the balance or value of the contingent liability or assets as an interest-free provision of funds and will calculate the benefit using, where appropriate, either a short-term or long-term commercial interest rate.
(c)
Distinction from effect of subsidy
—(1)
In general.
In determining whether a benefit is conferred, the Secretary is not required to consider the effect or impact of the government action on the firm's performance, including its costs, prices, output, or whether the firm's behavior is otherwise altered.
(2)
Subsidy provided to support compliance with a government-imposed mandate.
When a government provides assistance to a firm to comply with a government regulation, requirement or obligation, the Secretary, in measuring the benefit from the subsidy, will not consider whether the firm incurred a cost in complying with the government-imposed regulation, requirement, or obligation.
(d)
Varying financial contribution levels
—(1)
In general.
Where a government program provides varying levels of financial contributions based on different eligibility criteria, and one or
more of such levels is not specific within the meaning of § 351.502, a benefit is conferred to the extent that a firm receives a greater financial contribution than the financial contributions provided at a non-specific level under the program. The preceding sentence shall apply only to the extent the Secretary determines that the varying levels of financial contributions are set forth in a statute, decree, regulation, or other official act; that the levels are clearly delineated and identifiable; and that the firm would have been eligible for the non-specific level of contributions.
(2)
Exception.
Paragraph (d)(1) of this section shall not apply where the statute specifies a commercial test for determining the benefit.
(e)
Tax consequences.
In calculating the amount of a benefit, the Secretary will not consider the tax consequences of the benefit.
[63 FR 65407, Nov. 25, 1998, as amended at 89 FR 20840, Mar. 25, 2024; 89 FR 101765, Dec. 16, 2024]
§ 351.504
Grants.
(a)
Benefit.
In the case of a grant, a benefit exists in the amount of the grant.
(b)
Time of receipt of benefit.
In the case of a grant, the Secretary normally will consider a benefit as having been received on the date on which the firm received the grant.
(c)
Allocation of a grant to a particular time period.
The Secretary will allocate the benefit from a grant to a particular time period in accordance with § 351.524.
§ 351.505
Loans.
(a)
Benefit
—(1)
In general.
In the case of a loan, a benefit exists to the extent that the amount a firm pays on the government-provided loan is less than the amount the firm would pay on a comparable commercial loan(s) that the firm could actually obtain on the market.
See
section 771(5)(E)(ii) of the Act. In making the comparison called for in the preceding sentence, the Secretary normally will rely on effective interest rates.
(2)
“Comparable commercial loan” defined
—(i)
“Comparable” defined.
In selecting a loan that is “comparable” to the government-provided loan, the Secretary normally will place primary emphasis on similarities in the structure of the loans (
e.g.,
fixed interest rate v. variable interest rate), the maturity of the loans (
e.g.,
short-term v. long-term), and the currency in which the loans are denominated.
(ii)
“Commercial” defined.
In selecting a “commercial” loan, the Secretary normally will use a loan taken out by the firm from a commercial lending institution or a debt instrument issued by the firm in a commercial market. Also, the Secretary will treat a loan from a government-owned bank as a commercial loan, unless there is evidence that the loan from a government-owned bank is provided on non-commercial terms or at the direction of the government. However, the Secretary will not consider a loan provided under a government program, or a loan provided by a government-owned special purpose bank, to be a commercial loan for purposes of selecting a loan to compare with a government-provided loan.
(iii)
Long-term loans.
In selecting a comparable loan, if the government-provided loan is a long-term loan, the Secretary normally will use a loan the terms of which were established during, or immediately before, the year in which the terms of the government-provided loan were established.
(iv)
Short-term loans.
In making the comparison required under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, if the government-provided loan is a short-term loan, the Secretary normally will use an annual average of the interest rates on comparable commercial loans during the year in which the government-provided loan was taken out, weighted by the principal amount of each loan. However, if the Secretary finds that interest rates fluctuated significantly during the period of investigation or review, the Secretary will use the most appropriate interest rate based on the circumstances presented.
(3)
“Could actually obtain on the market” defined
—(i)
In general.
In selecting a comparable commercial loan that the recipient “could actually obtain on the market,” the Secretary normally will rely on the actual experience of the
firm in question in obtaining comparable commercial loans for both short-term and long-term loans.
(ii)
Where the firm has no comparable commercial loans.
If the firm did not take out any comparable commercial loans during the period referred to in paragraph (a)(2)(iii) or (a)(2)(iv) of this section, the Secretary may use a national average interest rate for comparable commercial loans.
(iii)
Exception for uncreditworthy companies.
If the Secretary finds that a firm that received a government-provided long-term loan was uncreditworthy, as defined in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, the Secretary normally will calculate the interest rate to be used in making the comparison called for by paragraph (a)(1) of this section according to the following formula:
i
b
= [(1 − q
n
)(1 + i
f
)
n
/ (1 − p
n
)]
1/n
− 1,
where:
n = the term of the loan;
i
b
= the benchmark interest rate for uncreditworthy companies;
i
f
= the long-term interest rate that would be paid by a creditworthy company;
p
n
= the probability of default by an uncreditworthy company within n years; and
q
n
= the probability of default by a creditworthy company within n years.
“Default” means any missed or delayed payment of interest and/or principal, bankruptcy, receivership, or distressed exchange. For values of p
n
, the Secretary will normally rely on the average cumulative default rates reported for the Caa to C-rated category of companies in Moody's study of historical default rates of corporate bond issuers. For values of q
n
, the Secretary will normally rely on the average cumulative default rates reported for the Aaa to Baa-rated categories of companies in Moody's study of historical default rates of corporate bond issuers.
(4)
Uncreditworthiness
—(i)
In general.
The Secretary will consider a firm to be uncreditworthy if the Secretary determines that, based on information available at the time of the government-provided loan, the firm could not have obtained long-term loans from conventional commercial sources. The Secretary will determine uncreditworthiness on a case-by-case basis, and may, in appropriate circumstances, focus its creditworthiness analysis on the project being financed rather than the company as a whole. In making the creditworthiness determination, the Secretary may examine, among other factors, the following:
(A) The receipt by the firm of comparable commercial long-term loans;
(B) The present and past financial health of the firm, as reflected in various financial indicators calculated from the firm's financial statements and accounts;
(C) The firm's recent past and present ability to meet its costs and fixed financial obligations with its cash flow; and
(D) Evidence of the firm's future financial position, such as market studies, country and industry economic forecasts, and project and loan appraisals prepared prior to the agreement between the lender and the firm on the terms of the loan.
(ii)
Significance of long-term commercial loans.
In the case of firms not owned by the government, the receipt by the firm of comparable long-term commercial loans, unaccompanied by a government-provided guarantee, will normally constitute dispositive evidence that the firm is not uncreditworthy.
(iii)
Significance of prior subsidies.
In determining whether a firm is uncreditworthy, the Secretary will ignore current and prior subsidies received by the firm.
(iv)
Discount rate.
When the creditworthiness of a firm is considered in connection with the allocation of non-recurring benefits, the Secretary will rely on information available in the year in which the government agreed to provide the subsidy conferring a non-recurring benefit.
(5)
Long-term variable rate loans
—(i)
In general.
In the case of a long-term variable rate loan, the Secretary normally will make the comparison called for by paragraph (a)(1) of this section by relying on a comparable commercial loan with a variable interest rate. The Secretary then will compare the variable interest rates on the comparable commercial loan and the government-provided loan for the year in which the terms of the government-provided loan
were established. If the comparison shows that the interest rate on the government-provided loan was equal to or higher than the interest rate on the comparable commercial loan, the Secretary will not consider the government-provided loan as having conferred a benefit. If the comparison shows that the interest rate on the government-provided loan was lower, the Secretary will consider the government-provided loan as having conferred a benefit, and, if the other criteria for a countervailable subsidy are satisfied, will calculate the amount of the benefit in accordance with paragraph (c)(4) of this section.
(ii)
Exception.
If the Secretary is unable to make the comparison described in paragraph (a)(5)(i) of this section or if the comparison described in paragraph (a)(5)(i) of this section would yield an inaccurate measure of the benefit, the Secretary may modify the method described in paragraph (a)(5)(i) of this section.
(6)
Allegations
—(i)
Allegation of uncreditworthiness required.
Normally, the Secretary will not consider the uncreditworthiness of a firm absent a specific allegation by the petitioner that is supported by information establishing a reasonable basis to believe or suspect that the firm is uncreditworthy.
(ii)
Government-owned banks.
The Secretary will not investigate a loan provided by a government-owned bank absent a specific allegation that is supported by information reasonably available to petitioners indicating that:
(A) The loan meets the specificity criteria in accordance with section 771(5A) of the Act; and
(B) A benefit exists within the meaning of paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
(iii)
Initiation standard for government-owned policy banks.
An interested party will normally meet the initiation threshold for specificity under paragraph (a)(6)(ii)(A) of this section with respect to section 771(5A)(D) of the Act if the party can sufficiently allege that the government-owned policy bank provides loans pursuant to government policies or directives and loan distribution information for the bank is not reasonably available. A policy bank is a government-owned special purpose bank.
(b)
Time of receipt of benefit.
The Secretary normally will consider a benefit as having been received in the year in which the firm otherwise would have had to make a payment on the comparable commercial loan.
(c)
Allocation of benefit to a particular time period
—(1)
Short-term loans.
The Secretary will allocate (expense) the benefit from a short-term loan to the year(s) in which the firm is due to make interest payments on the loan.
(2)
Long-term loans.
The Secretary normally will calculate the subsidy amount to be assigned to a particular year by calculating the difference in interest payments for that year,
i.e.,
the difference between the interest paid by the firm in that year on the government-provided loan and the interest the firm would have paid on the comparable commercial benchmark loan.
(d)
Treatment of outstanding loans as grant after three years of no payments of interest or principal.
With the exception of debt forgiveness tied to a particular loan and contingent liability interest-free loans, addressed in § 351.508 and paragraph (e) of this section, the Secretary will normally treat a loan as a grant if no payments on the loan have been made in three years unless the loan recipient can demonstrate that nonpayment is consistent with the terms of a comparable commercial loan it could obtain on the market, or the payments on the loan are consistent with the terms of the loan contract.
(e)
Contingent liability interest-free loans
—(1)
Treatment as loans.
In the case of an interest-free loan for which the repayment obligation is contingent upon the company taking some future action or achieving some goal in fulfillment of the loan's requirements, the Secretary normally will treat any balance on the loan outstanding during a year as an interest-free, short-term loan in accordance with paragraphs (a), (b), and (c)(1) of this section. However, if the event upon which repayment of the loan depends will occur at a point in time more than one year after the receipt of the contingent liability loan,
the Secretary will use a long-term interest rate as the benchmark in accordance with paragraphs (a), (b), and (c)(2) of this section.
(2)
Treatment as grants.
If at any point in time the Secretary determines that the event upon which repayment depends is not a viable contingency or the loan recipient has met the contingent action or goal and the government has not taken meaningful action to collect repayment, the Secretary will treat the outstanding balance of the loan as a grant received in the year in which this condition manifests itself.
[63 FR 65407, Nov. 25, 1998, as amended at 89 FR 20840, Mar. 25, 2024; 89 FR 101765, Dec. 16, 2024]
§ 351.506
Loan guarantees.
(a)
Benefit
—(1)
In general.
In the case of a loan guarantee, a benefit exists to the extent that the total amount a firm pays for the loan with the government-provided guarantee is less than the total amount the firm would pay for a comparable commercial loan that the firm could actually obtain on the market absent the government-provided guarantee, including any difference in guarantee fees.
See
section 771(5)(E)(iii) of the Act. The Secretary will select a comparable commercial loan in accordance with § 351.505(a).
(2)
Government acting as owner.
In situations where a government, acting as the owner of a firm, provides a loan guarantee to that firm, the guarantee does not confer a benefit if the respondent provides evidence demonstrating that it is normal commercial practice in the country in question for shareholders to provide guarantees to their firms under similar circumstances and on comparable terms.
(b)
Time of receipt of benefit.
In the case of a loan guarantee, the Secretary normally will consider a benefit as having been received in the year in which the firm otherwise would have had to make a payment on the comparable commercial loan.
(c)
Allocation of benefit to a particular time period.
In allocating the benefit from a government-provided loan guarantee to a particular time period, the Secretary will use the methods set forth in § 351.505(c) regarding loans.
§ 351.507
Equity.
(a)
Benefit
—(1)
In general.
In the case of a government-provided equity infusion, a benefit exists to the extent that the investment decision is inconsistent with the usual investment practice of private investors, including the practice regarding the provision of risk capital, in the country in which the equity infusion is made.
See
section 771(5)(E)(i) of the Act.
(2)
Private investor prices available
—(i)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section, the Secretary will consider an equity infusion as being inconsistent with usual investment practice (
see
paragraph (a)(1) of this section) if the price paid by the government for newly issued shares is greater than the price paid by private investors for the same (or similar form of) newly issued shares.
(ii)
Timing of private investor prices.
In selecting a private investor price under paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section, the Secretary will rely on sales of newly issued shares made reasonably concurrently with the newly issued shares purchased by the government.
(iii)
Significant private sector participation required.
The Secretary will not use private investor prices under paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section if the Secretary concludes that private investor purchases of newly issued shares are not significant.
(iv)
Adjustments for “similar” form of equity.
Where the Secretary uses private investor prices for a form of shares that is similar to the newly issued shares purchased by the government (
see
paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section), the Secretary, where appropriate, will adjust the prices to reflect the differences in the forms of shares.
(3)
Actual private investor prices unavailable
—(i)
In general.
If actual private investor prices are not available under paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the Secretary will determine whether the firm funded by the government-provided equity was equityworthy or unequityworthy at the time of the equity infusion (
see
paragraph (a)(4) of this section). If the Secretary determines that the firm was equityworthy, the Secretary will apply paragraph (a)(5) of this section to determine
whether the equity infusion was inconsistent with the usual investment practice of private investors. A determination by the Secretary that the firm was unequityworthy will constitute a determination that the equity infusion was inconsistent with usual investment practice of private investors, and the Secretary will apply paragraph (a)(6) of this section to measure the benefit attributable to the equity infusion.
(4)
Equityworthiness
—(i)
In general.
The Secretary will consider a firm to have been equityworthy if the Secretary determines that, from the perspective of a reasonable private investor examining the firm at the time the government-provided equity infusion was made, the firm showed an ability to generate a reasonable rate of return within a reasonable period of time. The Secretary may, in appropriate circumstances, focus its equityworthiness analysis on a project rather than the company as a whole. In making the equityworthiness determination, the Secretary may examine the following factors, among others:
(A) Objective analyses of the future financial prospects of the recipient firm or the project as indicated by,
inter alia,
market studies, economic forecasts, and project or loan appraisals prepared prior to the government-provided equity infusion in question;
(B) Current and past indicators of the recipient firm's financial health calculated from the firm's statements and accounts, adjusted, if appropriate, to conform to generally accepted accounting principles;
(C) Rates of return on equity in the three years prior to the government equity infusion; and
(D) Equity investment in the firm by private investors.
(ii)
Significance of a pre-infusion objective analysis.
For purposes of making an equityworthiness determination, the Secretary will request and normally require from the respondents the information and analysis completed prior to the infusion, upon which the government based its decision to provide the equity infusion (
see,
paragraph (a)(4)(i)(A) of this section). Absent the existence or provision of an objective analysis, containing information typically examined by potential private investors considering an equity investment, the Secretary will normally determine that the equity infusion received provides a countervailable benefit within the meaning of paragraph (a)(1) of this section. The Secretary will not necessarily make such a determination if the absence of an objective analysis is consistent with the actions of reasonable private investors in the country in question.
(iii)
Significance of prior subsidies.
In determining whether a firm was equityworthy, the Secretary will ignore current and prior subsidies received by the firm.
(5)
Benefit where firm is equityworthy.
If the Secretary determines that the firm or project was equityworthy (
see
paragraph (a)(4) of this section), the Secretary will examine the terms and the nature of the equity purchased to determine whether the investment was otherwise inconsistent with the usual investment practice of private investors. If the Secretary determines that the investment was inconsistent with usual private investment practice, the Secretary will determine the amount of the benefit conferred on a case-by-case basis.
(6)
Benefit where firm is unequityworthy.
If the Secretary determines that the firm or project was unequityworthy (
see
paragraph (a)(4) of this section), a benefit to the firm exists in the amount of the equity infusion.
(7)
Allegations.
The Secretary will not investigate an equity infusion in a firm absent a specific allegation by the petitioner which is supported by information establishing a reasonable basis to believe or suspect that the firm received an equity infusion that provides a countervailable benefit within the meaning of paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
(b)
Time of receipt of benefit.
In the case of a government-provided equity infusion, the Secretary normally will consider the benefit to have been received on the date on which the firm received the equity infusion.
(c)
Outside investor standard.
Any analysis made under paragraph (a) of this section will be based upon the
standard of a new outside private investor. The Secretary normally will consider whether an outside private investor, under its usual investment practice, would make an equity investment in the firm, and not whether a private investor who has already invested in the firm would continue to invest in the firm.
(d)
Allocation of benefit to a particular time period.
The benefit conferred by an equity infusion shall be allocated over a period of 12 years or the same time period as a non-recurring subsidy under § 351.524(d), whichever is longer.

§ 351.508
Debt forgiveness.
(a)
Benefit.
In the case of an assumption or forgiveness of a firm's debt obligation, a benefit exists equal to the amount of the principal and/or interest (including accrued, unpaid interest) that the government has assumed or forgiven. In situations where the entity assuming or forgiving the debt receives shares in a firm in return for eliminating or reducing the firm's debt obligation, the Secretary will determine the existence of a benefit under § 351.507 (equity infusions).
(b)
Time of receipt of benefit.
In the case of a debt or interest assumption or forgiveness, the Secretary normally will consider the benefit as having been received as of the date on which the debt or interest was assumed or forgiven.

(2)
Exception.
Where an interest assumption is tied to a particular loan and where a firm can reasonably expect to receive the interest assumption at the time it applies for the loan, the Secretary will normally treat the interest assumption as a reduced-interest loan and allocate the benefit to a particular year in accordance with § 351.505(c) (loans).

Exemption or remission of taxes.
In the case of a program that provides for a full or partial exemption or remission of a direct tax (for example, an income tax), or a reduction in the base used to calculate a direct tax, a benefit exists to the extent that the tax paid by a firm as a result of the program is less than the tax the firm would have paid in the absence of the program, including as a result of being located in an area designated by the government as being outside the customs territory of the country.
(2)
Deferral of taxes.
In the case of a program that provides for a deferral of direct taxes, a benefit exists to the extent that appropriate interest charges are not collected. Normally, a deferral of direct taxes will be treated as a government-provided loan in the amount of the tax deferred, according to the methodology described in § 351.505. The Secretary will use a short-term interest rate as the benchmark for tax deferrals of one year or less. The Secretary will use a long-term interest rate as the benchmark for tax deferrals of more than one year.
(b)
Time of receipt of benefit
—(1)
Exemption or remission of taxes.
In the case of a full or partial exemption or remission of a direct tax, the Secretary normally will consider the benefit as having been received on the date on which the recipient firm would otherwise have had to pay the taxes associated with the exemption or remission.

(2)
Deferral of taxes.
In the case of a tax deferral of one year or less, the Secretary normally will consider the benefit as having been received on the date on which the deferred tax becomes due. In the case of a multi-year deferral, the Secretary normally will consider the benefit as having been received on the anniversary date(s) of the deferral.

Allocation of benefit to a particular time period.
The Secretary normally
will allocate (expense) the benefit of a full or partial exemption, remission, or deferral of a direct tax to the year in which the benefit is considered to have been received under paragraph (b) of this section.
(d)
Benefit not tied to particular markets or products.
If a program provides for a full or partial exemption, reduction, credit, or remission of an income tax, the Secretary normally will consider any benefit to be not tied with respect to a particular market under § 351.525(b)(4) or to a particular product under § 351.525(b)(5).

§ 351.511
Provision of goods or services.
(a)
Benefit
—(1)
In general.
In the case where goods or services are provided, a benefit exists to the extent that such goods or services are provided for less than adequate remuneration.
See
section 771(5)(E)(iv) of the Act.
(2) “
Adequate Remuneration” defined
—(i)
In general.
The Secretary will normally seek to measure the adequacy of remuneration by comparing the government price to a market-determined price for the good or service resulting from actual transactions in the country in question. Such a price could include prices stemming from actual transactions between private parties or actual imports. In choosing such transactions or sales, the Secretary will consider product similarity; quantities sold or imported; and other factors affecting comparability.
(ii)
Actual market-determined price unavailable.
If there is no useable market-determined price with which to make the comparison under paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section, the Secretary will seek to measure the adequacy of remuneration by comparing the government price to a world market price where it is reasonable to conclude that such price would be available to purchasers in the country in question.
Where there is more than one commercially available world market price, the Secretary will average such prices to the extent practicable, making due allowance for factors affecting comparability.
(iii)
World market price unavailable.
If there is no world market price available to purchasers in the country in question, the Secretary will normally measure the adequacy of remuneration by assessing whether the government price is consistent with market principles. In making an assessment of whether a government price is consistent with market principles under this provision, the Secretary may assess such factors as costs (including rates of return sufficient to ensure future operations), the government's price setting methodology, possible price discrimination, or a government price derived from actual sales from competitively run government auctions if the government auction:
(A) Uses competitive bid procedures that are open without restriction on the use of the good or service;
(B) Is open without restriction to all bidders, including foreign enterprises, and protects the confidentiality of the bidders;
(C) Accounts for the substantial majority of the actual government provision of the good or service in the jurisdiction in question; and
(D) Determines the winner based solely on price.
(iv)
Use of delivered prices.
In measuring adequate remuneration under paragraph (a)(2)(i) or (a)(2)(ii) of this section, the Secretary will adjust the comparison price to reflect the price that a firm actually paid or would pay if it imported the product. This adjustment will include delivery charges and import duties.
(v)
Exclusion of certain prices.
In measuring the adequacy of remuneration under this section, the Secretary may exclude certain prices from its analysis if interested parties have demonstrated, with sufficient information, that those prices are derived from countries with weak, ineffective, or nonexistent property (including intellectual property), human rights, labor, or environmental protections, and that the lack of such protections would likely impact such prices.
(b)
Time of receipt of benefit.
In the case of the provision of a good or service, the Secretary normally will consider a benefit as having been received as of the date on which the firm pays or, in the absence of payment, was due to pay for the government-provided good or service.
(c)
Allocation of benefit to a particular time period.
In the case of the provision of a good or service, the Secretary will normally allocate (expense) the benefit to the year in which the benefit is considered to have been received under paragraph (b) of this section. In the case of the provision of infrastructure, the Secretary will normally treat the benefit as non-recurring and will allocate the benefit to a particular year in accordance with § 351.524(d).
(d)
Exception for general infrastructure.
A financial contribution does not exist in the case of the government provision of general infrastructure. General infrastructure is defined as infrastructure that is created for the broad societal welfare of a country, region, state or municipality.
[63 FR 65407, Nov. 25, 1998, as amended at 89 FR 20841, Mar. 25, 2024; 89 FR 101766, Dec. 16, 2024]

In general.
In the case where goods are purchased by the government from a firm, in accordance with section 771(5)(E)(iv) of the Act a benefit exists to the extent that such goods are purchased for more than adequate remuneration.
(2)
Adequate remuneration defined
—(i)
In general.
The Secretary will normally seek to measure the adequacy of remuneration by comparing the price paid to the firm for the good by the government to a market-determined price for the good based on actual transactions, including imports, between private parties in the country in question, but if such prices are not available, then to a world market price or prices for the good.
(ii)
Actual market-determined prices unavailable.
If there are no market-determined domestic or world market prices available, the Secretary may measure
the adequacy of remuneration by analyzing any premium in the request for bid or government procurement regulations provided to domestic suppliers of the good or use any other methodology to assess whether the price paid to the firm for the good by the government is consistent with market principles.
(iii)
Exclusion of certain prices.
In measuring the adequacy of remuneration under this section, the Secretary may exclude certain prices from a particular country from its analysis if the Secretary determines that interested parties have demonstrated, with sufficient information, that certain actions, including government laws or policies, such as price or production mandates or controls, likely impact such prices.
(iv)
Use of ex-factory or ex-works price.
In measuring adequate remuneration under paragraph (a)(2)(i) or (ii) of this section, the Secretary will use an ex-factory or ex-works comparison price and price paid to the firm for the good by the government in order to measure the benefit conferred to the recipient within the meaning of section 771(5)(E) of the Act. The Secretary will, if necessary, adjust the comparison price and the price paid to the firm by the government to remove all delivery charges, import duties, and taxes to derive an ex-factory or ex-works price.
(3)
Exception when the government is both a provider and purchaser of the good.
When the government is both a provider and a purchaser of the good, such as electricity, the Secretary will normally measure the benefit to the recipient firm by comparing the price at which the government provided the good to the price at which the government purchased the same good from the firm.
(b)
Time of receipt of benefit.
In the case of the purchase of a good, the Secretary normally will consider a benefit as having been received as of the date on which the firm receives payment for the purchased good.
(c)
Allocation of benefit to a particular time period.
In the case of the purchase of a good, the Secretary will normally allocate (expense) the benefit to the year in which the benefit is considered to have been received under paragraph (b) of this section. However, if the Secretary considers this purchase to be for or tied to capital assets such as land, buildings, or capital equipment, the benefit will normally be allocated over time as defined in § 351.524(d)(2).

Normally, the Secretary will allocate (expense) the benefit from assistance provided to workers to the year in which the benefit is considered to have been received under paragraph (b) of this section.
§ 351.514
Export subsidies.
(a)
In general.
The Secretary will consider a subsidy to be an export subsidy if the Secretary determines that eligibility for, approval of, or the amount of, a subsidy is contingent upon export performance. In applying this section, the Secretary will consider a subsidy to be contingent upon export performance if the provision of the subsidy is, in law or in fact, tied to actual or anticipated exportation or export earnings, alone or as one of two or more conditions.
(b)
Exception.
In the case of export promotion activities of a government, a benefit does not exist if the Secretary determines that the activities consist of general informational activities that do not promote particular products over others.
§ 351.515
Internal transport and freight charges for export shipments.
(a)
Benefit
—(1)
In general.
In the case of internal transport and freight charges on export shipments, a benefit exists to the extent that the charges paid by a firm for transport or freight with respect to goods destined for export are less than what the firm would
have paid if the goods were destined for domestic consumption. The Secretary will consider the amount of the benefit to equal the difference in amounts paid.
(2)
Exception.
For purposes of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, a benefit does not exist if the Secretary determines that:
(i) Any difference in charges is the result of an arm's-length transaction between the supplier and the user of the transport or freight service; or
(ii) The difference in charges is commercially justified.
(b)
Time of receipt of benefit.
In the case of internal transport and freight charges for export shipments, the Secretary normally will consider the benefit as having been received by the firm on the date on which the firm paid, or in the absence of payment was due to pay, the charges.
(c)
Allocation of benefit to a particular time period.
Normally, the Secretary will allocate (expense) the benefit from internal transport and freight charges for export shipments to the year in which the benefit is considered to have been received under paragraph (b) of this section.
§ 351.516
Price preferences for inputs used in the production of goods for export.
(a)
Benefit
—(1)
In general.
In the case of a program involving the provision by governments or their agencies, either directly or indirectly through government-mandated schemes, of imported or domestic products or services for use in the production of exported goods, a benefit exists to the extent that the Secretary determines that the terms or conditions on which the products or services are provided are more favorable than the terms or conditions applicable to the provision of like or directly competitive products or services for use in the production of goods for domestic consumption unless, in the case of products, such terms or conditions are not more favorable than those commercially available on world markets to exporters.
(2)
Amount of benefit.
In the case of products provided under such schemes, the Secretary will determine the amount of the benefit by comparing the price of products used in the production of exported goods to the commercially available world market price of such products, inclusive of delivery charges.

(a)
Benefit
—(1)
Exemption of prior-stage cumulative indirect taxes.
In the case of a program that provides for the
exemption of prior-stage cumulative indirect taxes on inputs used in the production of an exported product, a benefit exists to the extent that the exemption extends to inputs that are not consumed in the production of the exported product, making normal allowance for waste, or if the exemption covers taxes other than indirect taxes that are imposed on the input. If the Secretary determines that the exemption of prior-stage cumulative indirect taxes confers a benefit, the Secretary normally will consider the amount of the benefit to be the prior-stage cumulative indirect taxes that otherwise would have been paid on the inputs not consumed in the production of the exported product, making normal allowance for waste, and the amount of charges other than import charges covered by the exemption.
(2)
Remission of prior-stage cumulative indirect taxes.
In the case of a program that provides for the remission of prior-stage cumulative indirect taxes on inputs used in the production of an exported product, a benefit exists to the extent that the amount remitted exceeds the amount of prior-stage cumulative indirect taxes paid on inputs that are consumed in the production of the exported product, making normal allowance for waste.

In the case of a program that provides for a deferral of prior-stage cumulative indirect taxes on an exported product, a benefit exists to the extent that the deferral extends to inputs that are not consumed in the production of the exported product, making normal allowance for waste, and the government does not charge appropriate interest on the taxes deferred. If the Secretary determines that a benefit exists, the Secretary will normally treat the deferral as a government-provided loan in the amount of the tax deferred, according to the methodology described in § 351.505. The Secretary will use a short-term interest rate as the benchmark for tax deferrals of one year or less. The Secretary will use a long-term interest rate as the benchmark for tax deferrals of more than one year.

—(1) In
general.
In the case of export insurance, a benefit exists if the premium rates charged are inadequate to cover the long-term operating costs and losses of the program normally over a five-year period.
(2)
Amount of the benefit.
If the Secretary determines under paragraph (a)(1) of this section that premium rates are inadequate, the Secretary normally will calculate the amount of the benefit as the difference between the amount of premiums paid by the firm and the amount received by the firm under the insurance program during the period of investigation or review.

§ 351.522
[Reserved]
§ 351.523
Upstream subsidies.
(a)
Investigation of upstream subsidies
—(1)
In general.
Before investigating the existence of an upstream subsidy (
see
section 771A of the Act), the Secretary must have a reasonable basis to believe or suspect that all of the following elements exist:
(i) A countervailable subsidy, other than an export subsidy, is provided with respect to an input product;
(ii) One of the following conditions exists:
(A) The supplier of the input product and the producer of the subject merchandise are affiliated;
(B) The price for the subsidized input product is lower than the price that the producer of the subject merchandise otherwise would pay another seller in an arm's-length transaction for an unsubsidized input product; or
(C) The government sets the price of the input product so as to guarantee that the benefit provided with respect to the input product is passed through to producers of the subject merchandise; and
(iii) The
ad valorem
countervailable subsidy rate on the input product, multiplied by the proportion of the total production costs of the subject merchandise accounted for by the input product, is equal to, or greater than, one percent.
(b)
Input product.
For purposes of this section, “input product” means any product used in the production of the subject merchandise.
(c)
Competitive benefit
—(1)
In general.
In evaluating whether a competitive benefit exists under section 771A(b) of the Act, the Secretary will determine whether the price for the subsidized input product is lower than the benchmark input price. For purposes of this section, the Secretary will use as a benchmark input price the following, in order of preference:
(i) The actual price paid by, or offered to, the producer of the subject merchandise for an unsubsidized input product, including an imported input product;
(ii) An average price for an unsubsidized input product, including an imported input product, based upon publicly available data;
(iii) The actual price paid by, or offered to, the producer of the subject merchandise for a subsidized input product, including an imported input product, that is adjusted to account for the countervailable subsidy;
(iv) An average price for a subsidized input product, including an imported input product, based upon publicly available data, that is adjusted to account for the countervailable subsidy; or
(v) An unadjusted price for a subsidized input product or any other surrogate price deemed appropriate by the Secretary.
For purposes of this section, such prices must be reflective of a time period that reasonably corresponds to the time of the purchase of the input.
(2)
Use of delivered prices.
The Secretary will use a delivered price whenever the Secretary uses the price of an input product under paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
(d)
Significant effect
—(1)
Presumptions.
In evaluating whether an upstream subsidy has a significant effect on the cost of manufacturing or producing the subject merchandise (
see
section 771A(a)(3) of the Act), the Secretary will multiply the
ad valorem
countervailable subsidy rate on the
input product by the proportion of the total production cost of the subject merchandise that is accounted for by the input product. If the product of that multiplication exceeds five percent, the Secretary will presume the existence of a significant effect. If the product is less than one percent, the Secretary will presume the absence of a significant effect. If the product is between one and five percent, there will be no presumption.
(2)
Rebuttal of presumptions.
A party to the proceeding may present information to rebut these presumptions. In evaluating such information, the Secretary will consider the extent to which factors other than price, such as quality differences, are important determinants of demand for the subject merchandise.
§ 351.524
Allocation of benefit to a particular time period.
Unless otherwise specified in §§ 351.504-351.523, the Secretary will allocate benefits to a particular time period in accordance with this section.
(a)
Recurring benefits.
The Secretary will allocate (expense) a recurring benefit to the year in which the benefit is received.
(b)
Non-recurring benefits
—(1)
In general.
The Secretary will normally allocate a non-recurring benefit to a firm over the number of years corresponding to the average useful life (“AUL”) of renewable physical assets as defined in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.
(2)
Exception.
The Secretary will normally allocate (expense) non-recurring benefits provided under a particular subsidy program to the year in which the benefits are received if the total amount approved under the subsidy program is less than 0.5 percent of relevant sales (
e.g.,
total sales, export sales, the sales of a particular product, or the sales to a particular market) of the firm in question during the year in which the subsidy was approved.
(c)
“Recurring” versus “non-recurring” benefits
—(1)
Non-binding iIlustrative lists of recurring and non-recurring benefits.
The Secretary normally will treat the following types of subsidies as providing recurring benefits: Direct tax exemptions and deductions; exemptions and excessive rebates of indirect taxes or import duties; provision of goods and services for less than adequate remuneration; price support payments; discounts on electricity, water, and other utilities; freight subsidies; export promotion assistance; early retirement payments; worker assistance; worker training; wage subsidies; and upstream subsidies. The Secretary normally will treat the following types of subsidies as providing non-recurring benefits: equity infusions, grants, plant closure assistance, debt forgiveness, coverage for operating losses, debt-to-equity conversions, provision of non-general infrastructure, and provision of plant and equipment.
(2)
The test for determining whether a benefit is recurring or non-recurring.
If a subsidy is not on the illustrative lists, or is not addressed elsewhere in these regulations, or if a party claims that a subsidy on the recurring list should be treated as non-recurring or a subsidy on the non-recurring list should be treated as recurring, the Secretary will consider the following criteria in determining whether the benefits from the subsidy should be considered recurring or non-recurring:
(i) Whether the subsidy is exceptional in the sense that the recipient cannot expect to receive additional subsidies under the same program on an ongoing basis from year to year;
(ii) Whether the subsidy required or received the government's express authorization or approval (
i.e.,
receipt of benefits is not automatic), or
(iii) Whether the subsidy was provided for, or tied to, the capital structure or capital assets of the firm.
(d)
Process for allocating non-recurring benefits over time
—(1)
In general.
For purposes of allocating a non-recurring benefit over time and determining the annual benefit amount that should be assigned to a particular year, the Secretary will use the following formula:
ER25NO98.006
Where:
A
k
= the amount of the benefit allocated to year k,
y = the face value of the subsidy,
n = the AUL (see paragraph (d)(2) of this section),
d = the discount rate (see paragraph (d)(3) of this section), and
k = the year of allocation, where the year of receipt = 1 and 1 ≤k ≤n.
(2)
AUL
—(i)
In general.
The Secretary will presume the allocation period for non-recurring subsidies to be the AUL of renewable physical assets for the industry concerned as listed in the Internal Revenue Service's (“IRS”) 1977 Class Life Asset Depreciation Range System (Rev. Proc. 77-10, 1977-1, C.B. 548 (RR-38)), as updated by the Department of Treasury. The presumption will apply unless a party claims and establishes that the IRS tables do not reasonably reflect the company-specific AUL or the country-wide AUL for the industry under investigation, subject to the requirement, in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section, that the difference between the company-specific AUL or country-wide AUL for the industry under investigation and the AUL in the IRS tables is significant. If this is the case, the Secretary will use company-specific or country-wide AULs to allocate non-recurring benefits over time (
see
paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section).
(ii)
Definition of “significant.”
For purposes of this paragraph (d),
significant
means that a party has demonstrated that the company-specific AUL or country-wide AUL for the industry differs from AUL in the IRS tables by one year or more.
(iii)
Calculation of a company-specific or country-wide AUL.
A calculation of a company-specific AUL will not be accepted by the Secretary unless it satisfies the following requirements: the company must base its depreciation on an estimate of the actual useful lives of assets and it must use straight-line depreciation or demonstrate that its calculation is not distorted through irregular or uneven additions to the pool of fixed assets. A company-specific AUL is calculated by dividing the aggregate of the annual average gross book values of the firm's depreciable productive fixed assets by the firm's aggregated annual charge to accumulated depreciation, for a period considered appropriate by the Secretary, subject to appropriate normalizing adjustments. A country-wide AUL for the industry under investigation will not be accepted by the Secretary unless the respondent government demonstrates that it has a system in place to calculate AULs for its industries, and that this system provides a reliable representation of AUL.
(iv)
Exception.
Under certain extraordinary circumstances, the Secretary may consider whether an allocation period other than AUL is appropriate or whether the benefit stream begins at a date other than the date the subsidy was bestowed.
(3)
Selection of a discount rate.
(i)
In general.
The Secretary will select a discount rate based upon data for the year in which the government agreed to provide the subsidy. The Secretary will use as a discount rate the following, in order of preference:
(A) The cost of long-term, fixed-rate loans of the firm in question, excluding any loans that the Secretary has determined to be countervailable subsidies;
(B) The average cost of long-term, fixed-rate loans in the country in question; or
(C) A rate that the Secretary considers to be most appropriate.
(ii)
Exception for uncreditworthy firms.
In the case of a firm considered by the Secretary to be uncreditworthy (
see
§ 351.505(a)(4)), the Secretary will use as a discount rate the interest rate described in § 351.505(a)(3)(iii).
§ 351.525
Calculation of
ad valorem
subsidy rate and attribution of subsidy to a product.
(a)
Calculation of ad valorem subsidy rate.
The Secretary will calculate an
ad valorem
subsidy rate by dividing the amount of the benefit allocated to the period of investigation or review by the sales value during the same period of the product or products to which the Secretary attributes the subsidy under paragraph (b) of this section. Normally, the Secretary will determine the sales value of a product on an f.o.b. (port) basis (if the product is exported) or on an f.o.b. (factory) basis (if the product is sold for domestic consumption). However, if the Secretary determines that countervailable subsidies are provided with respect to the movement of a product from the port or factory to the place of destination (
e.g.,
freight or insurance costs are subsidized), the
Secretary may make appropriate adjustments to the sales value used in the denominator.
(b)
Attribution of subsidies
—(1)
In general.
In attributing a subsidy to one or more products, the Secretary will apply the rules set forth in paragraphs (b)(2) through (9) of this section. The Secretary may determine to limit the number of cross-owned corporations examined under this section based on record information and resource availability.
(2)
Export subsidies.
The Secretary will normally attribute an export subsidy only to products exported by a firm.
(3)
Domestic subsidies.
The Secretary will normally attribute a domestic subsidy to all products sold by a firm, including products that are exported.
(4)
Subsidies tied to a particular market.
If a subsidy is tied to sales to a particular market, the Secretary will attribute the subsidy only to products sold by the firm to that market.
(5)
Subsidies tied to a particular product
—(i)
In general.
If a subsidy is tied to the production or sale of a particular product, the Secretary will attribute the subsidy only to that product.
(ii)
Exception.
If a subsidy is tied to production of an input product, then the Secretary will attribute the subsidy to both the input and downstream products produced by a corporation.
(6)
Corporations with cross-ownership
—(i)
In general.
The Secretary normally will attribute a subsidy to the products produced by the corporation that received the subsidy.
(ii)
Corporations producing the same product.
If two (or more) corporations with cross-ownership produce the subject merchandise, the Secretary will attribute the subsidies received by either or both corporations to the products produced by both corporations.
(iii)
Holding or parent companies.
If the firm that received a subsidy is a holding company, including a parent company with its own business operations, the Secretary will attribute the subsidy to the consolidated sales of the holding company and its subsidiaries.
(iv)
Input producer
—(A)
In general.
If there is cross-ownership between an input producer that supplies, either directly or indirectly, a downstream producer and production of the input product is primarily dedicated to production of the downstream products, the Secretary will attribute subsidies received by the input producer to the combined sales of the input and downstream products produced by both corporations (excluding the sales between the two corporations).
(B)
Primarily dedicated.
In determining whether the input product is primarily dedicated to production of the downstream product, the Secretary will determine, as a threshold matter, whether the input could be used in the production of a downstream product including subject merchandise. The Secretary may also consider the following factors, which are not in hierarchical order: whether the input is a link in the overall production chain; whether the input provider's business activities are focused on providing the input to the downstream producer; whether the input is a common input used in the production of a wide variety of products and industries; whether the downstream producers in the overall production chain are the primary users of the inputs produced by the input producer; whether the inputs produced by the input producer are primarily reserved for use by the downstream producer until the downstream producer's needs are met; whether the input producer is dependent on the downstream producers for the purchases of the input product; whether the downstream producers are dependent on the input producer for their supply of the input; the coordination, nature and extent of business activities between the input producer and the downstream producers whether directly between the input producer and the downstream producers or indirectly through other cross-owned corporations; and any other factor deemed relevant by the Secretary based upon the case-specific facts.
(v)
Providers of utility products.
If there is cross-ownership between a corporation providing electricity, natural gas or other similar utility product and a producer of subject merchandise, the Secretary will attribute subsidies received by that provider to the combined sales of that provider and the sales of products sold by the producer
of subject merchandise if at least one of the following two conditions are met:
(A) A substantial percentage, normally defined as 25 percent or more, of the production of the cross-owned utility provider is provided to the producer of subject merchandise, or
(B) The producer of subject merchandise purchases a substantial percentage, normally defined as 25 percent or more, of its electricity, natural gas, or other similar utility product from the cross-owned provider.
(vi)
Transfer of subsidy between corporations with cross-ownership.
If a cross-owned corporation received a subsidy and transferred the subsidy to a producer of subject merchandise, the Secretary will only attribute the subsidy to products produced by the recipient of the transferred subsidy. When the cross-owned corporation that transferred the subsidy could fall under two or more of the paragraphs under paragraph (b)(6) of this section the transferred subsidy will be attributed solely under this paragraph.
(vii)
Cross-ownership defined.
Cross-ownership exists between two or more corporations when one corporation can use or direct the individual assets of the other corporation(s) in essentially the same ways it can use its own assets. Normally, this standard will be met when there is a majority voting ownership interest between two corporations or through common ownership of two (or more) corporations.
(7)
Multinational firms.
If the firm that received a subsidy has production facilities in two or more countries, the Secretary will attribute the subsidy to products produced by the firm within the country of the government that granted the subsidy. However, if it is demonstrated that the subsidy was tied to more than domestic production, the Secretary will attribute the subsidy to multinational production.
(8)
Attribution of subsidies to plants or factories.
The Secretary will not tie or attribute a subsidy on a plant- or factory-specific basis.
(9)
General standard for finding tying.
A subsidy will normally be determined to be tied to a product or market when the authority providing the subsidy was made aware of, or otherwise had knowledge of, the intended use of the subsidy and acknowledged that intended use of the subsidy prior to, or concurrent with, the bestowal of the subsidy.
(c)
Trading companies
—(1)
In general.
Benefits from subsidies provided to a trading company that exports subject merchandise shall be cumulated with benefits from subsidies provided to the firm which is producing subject merchandise that is sold through the trading company, regardless of whether the trading company and the producing firm are affiliated.
(2)
The individually examined respondent exports through trading company.
To cumulate subsidies when the trading company is not individually examined as a respondent, the Secretary will pro-rate the subsidy rate calculated for the trading company by using the ratio of the producer's total exports of subject merchandise to the United States sold through the trading company divided by producer's total exports of subject merchandise to the United States and add the resultant rate onto the producer's calculated subsidy rate.
(3)
The individually examined respondent is a trading company.
To cumulate subsidies when the trading company is individually examined as a respondent, the Secretary will pro-rate the subsidy rate calculated for the producer(s) by the ratio of the producer's sales of subject merchandise to the United States purchased or sourced by the trading company to total sales to the United States of subject merchandise from all selected producers sourced by the respondent trading company and add the resultant rates to the trading company's calculated subsidy rate.
(d)
Ad valorem subsidy rate in countries with high inflation.
For countries experiencing an inflation rate greater than 25 percent
per annum
during the relevant period, the Secretary will normally adjust the benefit amount (numerator) and the sales data (denominator) to account for the rate of inflation during the relevant period of investigation or review in calculating the
ad valorem
subsidy rate.
[63 FR 65407, Nov. 25, 1998, as amended at 89 FR 20841, Mar. 25, 2024; 89 FR 101767, Dec. 16, 2024]
§ 351.526
Subsidy extinguishment from changes in ownership.
(a)
In general.
The Secretary will normally presume that non-recurring subsidies continue to benefit a recipient in full over an allocation period determined consistent with §§ 351.507(d), 351.508(c)(1), or 351.524, notwithstanding an intervening change in ownership.
(b)
Rebutting the presumption of subsidy continuation notwithstanding a change in ownership.
(1) An interested party may rebut the presumption in paragraph (a) of this section by demonstrating with sufficient evidence that, during the allocation period, a change in ownership occurred in which the seller sold its ownership of all or substantially all of a company or its assets, retaining no control of the company or its assets, and
(i) In the case of a government-to-private sale, that the sale was an arm's-length transaction for fair market value, or
(ii) In the case of a private-to-private sale, that the sale was an arm's-length transaction, unless a party demonstrates that the sale was not for fair market value.
(2)
Arm's-length.
In determining whether the evidence presented in paragraph (b)(1) of this section demonstrates that the transaction was conducted at arm's length, the Secretary will be guided by the SAA, which defines an arm's-length transaction as a transaction negotiated between unrelated parties, each acting in its own interest, or between related parties such that the terms of the transaction are those that would exist if the transaction had been negotiated between unrelated parties.
(3)
Fair Market Value.
(i) In determining whether the evidence presented by parties pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section demonstrates that the transaction was for fair market value, the Secretary will determine whether the seller, including in the case of a privatization through the government in its capacity as seller, acted in a manner consistent with the normal sales practices of private, commercial sellers in that country, taking into account evidence regarding whether the seller failed to maximize its return on what it sold.
(ii) In making the determination under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, the Secretary may consider information regarding comparable benchmark prices as well as information regarding the process through which the sale was made. The following is a non-exhaustive list of specific considerations that the Secretary may find to be relevant in this regard:
(A)
Objective analysis.
Whether the seller performed or obtained an objective analysis in determining the appropriate sales price and, if so, whether it implemented the recommendations of such objective analysis for maximizing its return on the sale, including in regard to the sales price recommended in the analysis;
(B)
Artificial barriers to entry.
Whether the seller-imposed restrictions on foreign purchasers or purchasers from other industries, overly burdensome or unreasonable bidder qualification requirements, or any other restrictions that artificially suppressed the demand for, or the purchase price of, the company;
(C)
Highest bid.
Whether the seller accepted the highest bid, reflecting the full amount that the company or its assets (including the value of any subsidy benefits) were actually worth under the prevailing market conditions and whether the final purchase price was paid through monetary or close equivalent compensation; and
(D)
Committed investment.
Whether there were price discounts or other inducements in exchange for promises of additional future investment that private, commercial sellers would not normally seek (for example, retaining redundant workers or unwanted capacity) and, if so, whether such committed investment requirements were a barrier to entry or in any way distorted the value that bidders were willing to pay for what was being sold.
(4)
Deadline to rebut the presumption under paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
The Secretary will normally not consider information submitted by a respondent or government on the record to be sufficient to rebut the presumption of subsidy continuation under paragraph (b)(1) of this section unless that submitted information is timely
filed as part of the respondent's or government's initial questionnaire response.
(5)
Market distortion.
Information presented under paragraphs (b)(2) and (3) of this section notwithstanding, the Secretary will not find the presumption in paragraph (a) of this section to be rebutted if an interested party has demonstrated that, at the time of the change in ownership, the broader market conditions necessary for the transaction price to accurately reflect the subsidy benefit were not present or were severely distorted by government action or inaction such that the transaction price was meaningfully different from what it would otherwise have been absent the distortive government action or inaction. In assessing such claims, the Secretary may consider, among other things, the following factors:
(i)
Fundamental conditions.
Whether the fundamental requirements for a properly functioning market are sufficiently present in the economy in general as well as in the particular industry or sector, including, for example, free interplay of supply and demand, broad-based and equal access to information, sufficient safeguards against collusive behavior, and effective operation of the rule of law; and
(ii)
Legal and fiscal incentives.
Whether the government has used the prerogatives of government in a special or targeted way that makes possible or otherwise significantly distorts the terms of a change in ownership in a way that a private seller could not. Examples of such incentives include, but are not limited to, the following:
(A) Special tax or duty rates that make the sale more attractive to potential purchasers;
(B) Regulatory exemptions particular to the privatization (or to privatizations generally) affecting worker retention or environmental remediation; or
(C) Subsidization or support of other companies to an extent that severely distorts the normal market signals regarding company and asset values in the industry in question.
(c)
Subsidy benefit extinguishment
—(1)
In general.
If the Secretary determines that any evidence presented by interested parties under paragraph (b) of this section rebuts the presumption under paragraph (a) of this section, the full amount of pre-transaction subsidy benefits, including the benefit of any concurrent subsidy meeting the criteria in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, will be found to be extinguished and therefore not countervailable. Absent such a finding, the Secretary will not find that a change in ownership extinguishes subsidy benefits.
(2)
Concurrent subsidies.
For purposes of paragraph (c)(1) of this section, concurrent subsidies are those subsidies given to facilitate or encourage or that are otherwise bestowed concurrent with a change in ownership. The Secretary will normally consider the value of a concurrent subsidy to be fully reflected in the fair market value price of an arm's-length change in ownership and, therefore, to be fully extinguished in such a transaction under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, if the following criteria are met:
(i) The nature and value of the concurrent subsidies are fully transparent to all potential bidders and, therefore, reflected in the final bid values of the potential bidders,
(ii) The concurrent subsidies are bestowed prior to the sale, and
(iii) There is no evidence otherwise on the record demonstrating that the concurrent subsidies are not fully reflected in the transaction price.
[89 FR 101768, Dec. 16, 2024]
§ 351.527
[Reserved]
§ 351.528
Exchanges of undervalued currencies.
(a)
Currency undervaluation
—(1)
In general.
The Secretary normally will consider whether a benefit is conferred from the exchange of United States dollars for the currency of a country under review or investigation under a unified exchange rate system only if that country's currency is undervalued during the relevant period. In determining whether a country's currency is undervalued, the Secretary normally will take into account the gap between the country's real effective exchange rate (REER) and the real effective exchange rate that achieves an external
balance over the medium term that reflects appropriate policies (equilibrium REER).
(2)
Government action.
The Secretary normally will make an affirmative finding under paragraph (a)(1) of this section only if there has been government action on the exchange rate that contributes to an undervaluation of the currency. In assessing whether there has been such government action, the Secretary will not normally include monetary and related credit policy of an independent central bank or monetary authority. The Secretary may also consider the government's degree of transparency regarding actions that could alter the exchange rate.
(b)
Benefit
—(1)
In general.
Where the Secretary has made an affirmative finding under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the Secretary normally will determine the existence of a benefit after examining the difference between:
(i) The nominal, bilateral United States dollar rate consistent with the equilibrium REER; and
(ii) The actual nominal, bilateral United States dollar rate during the relevant time period, taking into account any information regarding the impact of government action on the exchange rate.
(2)
Amount of benefit.
Where there is a difference under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the amount of the benefit from a currency exchange normally will be based on the difference between the amount of currency the firm received in exchange for United States dollars and the amount of currency that firm would have received absent the difference referred to in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
(c)
Information sources.
In applying this section, the Secretary will request that the Secretary of the Treasury provide its evaluation and conclusion as to the determinations under paragraphs (a) and (b)(1) of this section.
[85 FR 6043, Feb. 4, 2020]
§ 351.529
Certain fees, fines, and penalties.
(a)
Financial contribution.
When determining if a fee, fine, or penalty that is otherwise due, has been forgone or not collected, within the meaning of section 771(5)(D)(ii) of the Act, the Secretary may conclude that a financial contribution exists if information on the record demonstrates that payment was otherwise required and was not made, in full or in part. In making such a determination, the Secretary will not be required to consider whether the government took efforts to seek payment or grant deferral, or otherwise acknowledged nonpayment, of the fee, fine, or penalty.
(b)
Benefit.
If the Secretary determines that the government has exempted or remitted in part or in full, a fee, fine, or penalty under paragraph (a) of this section, a benefit exists to the extent that the fee, fine, or penalty paid by a party is less than if the government had not exempted or remitted that fee, fine, or penalty. Further, if the government is determined to have deferred the payment of the fee, fine, or penalty, in part or in full, a benefit exists to the extent that appropriate interest charges are not collected. Normally, a deferral of payment of fees, fines, or penalties will be treated as a government provided loan in the amount of the payments deferred, according to the methodology described in § 351.505.
[89 FR 20841, Mar. 25, 2024]

# Subpart F—Subsidy Determinations Regarding Cheese Subject to an In-Quota Rate of Duty
§ 351.601
Annual list and quarterly update of subsidies.
The Secretary will make the determinations called for by section 702(a) of the Trade Agreements Act of 1979, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1202 note) based on the available information, and will publish the annual list and quarterly updates described in such section in the
Federal Register.
§ 351.602
Determination upon request.
(a)
Request for determination.
(1) Any person, including the Secretary of Agriculture, who has reason to believe there have been changes in or additions to the latest annual list published under § 351.601 may request in writing that the Secretary determine under
section 702(a)(3) of the Trade Agreements Act of 1979 whether there are any changes or additions. The person must file the request with the Central Records Unit (
see
§ 351.103). The request must allege either a change in the type or amount of any subsidy included in the latest annual list or quarterly update or an additional subsidy not included in that list or update provided by a foreign government, and must contain the following, to the extent reasonably available to the requesting person:
(i) The name and address of the person;
(ii) The article of cheese subject to an in-quota rate of duty allegedly benefitting from the changed or additional subsidy;
(iii) The country of origin of the article of cheese subject to an in-quota rate of duty; and
(iv) The alleged subsidy or changed subsidy and relevant factual information (particularly documentary evidence) regarding the alleged changed or additional subsidy including the authority under which it is provided, the manner in which it is paid, and the value of the subsidy to producers or exporters of the article.
(2) The requirements of § 351.303 (c) and (d) apply to this section.
(b)
Determination.
Not later than 30 days after receiving an acceptable request, the Secretary will:
(1) In consultation with the Secretary of Agriculture, determine based on the available information whether there has been any change in the type or amount of any subsidy included in the latest annual list or quarterly update or an additional subsidy not included in that list or update is being provided by a foreign government;
(2) Notify the Secretary of Agriculture and the person making the request of the determination; and
(3) Promptly publish in the
Federal Register
notice of any changes or additions.
§ 351.603
Complaint of price-undercutting by subsidized imports.
Upon receipt of a complaint filed with the Secretary of Agriculture under section 702(b) of the Trade Agreements Act concerning price-undercutting by subsidized imports, the Secretary will promptly determine, under section 702(a)(3) of the Trade Agreements Act of 1979, whether or not the alleged subsidies are included in or should be added to the latest annual list or quarterly update.
§ 351.604
Access to information.
Subpart C of this part applies to factual information submitted in connection with this subpart.

# Subpart G—Applicability Dates
§ 351.701
Applicability dates.
The regulations contained in this part 351 apply to all administrative reviews initiated on the basis of requests made on or after the first day of July, 1997, to all investigations and other segments of proceedings initiated on the basis of petitions filed or requests made after June 18, 1997 and to segments of proceedings self-initiated by the Department after June 18, 1997. Segments of proceedings to which part 351 do not apply will continue to be governed by the regulations in effect on the date the petitions were filed or requests were made for those segments, to the extent that those regulations were not invalidated by the URAA or replaced by the interim final regulations published on May 11, 1995 (60 FR 25130 (1995)). For segments of proceedings initiated on the basis of petitions filed or requests made after January 1, 1995, but before part 351 applies, part 351 will serve as a restatement of the Department's interpretation of the requirements of the Act as amended by the URAA.
§ 351.702
Applicability dates for countervailing duty regulations.

§ 354.4
Suspension of rules.

Report of violation and investigation.
(a) An employee of the Department who has information indicating that the terms of an administrative protective order have been violated will provide the information to the Senior APO Specialist or the Chief Counsel.
(b) Upon receiving information which indicates that a person may have violated the terms of an administrative protective order from an employee of the Department or any other person, the director will conduct an investigation concerning whether there was a violation of an administrative protective order, and who was responsible for the violation, if any. No director shall investigate an alleged violation that
arose out of a proceeding for which the director was responsible. For the purposes of this part, the director will be supervised by the Deputy Under Secretary for International Trade with guidance from the Chief Counsel.

[53 FR 47920, Nov. 28, 1988, as amended at 63 FR 24404, May 4, 1998]
§ 354.6
Initiation of proceedings.
(a)
In general.
After an investigation and report by the director under § 354.5(c) and consultation with the Chief Counsel, the Deputy Under Secretary for International Trade will determine whether there is reasonable cause to believe that a person has violated an administrative protective
order. If the Deputy Under Secretary for International Trade determines that there is reasonable cause, the Deputy Under Secretary for International Trade also will determine whether sanctions under paragraph (b) or a warning under paragraph (c) is appropriate for the violation.
(b)
Sanctions.
In determining under paragraph (a) of this section whether sanctions are appropriate, and, if so, what sanctions to impose, the Deputy Under Secretary for International Trade will consider the nature of the violation, the resulting harm, and other relevant circumstances of the case. If the Deputy Under Secretary for International Trade determines that sanctions are appropriate, the Deputy Under Secretary for International Trade will initiate a proceeding under this part by issuing a charging letter under § 354.7. The Deputy Under Secretary for International Trade will determine whether to initiate a proceeding no later than 60 days after receiving a report of the investigation.
(c)
Warning.
If the Deputy Under Secretary for International Trade determines under paragraph (a) of this section that a warning is appropriate, the Deputy Under Secretary will issue a warning letter to the person believed to have violated an administrative protective order. Sanctions are not appropriate and a warning is appropriate if:
(1) The person took due care;
(2) The Secretary has not previously charged the person with violating an administrative protective order;
(3) The violation did not result in any disclosure of the business proprietary information or the Secretary is otherwise able to determine that the violation caused no harm to the submitter of the information; and
(4) The person cooperated fully in the investigation.
[63 FR 24404, May 4, 1998]
§ 354.7
Charging letter.
(a)
Contents of Letter.
The Deputy Under Secretary will initiate proceedings by issuing a charging letter to each charged party and affected party which includes:
(1) A statement of the allegation that an administrative protective order has been violated and the basis thereof;
(2) A statement of the proposed sanctions;
(3) A statement that the charged or affected party is entitled to review the documents or other physical evidence upon which the charge is based and the method for requesting access to, or copies of, such documents;
(4) A statement that the charged or affected party is entitled to a hearing before a presiding official if requested within 30 days of the date of service of the charging letter and the procedure for requesting a hearing, including the name, address, and telephone number of the person to contact if there are further questions;
(5) A statement that the charged or affected party has a right, if a hearing is not requested, to submit documentary evidence to the Deputy Under Secretary and an explanation of the method for submitting evidence and the date by which it must be received; and
(6) A statement that the charged or affected party has a right to retain counsel at the party's own expense for purposes of representation.
(b) Settlement and amending the charging letter. The Deputy Under Secretary for International Trade and a charged or affected party may settle a charge brought under this part by mutual agreement at any time after service of the charging letter; approval of the presiding official or the administrative protective order Sanctions Board is not necessary. The charged or affected party may request a hearing but at the same time request that a presiding official not be appointed pending settlement discussions. Settlement agreements may include sanctions for purposes of § 354.18. The Deputy Under Secretary for International Trade may amend, supplement, or withdraw the charging letter as follows:
(1) If there has been no request for a hearing, or if supporting information has not been submitted under § 354.13, the withdrawal will not preclude future actions on the same alleged violation.
(2) If a hearing has been requested but no presiding official has been appointed, withdrawal of the charging letter will preclude the Deputy Under Secretary for International Trade from
seeking sanctions at a later date for the same alleged violation.
(3) The Deputy Under Secretary for International Trade may amend, supplement or withdraw the charging letter at any time after the appointment of a presiding official, if the presiding official determines that the interests of justice would thereby be served. If the presiding official so determines, the presiding official will also determine whether the withdrawal will preclude the Deputy Under Secretary for International Trade from seeking sanctions at a later date for the same alleged violation.
(c)
Service of charging letter on a resident of the United States.
(1) Service of a charging letter on a United States resident will be made by:
(i) Mailing a copy by registered or certified mail addressed to the charged or affected party at the party's last known address;
(ii) Leaving a copy with the charged or affected party or with an officer, a managing or general agent, or any other agent authorized by appointment or by law to receive service for the party; or
(iii) Leaving a copy with a person of suitable age and discretion who resides at the party's last known dwelling.
(2) Service made in the manner described in paragraph (c) (ii) or (iii) of this section shall be evidenced by a certificate of service signed by the person making such service, stating the method of service and the identity of the person with whom the charging letter was left.
(d)
Service of charging letter on a non-resident.
If applicable laws or intergovernmental agreements or understandings make the methods of service set forth in paragraph (c) of this section inappropriate or ineffective, service of the charging letter on a person who is not a resident of the United States may be made by any method that is permitted by the country in which the person resides and that satisfies the due process requirements under United States law with respect to notice in administrative proceedings.
[53 FR 47920, Nov. 28, 1988, as amended at 63 FR 24405, May 4, 1998]
§ 354.8
Interim sanctions.
(a) If the Deputy Under Secretary concludes, after issuing a charging letter under § 354.7 and before a final decision is rendered, that interim sanctions are necessary to protect the interests of the Department or others, including the protection of business proprietary information, the Deputy Under Secretary may petition a presiding official to impose such sanctions.
(b) The presiding official may impose interim sanctions against a person upon determining that:
(1) There is probable cause to believe that there was a violation of an administrative protective order and the Department is likely to prevail in obtaining sanctions under this part,
(2) The Department or others are likely to suffer irreparable harm if the interim sanctions are not imposed, and
(3) The interim sanctions are a reasonable means for protecting the rights of the Department or others while preserving to the greatest extent possible the rights of the person against whom the interim sanctions are proposed.
(c) Interim sanctions which may be imposed include any sanctions that are necessary to protect the rights of the Department or others, including, but not limited to:
(1) Denying a person further access to business proprietary information.
(2) Barring a person from representing another person before the International Trade Administration.
(3) Barring a person from appearing before the International Trade Administration, and
(4) Requiring the person to return material previously provided by the Department and all other materials containing the business proprietary information, such as briefs, notes, or charts based on any such information received under an administrative protective order.
(d) The Deputy Under Secretary will notify the person against whom interim sanctions are sought of the request for interim sanctions and provide to that person the material submitted to the presiding official to support the request. The notice will include a reference to the procedures of this section.
(e) A person against whom interim sanctions are proposed has a right to oppose the request through submission of material to the presiding official. The presiding official has discretion to permit oral presentations and to allow further submissions.
(f) The presiding official will notify the parties of the decision on interim sanctions and the basis therefor within five days of the conclusion of oral presentations or the date of final written submissions.
(g) If interim sanctions have been imposed, the investigation and any proceedings under this part will be conducted on an expedited basis.
(h) An order imposing interim sanctions may be revoked at any time by the presiding official and expires automatically upon the issuance of a final order.
(i) The presiding official may reconsider imposition of interim sanctions on the basis of new and material evidence or other good cause shown. The Deputy Under Secretary or a person against whom interim sanctions have been imposed may appeal a decision on interim sanctions to the APO Sanctions Board, if such an appeal is certified by the presiding official as necessary to prevent undue harm to the Department, a person against whom interim sanctions have been imposed or others, or is otherwise in the interests of justice. Interim sanctions which have been imposed remain in effect while an appeal is pending, unless the presiding official determines otherwise.
(j) The Deputy Under Secretary may request a presiding official to impose emergency interim sanctions to preserve the status quo. Emergency interim sanctions may last no longer than 48 hours, excluding weekends and holidays. The person against whom such emergency interim sanctions are proposed need not be given prior notice or an opportunity to oppose the request for sanctions. The presiding official may impose emergency interim sanctions upon determining that the Department is, or others are, likely to suffer irreparable harm if such sanctions are not imposed and that the interests of justice would thereby be served. The presiding official will promptly notify a person against whom emergency sanctions have been imposed of the sanctions and their duration.
(k) If a hearing has not been requested, the Deputy Under Secretary will ask the Under Secretary to appoint a presiding official for making determinations under this section.
§ 354.9
Request for a hearing.
(a) Any party may request a hearing by submitted a written request to the Under Secretary within 30 days after the date of service of the charging letter. However, the Deputy Under Secretary may request a hearing only if the interests of justice would thereby be served.
(b) Upon timely receipt of a request for a hearing, and unless the party requesting a hearing requests that the Under Secretary not appoint a presiding official, the Under Secretary will appoint a presiding official to conduct the hearing and render an initial decision.
[53 FR 47920, Nov. 28, 1988, as amended at 63 FR 24405, May 4, 1998]
§ 354.10
Discovery.
(a)
Voluntary discovery.
All parties are encouraged to engage in voluntary discovery procedures regarding any matter, not privileged, which is relevant to the subject matter of the pending proceeding.
(b)
Interrogatories and requests for admissions or production of documents.
A party may serve on any other party interrogatories, requests for admissions, or requests for production of documents for inspection and copying, and a party concerned may then apply to the presiding official for such enforcement or administrative protective order as that party deems warranted concerning such discovery. The party will serve a discovery request at least 20 days before the scheduled date of a hearing, if a hearing has been requested and scheduled, unless the presiding official specifies a shorter time period. Copies of interrogatories, requests for admissions, and requests for production of documents and responses thereto will be served on all parties. Matters of fact or law of which admission is requested will be deemed admitted unless, within a period designated
in the request (at least 10 days after the date of service of the request, or within such further time as the presiding official may allow), the party to whom the request is directed serves upon the requesting party a sworn statement either admitting or denying specifically the matters of which admission is requested or setting forth in detail the reasons why the party cannot truthfully either admit or deny such matters.
(c)
Depositions.
Upon application of a party and for good cause shown, the presiding official may order the taking of the testimony of any person who is a party, or under the control or authority of a party, by deposition and the production of specified documents or materials by the person at the deposition. The application shall state the purpose of the deposition and shall set forth the facts sought to be established through the deposition.
(d)
Enforcement.
The presiding official may order a party to answer designated questions, to produce specified documents or items, or to take any other action in response to a proper discovery request. If a party does not comply with such an order, the presiding official may make any determination or enter any order in the proceedings as he or she deems reasonable and appropriate. The presiding official may strike related charges or defenses in whole or in part, or may take particular facts relating to the discovery request to which the party failed or refused to respond as being established for purposes of the proceeding in accordance with the contentions of the party seeking discovery. In issuing a discovery order, the presiding official will consider the necessity to protect business proprietary information and will not order the release of information in circumstances where it is reasonable to conclude that such release will lead to unauthorized dissemination of such information.
(e)
Role of the Under Secretary.
If a hearing has not been requested, the party seeking enforcement will ask the Under Secretary to appoint a presiding official to rule on motions under this section.
§ 354.11
Prehearing conference.
(a)(1) If an administrative hearing has been requested, the presiding official will direct the parties to attend a prehearing conference to consider:
(i) Simplification of issues;
(ii) Obtaining stipulations of fact and of documents to avoid unnecessary proof;
(iii) Settlement of the matter;
(iv) Discovery; and
(v) Such other matters as may expedite the disposition of the proceedings.
(2) Any relevant and significant stipulations or admissions will be incorporated into the initial decision.
(b) If a prehearing conference is impractical, the presiding official will direct the parties to correspond with each other or to confer by telephone or otherwise to achieve the purposes of such a conference.
§ 354.12
Hearing.
(a)
Scheduling of hearing.
The presiding official will schedule the hearing at a reasonable time, date, and place, which will be in Washington, DC, unless the presiding official determines otherwise based upon good cause shown that another location would better serve the interests of justice. In setting the date, the presiding official will give due regard to the need for the parties adequately to prepare for the hearing and the importance of expeditiously resolving the matter.
(b)
Joinder or consolidation.
The presiding official may order joinder or consolidation if sanctions are proposed against more than one party or if violations of more than one administrative protective order are alleged if to do so would expedite processing of the cases and not adversely affect the interests of the parties.
(c)
Hearing procedures.
Hearings will be conducted in a fair and impartial manner by the presiding official, who may limit attendance at any hearing or portion thereof if necessary or advisable in order to protect business proprietary information from improper disclosure. The rules of evidence prevailing in courts of law shall not apply, and all evidentiary material the presiding official determines to be relevant and material to the proceeding
and not unduly repetitious may be received into evidence and given appropriate weight. The presiding official may make such orders and determinations regarding the admissibility of evidence, conduct of examination and cross-examination, and similar matters as are necessary or appropriate to ensure orderliness in the proceedings. The presiding official will ensure that a record of the hearing be taken by reporter or by electronic recording, and will order such part of the record to be sealed as is necessary to protect business proprietary information.
(d)
Rights of parties.
At a hearing each party shall have the right to:
(1) Introduce and examine witnesses and submit physical evidence,
(2) Confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses,
(3) Present oral argument, and
(4) Receive a transcript or recording of the proceedings, upon request, subject to the presiding official's orders regarding sealing the record.
(e)
Representation.
Each charged or affected party has a right to represent himself or herself or to retain private counsel for that purpose. The Chief Counsel will represent the Department, unless the General Counsel determines otherwise. The presiding official may disallow a representative if such representation constitutes a conflict of interest or is otherwise not in the interests of justice and may debar a representative for contumacious conduct relating to the proceedings.
(f)
Ex parte communications.
The parties and their representatives may not make any
ex parte
communications to the presiding official concerning the merits of the allegations or any matters at issue, except as provided in § 354.8 regarding emergency interim sanctions.
§ 354.13
Proceeding without a hearing.
If no party has requested a hearing, the Deputy Under Secretary, within 40 days after the date of service of a charging letter, will submit for inclusion into the record and provide each charged or affected party information supporting the allegations in the charging letter. Each charged or affected party has the right to file a written response to the information and supporting documentation within 30 days after the date of service of the information provided by the Deputy Under Secretary unless the Deputy Under Secretary alters the time period for good cause. The Deputy Under Secretary may allow the parties to submit further information and argument.
§ 354.14
Initial decision.
(a)
Initial decision.
The presiding official, if a hearing was requested, or the Deputy Under Secretary will submit an initial decision to the APO Sanctions Board, providing copies to the parties. The presiding official or Deputy Under Secretary will ordinarily issue the decision within 20 days of the conclusion of the hearing, if one was held, or within 15 days of the date of service of final written submissions. The initial decision will be based solely on evidence received into the record, and the pleadings of the parties.
(b)
Findings and conclusions.
The initial decision will state findings and conclusions as to whether a person has violated an administrative protective order; the basis for those findings and conclusions; and whether the sanctions proposed in the charging letter, or lesser included sanctions, should be imposed against the charged or affected party. The presiding official or Deputy Under Secretary may impose sanctions only upon determining that the preponderance of the evidence supports a finding of violation of an administrative protective order and that the sanctions are warranted against the charged or affected party. In determining whether sanctions are appropriate and, if so, what sanctions to impose, the presiding official or the Deputy Under Secretary will consider the nature of the violation, the resulting harm, and other relevant circumstances of the case.
(c)
Finality of decision.
If the APO Sanctions Board has not issued a decision on the matter within 60 days after issuance of the initial decision, the initial decision becomes the final decision of the Department.
§ 354.15
Final decision.
(a)
APO Sanctions Board.
Upon request of a party, the initial decision will be reviewed by the members of the
APO Sanctions Board. The Board consists of the Under Secretary for International Trade, who shall serve as Chairperson, the Under Secretary for Economic Affairs, and the General Counsel.
(b)
Comments on initial decision.
Within 30 days after issuance of the initial decision, a party may submit written comments to the APO Sanctions Board on the initial decision, which the Board will consider when reviewing the initial decision. The parties have no right to an oral presentation, although the Board may allow oral argument in its discretion.
(c)
Final decision by the APO Sanctions Board.
Within 60 days but not sooner than 30 days after issuance of an initial decision, the APO Sanctions Board may issue a final decision which adopts the initial decision in its entirety; differs in whole or in part from the initial decision, including the imposition of lesser included sanctions; or remands the matter to the presiding official or Deputy Under Secretary for further consideration. The only sanctions that the Board can impose are those sanctions proposed in the charging letter or lesser included sanctions.
(d)
Contents of final decision.
If the final decision of the APO Sanctions Board does not remand the matter and differs from the initial decision, it will state findings and conclusions which differ from the initial decision, if any, the basis for those findings and conclusions, and the sanctions which are to be imposed, to the extent they differ from the sanctions in the initial decision.
[53 FR 47920, Nov. 28, 1988, as amended at 63 FR 24405, May 4, 1998]
§ 354.16
Reconsideration.
Any party may file a motion for reconsideration with the APO Sanctions Board. The party must state with particularity the grounds for the motion, including any facts or points of law which the party claims the APO Sanctions Board has overlooked or misapplied. The party may file the motion within 30 days of the issuance of the final decision or the adoption of the initial decision as the final decision, except that if the motion is based on the discovery of new and material evidence which was not known, and could not reasonably have been discovered through due diligence prior to the close of the record, the party shall file the motion within 15 days of the discovery of the new and material evidence. The party shall provide a copy of the motion to all other parties. Opposing parties may file a response within 30 days of the date of service of the motion. The response shall be considered as part of the record. The parties have no right to an oral presentation on a motion for reconsideration, but the Board may permit oral argument at its discretion. If the motion to reconsider is granted, the Board will review the record and affirm, modify, or reverse the original decision or remand the matter for further consideration to a presiding official or the Deputy Under Secretary, as warranted.
§ 354.17
Confidentiality.
(a) All proceedings involving allegations of a violation of an administrative protective order shall be kept confidential until such time as the Department makes a final decision under these regulations, no longer subject to reconsideration, imposing a sanction.
(b) The charged party or counsel for the charged party will be granted access to business proprietary information in these proceedings, as necessary, under administrative protective order, consistent with the provisions of 19 CFR 351.305(c), or their successor regulations.
[53 FR 47920, Nov. 28, 1988, as amended at 63 FR 24405, May 4, 1998]
§ 354.18
Public notice of sanctions.
If there is a final decision under § 354.15 to impose sanctions, or if a charging letter is settled under § 354.7(b), notice of the Secretary's decision or of the existence of a settlement will be published in the
Federal Register.
If a final decision is reached, such publication will be no sooner than 30 days after issuance of a final decision or after a motion to reconsider has been denied, if such a motion was filed. In addition, whenever the Deputy Under Secretary for International Trade subjects a charged or affected party to a sanction under § 354.3(a)(1),
the Deputy Under Secretary for International Trade also will provide such information to the ethics panel or other disciplinary body of the appropriate bar associations or other professional associations and to any Federal agency likely to have an interest in the matter. The Deputy Under Secretary for International Trade will cooperate in any disciplinary actions by any association or agency. Whenever the Deputy Under Secretary for International Trade subjects a charged or affected party to a private letter of reprimand under § 354.3(a)(5), the Secretary will not make public the identity of the violator, nor will the Secretary make public the specifics of the violation in a manner that would reveal indirectly the identity of the violator.
[63 FR 24405, May 4, 1998]
§ 354.19
Sunset.
(a) If, after a period of three years from the date of issuance of a warning letter, a final decision or settlement in which sanctions were imposed, the charged or affected party has fully complied with the terms of the sanctions and has not been found to have violated another administrative protective order, the party may request in writing that the Deputy Under Secretary for International Trade rescind the charging letter. A request for rescission must include:
(1) A description of the actions taken during the preceding three years in compliance with the terms of the sanctions; and
(2) A letter certifying that: the charged or affected party complied with the terms of the sanctions; the charged or affected party has not received another administrative protective order sanction during the three-year period; and the charged or affected party is not the subject of another investigation for a possible violation of an administrative protective order.
(b) Subject to the Chief Counsel's confirmation that the charged or affected party has complied with the terms set forth in paragraph (a) of this section, the Deputy Under Secretary for International Trade will rescind the charging letter within 30 days after receiving the written request.

§ 356.13
Suspension of rules.
Upon request by the Deputy Under Secretary, a charged or affected party, or the APO Sanctions Board, the administrative law judge may modify or waive any rule in this subpart upon determining that no party will be unduly prejudiced and the ends of justice will thereby be served and upon notice to all parties.

§ 356.15
Initiation of proceedings.
(a) If the Deputy Under Secretary concludes, after an investigation and report by the Director under § 356.14(c) and consultation with the Chief Counsel, that there is reasonable cause to believe that a person has violated a protective order or a disclosure undertaking and that sanctions are appropriate for the violation, the Deputy Under Secretary will, at the Deputy Under Secretary's discretion, either initiate a proceeding under this subpart by issuing a charging letter as set forth in § 356.16 or request that the authorized agency of the involved FTA country initiate a proceeding by issuing a request to charge as set forth in § 356.17. In determining whether sanctions are appropriate and, if so, what sanctions to impose, the Deputy Under Secretary will consider the nature of the violation, the resulting harm, and other relevant circumstances of the case. The Deputy Under Secretary will decide whether to initiate a proceeding no later than 60 days after receiving a report of the investigation.
(b) If the Department receives a request to charge from an authorized agency of a FTA country, the Deputy Under Secretary will promptly initiate proceedings under this part by issuing a charging letter as set forth in § 356.16.
§ 356.16
Charging letter.
(a)
Contents of letter.
The Deputy Under Secretary will initiate proceedings by issuing a charging letter to each charged party and affected party which includes:
(1) A statement of the allegation that a protective order or a disclosure undertaking has been violated and the basis thereof;
(2) A statement of the proposed sanctions;
(3) A statement that the charged or affected party is entitled to review the documents or other physical evidence upon which the charge is based and the method for requesting access to, or copies of, such documents;
(4) A statement that the charged or affected party is entitled to a hearing before an administrative law judge if requested within 30 days of the date of service of the charging letter and the procedure for requesting a hearing, including the name, address, and telephone number of the person to contact if there are further questions;
(5) A statement that the charged or affected party has a right, if a hearing is not requested, to submit documentary evidence to the Deputy Under Secretary and an explanation of the method for submitting evidence and the date by which it must be received; and
(6) A statement that the charged or affected party has a right to retain counsel at the party's own expense for purposes of representation.
(b)
Settlement and amendment of the charging letter.
The Deputy Under Secretary may amend, supplement, or withdraw the charging letter at any time with the approval of an administrative law judge if the interests of justice would thereby be served. If a hearing has not been requested, the Deputy Under Secretary will ask the Under Secretary to appoint an administrative law judge to make this determination. If a charging letter is withdrawn after a request for a hearing, the administrative law judge will determine whether the withdrawal will bar the Deputy Under Secretary from seeking sanctions at a later date for the same alleged violation. If there has been no request for a hearing, or if supporting information has not been submitted under § 356.28, the withdrawal will not bar future actions on the same alleged violation. The Deputy Under Secretary and a charged or affected party may settle a charge brought under this subpart by mutual agreement at any time after service of the charging letter; approval of the administrative law judge or the APO Sanctions Board is not necessary.
(c)
Service of charging letter on a resident of the United States.

(i) Mailing a copy by registered or certified mail addressed to the charged or affected party at the party's last known address;
(ii) Leaving a copy with the charged or affected party or with an officer, a managing or general agent, or any other agent authorized by appointment or by law to receive service for the party; or
(iii) Leaving a copy with a person of suitable age and discretion who resides at the party's last known dwelling.
(2) Service made in the manner described in paragraph (c)(1) (ii) or (iii) of this section shall be evidenced by a certificate of service signed by the person making such service, stating the method of service and the identity of the person with whom the charging letter was left.
(d)
Service of charging letter on a non-resident.
If applicable laws or intergovernmental agreements or understandings make the methods of service set forth in paragraph (c) of this section inappropriate or ineffective, service of the charging letter on a person who is not a resident of the United States may be made by any method that is permitted by the country in which the person resides and that, in the opinion of the Deputy Under Secretary, satisfies due process requirements under United States law with respect to notice in administrative proceedings.
§ 356.17
Request to charge.
Upon deciding to initiate a proceeding pursuant to § 356.15, the Deputy Under Secretary will request the authorized agency of the involved FTA country to initiate a proceeding for imposing sanctions for violation of a protective order or a disclosure undertaking by issuing a letter of request to charge that includes a statement of the allegation that a protective order or a disclosure undertaking has been violated and the basis thereof.
§ 356.18
Interim sanctions.
(a) If the Deputy Under Secretary concludes, after issuing a charging letter under § 356.16 and before a final decision is rendered, that interim sanctions are necessary to protect the interests of the Department, an authorized agency of the involved FTA country, or others, including the protection of proprietary information, the Deputy Under Secretary may petition an administrative law judge to impose such sanctions.
(b) The administrative law judge may impose interim sanctions against a person upon determining that:
(1) There is probable cause to believe that there was a violation of a protective order or a disclosure undertaking and the Department is likely to prevail in obtaining sanctions under this subpart;
(2) The Department, authorized agency of the involved FTA country, or others are likely to suffer irreparable harm if the interim sanctions are not imposed; and
(3) The interim sanctions are a reasonable means for protecting the rights of the Department, authorized agency of the involved FTA country, or others while preserving to the greatest extent possible the rights of the person against whom the interim sanctions are proposed.
(c) Interim sanctions which may be imposed include any sanctions that are necessary to protect the rights of the Department, authorized agency of the involved FTA country, or others, including, but not limited to:
(1) Denying a person further access to proprietary information;
(2) Barring a person from representing another person before the Department;
(3) Barring a person from appearing before the Department; and
(4) Requiring the person to destroy and certify to the Department the destruction of all material previously provided by the Department or the investigating authority of the involved FTA country, and all other materials containing the proprietary information, such as briefs, notes, or charts based on any such information received under a protective order or disclosure undertaking.
(d) The Deputy Under Secretary will notify the person against whom interim sanctions are sought of the request for interim sanctions and provide to that person the material submitted to the administrative law judge to support the request. The notice will include a reference to the procedures of this section.
(e) A person against whom interim sanctions are proposed has a right to oppose the request through submission of material to the administrative law judge. The administrative law judge
has discretion to permit oral presentations and to allow further submissions.
(f) The administrative law judge will notify the parties of the decision on interim sanctions and the basis therefor within five days of the conclusion of oral presentations or the date of final written submissions.
(g) If interim sanctions have been imposed, the investigation and any proceedings under this subpart will be conducted on an expedited basis.
(h) An order imposing interim sanctions may be revoked at any time by the administrative law judge and expires automatically upon the issuance of a final order.
(i) The administrative law judge may reconsider imposition of interim sanctions on the basis of new and material evidence or other good cause shown. The Deputy Under Secretary or a person against whom interim sanctions have been imposed may appeal a decision on interim sanctions to the APO Sanctions Board, if such an appeal is certified by the administrative law judge as necessary to prevent undue harm to the Department or authorized agency of the involved FTA country, a person against whom interim sanctions have been imposed or others, or is otherwise in the interests of justice. Interim sanctions which have been imposed remain in effect while an appeal is pending, unless the administrative law judge determines otherwise.
(j) The Deputy Under Secretary may request an administrative law judge to impose emergency interim sanctions to preserve the status quo. Emergency interim sanctions may last no longer than 48 hours, excluding weekends and holidays. The person against whom such emergency interim sanctions are proposed need not be given prior notice or an opportunity to oppose the request for sanctions. The administrative law judge may impose emergency interim sanctions upon determining that the Department or authorized agency of the involved FTA country is, or others are, likely to suffer irreparable harm if such sanctions are not imposed and that the interests of justice would thereby be served. The administrative law judge will promptly notify a person against whom emergency sanctions have been imposed of the sanctions and their duration.
(k) If a hearing has not been requested, the Deputy Under Secretary will request that the Under Secretary appoint an administrative law judge for making determinations under this section.
(l) The Deputy Under Secretary will notify the Secretariat concerning the imposition or revocation of interim sanctions or emergency interim sanctions.
[59 FR 229, Jan. 3, 1994, as amended at 86 FR 70052, Dec. 9, 2021]
§ 356.19
Request for a hearing.
(a) Any party may request a hearing by submitting a written request to the Under Secretary within 30 days after the date of service of the charging letter. However, the Deputy Under Secretary may request a hearing only if the interests of justice would thereby be served.
(b) Upon timely receipt of a request for a hearing, the Under Secretary will appoint an administrative law judge to conduct the hearing and render an initial decision.
§ 356.20
Discovery.
(a)
Voluntary discovery.
All parties are encouraged to engage in voluntary discovery procedures regarding any matter, not privileged, which is relevant to the subject matter of the pending sanctions proceeding.
(b)
Limitations on discovery.
The administrative law judge shall place such limits upon the kind or amount of discovery to be had or the period of time during which discovery may be carried out as shall be consistent with the time limitations set forth in this Part.
(c)
Interrogatories and requests for admissions or production of documents.
A party may serve on any other party interrogatories, requests for admissions, or requests for production of documents for inspection and copying, and the party may then apply to the administrative law judge for such enforcement or protective order as that party deems warranted concerning such discovery. The party will serve a discovery request at least 20 days before the scheduled date of a hearing, if a hearing has been requested and
scheduled, unless the administrative law judge specifies a shorter time period. Copies of interrogatories, requests for admissions, and requests for production of documents and responses thereto will be served on all parties. Matters of fact or law of which admission is requested will be deemed admitted unless, within a period designated in the request (at least 10 days after the date of service of the request, or within such further time as the administrative law judge may allow), the party to whom the request is directed serves upon the requesting party a sworn statement either admitting or denying specifically the matters of which admission is requested or setting forth in detail the reasons why the party cannot truthfully either admit or deny such matters.
(d)
Depositions.
Upon application of a party and for good cause shown, the administrative law judge may order the taking of the testimony of any person who is a party, or under the control or authority of a party, by deposition and the production of specified documents or materials by the person at the deposition. The application shall state the purpose of the deposition and shall set forth the facts sought to be established through the deposition.
(e)
Supplementation of responses.
A party who has responded to a request for discovery with a response that was complete when made is under no duty to supplement the party's response to include information thereafter acquired, except as follows:
(1) A party is under a duty to seasonably supplement the party's response with respect to any question directly addressed to:
(i) The identity and location of persons having knowledge of discoverable matters; and
(ii) The identity of each person expected to be called as an expert witness at a hearing, the subject matter on which the witness is expected to testify, and the substance of the testimony.
(2) A party is under a duty to seasonably amend a prior response if the party obtains information upon the basis of which the party:
(i) Knows the response was incorrect when made; or
(ii) Knows that the response, though correct when made, is no longer true, and the circumstances are such that a failure to amend the response is in substance a knowing concealment.
(3) A duty to supplement responses may be imposed by order of the administrative law judge, agreement of the parties, or at any time prior to a hearing through new requests for supplementation of prior responses.
(f)
Enforcement.
The administrative law judge may order a party to answer designated questions, to produce specified documents or items, or to take any other action in response to a proper discovery request. If a party does not comply with such an order, the administrative law judge may make any determination or enter any order in the proceedings as the administrative law judge deems reasonable and appropriate. The administrative law judge may strike related charges or defenses in whole or in part, or may take particular facts relating to the discovery request to which the party failed or refused to respond as being established for purpose of the proceeding in accordance with the contentions of the party seeking discovery. In issuing a discovery order, the administrative law judge will consider the necessity to protect proprietary information and will not order the release of information in circumstances where it is reasonable to conclude that such release will lead to unauthorized dissemination of such information.
§ 356.21
Subpoenas.
(a)
Application for issuance of a subpoena.
An application for issuance of a subpoena requiring a person to appear and depose or testify at the taking of a deposition or at a hearing shall be made to the administrative law judge. An application for issuance of a subpoena requiring a person to appear and depose or testify and to produce specified documents, papers, books, or other physical exhibits at the taking of a deposition, at a prehearing conference, at a hearing, or under any other circumstances, shall be made in writing to the administrative law judge and shall specify the material to be produced as precisely as possible, showing the general relevancy of the material
and the reasonableness of the scope of the subpoena.
(b)
Use of subpoena for discovery.
Subpoenas may be used by any party for purposes of discovery or for obtaining documents, papers, books, or other physical exhibits for use in evidence, or for both purposes. When used for discovery purposes, a subpoena may require a person to produce and permit the inspection and copying of nonprivileged documents, papers, books, or other physical exhibits which constitute or contain evidence relevant to the subject matter involved and which are in the possession, custody, or control of such person.
(c)
Application for subpoenas for nonparty department records or personnel or for records or personnel of other Government agencies.
(1) An application for issuance of a subpoena requiring the production of nonparty documents, papers, books, physical exhibits, or other material in the records of the Department, or requiring the appearance of an official or employee of the Department, or requiring the production of records or personnel of other Government agencies shall specify as precisely as possible the material to be produced, the nature of the information to be disclosed, or the expected testimony of the official or employee, and shall contain a statement showing the general relevancy of the material, information, or testimony and the reasonableness of the scope of the application, together with a showing that such material, information, or testimony or their substantial equivalent could not be obtained without undue hardship by alternative means.
(2) Such applications shall be ruled upon by the administrative law judge. To the extent that the motion is granted, the administrative law judge shall provide such terms and conditions for the production of the material, the disclosure of the information, or the appearance of the official or employee as may appear necessary and appropriate for the protection of the public interest.
(3) No application for a subpoena for production of documents grounded upon the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) shall be entertained by the administrative law judge.
(d)
Motion to limit or quash.
Any motion to limit or quash a subpoena shall be filed within 10 days after service thereof, or within such other time as the administrative law judge may allow.
(e)
Ex parte rulings on applications for subpoenas.
Applications for the issuance of subpoenas pursuant to this section may be made
ex parte,
and, if so made, such applications and rulings thereon shall remain
ex parte
unless otherwise ordered by the administrative law judge.
(f)
Role of the Under Secretary.
If a hearing has not been requested, the party seeking enforcement will ask the Under Secretary to appoint an administrative law judge to rule on applications for issuance of a subpoena under this section.
§ 356.22
Prehearing conference.
(a)(1) If an administrative hearing has been requested, the administrative law judge will direct the parties to attend a prehearing conference to consider:
(i) Simplification of issues;
(ii) Obtaining stipulations of fact and of documents to avoid unnecessary proof;
(iii) Settlement of the matter;
(iv) Discovery; and
(v) Such other matters as may expedite the disposition of the proceedings.
(2) Any relevant and significant stipulations or admissions will be incorporated into the initial decision.
(b) If a prehearing conference is impractical, the administrative law judge will direct the parties to correspond with each other or to confer by telephone or otherwise to achieve the purposes of such a conference.
§ 356.23
Hearing.
(a)
Scheduling of hearing.
The administrative law judge will schedule the hearing at a reasonable time, date, and place, which will be in Washington, DC, unless the administrative law judge determines otherwise based upon good cause shown, that another location would better serve the interests of justice. In setting the date, the administrative law judge will give due regard to the need for the parties adequately
to prepare for the hearing and the importance of expeditiously resolving the matter.
(b)
Joinder or consolidation.
The administrative law judge may order joinder or consolidation if sanctions are proposed against more than one party or if violations of more than one protective order or disclosure undertaking are alleged if to do so would expedite processing of the cases and not adversely affect the interests of the parties.
(c)
Hearing procedures.
Hearings will be conducted in a fair and impartial manner by the administrative law judge, who may limit attendance at any hearing or portion thereof if necessary or advisable in order to protect proprietary information from improper disclosure. The rules of evidence prevailing in courts of law shall not apply, and all evidentiary material the administrative law judge determines to be relevant and material to the proceeding and not unduly repetitious may be received into evidence and given appropriate weight. The administrative law judge may make such orders and determinations regarding the admissibility of evidence, conduct of examination and cross-examination, and similar matters as are necessary or appropriate to ensure orderliness in the proceedings. The administrative law judge will ensure that a record of the hearing will be taken by reporter or by electronic recording, and will order such part of the record to be sealed as is necessary to protect proprietary information.
(d)
Rights of parties.
At a hearing each party shall have the right to:
(1) Introduce and examine witnesses and submit physical evidence;
(2) Confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses;
(3) Present oral argument; and
(4) Receive a transcript or recording of the proceedings, upon request, subject to the administrative law judge's orders regarding sealing the record.
(e)
Representation.
Each charged or affected party has a right to represent himself or herself or to retain private counsel for that purpose. The Chief Counsel will represent the Department, unless the General Counsel of the Department determines otherwise. The administrative law judge may disallow a representative if such representation constitutes a conflict of interest or is otherwise not in the interests of justice and may debar a representative for contumacious conduct relating to the proceedings.
(f)
Ex parte communications.
The parties and their representatives may not make any
ex parte
communications to the administrative law judge concerning the merits of the allegations or any matters at issue, except as provided in § 356.18(j) regarding emergency interim sanctions.
§ 356.24
Proceeding without a hearing.
If no party has requested a hearing, the Deputy Under Secretary, within 40 days after the date of service of a charging letter, will submit for inclusion into the record and provide each charged or affected party information supporting the allegations in the charging letter. Each charged or affected party has the right to file a written response to the information and supporting documentation within 30 days after the date of service of the information provided by the Deputy Under Secretary unless the Deputy Under Secretary alters the time period for good cause. The Deputy Under Secretary may allow the parties to submit further information and argument.
§ 356.25
Witnesses.
Witnesses summoned before the Department shall be paid the same fees and mileage that are paid witnesses in the courts of the United States.
§ 356.26
Initial decision.
(a)
Initial decision.
The administrative law judge, if a hearing was requested, or the Deputy Under Secretary will submit an initial decision to the APO Sanctions Board, providing copies to the parties. The administrative law judge or the Deputy Under Secretary will ordinarily issue the decision within 20 days of the conclusion of the hearing, if one was held, or within 15 days of the date of service of final written submissions. The initial decision will be based solely on evidence received into the record and the pleadings of the parties.
(b)
Findings and conclusions.
The initial decision will state findings and conclusions as to whether a person has violated a protective order or a disclosure undertaking; the basis for those findings and conclusions; and whether the sanctions proposed in the charging letter, or lesser included sanctions, should be imposed against the charged or affected party. The administrative law judge or the Deputy Under Secretary may impose sanctions only upon determining that the preponderance of the evidence supports a finding of violation of a protective order or a disclosure undertaking and that the sanctions are warranted against the charged or affected party.
(c)
Finality of decision.
If the APO Sanctions Board has not issued a decision on the matter within 60 days after issuance of the initial decision, the initial decision becomes the final decision of the Department.
§ 356.27
Final decision.
(a)
APO Sanctions Board.
Upon request of a party, the initial decision will be reviewed by the members of the APO Sanctions Board. The Board consists of the Under Secretary for International Trade, who shall serve as Chairperson, the Under Secretary for Economic Affairs, and the General Counsel.
(b)
Comments on initial decision.
Within 30 days after issuance of the initial decision, a party may submit written comments to the APO Sanctions Board on the initial decision, which the Board will consider when reviewing the initial decision. The parties have no right to an oral presentation, although the Board may allow oral argument in its discretion.
(c)
Final decision by the APO Sanctions Board.
Within 60 days but not sooner than 30 days after issuance of an initial decision, the APO Sanctions Board may issue a final decision which adopts the initial decision in its entirety; differs in whole or in part from the initial decision, including the imposition of lesser included sanctions; or remands the matter to the administrative law judge or the Deputy Under Secretary for further consideration. The only sanctions that the Board can impose are those sanctions proposed in the charging letter or lesser included sanctions.
(d)
(d)
Contents of final decision.
If the final decision of the APO Sanctions Board does not remand the matter and differs from the initial decision, it will state findings and conclusions which differ from the initial decision, if any, the basis for those findings and conclusions, and the sanctions which are to be imposed, to the extent they differ from the sanctions in the initial decision.
(e)
Public notice of sanctions.
If the final decision is that there has been a violation of a protective order or a disclosure undertaking and that sanctions are to be imposed, notice of the decision will be published in the
Federal Register
and forwarded to the United States section of the Secretariat. Such publication will be no sooner than 30 days after issuance of a final decision or after a motion to reconsider has been denied, if such a motion was filed. If the final decision is made in a proceeding based upon a request to charge by an authorized agency of an FTA country, the decision will be forwarded to the Secretariat of the involved FTA country for transmittal to the authorized agency of the FTA country for publication in the official publication or other appropriate action. The Deputy Under Secretary will also provide such information to the ethics panel or other disciplinary body of the appropriate bar associations or other professional associations whenever the Deputy Under Secretary subjects a charged or affected party to a sanction under § 356.12(a)(2) and to any Federal agency likely to have an interest in the matter and will cooperate in any disciplinary actions by any association or agency.
[59 FR 229, Jan. 3, 1994, as amended at 86 FR 70051, Dec. 9, 2021]
§ 356.28
Reconsideration.
Any party may file a motion for reconsideration with the APO Sanctions Board. The party must state with particularity the grounds for the motion, including any facts or points of law which the party claims the APO Sanctions Board has overlooked or misapplied. The party may file the motion within 30 days of the issuance of the
final decision or the adoption of the initial decision as the final decision, except that if the motion is based on the discovery of new and material evidence which was not known, and could not reasonably have been discovered through due diligence prior to the close of the record, the party shall file the motion within 15 days of the discovery of the new and material evidence. The party shall provide a copy of the motion to all other parties. Opposing parties may file a response within 30 days of the date of service of the motion. The response shall be considered as part of the record. The parties have no right to an oral presentation on a motion for reconsideration, but the Board may permit oral argument at its discretion. If the motion to reconsider is granted, the Board will review the record and affirm, modify, or reverse the original decision or remand the matter for further consideration to an administrative law judge or the Deputy Under Secretary, as warranted.
§ 356.29
Confidentiality.
(a) All proceedings involving allegations of a violation of a protective order or a disclosure undertaking shall be kept confidential until such time as the Department makes a final decision under these regulations, which is no longer subject to reconsideration, imposing a sanction.
(b) The charged party or counsel for the charged party will be, to the extent possible, granted access to proprietary information in these proceedings, as necessary, under administrative protective order, consistent with the provisions of § 356.10.
§ 356.30
Sanctions for violations of a protective order for privileged information.
The provisions of this subpart shall apply to persons who are alleged to have violated a Protective Order for Privileged Information.

§ 360.101
Steel import licensing.
(a)
In general.
(1) All imports of basic steel mill products are subject to the import licensing requirements. These products are listed on the Steel Import Monitoring and Analysis (SIMA) system website (
https://www.trade.gov/steel
). Registered users will be able to obtain steel import licenses on the SIMA system website. This website contains two sections related to import licensing—the online registration system and the automatic steel import license issuance system. Information gathered from these licenses will be aggregated and posted on the import monitoring section of the SIMA system website.
(2) A single license may cover multiple products as long as certain information on the license (
e.g.
, importer, exporter, manufacturer and country of origin) remains the same. However, separate licenses for steel entered under a single entry will be required if
the information differs. As a result, a single Customs entry may require more than one steel import license. The applicable license(s) must cover the total quantity of steel entered and should cover the same information provided on the Customs entry summary.
(b)
Entries for consumption.
All entries for consumption of covered steel products, other than the exception for “informal entries” listed in paragraph (d) of this section, will require an import license prior to the filing of Customs entry summary documents. The license number(s) must be reported on the entry summary (Customs Form 7501) at the time of filing. There is no requirement to present physical copies of the license forms at the time of entry summary. However, copies must be maintained in accordance with Customs' normal requirements. Entry summaries submitted without the required license number(s) will be considered incomplete and will be subject to liquidated damages for violation of the bond condition requiring timely completion of entry.
(c)
Foreign Trade Zone entries.
All shipments of covered steel products into a foreign trade zones (FTZ), known as FTZ admissions, will require an import license prior to the filing of FTZ admission documents. The license number(s) must be reported on the application for FTZ admission and/or status designation (Customs form 214) at the time of filing. There is no requirement to present physical copies of the license forms at the time of FTZ admission; however, copies must be maintained in accordance with Customs' normal requirements. FTZ admission documents submitted without the required license number(s) will not be considered complete and will be subject to liquidated damages for violation of the bond condition requiring timely completion of admission. A further steel license will not be required for shipments from zones into the commerce of the United States.
(d)
Informal entries.
No import license shall be required on informal entries of covered steel products, such as merchandise valued at less than $2,000. This exemption applies to informal entries only, imports of steel valued at less than $2,000 that are part of a formal entry will require a license. For additional information, refer to 19 CFR 143.21 through 143.28.
(e)
Other non-consumption entries.
Import licenses are not required on temporary importation bond (TIB) entries, transportation and exportation (T
E) entries or entries into a bonded warehouse. Covered steel products withdrawn for consumption from a bonded warehouse will require a license at the entry summary.
[70 FR 12136, Mar. 11, 2005, as amended at 85 FR 56171, Sept. 11, 2020]
§ 360.102
Online registration.
(a)
In general.
(1) Any importer, importing company, customs broker or importer's agent with a U.S. street address may register and obtain the user identification number necessary to log on to the automatic steel import license issuance system. Foreign companies may obtain a user identification number if they have a U.S. address through which they may be reached; P.O. boxes will not be accepted. A user identification number will be issued within two business days. Companies will be able to register online through the SIMA system Web site. However, should a company prefer to apply for a user identification number non-electronically, a phone/fax option will be available at Commerce during regular business hours.
(2) This user identification number will be required in order to log on to the steel import license issuance system. A single user identification number will be issued to an importer, customs broker or importer's agent. Operating units within the company (
e.g.
, individual branches, divisions or employees) will all use the same basic company user identification code but can supply suffixes to identify the branches. The steel import license issuance system will be designed to allow multiple users of a single identification number from different locations within the company to enter information simultaneously.
(b)
Information required to obtain a user identification number.
In order to obtain a user identification number, the importer, importing company, customs broker or importer's agent will be
required to provide general information. This information will include: the filer company name, employer identification number (EIN) or Customs ID number (where no EIN is available), U.S. street address, phone number, contact information and e-mail address for both the company headquarters and any branch offices that will be applying for steel licenses. It is the responsibility of the applicant to keep the information up-to-date. This information will not be released by Commerce, except as required by U.S. law.
§ 360.103
Automatic issuance of import licenses.
(a)
In general.
Steel import licenses will be issued to registered importers, customs brokers or their agents through an automatic steel import licensing system. The licenses will be issued automatically after the completion of the form.
(b)
Customs entry number.
Filers are not required to report a Customs entry number to obtain an import license but are encouraged to do so if the Customs entry number is known at the time of filing for the license.
(c)
Information required to obtain an import license.
(1) The following information is required to be reported in order to obtain an import license (if using the automatic licensing system, some of this information will be provided automatically from information submitted as part of the registration process):
(i) Filer company name and address;
(ii) Filer contact name, phone number, and email address;
(iii) Entry type (
i.e.,
Consumption, FTZ);
(iv) Importer name;
(v) Exporter name;
(vi) Manufacturer name (filer may state “unknown”);
(vii) Country of origin;
(viii) Country of exportation;
(ix) Expected date of export;
(x) Expected date of import;
(xi) Expected port of entry;
(xii) Current Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) number (from Chapters 72 or 73);
(xiii) Country where the steel used in the manufacture of the product was melted and poured (see paragraph (c)(3) of this section for further instruction);
(xiv) Quantity (in kilograms); and
(xv) Customs value (U.S. $).
(2) Certain fields will be automatically filled out by the automatic license system based on information submitted by the filer (
e.g.
, product category, unit value). Filers should review these fields to help confirm the accuracy of the submitted data.
(3)(i) The field in the license application requiring identification of the country where the steel used in the manufacture of the product was melted and poured (
see
paragraph (c)(1)(xiii) of this section) applies to the original location where the raw steel is:
(A) First produced in a steel-making furnace in a liquid state; and then
(B) Poured into its first solid shape.
(ii) The first solid state can take the form of either a semi-finished product (slab, billets or ingots) or a finished steel mill product. The location of melt and pour is customarily identified on mill test certificates that are commonplace in steel production, generated at each stage of the production process, and maintained in the ordinary course of business. The reporting requirement in paragraph (c)(1)(xiii) of this section will not apply to raw materials used in the steel manufacturing process (
i.e.,
steel scrap; iron ore; pig iron; reduced, processed, or pelletized iron ore; or raw alloys).
(4) Upon completion of the form, the importer, customs broker or the importer's agent will certify as to the accuracy and completeness of the information and submit the form electronically. After refreshing the page, the system will automatically issue a steel import license number. The refreshed form containing the submitted information and the newly issued license number will appear on the screen (the “license form”). Filers can print the license form themselves only at that time. For security purposes, users will not be able to retrieve licenses themselves from the license system at a later date for reprinting. If needed, copies of completed license forms can be requested from Commerce during normal business hours.
(d)
Duration of the steel import license.
The steel import license can be applied
for up to 60 days prior to the expected date of importation and until the date of filing of the entry summary documents, or in the case of FTZ entries, the filing of Customs form 214. The steel import license is valid for 75 days; however, import licenses that were valid on the date of importation but expired prior to the filing of entry summary documents will be accepted.
(e)
Correcting submitted license information.
Users will need to correct licenses themselves if they determine that there was an error submitted. To access a previously issued license, a user must log on with his user identification code and identify the license number and the volume (in kilograms) for the first product shown on the license. The information on the license should match the information presented on the CF-7501 entry summary document as closely as possible; this includes the value and volume of the shipment, the expected date of importation, and the customs district of entry.
(f)
Low-value licenses.
There is one exception to the requirement for obtaining a unique license for each Customs entry. If the total value of the covered steel portion of an entry is less than $5,000, applicants may apply to Commerce for a low-value license that can be used in lieu of a single-entry license for low-value entries.

§ 360.104
Steel import monitoring.
(a) Commerce will maintain an import monitoring system on the SIMA system website that will report certain aggregate information on imports of steel mill products obtained from the steel licenses and, where available, from the U.S. Census Bureau. Aggregate data will be reported, as appropriate, on a monthly basis by country of origin, country of melt and pour, and relevant steel mill product groupings, etc. and will include import quantity (metric tons), import Customs value (U.S. $), and average unit value ($/metric ton). The website will also contain certain aggregate data at the 6-digit Harmonized Tariff Schedule level and will also present a range of historical data for comparison purposes. Provision of aggregate data on the website may be revisited should concerns arise over the possible release of proprietary data.
(b) Reported monthly import data will be refreshed each week, as appropriate, with new data on licenses issued during the previous week. This data will also be adjusted periodically for cancelled or unused steel import licenses, as appropriate. Additionally, outdated license data will be replaced, where available, with information from the U.S. Census Bureau.
[85 FR 56171, Sept. 11, 2020]
§ 360.105
[Reserved]
§ 360.106
Fees.
No fees will be charged for obtaining a user identification number, issuing a steel import license or accessing the steel import surge monitoring system.
§ 360.107
Hours of operation.
The automatic licensing system will generally be accessible 24 hours a day, 7 days a week but may be unavailable at selected times for server maintenance. If the system is unavailable for an extended period of time, parties will be able to obtain licenses from Commerce directly via fax during regular business hours. Should the system be inaccessible for an extended period of time, Commerce would advise Customs to consider this as part of mitigation on any liquidated damage claims that may be issued.
§ 360.108
Loss of electronic licensing privileges.
Should Commerce determine that a filer consistently files inaccurate licensing information or otherwise abuses the licensing system, Commerce may revoke its electronic licensing privileges without prior notice. The filer will then only be able to obtain a license directly from Commerce. Because of the additional time need to review such forms, Commerce may require up to 10 working days to process such forms. Delays in filing caused by the removal of a filer's electronic filing privilege will not be considered a mitigating factor by the U.S. Customs Service.

§ 361.101
Aluminum import licensing.
(a)
In general.
(1) All imports of basic aluminum products are subject to the import licensing requirements imposed by the U.S. Department of Commerce (Commerce). These products are listed on the Aluminum Import Monitoring and Analysis (AIM) system website (
https://www.trade.gov/aluminum
). Registered users will be able to obtain aluminum import licenses on the AIM system website. This website contains two sections related to import licensing—the online registration system and the automatic aluminum import license issuance system. Aluminum import licenses must be provided to U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP or Customs) as discussed in this section. Information gathered from these licenses will be aggregated and posted on the import monitoring section of the AIM system website.
(2) A single license may cover multiple products as long as certain information on the license (
e.g.,
importer, exporter, manufacturer and country of origin) remains the same. However, separate licenses for aluminum entered under a single entry will be required if the information differs. As a result, a single Customs entry may require more than one aluminum import license. The applicable license(s) must cover the total quantity of aluminum entered and should cover the same information provided on the Customs entry summary.
(b)
Entries for consumption.
All entries for consumption of covered aluminum products, other than the exceptions discussed in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, will require an import license prior to the filing of Customs entry summary documents, or its electronic equivalent. The license number(s) must be reported on the entry summary (Customs Form 7501), or its electronic equivalent, at the time of filing. There is no requirement to present physical copies of the license forms at the time of entry summary. However, copies must be maintained in accordance with Customs' normal requirements. Entry summaries submitted without the required license number(s) will be considered incomplete and will be subject to liquidated damages for violation of the bond condition requiring timely completion of entry.
(c)
Foreign Trade Zone admissions.
All shipments of covered aluminum products into a foreign trade zone (FTZ), known as FTZ admissions, will require an import license prior to the filing of FTZ admission documents, or its electronic equivalents. The license number(s) must be reported on the application for FTZ admission and/or status designation (Customs Form 214) at the time of filing. There is no requirement to present physical copies of the license forms at the time of FTZ admission; however, copies must be maintained in accordance with Customs' normal requirements. FTZ admission documents submitted without the required license number(s) will not be considered complete and will be subject to liquidated damages for violation of the bond condition requiring timely completion of admission. The aluminum license for FTZ admission does not expire, and a further aluminum license will not be required for shipments of entries for consumption from zones into the commerce of the United States.
(d)
Informal entries.
No import license shall be required on informal entries of covered aluminum products, such as merchandise valued at less than $2,500. This exemption applies to informal entries only; imports of aluminum valued at less than $2,500 that are part of a formal entry will require a license. For additional information, refer to 19 CFR 143.21 through 143.28.
(e)
Other non-consumption entries.
Import licenses are not required on temporary importation bond (TIB) entries, transportation and exportation (T
E) entries or entries into a bonded warehouse. Covered aluminum products withdrawn for consumption from a bonded warehouse will require a license at the entry summary in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.
§ 361.102
Online registration.
(a)
In general.
(1) Any importer, importing company, customs broker or importer's agent with a U.S. street address may register and obtain the username necessary to log on to the automatic aluminum import license issuance system. Foreign companies may obtain a username if they have a U.S. address through which they may be reached; P.O. boxes will not be accepted. A username will be issued within two business days. Companies will be able to register online through the AIM system website. However, should a company prefer to apply for a username non-electronically, a phone/email option will be available at Commerce during regular business hours.
(2) This username will be required in order to log on to the aluminum import license issuance system. A single username will be issued to an importer, customs broker or importer's agent. Operating units within the company (
e.g.,
individual branches, divisions or employees) will all use the same basic company username but can supply suffixes to identify the branches. The aluminum import license issuance system will be designed to allow multiple users of a single identification number from different locations within the company to enter information simultaneously.
(b)
Information required to obtain a username.
In order to obtain a username, the importer, importing company, customs broker or importer's agent will be required to provide general information. This information will include: The filer company name, employer identification number (EIN) or Customs ID number (the Customs-issued importer number) (where no EIN is available), U.S. street address, phone number, contact information and email address for both the company headquarters and any branch offices that will be applying for aluminum licenses. It is the responsibility of the applicant to keep the information up to date. This information will not be released by Commerce, except as required by U.S. law.
§ 361.103
Automatic issuance of import licenses.
(a)
In general.
Aluminum import licenses will be issued to registered importers, customs brokers or their agents through an automatic aluminum import licensing system. The licenses will be issued automatically after the completion of the form.
(b)
Customs entry number.
Filers are not required to report a Customs entry number to obtain an import license but are encouraged to do so if the Customs entry number is known at the time of filing for the license.
(c)
Information required to obtain an import license.
(1) The following information is required to be reported in order to obtain an import license (if using the automatic licensing system, some of this information will be provided automatically from information submitted as part of the registration process):
(i) Filer company name and address;
(ii) Filer contact name, phone number, email address;
(iii) Entry type (
i.e.,
Consumption, FTZ);
(iv) Importer name;
(v) Exporter name;
(vi) Manufacturer name (filer may state “unknown”);
(vii) Country of origin;
(viii) Country of exportation;
(ix) Expected date of export;
(x) Expected date of import;
(xi) Expected port of entry;
(xii) Current Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) number (from Chapter 76);
(xiii) Country where the largest volume of primary aluminum used in the manufacture of the product was smelted (see paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section);
(xiv) Country where the second largest volume of primary aluminum used in the manufacture of the product was smelted (see paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section);
(xv) Country where the product was most recently cast (see paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this section);
(xvi) Quantity (in kilograms); and
(xvii) Customs value (US$).
(2) Certain fields will be automatically filled out by the automatic license system based on information submitted by the filer (
e.g.,
product category, unit value). Filers should review these fields to help confirm the accuracy of the submitted data.
(3)(i) For purposes of paragraph (c)(1)(xiii) of this section:
(A) The field in the license application requiring identification of the country where the largest volume of primary aluminum used in the manufacture of the product was smelted applies to the country where the largest volume of new aluminum metal is produced from alumina (or aluminum oxide) by the electrolytic Hall-Héroult process.
(B) Filers may state “not applicable” for this field if the product contains only secondary aluminum and no primary aluminum. Secondary aluminum is defined as aluminum metal that is produced from recycled aluminum scrap through a re-melting process.
(C) For license applications up to June 28, 2022, filers may state “unknown” for this field. Effective June 29, 2022, filers may not state “unknown” for this field.
(ii) For purposes of paragraph (c)(1)(xiv) of this section:
(A) The field in the license application requiring identification of the country where the second largest volume of primary aluminum used in the manufacture of the product was smelted applies to the country where the second largest volume of new aluminum metal is produced from alumina (or aluminum oxide) by the electrolytic Hall-Héroult process.
(B) Filers may state “not applicable” for this field if the product does not contain a second largest volume of primary aluminum or if the product contains only secondary aluminum and no primary aluminum. Secondary aluminum is defined as aluminum metal that is produced from recycled aluminum scrap through a re-melting process.
(C) For license applications up to June 28, 2022, filers may state “unknown” for this field. Effective June 29, 2022, filers may not state “unknown” for this field.
(iii) For purposes of paragraph (c)(1)(xv) of this section:
(A) The field in the license application requiring identification of the country where the product was most recently cast applies to the country where the aluminum (with or without alloying elements) was last liquified by heat and cast into a solid state. The final solid state can take the form of either a semi-finished product (slab, billets or ingots) or a finished aluminum product.
(B) Filers may not state “not applicable” for this field.
(C) Filers may not state “unknown” for this field.
(4) Upon completion of the form, the importer, customs broker or the importer's agent will certify as to the accuracy and completeness of the information and submit the form electronically. After refreshing the page, the system will automatically issue an aluminum import license number. The refreshed form containing the submitted information and the newly issued license number will appear on the screen (the “license form”). Filers can print the license form themselves only at that time. For security purposes, users will not be able to retrieve licenses themselves from the license system at a later date for reprinting. If needed, copies of completed license forms can be requested from Commerce during normal business hours.
(d)
Duration of the aluminum import license.
The aluminum import license can be applied for up to 60 days prior to the expected date of importation and until the date of filing of the entry summary documents, or in the case of FTZ admissions, the filing of Customs Form 214, or their electronic equivalents. With the exception of the licenses for FTZ admission (
see
§ 361.101(c)), the aluminum import license is valid for 75 days; however, import licenses that were valid on the date of importation but expired prior to the filing of entry summary data will be accepted.
(e)
Correcting submitted license information.
Users will need to correct licenses themselves if they determine that there was an error submitted. To access a previously issued license, a user must log on with his username and identify the license number and the volume (quantity in kilograms) for the first product shown on the license. The information on the license should match the information presented in the entry summary data as closely as possible. This includes the value and quantity of the shipment, the expected date of importation, and the Customs port of entry.
(f)
Low-value licenses.
There is one exception to the requirement for obtaining a unique license for each Customs entry. If the total value of the covered aluminum portion of an entry is less than $5,000, applicants may apply to Commerce for a low-value license that can be used in lieu of a single-entry license for low-value entries.

§ 361.104
Aluminum import monitoring.
(a) Commerce will maintain an import monitoring system on the public AIM system website that will report certain aggregate information on imports of aluminum products obtained from the aluminum licenses and, where available, from publicly available U.S. import statistics. Aggregate data will be reported, as appropriate, on a monthly basis by country of origin, country of smelt, country of last cast, relevant aluminum product grouping, etc., and will include import quantity (metric tons), import Customs value (U.S. $), and average unit value ($/metric ton). The website will also contain certain aggregate data at the 6-digit Harmonized Tariff Schedule level and will also present a range of historical data for comparison purposes. Provision of aggregate data on the website may be revisited should concerns arise over the possible release of proprietary data.
(b) Reported monthly import data will be refreshed each week, as appropriate, with new data on licenses issued during the previous week. This data will also be adjusted periodically for cancelled or unused aluminum import licenses, as appropriate. Additionally, outdated license data will be replaced, where available, with publicly available U.S. import statistics.
