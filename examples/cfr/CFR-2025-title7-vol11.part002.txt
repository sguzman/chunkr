(i) The spare parts bid price shall be based upon the required quantities of spares shown in Item 6.2 of appendix C of this section, and shall be added to the base bid for comparison purposes in awarding the bid. It is the supplier's responsibility to provide all spares required by this section. If the supplier neglects to list certain spare parts in Item 6.2 of appendix C of this section, but they are necessary to comply with this section, they shall be provided by the supplier at no additional cost to the owner.
(A) “Units” are defined as user replaceable components used in the central office equipment. “Spare Parts” are direct replacements for units. Spare parts are necessary for the maintenance and diagnostic operations where the suspected faulty unit may be removed and a spare part substituted in anticipation that the trouble will be cleared.
(B) Examples of units for which spare parts should be furnished are printed circuit cards; circuit pack assemblies; fuses; and power supplies.
(C) Spare parts are not required as part of this addendum for items such as connectorized cables, nuts, bolts, and similar hardware; nor for items which can be obtained from sources other than the bidder such as battery cells, chargers, powerboards, magnetic tape transport assemblies, disk drives, ringing machines, recorded announcement machines, loop extenders and voice frequency repeaters, fire bars, teletypewriters, and video monitors.
(D) When 100 or more like units are used in the hosts and RST's to be bid, the quantity of spares to be furnished is determined by multiplying the total number of like units in the contract by .05 or .03, as applicable, and rounding off to the next lowest integer. For example, 119 Class 1 units require five spares; 120 require six.
(E) When alternates are required, the price of the spare parts for the alternates shall be included with the price of the alternate.
(F) For equipment in which the line cards consist of a number of plug-in “daughter” boards on a “mother” board, the line card is defined as the “daughter” board unit. In a similar manner for those designs which have line cards backed up by a “control card,” the “control card” is not, by definition, a line card.
(G) The quantities of spare parts determined in paragraph (x)(6)(vi) of this section are a minimum quantity. The bidder may add quantities of spare parts to bring the number of spare parts up to the bidder's list of spare parts necessary for proper operation in the field.
(ii) A Class 1 unit does not have automatic transfer to a redundant or standby pool of identical units, and provides any function for 24 or more lines or trunks or for all trunks in a group. Nonredundant digital trunk interfaces are included in this category.
(iii) A Class 2 unit has automatic transfer to a redundant or standby pool of identical units, and provides any function for 24 or more lines or trunks or for all trunks in a group. Redundant digital trunk interfaces and units of a redundant stored program processor are included in this category.
(iv) A Class 3 unit does not have automatic transfer to a redundant or standby pool of identical units and provides any function for no more than 23 lines or trunks or for less than all trunks in a group. Nonredundant analog trunks are included in this category. Excluded from this category are line cards, which are in Class 4.
(v) A Class 4 unit has automatic transfer to a redundant or standby pool of identical units and provides any function for no more than 23 lines or trunks or for less than all trunks in a group. Also, any line cards are in Class 4.

Sample Preparation.
Prepare test sample in accordance with the procedures specified in ASTM D 4565-90a.
(c)
Sample Conditioning and Testing.
Remove the sample from the tensile tester prior to testing and condition for one hour at 50 ±2 °C. Test immediately in accordance with the procedure specified in ASTM D 4565-90a. A minimum outer jacket slip strength of 67 newtons (15 pound-force) is required. Record the load attained.
(6)
Humidity Exposure.
(a) Repeat steps (III)(1)(a) through (III)(1)(c)(iii) of this appendix for separate set of samples B, C, D and E which have not been subjected to prior environmental conditioning.
(b) Immediately after completing the measurements, expose the test sample to 100 temperature cyclings. Relative humidity within the chamber must be maintained at 90 ±2 percent. One cycle consists of beginning at a stabilized chamber and test sample temperature of 52 ±1 °C, increasing the temperature to 57 ±1 °C, allowing the chamber and test samples to stabilize at this level, then dropping the temperature back to 52 ±1 °C.
(c) Repeat steps (III)(1)(d)(ii) through (III)(5)(c) of this appendix.
(7)
Temperature Cycling.
(a) Repeat steps (III)(1)(a) through (III)(1)(c)(iii) of this appendix for separate set of samples B, C, D and E which have not been subjected to prior environmental conditioning.
(b) Immediately after completing the measurements, subject the test sample to 10 cycles of temperature between −40 °C and + 60 °C. The test sample must be held at each temperature extreme for a minimum of 1
1/2
hours during each cycle of temperature. The air within the temperature cycling chamber must be circulated throughout the duration of the cycling.
(c) Repeat steps (III)(1)(d)(ii) through (III)(5)(c) of this appendix.
(IV)
Control Sample
—(1)
Test Samples.
A separate set of lengths for samples A, C, D, and E must have been maintained at 23 ±3 °C for at least 48 hours before the testing.
(2) Repeat steps (III)(2) through (III)(5)(c) of this appendix except use length A instead of length B.
(3)
Surge Test.
(a) One length of sample F must be used to measure the breakdown between conductors while the other length of F must be used to measure core to shield breakdown.
(b) The samples must be capable of withstanding, without damage, a single surge voltage of 20 kilovolts peak between conductors, and 35 kilovolts peak between conductors and the shield as hereinafter described. The surge voltage must be developed from a capacitor discharge through a forming resistor connected in parallel with the dielectric of the test sample. The surge generator constants must be such as to produce a surge of 1.5 × 40 microseconds wave shape.
(c) The shape of the generated wave must be determined at a reduced voltage by connecting an oscilloscope across the forming resistor with the wire sample connected in parallel with the forming resistor. The capacitor bank is charged to the test voltage and then discharged through the forming resistor and test sample. The test sample will be considered to have passed the test if there is no distinct change in the wave shape obtained with the initial reduced voltage compared to that obtained after the application of the test voltage.

The 10 meter (33 foot) section of length B must be tested.
(b)
Test sample preparation.
Prepare the sample by removing the jacket, shield or shield/armor, and core wrap for sufficient distance to allow one end to be accessed for test connections. Cut out a series of 6 millimeter (0.25 inch.) diameter holes along the test sample, at 30 centimeters (1 foot) intervals progressing successively 90 degrees around the circumference of the cable. Assure that the cable core is exposed at each hole by slitting the core wrapper. Place the prepared sample in a dry vessel which when filled will maintain a one meter (3 foot) head of water over 6 meters (20 feet) of uncoiled cable. Extend and fasten the ends of the cable so they will be above the water line and the pairs are rigidly held for the duration of the test.

Collect the water leakage from the end of the test sample during the test and weigh to the nearest 0.1 gram. Immediately after the one hour test, seal the ends of the cable with a thin layer of grease and remove all visible water from the closure, being careful not to remove water that penetrated into the core during the test. Reweigh the sample and determine the weight of water that penetrated into the core. The weight of water that penetrated into the core must not exceed 6 grams.
(ii)
Option B.
Fill the closure with a 0.2 gram sodium fluorscein per liter water solution and apply a continuous pressure 10 ±0.7 kilopascals (1.5 ±0.1 pounds per square inch gauge) for one hour. Catch and weigh any water that leaks from the end of the cable during the one hour period. If no water leaks from the sample, carefully remove the water from the closure. Then carefully remove the jacket, shield or shield/ armor, and core wrap
one at a time, examining with an ultraviolet light source for water penetration. After removal of the core wrap, carefully dissect the core and examine for water penetration within the core. Where water penetration is observed, measure the penetration distance. The distance of water penetration into the core must not exceed 127 millimeters (5.0 inches).

The surge generator constants must be such as to produce a surge of 1.5 × 40 microsecond wave shape.
(c) The shape of the generated wave must be determined at a reduced voltage by connecting an oscilloscope across the forming resistor with the cable sample connected in parallel with the forming resistor. The capacitor bank is charged to the test voltage and then discharged through the forming resistor and test sample. The test sample will be considered to have passed the test if there is no distinct change in the wave shape obtained with the initial reduced voltage compared to that obtained after the application of the test voltage.

by a communications channel with defined maximum loss or distortion. Bandwidth indicates the information-carrying capacity of a channel.
(6)
Birefringence
means the decomposition of a pulse of light entering the fiber into “two polarized pulses” traveling at different velocities due to the different refractive indexes in the polarization axes in which the electric fields oscillate. Different refractive indexes in the fiber may be caused by an asymmetric fiber core, internal manufacturing stresses, or through external stresses from cabling and installation of the fiber optic cable, such as bending and twisting.
(7)
Cable cutoff wavelength
means the shortest wavelength at which only one mode light can be transmitted in any of the single mode fibers of an optical fiber cable.
(8)
Chromatic dispersion
means the broadening of a light pulse as it travels down the length of an optical fiber, resulting in different spectral components of the light pulse traveling at different speeds, due to the fact that the index of refraction of the fiber core is different for different wavelengths.
(9)
Cladding
means the outer layer of an optical fiber made of glass or other transparent material that is fused to the fiber core. The cladding concentrically surrounds the fiber core. It has a lower refractive index than the core, so light travelling in the fiber is maintained in the core by internal reflection at the core-cladding interface.
(10)
Core
means the central region of an optical waveguide or fiber which has a higher refractive index than the cladding through which light is transmitted.
(11)
Cutoff wavelength
means, in single mode fiber, the shortest wavelength at which only the fundamental mode of an optical wavelength can propagate.
(12)
Dielectric cable
means a cable which has neither metallic members nor other electrically conductive materials or elements.
(13)
Differential group delay
means the arrival time differential of the two polarized light components of a light pulse traveling through the optical fiber due to birefringence.

(20)
Mode-field diameter
means the diameter of the cross-sectional area of an optical fiber which includes the core and portion of the cladding where the majority of the light travels in a single mode fiber.
(21)
Multimode fiber

(22)
Numerical Aperture (NA)
means an optical fiber parameter that indicates the angle of acceptance of light into a fiber.
(23)
Optical fiber
means any fiber made of dielectric material that guides light.
(24)
Optical point discontinuities
means the localized deviations of the optical fiber loss characteristic which location and magnitude may be determined by appropriate OTDR measurements of the fiber.

(26)
Polarization mode dispersion
means, for a particular length of fiber, the average of the differential group delays of the two polarized components of light pulses traveling in the fiber, when the light pulses are generated from a sufficient narrow band source. The differential group delay varies randomly with time and wavelength. The term PMD is used in the industry in the general sense to indicate the phenomenon of birefringence (polarized light having different group velocities), and used specifically to refer to the value of time delay expected in a specific length of fiber.
(27)
PMD
Q
means the statistical upper bound for the PMD coefficient of a fiber optic cable link composed of M number of randomly chosen concatenated fiber optic cable sections of the same length. The upper bound is defined in terms of a probability level Q, which is the probability that a concatenated PMD coefficient value exceeds PMD
Q
, ITU G recommendations for fiber optic cables call for M = 20 and Q = 0.01%. This PMD
Q
value is the one used in the design of fiber optic links.
(28)

[74 FR 20561, May 5, 2009]
§ 1755.902
Minimum performance Specification for fiber optic cables.
(a)
Scope.
This section is intended for cable manufacturers, Agency borrowers, and consulting engineers. It covers the requirements for fiber optic cables intended for aerial installation either by attachment to a support strand or by an integrated self-supporting arrangement, for underground application by placement in a duct, or for buried installations by trenching, direct plowing, and directional or pneumatic boring.
(1)
General.
(i) Specification requirements are given in SI units which are the controlling units in this part. Approximate English equivalent of units are given for information purposes only.
(ii) The optical waveguides are glass fibers having directly-applied protective coatings, and are called “fibers,” herein. These fibers may be assembled in either loose fiber bundles with a protective core tube, encased in several protective buffer tubes, in tight buffer tubes, or ribbon bundles with a protective core tube.
(iii) Fillers, strength members, core wraps, and bedding tapes may complete the cable core.
(iv) The core or buffer tubes containing the fibers and the interstices between the buffer tubes, fillers, and strength members in the core structure are filled with a suitable material or water swellable elements to exclude water.
(v) The cable structure is completed by an extruded overall plastic jacket. A shield or armor or combination thereof may be included under the jacket. The jacket may have strength members embedded in it, in some designs.
(vi) Buried installation requires armor under the outer jacket.
(vii) For self-supporting cable, the outer jacket may be extruded over the support messenger and cable core.
(viii) Cables for mid-span applications for network access must be designed for easy mid-span access to the fibers. The manufacturer may use reversing oscillating stranding (SZ) described in section 6.4 of ITU-T Recommendation L.58,
Construction, Installation and Protection of Cables and Other Elements of Outside Plant
, 2004 (incorporated by reference at § 1755.901(f)). The cable end user is cautioned that installed cable must be properly terminated. This includes properly securing rigid strength members (
i.e.
, central strength member) and clamping the cable and jacket. It is important that cable components be secured to prevent movement of the cable or components over the operating conditions. Central strength member (CSM) clamps must prevent movement of the CSM; positive stop CSM clamps are recommended. The CSM must be routed as straight and as short as practical to prevent bowing or breaking of the CSM. The cable and jacket retention must be sufficient to prevent jacket slippage over the operating temperature range.
(2) The normal temperature ranges for cables must meet paragraph 1.1.3 of ANSI/ICEA S-87-640,
Standard for Optical Fiber Outside Plant Communications Cable
(incorporated by reference at § 1755.901(c)).
(3)
Tensile rating.
The standard installation tensile rating for cables is 2670 N (600 1bf), unless installation involves micro type cables that utilize less stress related methods of installation,
i.e.
, blown micro-fiber cable or All-Dielectric Self-Supporting (ADSS) cables (see paragraph (c)(4) of this section).
(4)
ADSS and other self-supporting cables.
Based on the storm loading districts referenced in Section 25, Loading of Grades B and C, of ANSI/IEEE C2-2007,
National Electrical Safety Code
, 2007 (incorporated by reference at § 1755.901(b)) and the maximum span and location of cable installation provided by the end user, the manufacturer must provide a cable design with sag and tension tables showing the maximum span and sag information for that particular installation. The information included must be for Rule B,
Ice and Wind Loading
, and when applicable, information on Rule 250C,
Extreme Wind Loading.
Additionally, to ensure the proper ground clearance, typically a minimum of 4.7 m (15.5 feet), the end user should factor in the maximum sag under loaded conditions, as well as, height of attachment for each application.
(5)
Minimum bend diameter.
For cable under loaded and unloaded conditions, the cable must have the minimum bend diameters indicated in paragraph 1.1.5,
Minimum Bend Diameter
, of the ANSI/ICEA S-87-640 (incorporated by reference at § 1755.901(c)). For very small cables, manufacturers may specify fixed cable minimum bend diameters that are independent of the outside diameter. For cables having a non-circular cross-section, the bend diameter is to be determined using the thickness of the cable associated with the preferential bending axis.
(6) The cable is fully color coded so that each fiber is distinguishable from every other fiber. A basic color scheme of twelve colors allows individual fiber identification. Colored tubes, binders, threads, strippings, or markings provide fiber group identification.
(7) Cables must demonstrate compliance with the qualification testing requirements of this section to ensure satisfactory end-use performance characteristics for the intended applications.
(8) Optical cable designs not specifically addressed by this section may be allowed if accepted by the Agency. Justification for acceptance of a modified design must be provided to substantiate product utility and long term stability and endurance. For information on how to obtain Agency product acceptance, refer to the procedures listed at
http://www.usda.gov/rus/telecom/listing_procedures/index_listing_procedures.htm
, as well as additional information in RUS Bulletin 345-3,
Acceptance of Standards, Specifications, Equipment Contract Forms, Manual Sections, Drawings, Materials and Equipment for the Telephone Program
(hereinafter “RUS Bulletin 345-3”), available for download at
http://www.usda.gov/rus/telecom/publications/bulletins.htm.
(9) All cables sold to RUS telecommunications borrowers for projects involving RUS loan funds must be accepted by the Agency's Technical Standards Committee “A” (Telecommunications). Any design change to existing acceptable designs must be submitted to the Agency for acceptance. As stated in paragraph 8 above, refer to the procedures listed at
http://www.usda.gov/rus/telecom/listing_procedures/index_listing_procedures.htm
as well as RUS Bulletin 345-3.
(10) The Agency intends that the optical fibers contained in the cables meeting the requirements of this section have characteristics that will allow signals having a range of wavelengths to be carried simultaneously.
(b)
Optical fibers.
(1) The solid glass optical fibers must consist of a cylindrical core and cladding covered by either an ultraviolet-cured acrylate or other suitable coating. Each fiber must be continuous throughout its length.
(2)
Zero-dispersion.
Optical fibers must meet the fiber attributes of Table 2,
G.652.B attributes
, found in ITU-T Recommendation G.652 (incorporated by reference at § 1755.901(f)). However, when the end user stipulates a low water peak fiber, the optical fibers must meet the fiber attributes of Table 4,
G.652.D attributes
, found in ITU-T Recommendation G.652; or when the end user stipulates a low bending loss fiber, the optical fibers must meet the fiber attributes of Table 7-1,
G.657 class
A attributes
, found in the ITU-T Recommendation G.657 (incorporated by reference at § 1755.901(f)).
(3)
Non-zero-dispersion.
Optical fibers must meet the fiber attributes of Table 1,
G.656 attributes
, found in ITU-T Recommendation G.656 (incorporated by reference at § 1755.901(f)). However, when the end user specifies Recommendation A, B, C, D, or E of ITU-T Recommendation G.655 (incorporated by reference at § 1755.901(f)), the optical fibers must meet the fiber attributes of ITU-T Recommendation G.655.
(4)
Multimode fibers.
Optical fibers must meet the requirements of paragraphs 2.1 and 2.3.1 of ANSI/ICEA S-87-640 (incorporated by reference at § 1755.901(c)).
(5)
Matched cable.
Unless otherwise specified by the buyer, all single mode fiber cables delivered to a RUS-financed project must be manufactured to the same MFD specification. However, notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(3) of this section, the maximum MFD tolerance allowed for cable meeting the requirements of this section must be of a magnitude meeting the definition of “matched cable,” as defined in paragraph (b) of § 1755.900. With the use of cables meeting this definition the user can reasonably expect that the average bi-directional loss of a fusion splice to be ≤0.1 dB.
(6) Buyers will normally specify the MFD for the fibers in the cable. When a buyer does not specify the MFD at 1310 nm, the fibers must be manufactured to an MFD of 9.2 µm with a maximum tolerance range of ±0.5 µm (362 ±20 microinch), unless the end user agrees to accept cable with fibers specified to a different MFD. When the end user does specify a MFD and tolerance conflicting with the MFD maximum tolerance allowed by paragraph (d)(5) of this section, the requirements of paragraph (d)(5) must prevail.
(7) Factory splices are not allowed.
(8)
Coating.

Mid-span test.
This test is applicable only to cables of a loose tube design specified for mid-span applications with tube storage. Cable of specialty design may be exempted from this requirement when this requirement is not applicable to such design. All buried and underground loose tube single mode cables manufactured per the requirements in this section and intended for mid-span applications with tube storage must meet the following mid-span test without exhibiting an increase in fiber attenuation greater than 0.1 dB and a maximum average increase over all fibers of 0.05 dB.
(i) The specimen must be installed in a commercially available pedestal or closure or in a device that mimics their performance, as follows: A length of cable sheath, equal to the mid-span length, must be removed from the middle of the test specimen so as to allow access to the buffer tubes. All binders, tapes, strength members, etc. must be removed. The buffer tubes must be left intact. The cable ends defining the ends of the mid-span length must be properly secured in the closure to the more stringent of the cable or hardware manufacturer's recommendations. Strength members must be secured with an end stop type clamp and the outer jacket must be clamped to prevent slippage. A minimum of 6.096 meters (20 feet) of cable must extend from the entry and exit ports of the closure for the purpose of making optical measurements. If a device that mimics the performance of pedestals or closures is used, the buffer tubes must be wound in a coil with a minimum width of 3 inches and minimum length of 12 inches.
(ii) The expressed buffer tubes must be loosely constrained during the test.
(iii) The enclosure, with installed cable, must be placed in an environmental chamber for temperature cycling. It is acceptable for some or all of the two 20 feet (6.096 meters) cable segments to extend outside the environmental chamber.
(iv) Lids, pedestal enclosures, or closure covers must be removed if possible to allow for temperature equilibrium of the buffer tubes. If this is not possible, the manufacturer must demonstrate that the buffer tubes are at temperature equilibrium prior to beginning the soak time.
(v) Measure the attenuation of single mode fibers at 1550 ±10 nm. The supplier must certify the performance of lower specified wavelengths comply with the mid-span performance requirements.
(vi) After measuring the attenuation of the optical fibers, test the cable sample per TIA/EIA Standard 455-3A (incorporated by reference at § 1755.901(e)). Temperature cycling, measurements, and data reporting must conform to TIA/EIA Standard 455-3A. The test must be conducted for at least five complete cycles. The following detailed test conditions must apply:
(A) TIA/EIA Standard 455-3A (incorporated by reference at § 1755.901(e)), Section 4.1—Loose tube single mode optical cable sample must be tested.
(B) TIA/EIA Standard 455-3A (incorporated by reference at § 1755.901(e)), Section 4.2—An Agency accepted 8 to 12 inch diameter optical buried distribution pedestal or a device that mimics their performance must be tested.

Section 5.2—Test Condition C-2, minimum −40 °C (−40 °F) and maximum 70 °Celsius (158 °F).
(F) TIA/EIA Standard 455-3A (incorporated by reference at § 1755.901(e)), Section 5.7.2—A statistically representative amount of transmitting fibers in all express buffer tubes passing through the pedestal and stored must be measured.
(G) The buffer tubes in the closure or pedestal must not be handled or moved during temperature cycling or attenuation measurements.
(vii) Fiber cable attenuation measured through the express buffer tubes during the last cycle at −40 °C (−40 °F) and + 70 °C (158 °F) must not exceed a maximum increase of 0.1 dB and must not exceed a 0.05 dB average across all tested fibers from the initial baseline measurements. At the conclusion of the temperature cycling, the maximum attenuation increase at 23 °C from the initial baseline measurement must not exceed 0.05 dB which allows for measurement noise that may be encountered during the test. The cable must also be inspected at room temperature at the conclusion of all measurements; the cable must not show visible evidence of fracture of the buffer tubes nor show any degradation of all exposed cable assemblies.

§ 1755.903
Fiber optic service entrance cables.
(a)
Scope.
This section covers Agency requirements for fiber optic service entrance cables intended for aerial installation either by attachment to a support strand or by an integrated self-supporting arrangement, for underground application by placement in a duct, or for buried installations by trenching, direct plowing, directional or pneumatic boring. Cable meeting this section is recommended for fiber optic service entrances having 12 or fewer fibers with distances less than 100 meters (300 feet).
(1)
General.
(i) Specification requirements are given in SI units which are the controlling units in this part. Approximate English equivalent of units are given for information purposes only.
(ii) The optical waveguides are glass fibers having directly-applied protective coatings, and are called “fibers,” herein. These fibers may be assembled in either loose fiber bundles with a protective core tube, encased in several protective buffer tubes, in tight buffer tubes, or ribbon bundles with a protective core tube.
(iii) Fillers, strength members, core wraps, and bedding tapes may complete the cable core.
(iv) The core or buffer tubes containing the fibers and the interstices between the buffer tubes, fillers, and strength members in the core structure are filled with a suitable material or water swellable elements to exclude water.
(v) The cable structure is completed by an extruded overall plastic jacket. A shield or armor or combination thereof may be included under the jacket. This jacket may have strength members embedded in it, in some designs.
(vi) For rodent resistance or for additional protection with direct buried installations, it is recommended the use of armor under the outer jacket.
(vii) For self-supporting cable the outer jacket may be extruded over the support messenger and cable core.
(viii) For detection purposes, the cable may have toning elements embedded or extruded with the outer jacket.
(2) The cable is fully color coded so that each fiber is distinguishable from every other fiber. A basic color scheme of twelve colors allows individual fiber identification. Colored tubes, binders, threads, striping, or markings provide fiber group identification.
(3) Cables manufactured to the requirements of this section must demonstrate compliance with the qualification testing requirements to ensure satisfactory end-use performance characteristics for the intended applications.
(4) Optical cable designs not specifically addressed by this section may be allowed. Justification for acceptance of a modified design must be provided to substantiate product utility and long term stability and endurance. For information on how to obtain Agency's acceptance of such a modified design, refer to the product acceptance procedures available at
http://www.usda.gov/rus/telecom/listing_procedures/index_listing_procedures.htm
as well as RUS Bulletin 345-3.
(5) The cable must be designed for the temperatures ranges of Table 1-1,
Cable Normal Temperature Ranges
, of ICEA S-110-717 (incorporated by reference at § 1755.901(c)).
(6)
Tensile rating.
The cable must have ratings that are no less than the tensile ratings indicated in paragraph 1.1.4,
Tensile Rating
, of Part 1 of the ICEA S-110-717 (incorporated by reference at § 1755.901(c)).
(7)
Self-supporting cables.
Based on the storm loading districts referenced in Section 25, Loading of Grades B and C, of ANSI/IEEE C2-2007 (incorporated by reference at § 1755.901(b)), and the maximum span and location of cable installation provided by the end user, the manufacturer must provide a cable design with sag and tension tables showing the maximum span and sag information for that particular installation. The information included must be for Rule B,
Ice and Wind Loading
, and when applicable, information on Rule 250C,
Extreme Wind Loading.
Additionally, to ensure the proper ground clearance, typically a minimum of 4.7 m (15.5 feet), the end user should factor in the maximum sag under loaded conditions as well as height of attachment for each application.
(8)
Minimum bend diameter.
For cable under loaded and unloaded conditions, the cable must have the minimum bend diameters indicated in paragraph 1.1.5,
Minimum Bend Diameter
, of Part 1 of ICEA S-110-717 (incorporated by reference at § 1755.901(c)). For very small cables, manufacturers may specify fixed cable minimum bend diameters that are independent of the outside diameter.
(9) All cables sold to RUS Telecommunications borrowers must be accepted by the Agency's Technical Standards Committee “A” for projects involving RUS loan funds. All design changes to Agency acceptable designs must be submitted to the Agency for acceptance. Optical cable designs not specifically addressed by this section may be allowed, if accepted by the Agency. Justification for acceptance of a modified design must be provided to substantiate product utility and long term stability and endurance. For information on how to obtain the Agency's acceptance of cables, refer to the product acceptance procedures available at
http://www.usda.gov/rus/telecom/listing_procedures/index_listing_procedures.htm
as well as RUS Bulletin 345-3.
(10) The Agency intends that the optical fibers contained in the cables meeting the requirement of this section have characteristics that will allow signals, having a range of wavelengths, to be carried simultaneously.
(11) The manufacturer is responsible to establish a quality assurance system meeting industry standards described in paragraph 1.8 of ICEA S-110-717 (incorporated by reference at § 1755.901(c)).
(12) The cable made must meet paragraph 1.10 of ICEA S-110-717 (incorporated by reference at § 1755.901(c)).
(b)
Optical fibers.
(1) The solid glass optical fibers must consist of a cylindrical core and cladding covered by either an ultraviolet-cured acrylate or other suitable coating. Each fiber must be continuous throughout its length.
(2) Optical fibers must meet the fiber attributes of Table 2,
G.652.B attributes
, of ITU-T Recommendation G.652 (incorporated by reference at § 1755.901(f)), unless the end user specifically asks for another type of fiber. However, when the end user stipulates a low water peak fiber, the optical fibers must meet the fiber attributes of Table 4,
G.652.D attributes
, of ITU-T Recommendation G.652; or when the end user stipulates a low bending loss fiber, the optical fibers must meet the fiber
attributes of Table 7-1,
G.657 class A attributes
, of ITU-T Recommendation G.657 (incorporated by reference at § 1755.901(f)).
(i) Additionally, optical ribbon fibers must meet paragraph 3.3,
Optical Fiber Ribbons
, of Part 3 of ICEA S-110-717 (incorporated by reference at § 1755.901(c)).
(ii) [Reserved]
(3)
Multimode fibers.
Optical fibers must meet the requirements of paragraphs 2.1 and 2.3.1 of ANSI/ICEA S-87-640 (incorporated by reference at § 1755.901(c)).
(4)
Matched cable.
Unless otherwise specified by the buyer, all single mode fiber cables delivered to an Agency-financed project must be manufactured to the same MFD specification. However, notwithstanding the requirements indicated in paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(3) of this section, the maximum MFD tolerance allowed for cables meeting the requirements of this section must be of a magnitude meeting the definition of “matched cable,” as defined in paragraph (b) of § 1755.900. With the use of cables meeting this definition the user can reasonably expect that the average bi-directional loss of a fusion splice to be ≤0.1 dB.
(5) Buyers will normally specify the MFD for the fibers in the cable. When a buyer does not specify the MFD at 1310 nm, the fibers must be manufactured to an MFD of 9.2 µm with a maximum tolerance range of ±0.5 µm (362 ±20 microinch), unless the buyer agrees to accept cable with fibers specified to a different MFD. When the buyer does specify a MFD and tolerance conflicting with the MFD maximum tolerance allowed by paragraph (d)(4) of this section, the requirements of paragraph (d)(4) must prevail.
(6) Factory splices are not allowed.
(7) All optical fibers in any single length of cable must be of the same type unless otherwise specified by end user.
(8) Optical fiber dimensions and data reporting must be as required by paragraph 7.13.1.1 of ANSI/ICEA S-87-640 (incorporated by reference at § 1755.901(c)).
(c)
Buffers/coating.
(1) The optical fibers contained in a buffer tube (loose tube) loosely packaged must have a clearance between the fibers and the inside of the container sufficient to allow for thermal expansions without constraining the fibers. The protective container must be manufactured from a material having a coefficient of friction sufficiently low to allow the fibers free movement. The design may contain more than one tube. Loose buffer tubes must meet the requirements of Paragraph 3.2.1,
Loose Buffer Tube Dimensions
, of Part 3 of ICEA S-110-717 (incorporated by reference at § 1755.901(c)).
(2) The loose tube coverings of each color and other fiber package types removed from the finished cable must meet the following shrinkback and cold bend performance requirements. The fibers may be left in the tube.
(i)
Shrinkback.
Testing must be conducted per ASTM D 4565 (incorporated by reference at § 1755.901(d)), paragraph 14.1, using a talc bed at a temperature of 95 °C. Shrinkback must not exceed 5 percent of the original 150 millimeter length of the specimen. The total shrinkage of the specimen must be measured.
(ii)
Cold bend.
Testing must be conducted on at least one tube from each color in the cable. Stabilize the specimen to −20 ±1 °C for a minimum of four hours. While holding the specimen and mandrel at the test temperature, wrap the tube in a tight helix ten times around a mandrel with a diameter the greater of five times the tube diameter or 50 mm. The tube must show no evidence of cracking when observed with normal or corrected-to-normal vision.
(3) Optical fiber coating must meet the requirements of paragraph 2.4,
Optical Fiber Coatings and Requirements
, of Part 2 of ICEA S-110-717 (incorporated by reference at § 1755.901(c)).
(i) All protective coverings in any single length of cable must be continuous and be of the same material except at splice locations.
(ii) The protective coverings must be free from holes, splits, blisters, and other imperfections and must be as smooth and concentric as is consistent with the best commercial practice.
(iii) Repairs to the fiber coatings are not allowed.
(d)
Fiber and buffer tube identification.
Fibers within a unit and the units
within a cable must be identified as indicated in paragraphs 4.2 and 4.3 of Part 4 of ICEA S-110-717 (incorporated by reference at § 1755.901(c)), respectively.
(e)
Strength members.
(1) Combined strength of all the strength members must be sufficient to support the stress of installation and to protect the cable in service. Strength members must meet paragraph 4.4,
Strength Members
, of ICEA S-110-717 (incorporated by reference at § 1755.901(c)). Self supporting aerial cables using the strength members as an integral part of the cable strength must comply with paragraph C.4,
Static Tensile Testing of Aerial Self-Supporting Cables
, of ANNEX C of ICEA S-110-717.
(2) Strength members may be incorporated into the core as a central support member or filler, as fillers between the fiber packages, as an annular serving over the core, as an annular serving over the intermediate jacket, embedded in the outer jacket or as a combination of any of these methods.
(3) The central support member or filler must contain no more than one splice per kilometer of cable. Individual fillers placed between the fiber packages and placed as annular servings over the core must contain no more than one splice per kilometer of cable. Cable sections having central member or filler splices must meet the same physical requirements as un-spliced cable sections.
(4) Notwithstanding what has been indicated in other parts of this document, in each length of completed cable having a metallic central member, the dielectric strength between the optional armor and the metallic center member must withstand at least 15 kilovolts direct current for 3 seconds.
(f)
Forming the cable core.

(3) Because the accuracy of attenuation measurements for single mode fibers becomes questionable when measured on short cable lengths, attenuation measurements are to be made utilizing characterization cable lengths. Master Cable reels must be tested and the attenuation values measured will be used for shorter ship lengths of cable.
(4) Because the accuracy of attenuation measurements for multimode fibers becomes questionable when measured on short cable lengths, attenuation measurements are to be made utilizing characterization cable lengths. If the ship length of cable is less than one kilometer, the attenuation values measured on longer lengths of cable (characterization length of cable) before cutting to the ship lengths of cable may be applied to the ship lengths.
(5) Attenuation must be measured per Table 8.4,
Optical Attenuation Measurement Methods,
ANSI/ICEA S-87-640 (incorporated by reference at § 1755.901(c)).
