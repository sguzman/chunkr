# Explanation
The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.
Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:
Title 1 through Title 16
as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27
as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41
as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50
as of October 1
The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.

# LEGAL STATUS
The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

# HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS
The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, January 1, 2025), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

# EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES
Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.

# OMB CONTROL NUMBERS
The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request.
Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.

# PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE
Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.

# “[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY
The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not dropped in error.

# INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE
What is incorporation by reference?
Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.
What is a proper incorporation by reference?
The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:
(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.
(b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.
(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?
If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.

# CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES
A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR
Index and Finding Aids.
This volume contains the Parallel Table of Authorities and Rules. A list of CFR titles, chapters, subchapters, and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in this volume.
An index to the text of “Title 3—The President” is carried within that volume.
The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. This index is based on a consolidation of the “Contents” entries in the daily Federal Register.
A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

# REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL
There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing in the Code of Federal Regulations.

Applicability.
This part applies to all persons included within the term “employee” as defined in § 0.735-4, except as otherwise provided in this part.

Employee.
(1) Shall include: (i) Every officer and employee of the Department of Commerce (regardless of location), including commissioned officers of the Environmental Science Services Administration; and
(ii) Every other person who is retained, designated, appointed, or employed by a Federal officer or employee, who is engaged in the performance of a function of the Department under authority of law or an Executive act, and who is subject to the supervision of a Federal officer or employee while engaged in the performance of the duties of his position not only as to what he does but also as to how he performs his duties, regardless of whether the relationship to the Department is created by assignment, detail, contract, agreement or otherwise.
(2) Shall not include: (i) Members of the Executive Reserve except when they are serving as employees of the
Department under the circumstances described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section;
(ii) Members of crews of vessels owned or chartered to the Government and operated by or for the Maritime Administration under a General Agency Agreement; or

Subparts B-C [Reserved]

# Subpart D—Regulatory Limitations Upon Employee Conduct
§ 0.735-10
Administrative extension of statutory limitations.
The provisions of the statutes identified in this part which relate to the ethical and other conduct of Federal employees are adopted and will be enforced as administrative regulations, violations of which may in appropriate cases be the basis for disciplinary action, including removal. The fact that a statute which may relate to employee conduct is not identified in this part does not mean that it may not be the basis for disciplinary action against an employee.
§§ 0.735-10a—0.735-15
[Reserved]
§ 0.735-16
Indebtedness.
(a) An employee shall pay each just financial obligation in a proper and timely manner, especially one imposed by law such as Federal, State, or local taxes. For purposes of this section, “a just financial obligation” means one acknowledged by the employee or reduced to judgment by a court, and “in a proper and timely manner” means in a manner which, in the view of the Department, does not, under the circumstances, reflect adversely on the Government as his employer.
(b) In the event of dispute between an employee and an alleged creditor, this section does not require the Department to determine the validity or amount of the disputed debt.
§ 0.735-17
Gambling, betting, and lotteries.
An employee shall not participate while on Government-owned or leased property or while on duty for the Government, in any gambling activity including the operation of a gambling device, in conducting a lottery or pool, in a game for money or property or in selling or purchasing a numbers slip or ticket. However, this section does not preclude activities
(a) Necessitated by an employee's law enforcement duties, or
(b) Under section 3 of Executive Order 10927 (relating to solicitations conducted by organizations composed of civilian employees or members of the armed forces among their own members for organizational support or for benefit or welfare funds for their own members) and similar agency-approved activities.
§ 0.735-18
General conduct prejudicial to the Government.
(a)
General policy.
Officers and employees of the Federal Government are servants of the people. Because of this, their conduct must, in many instances, be subject to more restrictions and to higher standards than may be the case in certain private employments. They are expected to conduct themselves in a manner which will reflect favorably upon their employer. Although the
Government is not particularly interested in the private lives of its employees, it does expect them to be honest, reliable, trustworthy, and of good character and reputation. They are expected to be loyal to the Government, and to the department or agency in which they are employed.
(b)
Specific policy.
An employee shall not engage in criminal, infamous, dishonest, immoral, or notoriously disgraceful conduct, or other conduct prejudicial to the Government.
(c)
Regulations applicable to public buildings and grounds.
Each employee is responsible for knowing and complying with regulations of the General Services Administration and of the Department of Commerce applicable to public buildings and grounds.
§ 0.735-19
Reporting undue influence to superiors.
Each employee shall report to his superior any instance in which another person inside or outside the Federal Government uses or attempts to use undue influence to induce, by reason of his official Government position, former Government employment, family relationship, political position, or otherwise, the employee to do or omit to do any official act in derogation of his official duty.
Subpart E [Reserved]

(b) 46 U.S.C. 1111(b) (Maritime Administration);

App. 2160(f) (prohibition of use of confidential information for purposes of speculation) (Business and Defense Services Administration and any other primary operating unit affected); and
(d) Certain provisions of Pub. L. 89-136, the Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1965, e.g., section 711 (restriction on employing certain EDA employees by applicants for financial assistance), and section 710(b) (embezzlement), false book entries, sharing in loans, etc., and giving out unauthorized information for speculation).

Responsibilities of operating units.
The head of each operating unit, or his designee, shall:

(h) Require each employee upon entering on duty and at such other times as may be specified, to execute the certification required by § 0.735-35(c);
(i) Report to the program Secretarial Officer concerned and to the Assistant Secretary for Administration promptly any instance in which an employee, after notice, fails to submit the certification required under § 0.735-35(c) or a statement of employment or financial interests required under this part within 14 calendar days following the prescribed time limit for doing so; and
(j) Take action to impress upon each employee required to submit a statement of employment and financial interests, upon his supervisor, and upon employees with whom the employee works, their responsibility as follows:
(1) The employee's supervisor is responsible (i) for excluding from the range of duties of the employee any contracts or other transactions between the Government and his outside employer, clients, or entities in which he has an interest within the purview of this part, and (ii) for overseeing the employee's activities in order to insure that the public interest is protected from improper conduct on his part and that he will not, through ignorance or inadvertence, embarrass the Government or himself.
(2) The employee's supervisor and employees with whom he works are responsible for avoiding the use of the employee's services in any situation in which a violation of law, regulation, or ethical standards is likely to occur or to appear to occur.
(3) The supervisor of an employee is responsible for initiating prompt and proper disciplinary or remedial action when a violation, intentional or innocent, is detected.
(4) Employees shall avoid divulging to a special Government employee privileged Government information which is not necessary to the performance of his governmental responsibility or information which directly involves
the financial interests of his non-Government employer.
(5) An employee shall make every effort in his private work to avoid any personal contact with respect to negotiations with the Department for contracts, grants, or loans, if the subject matter is related to the subject matter of his Government employment. When this is not possible, he may participate if not otherwise prohibited by law (e.g., 18 U.S.C. 203 and 205) in the negotiations for his private employer only with the prior approval of the head of the operating unit concerned.
[32 FR 15222, Nov. 2, 1967, as amended at 55 FR 53489, Dec. 31, 1990]
§ 0.735-37
Procedure.

b. If, by general rule or regulation published in the
Federal Register,
the financial interest has been exempted from the requirements of section 208 as being too remote or too inconsequential to affect the integrity of Government officers' or employees' services.

# f. salary of government officials and employees
.01 Title 18, U.S.C., section 209, prohibits:
a. An officer or employee from receiving any salary, or any contribution to or supplementation of salary, as compensation for his services as an officer or employee of the United States from any source other than the Government of the United States, except as may be contributed out of the treasury of a State, county, or municipality; and

§ 1.1
Purpose.
The purpose of this part is to describe the seal of the Department of Commerce and to delegate authority to affix the seal to certifications and documents of the Department.
§ 1.2
Description and design.
(a) The Act of February 14, 1903 (32 Stat. 825, as amended) (15 U.S.C. 1501), which established the Department of Commerce, provided that “The said Secretary shall cause a seal of office to be made for the said department of such device as the President shall approve, and judicial notice shall be taken of the said seal.” On April 4, 1913, the President approved and declared to be the seal of the Department of Commerce the device which he described as follows:
Arms: Per fesse azure and or, a ship in full sail on waves of the sea, in chief proper; and in base a lighthouse illumined proper.
Crest: The American Eagle displayed. Around the Arms, between two concentric circles, are the words:

# Department of Commerce

# United States of America
(b) The design of the approved seal is as shown below. Where necessitated by requirements of legibility, immediate comprehension, or clean reproduction, the concentric circles may be eliminated from the seal on publications and exhibits, and in slides, motion pictures, and television. In more formal uses of the seal, such as on letterheads, the full, proper rendition of the seal shall be used.
EC20SE91.005
(c) The official symbolism of the seal shall be the following: The ship is a symbol of commerce; the blue denotes uprightness and constancy; the lighthouse is a well-known symbol representing guidance from the darkness which is translated to commercial enlightenment; and the gold denotes purity. The crest is the American bald eagle denoting the national scope of the Department's activities. (The above is a modification of the original symbolism issued with the President's approval of the seal, made necessary by
changes in the functions of the Department.)
§ 1.3
Delegation of authority.
(a) Pursuant to authority vested in the Secretary of Commerce by law, (1) the Chief Administrative Officer of each operating unit, and (2) the Director, Office of Administrative Services in the Office of the Secretary, are hereby authorized to sign as Certifying Officers certifications as to the official nature of copies of correspondence and records from the files, publications and other documents of the Department and to affix the seal of the Department of Commerce to such certifications or documents for all purposes, including the purpose authorized by 28 U.S.C. 1733(b).
(b) Delegations of authority to persons other than those named in paragraph (a) of this section may be made by the Assistant Secretary for Administration.
(c) This delegation shall not affect or prejudice the use of properly authorized office or bureau seals in appropriate cases.

§ 2.1
Purpose.
(a) The purpose of this part is to delegate authority to settle or deny claims under the Federal Tort Claims Act (in part, 28 U.S.C. 2671-2680) as amended by Pub.

[32 FR 3769, Mar. 7, 1967, as amended at 48 FR 31636, July 11, 1983]
§ 2.2
Provisions of law and regulations thereunder.
(a) Section 2672 of Title 28, U.S. Code, as above amended, provides that:
The head of each Federal agency or his designee, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Attorney General, may consider, ascertain, adjust, determine, compromise, and settle any claim for money damages against the United States for injury or loss of property or personal injury or death caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any employee of the agency while acting within the scope of his office or employment, under circumstances where the United States, if a private person, would be liable to the claimant in accordance with the law of the place where the act or omission occurred:
Provided,
that any award, compromise, or settlement in excess of $25,000 shall be effected only with the prior written approval of the Attorney General or his designee.
Subject to the provisions of this title relating to civil actions on tort claims against the United States, any such award, compromise, settlement, or determination shall be final and conclusive on all officers of the Government, except when procured by means of fraud.
Any award, compromise, or settlement in an amount of $2,500 or less made pursuant to this section shall be paid by the head of the Federal agency concerned out of appropriations available to that agency. Payment of any award, compromise, or settlement in an amount in excess of $2,500 made pursuant to this section or made by the Attorney General in any amount pursuant to section 2677 of this title shall be paid in a manner similar to judgments and compromises in like causes and appropriations or funds available for the payment of such judgments and compromises are hereby made available for the payment of awards, compromises, or settlements under this chapter.
The acceptance by the claimant of any such award, compromise, or settlement shall be final and conclusive on the claimant, and shall constitute a complete release of any claim against the United States and against the employee of the Government whose act or omission gave rise to the claim, by reason of the same subject matter.
(b) Subsection (a) section 2675 of said Title 28 provides that:
An action shall not be instituted upon a claim against the United States for money damages for injury or loss of property or personal injury or death caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any employee of the Government while acting within the scope of his office or employment, unless the claimant shall have first presented the claim to the appropriate Federal agency and his claim shall have been finally denied by the agency in writing and sent by certified or registered mail. The failure of an agency to make final disposition of a claim within 6 months after it is filed shall, at the option of the claimant any time thereafter, be deemed a final denial of the claim for purposes of this section. The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to such claims as may be asserted under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure by third party complaint, crossclaim, or counterclaim.
(c) Section 2678 of said Title 28 provides that no attorney shall charge fees in excess of 25 percent of a judgment or settlement after litigation, or over 20 percent of administrative settlements.
(d) Section 2401(b) of said Title 28 provides that:
A tort claim against the United States shall be forever barred unless it is presented in writing to the appropriate Federal agency within 2 years after such claim accrues or unless action is begun within 6 months after the date of mailing, by certified or registered mail, of notice of final denial of the claim by the agency to which it was presented.
(e) Pursuant to section 2672 as amended, the Attorney General has issued regulations (herein referred to as “the Regulations”; 28 CFR Part 14) prescribing standards and procedures for settlement of tort claims (31 FR 16616). Persons delegated authority under this part shall follow and be guided by such Regulations (28 CFR Part 14).

(2) Request another Federal agency to conduct the investigation as necessary, pursuant to § 14.8 of the regulations (28 CFR Part 14), all on a reimbursable basis.

# Subpart A—Freedom of Information Act
§ 4.1
General provisions.
(a) The information in this part is furnished for the guidance of the public and in compliance with the requirements of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), as amended (5 U.S.C. 552). This part sets forth the procedures the Department of Commerce (Department) and its components follow to make publicly available materials and indices specified in 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(2) and records requested under 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(3). Information routinely provided to the public as part of a regular Department activity (for example, press releases issued by the Office of Public Affairs) may be provided to the public without following this part. In addition, as a matter of policy, the Department shall make discretionary releases of records or information exempt from disclosure under the FOIA when required to do so in accordance with current law and/or Executive Branch policy. This policy does not create any right enforceable in court.
(b) As used in this subpart,
component
means any office, division, bureau or other unit of the Department listed in appendix A to this part (except that a regional office of a larger office or other unit does not constitute a separate component).
(c) The Department has a FOIA Requester Service Center with at least one FOIA Public Liaison. Each Department component may have a FOIA Requester Service Center with at least one FOIA Public Liaison. FOIA Public Liaisons are responsible for: Working with requesters that have any concerns about the service received from a FOIA component, reducing delays in the processing of FOIA requests, increasing transparency and understanding of the status of requests, and assisting in the resolution of disputes. Contact information for the relevant component FOIA Requester Service Centers, FOIA Public Liaisons, and component FOIA offices and contacts is available at
http://www.osec.doc.gov/opog/contacts.html
.
(d) The Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) within the National Archives and Records Administration offers mediation services to resolve disputes between requesters and agencies as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation. Requesters with concerns
about the handling of their requests may contact OGIS.
[66 FR 65632, Dec. 20, 2001, as amended at 79 FR 62557, Oct. 20, 2014; 83 FR 39589, Aug. 10, 2018]
§ 4.2
Public reading rooms.
(a) Records that the FOIA requires to be made available for public inspection and copying are accessible electronically through the Department's “Electronic FOIA Library” on the Department's website,
http://www.doc.gov
, which includes links to websites for those components that maintain Electronic FOIA Libraries. Each component of the Department is responsible for determining which of its records are required to be made available, as well as identifying additional records of interest to the public that are appropriate for disclosure, and for making those records available either in its own Electronic Library or in the Department's central Electronic FOIA Library. Components that maintain their own Electronic FOIA Libraries are designated as such in appendix A to this part. Each component shall also maintain and make available electronically a current subject-matter index of the records made available electronically. Each component shall ensure that posted records and indices are updated regularly, at least quarterly.
(b) If the requester does not have access to the Internet and wishes to obtain information regarding publicly available information, he or she may contact the component's FOIA office. Appendix A to this part contains the contact information for the components' FOIA offices. Some components may also maintain physical public reading rooms. These components and their contact information are listed in appendix A to this part.
(c) The Department and its components shall maintain and make available electronically for public inspection:
(1) Copies of records that have been released and—
(i) That the component that maintains them determines, because of their subject matter, have become or are likely to become the subject of subsequent requests for substantially the same records by other requesters, or
(ii) That have been requested three or more times by different requesters;
(2) A general index of the records available for public inspection—for purposes of these regulations, a general index includes records available through a search capability on the Department or component's website, such as a person finder;
(3) Final opinions and orders, including concurring and dissenting opinions made in the adjudication of cases;
(4) Those statements of policy and interpretations that have been adopted by a component and are not published in the
Federal Register
; and
(5) Administrative staff manuals and instructions to staff that affect a member of the public.
[79 FR 62558, Oct. 20, 2014, as amended at 83 FR 39589, Aug. 10, 2018]
§ 4.3
Records under the FOIA.
(a) Records under the FOIA include all Government records, regardless of format, medium or physical characteristics, and electronic records and information, audiotapes, videotapes, Compact Disks, DVDs, and photographs.
(b) In response to a FOIA request, the Department has no obligation to create, compile, or obtain from outside the Department a record to satisfy a request (for example, extrapolating information from existing agency records, reformatting available information, preparing new electronic programs or databases, or creating data through calculations of rations, proportions, percentages, trends, frequency distributions, correlations, or comparisons). In complying with a request for records (including data and other electronically-stored information), whether the Department creates or compiles records (as by undertaking significant programming work) or merely extracts them from an existing database is fact dependent. The Department shall undertake reasonable efforts to search for records stored in electronic format (including data and other electronically-stored information).
(c) Department officials may, upon request, create and provide new records to the public pursuant to statutes that authorize the creation and provision of new records for a fee, such as the first
paragraph of 15 U.S.C. 1525, or in accordance with authority otherwise provided by law. Such creation and provision of records is outside the scope of the FOIA.
(d) Components shall preserve all correspondence pertaining to the requests they receive under this subpart, as well as copies of all requested records, until disposition or destruction is authorized by Title 44 of the United States Code or the National Archives and Records Administration's General Records Schedule 4.2, Information Access and Protection Records. Components shall not dispose of records while they are the subject of a pending request, appeal, or lawsuit under the FOIA.
[66 FR 65632, Dec. 20, 2001, as amended at 79 FR 62558, Oct. 20, 2014; 83 FR 39589, Aug. 10, 2018]
§ 4.4
Requirements for making requests.
(a)
How made and addressed.
The Department has a decentralized system for responding to FOIA requests, with each component designating a FOIA office to process records from that component. All components have the capability to receive requests electronically through electronic mail (email). A request for Department records that are not customarily made available to the public as part of the Department's regular informational services (or pursuant to a user fee statute), must be in writing and shall be processed under the FOIA, regardless of whether the FOIA is mentioned in the request. Requests must include the requester's full name and a valid return address. Requesters may also include other contact information, such as an email address and a telephone number. For the quickest handling, the request (and envelope, if the request is mailed or hand delivered) should be marked “Freedom of Information Act Request.” Requests may be submitted by U.S. mail, delivery service, email, or online case management system. Requests may also be submitted to some components, identified in appendix A to this part, by facsimile. Requests should be sent to the Department component identified in appendix A to this part that maintains those records requested, and should be sent to the addresses, email addresses, or numbers listed in appendix A to this part or the Department's website,
http://www.doc.gov.
1
If the proper component cannot be determined, the request should be sent to the central facility identified in appendix A to this part. The central facility will forward the request to the component(s) it believes most likely to have the requested records. Requests will be considered received for purposes of the 20-day time limit of § 4.6 as of the date it is received by the proper component's FOIA office, but in any event not later than ten working days after the request is first received by any Department component identified in appendix A to this part.
1
The USPTO, which is established as an agency of the United States within the Department, operates under its own FOIA regulations at 37 CFR part 102, subpart A. Accordingly, requests for USPTO records, and any appeals thereof, should be sent directly to the USPTO.
(b)
Requests for records about an individual or oneself.
For requests for records about oneself, § 4.24 contains additional requirements. For requests for records about another individual, either a notarized authorization signed by that individual or a declaration by that individual made under 28 U.S.C. 1746, a law that permits statements to be made under penalty of perjury as a substitute for notarization, permitting disclosure of the individual's records to the requester, or proof that the individual is deceased (for example, a copy of a death certificate or an obituary) will facilitate processing the request.
(c)
Description of records sought.
(1) A FOIA request must reasonably describe the agency records sought, to enable Department personnel to locate them with a reasonable amount of effort.
(2) Whenever possible, a request should include specific information about each record sought, such as the date, title or name, author, recipient, subject matter of the record, case number, file designation, or reference number, and the name and location of the office where the record(s) might be found.
(i) In addition, if records about a court case are sought, the title of the case, the court in which the case was
filed, and the nature of the case should be included.
(ii) If known, any file designations or descriptions of the requested records should be included.
(iii) As a general rule, the more specifically the request describes the records sought, the greater the likelihood that the Department will be able to locate those records.
(3) Before submitting their requests, requesters may first contact the Department's or the component's FOIA contact to discuss the records they are seeking and to receive assistance in describing the records.
(4) For further assistance, requesters may also contact the relevant FOIA Requester Service Center or FOIA Public Liaison. Contact information for relevant FOIA Requester Service Centers and FOIA Public Liaisons is contained on the Department's website,
http://www.osec.doc.gov/opog/contacts.html
and appendix A to this part.
(5) If a component determines that a request does not reasonably describe the records sought, it shall inform the requester what additional information is needed or how the request is otherwise insufficient, to enable the requester to modify the request to meet the requirements of this section.
(6) Requesters who are attempting to reformulate or modify such a request may discuss their request first with the relevant FOIA Contact, or if unresolved, with the relevant Requester Service Center or FOIA Public Liaison to discuss the records they are seeking and to receive assistance in describing the records.
(7) When a requester fails to provide sufficient detail within 30 calendar days after having been asked to reasonably describe the records sought, the component shall notify the requester in writing that the request has not been properly made, that no further action will be taken, and that the FOIA request is closed. Such a notice constitutes an adverse determination under § 4.7(c)(2) for which components shall follow the procedures for a denial letter under § 4.7(c)(3).
(8) In cases where a requester has modified his or her request, the date of receipt for purposes of the 20-day time limit of § 4.6 shall be the date of receipt of the modified request.
[83 FR 39590, Aug. 10, 2018, as amended at 88 FR 36470, June 5, 2023]
§ 4.5
Responsibility for responding to requests.
(a)
In general.
Except as stated in paragraph (b) of this section, the proper component of the Department to respond to a request for records is the component that first receives the request and has responsive records (or in the instance of where no records exist, the component that first receives the request and is likely to have responsive records), or the component to which the Departmental FOIA Officer or component FOIA Officer assigns lead responsibility for responding to the request. Where a component's FOIA office determines that a request was misdirected within the Department, the receiving component's FOIA office shall route the request to the FOIA office of the proper component(s). Records responsive to a request shall include those records within the Department's possession and control as of the date the Department begins its search for them. A record that is excluded from the requirements of the FOIA pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(c), is not considered responsive to a request.
(b)
Consultations and referrals.
When the Department or a component receives a request for a record (or a portion thereof) in its possession that originated with another Departmental component or Federal agency subject to the FOIA, the Department or component should typically refer the record to the component or originating agency for direct response to the requester (see § 4.8 for additional information about referrals of classified information). When the Department or a component receives a request for a record (or a portion thereof) in its possession that originated with another Departmental component, Federal agency, or executive branch office that is not subject to the FOIA, the Department or component shall consult with that component, Federal agency, or executive branch office before responding to the requester. In instances where a record is requested that originated with the Department or component and
another component, Federal agency, or executive branch office has substantial interest in the record (or a portion thereof), the Department or component should typically consult with that component, Federal agency, or executive branch office before responding to the requester.
(c)
Notice of referral.
Whenever a component refers a record to another Federal agency or Department component for direct response to the requester, the component's FOIA Officer should typically notify the requester in writing of the referral and inform the requester of the name(s) of the agency or Department component to which the record was referred, including that agency's or component's FOIA contact information. The standard referral procedure is not appropriate where disclosure of the identity of the agency or Department component to which the referral would be made could harm an interest protected by an applicable exemption, such as the exemptions that protect personal privacy or national security interests. For example, if a non-law enforcement agency responding to a request for records on a living third party locates within its files records originating with a law enforcement agency, and if the existence of that law enforcement interest in the third party were not publicly known, then to disclose that law enforcement interest by providing notice of a referral could cause an unwarranted invasion of the personal privacy of the third party. In such cases, the agency that received the request should consult with the originating agency to seek its views on the disclosability of the record and the release determination should then be conveyed to the requester by the agency that originally received the request.
(d)
Timing of responses to consultations and referrals.
All consultations and referrals shall be handled in chronological order, based on when the FOIA request was received by the first Federal agency.
(e)
Agreements regarding consultations and referrals.
Components may make agreements with other Federal agencies to eliminate the need for consultations or referrals for particular types of records.
[66 FR 65632, Dec. 20, 2001, as amended at 71 FR 31073, June 1, 2006; 79 FR 62559, Oct. 20, 2014; 83 FR 39590, Aug. 10, 2018]
§ 4.6
Time limits and expedited processing.
(a)
In general.
Components ordinarily shall respond to requests according to their order of receipt.
(b)
Initial response and appeal.
Unless the component and the requester have agreed otherwise, or when “unusual circumstances” exist as provided for in paragraph (d) of this section, a determination whether to comply with a FOIA request shall be made by components within 20 working days (
i.e.,
excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) of the receipt of a request for a record under this part by the proper component identified in accordance with § 4.5(a). In instances involving misdirected requests that are re-routed pursuant to § 4.5(a), the response time shall commence on the date that the request is received by the proper component, but in any event not later than ten working days after the request is first received by any designated component. An administrative appeal, other than an appeal from a request made to the Office of the Inspector General, shall be decided within 20 working days of its receipt by the Office of the General Counsel. An administrative appeal from a request made to the Office of the Inspector General shall be decided within 20 working days of its receipt by the Office of the Inspector General Office of Counsel. The Department's failure to comply with the time limits identified in this paragraph constitutes exhaustion of the requester's administrative remedies for the purposes of judicial action to compel disclosure.
(c)
Clarification of request.
Components may seek a one-time clarification of a request for records under this part. The component's request for clarification must be in writing. When a component seeks clarification of a request, the time for responding to a request set forth in § 4.6(b) is tolled until the requester responds to the clarification request. The tolled period will end when the component that sought the
clarification receives a response from the requester. If a component asks for clarification and does not receive a written response from the requester within 30 calendar days from the date of the component's clarification request, the component will presume that the requester is no longer interested and notify the requester that the request will be closed.
(d)
Unusual circumstances.
(1) Components may extend the time period for processing a FOIA request only in “unusual circumstances,” as described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, in which the component shall, before expiration of the twenty-day period to respond, notify the requester of the extension in writing of the unusual circumstances involved and the date by which processing of the request is expected to be completed. If the extension is for more than ten working days, the component shall provide the requester with an opportunity to modify the request or agree to an alternative time period for processing the original or modified request. Furthermore, the requester will be advised that the relevant FOIA Public Liaison or FOIA contact is available for this purpose and of the requester's right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS).
(2) For purposes of this section, “unusual circumstances” include:
(i) The need to search for and collect the requested agency records from field facilities or other establishments that are separate from the office processing the request;
(ii) The need to search for, collect, and appropriately examine a voluminous amount of separate and distinct records that are the subject of a single request; or
(iii) The need to consult, which shall be conducted with all practicable speed, with another Federal agency having a substantial interest in the determination of the FOIA request or with another component of the Department which has a substantial interest in the determination of the request.
(3) If a component reasonably believes that multiple requests submitted by a requester, or by a group of requesters acting in concert, constitute a single request that would otherwise involve unusual circumstances, and the requests involve clearly related matters, the component may aggregate them. Multiple requests involving unrelated matters will not be aggregated.
(e)
Multi-track processing.
(1) A component must use two or more processing tracks by distinguishing between simple and more complex requests based on the amount of work and/or time needed to process the request, including the amount of pages involved, the need to consult with or refer to other agencies or Department components or for commercial confidential information to a third party, or whether the request qualifies for unusual circumstances as described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, and whether the request qualifies for expedited processing as described in paragraph (f) of this section.
(2) A component using multi-track processing may provide requesters in its slower track(s) with an opportunity to limit the scope of their requests in order to qualify for faster processing. A component doing so shall contact the requester by telephone, email, letter, or online FOIA case management system, whichever is the most efficient in each case.
(f)
Expedited processing.
(1) Requests and appeals shall be taken out of order and given expedited treatment whenever it is determined that they involve:
(i) Circumstances in which the lack of expedited treatment could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual;
(ii) The loss of substantial due process rights;
(iii) A matter of widespread and exceptional media interest involving questions about the Government's integrity which affect public confidence; or
(iv) An urgency to inform the public about an actual or alleged Federal Government activity, if made by a person primarily engaged in disseminating information.
(2) A request for expedited processing may be made at the time of the initial request for records or at any later time. For a prompt determination, a request for expedited processing should
be sent to the component listed in appendix A to this part that maintains the records requested.
(3) A requester who seeks expedited processing must submit a statement, certified to be true and correct to the best of that person's knowledge and belief, explaining in detail the basis for requesting expedited processing. For example, a requester within the category described in paragraph (f)(1)(iv) of this section, if not a full-time member of the news media, must establish that he or she is a person whose primary professional activity or occupation is information dissemination, though it need not be his or her sole occupation. A requester within the category described in paragraph (f)(1)(iv) of this section must also establish a particular urgency to inform the public about the Government activity involved in the request—one that extends beyond the public's right to know about Government activity generally. The existence of numerous articles published on a given subject can be helpful to establishing the requirement that there be an “urgency to inform” the public on a topic. As a matter of administrative discretion, a component may waive the formal certification requirement.
(4) Within ten calendar days of its receipt of a request for expedited processing, the proper component shall decide whether to grant it and shall notify the requester of the decision. Solely for purposes of calculating the foregoing time limit, any request for expedited processing shall always be considered received on the actual date of receipt by the proper component. If a request for expedited processing is granted, the request shall be given priority and processed as soon as practicable, subject to § 4.11(i). If a request for expedited processing is denied, any appeal of that decision shall be acted on expeditiously.
[66 FR 65632, Dec. 20, 2001, as amended at 79 FR 62559, Oct. 20, 2014; 83 FR 39591, Aug. 10, 2018; 88 FR 36470, June 5, 2023]
§ 4.7
Responses to requests.
(a)
Acknowledgment of requests.
Upon receipt of a request, a component ordinarily shall send an acknowledgement to the requester which shall provide an assigned tracking request number for further reference and, if necessary, confirm whether the requester is willing to pay fees. A component must send this acknowledgment if the request will take longer than ten working days to process. In most cases, the acknowledgment email, generated by the FOIA electronic case management system, that is sent to requesters who provide an email address will suffice for this requirement.
(b)
Interim responses.
If a request involves voluminous records or requires searches in multiple locations, to the extent feasible, a component shall provide the requester with interim responses. Such responses may include records that are fully releasable or records that have been withheld in part under one or more applicable FOIA exemptions set forth at 5 U.S.C. 552(b). Bureaus will make reasonable efforts to provide to requesters an estimated date when a determination will be provided. An interim response is not a determination and appeal rights need not be provided with the interim response.
(c)
Determination
—(1)
Grants of requests.
If a component makes a determination to grant a request in whole or in part, it shall notify the requester in writing of such determination.
(i) A component shall inform the requester:
(A) Of any fees charged under § 4.11; and
(B) That the requester may contact the relevant FOIA Public Liaison or FOIA contact for further assistance.
(ii) The component shall also disclose records to the requester promptly upon payment of any applicable fees.
(iii) Records disclosed in part shall be marked or annotated to show the applicable FOIA exemption(s) and the amount of information deleted, unless doing so would harm an interest protected by an applicable exemption. The location of the information deleted shall also be indicated on the record, if feasible.
(2)
Adverse determinations of requests.
If a component makes an adverse determination regarding a request, it shall notify the requester of that determination in writing.
(i) An adverse determination may be a denial of a request and includes decisions that:
(A) The requested record is exempt, in whole or in part.
(B) The request does not reasonably describe the records sought and the requester is unwilling to further clarify the request.
(C) The information requested is not a record subject to the FOIA.
(D) The requested record does not exist, cannot be located, or has previously been destroyed.
(E) The requested record is not readily reproducible in the form or format sought by the requester.
(ii) Adverse determinations may also include:
(A) Denials of requested fee category status.
(B) Denials of requests for fee waivers.
(C) Denials of requests for expedited processing.
(D) Denials of requests for reduction of fees.
(3)
Content of denial.
The denial letter shall be signed by an official listed in appendix B to this part (or a designee), and shall include:
(i) The name and title or position of the person responsible for the denial;
(ii) A brief statement of the reason(s) for the denial, including any FOIA exemption(s) applied by the component in denying the request;
(iii) An estimate of the volume of any records or information withheld, by providing the number of pages or some other reasonable form of estimation. This estimate is not required if the volume is otherwise indicated by deletions marked on records that are disclosed in part, or if providing an estimate would harm an interest protected by an applicable FOIA exemption;
(iv) A statement advising the requester of the right to seek dispute resolution services from the Department FOIA Public Liaison, the relevant component FOIA Public Liaison or FOIA contact, or OGIS; and
(v) A statement that the denial may be appealed under § 4.10, and a list of the requirements for filing an appeal set forth in § 4.10(b).
(d) All responses shall be made subject to the provisions of § 4.25(b)(2)(iv).
[83 FR 39591, Aug. 10, 2018, as amended at 86 FR 21934, Apr. 26, 2021; 88 FR 36471, June 5, 2023]
§ 4.8
Classified information.
In processing a request for information classified under Executive Order 13526 or any other executive order concerning the classification of records, the information shall be reviewed to determine whether it should remain classified. Ordinarily the component or other Federal agency that classified the information should conduct the review, except that if a record contains information that has been derivatively classified by a component because it contains information classified by another component or agency, the component shall refer the responsibility for responding to the request to the component or agency that classified the underlying information. Information determined to no longer require classification shall not be withheld on the basis of FOIA exemption (b)(1) (5 U.S.C. 552(b)(1)), but should be reviewed to assess whether any other FOIA exemption should be invoked. Appeals involving classified information shall be processed in accordance with § 4.10(c).
[79 FR 62560, Oct. 20, 2014]
§ 4.9
Confidential commercial information.
(a)
Definitions.
For the purposes of this section:
(1)
Confidential commercial information
means commercial or financial information, obtained by the Department from a submitter, which may be protected from disclosure under FOIA exemption (b)(4) (5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4)).
(2)
Submitter
means any person or entity outside the Federal Government from which the Department obtains confidential commercial information, directly or indirectly. The term includes U.S. or foreign persons, U.S. or foreign corporations; state, local and tribal governments; and foreign governments.
(b)
Designation of confidential commercial information.
A submitter of confidential commercial information should be encouraged to use good-faith
efforts to designate, by appropriate markings, either at the time of submission or at a reasonable time thereafter, any portions of its submission that it considers to be protected from disclosure under FOIA exemption (b)(4). These designations will expire ten years after the date of the submission unless the submitter requests, and provides justification for, a longer period.
(c)
Notice to submitters.
(1) A component shall provide a submitter with prompt written notice of a FOIA request or administrative appeal that seeks its confidential commercial information whenever required under paragraph (d) of this section, except as provided in paragraph (g) of this section, in order to give the submitter an opportunity under paragraph (e) of this section to object to disclosure of any specified portion of that information.
(2) Such written notice shall be sent via certified mail, return receipt requested, or similar means.
(3) Where notification of a voluminous number of submitters is required, such notification may be accomplished by posting or publishing the notice in a place reasonably calculated to accomplish notification.
(4) The notice shall either describe the confidential commercial information requested or include copies of the requested records or portions of the records containing the information. If notification of a large number of submitters is required, notification may be made by posting or publishing the notice in a place reasonably likely to accomplish notification, instead of sending individual notifications.
(d)
When notice is required.
Notice shall be given to the submitter whenever:
(1) The submitter has designated the information in good faith as protected from disclosure under FOIA exemption (b)(4); or
(2) The component has reason to believe that the information may be protected from disclosure under FOIA exemption (b)(4), but has not yet determined whether the information is protected from disclosure.
(e)
Opportunity to object to disclosure.
A component shall allow a submitter seven working days (
i.e.,
excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) from the date of receipt of the written notice described in paragraph (c) of this section to provide the component with a statement of any objection to disclosure. A FOIA Officer may extend the comment period from seven to ten working days, if a submitter requests an extension. The statement from a submitter must identify any portions of the information the submitter requests to be withheld under FOIA exemption (b)(4), and describe how each qualifies for protection under the exemption: That is, why the information is a trade secret, or commercial or financial information that is privileged or confidential. If a submitter fails to respond to the notice within the time specified, the submitter will be considered to have no objection to disclosure of the information. Information a submitter provides under this paragraph may itself be subject to disclosure under the FOIA.
(f)
Notice of intent to disclose.
A component shall consider a submitter's objections and specific grounds under the FOIA for nondisclosure in deciding whether to disclose confidential commercial information. If a component decides to disclose confidential commercial information over a submitter's objection, the component shall give the submitter written notice via certified mail, return receipt requested, or similar means, which shall include:
(1) A statement of reason(s) why the submitter's objections to disclosure were not sustained;
(2) A description of the confidential commercial information to be disclosed; and
(3) A statement that the component intends to disclose the information seven working days, or ten working days if an extension is granted, from the date the submitter receives the notice.
(g)
Exceptions to notice requirements.
The notice requirements of paragraphs (c) and (f) of this section shall not apply if:
(1) The component determines that the information is exempt and will be withheld under a FOIA exemption;
(2) The information has been lawfully published or has been officially made available to the public;
(3) Disclosure of the information is required by statute (other than the FOIA) or by a regulation issued in accordance with Executive Order 12600; or
(4) The designation made by the submitter under paragraph (b) of this section appears obviously frivolous, except that, in such a case, the component shall provide the submitter written notice of any final decision to disclose the information seven working days after the date the submitter receives the notice.
(h)
Notice to submitter of FOIA lawsuit.
Whenever a requester files a lawsuit seeking to compel the disclosure of confidential commercial information, the component shall promptly notify the submitter. Where notification of a voluminous number of submitters is required, such notification may be accomplished by posting or publishing the notice in a place reasonably calculated to accomplish notification.
(i)
Corresponding notice to requester.
Whenever a component provides a submitter with notice and an opportunity to object to disclosure under paragraph (c) of this section, the component shall notify the requester that the request is being processed under the provisions of this regulation and, as a consequence, there may be a delay in receiving a response. The notice to the requester will not include any of the specific information contained in the records being requested. Whenever a submitter files a lawsuit seeking to prevent the disclosure of confidential commercial information, the component shall notify the requester of such action and, as a consequence, there may be further delay in receiving a response.
[83 FR 39592, Aug. 10, 2018]
§ 4.10
Appeals from initial determinations or untimely delays.
(a)(1) If a request for records to a component other than the Office of Inspector General is initially denied in whole or in part, or has not been timely determined, or if a requester receives an adverse determination regarding any other matter listed under this subpart (as described in § 4.7(c)), the requester may file an appeal. Appeals can be submitted in writing or electronically, as described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. For requests filed on or after July 1, 2016, the appeal must be received by the Office of the General Counsel during normal business hours (8:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time, Monday through Friday) within 90 calendar days of the date of the written denial of the adverse determination or, if there has been no determination, an appeal may be submitted any time after the due date of the request, including the last extension under § 4.6(d), of a request due date. Written or electronic appeals arriving after normal business hours will be deemed received on the next normal business day. If the 90th calendar day falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or a legal public holiday, an appeal received by 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time, the next business day will be deemed timely. Appeals received after the 90-day limit will not be considered.
(2) If a request for records to the Office of Inspector General is initially denied in whole or in part, or has not been timely determined, or if a requester receives an adverse determination regarding any other matter listed under this subpart (as described in § 4.7(c)), the requester may file an appeal. Appeals can be submitted in writing or electronically, as described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. For requests submitted on or after July 1, 2016, the appeal must be received by the Office of Inspector General, Office of Counsel, during normal business hours (8:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time, Monday through Friday) within 90 calendar days of the date of the written denial of the adverse determination or, if there has been no determination, an appeal may be submitted any time after the due date, including the last extension under § 4.6(d), of the adverse determination. Written or electronic appeals arriving after normal business hours will be deemed received on the next normal business day. If the 90th calendar day falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or a legal public holiday, an appeal received by 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time, the next business day will be deemed timely. Appeals received after the 90-day limit will not be considered.
(b)(1) Appeals, other than appeals from requests made to the Office of Inspector General, shall be decided by the
Assistant General Counsel for Employment, Litigation, and Information (AGC-ELI). Written appeals should be addressed to the Assistant General Counsel for Employment, Litigation, and Information, at the U.S. Department of Commerce, Office of the General Counsel, Room 5896, 1401 Constitution Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20230. For a written appeal, both the letter and the appeal envelope should be clearly marked “Freedom of Information Act Appeal.” Appeals may also be submitted electronically by email to
FOIAAppeals@doc.gov
or through the online case management system. In all cases, the appeal (written or electronic) should include a copy of the original request and initial denial, if any. All appeals should include a statement of the reasons why the records requested should be made available and why the adverse determination was in error. No opportunity for personal appearance, oral argument or hearing on appeal is provided. Upon receipt of an appeal, the AGC-ELI ordinarily shall send an acknowledgement letter to the requester which shall confirm receipt of the requester's appeal.
(2) Appeals of initial and untimely determinations by the OIG shall be decided by the Counsel to the Inspector General, except that appeals of records requests that were initially denied by the Counsel to the Inspector General shall be decided by the Deputy Inspector General. Written appeals should be addressed to the Counsel to the Inspector General, or the Deputy Inspector General if the records were initially denied by the Counsel to the Inspector General. The address of both is: U.S. Department of Commerce, Office of the Inspector General, Office of Counsel, Room 7898C, 1401 Constitution Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20230. For a written appeal, both the letter and the appeal envelope should be clearly marked “Freedom of Information Act Appeal.” Appeals may also be submitted electronically by email to
FOIA@oig.doc.gov
or through the online case management system. In all cases, the appeal (written or electronic) should include a copy of the original request and initial denial, if any. All appeals should include a statement of the reasons why the records requested should be made available and why the adverse determination was in error. No opportunity for personal appearance, oral argument or hearing on appeal is provided. Upon receipt of an appeal, the Counsel to the Inspector General, or the Deputy Inspector General if the records were initially denied by the Counsel to the Inspector General, ordinarily shall send an acknowledgement letter to the requester which shall confirm receipt of the requester's appeal.
(c) Upon receipt of an appeal involving records initially denied on the basis of FOIA exemption (b)(1), the records shall be forwarded to the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Security (DAS) for a declassification review. The DAS may overrule previous classification determinations in whole or in part if continued protection in the interest of national security is no longer required, or no longer required at the same level. The DAS shall advise the AGC-ELI, the General Counsel, Counsel to the Inspector General, or Deputy Inspector General, as appropriate, of his or her decision.
(d) If an appeal is granted, the notification letter may include documents to be released or the request may be referred back to the component for further action consistent with the determination on the appeal.
(e) If no determination on an appeal has been sent to the requester within the twenty working day period specified in § 4.6(b) or the last extension thereof, the requester is deemed to have exhausted all administrative remedies with respect to the request, giving rise to a right of judicial review under 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(C). If the requester initiates a court action against the Department based on the provision in this paragraph, the administrative appeal process may continue.
(f) The determination on an appeal shall be in writing and, when it denies records in whole or in part, the letter to the requester shall include:
(1) A brief explanation of the basis for the denial, including a list of the applicable FOIA exemptions and a description of how they apply;
(2) A statement that the decision is final for the Department;
(3) Notification that dispute resolution services are offered by the Office
of Government Information Services (OGIS) of the National Archives and Records Administration as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation, informing the requester that dispute resolution is a voluntary process, and if the Department and requester agree to participate in the dispute resolution services provided by OGIS, the Department will actively engage as a partner to the process in an attempt to resolve the dispute.
(4) Notification that judicial review of the denial is available in the district court of the United States in the district in which the requester resides, or has his or her principal place of business, or in which the agency records are located, or in the District of Columbia; and
(5) The name and title or position of the official responsible for denying the appeal.
[66 FR 65632, Dec. 20, 2001, as amended at 69 FR 49784, Aug. 12, 2004; 79 FR 62561, Oct. 20, 2014; 80 FR 70153, Nov. 13, 2015; 83 FR 39593, Aug. 10, 2018; 88 FR 36471, June 5, 2023]
§ 4.11
Fees.
(a)
In general.
Components shall charge fees for processing requests under the FOIA in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section, except where fees are limited under paragraph (d) of this section or when a waiver or reduction is granted under paragraph (l) of this section. A component shall collect all applicable fees before processing a request if a component determines that advance payment is required in accordance with paragraphs (i)(2) and (i)(3) of this section. If advance payment of fees is not required, a component shall collect all applicable fees before sending copies of requested records to a requester. Requesters must pay fees by check or money order made payable to the Treasury of the United States.
(b)
Definitions.
For purposes of this section:
(1)
Commercial use request
means a request from or on behalf of a person who seeks information for a use or purpose that furthers his or her commercial, trade, or profit interests, which can include furthering those interests through litigation. Components shall determine, whenever reasonably possible, the use to which a requester will put the requested records. If it appears that the requester will put the records to a commercial use, or if a component has reasonable cause to doubt a requester's asserted non-commercial use, the component shall provide the requester a reasonable opportunity to submit further clarification.
(2)
Direct costs
means those expenses a component incurs in searching for and duplicating (and, in the case of commercial use requests, reviewing) records to respond to a FOIA request. The hourly processing fees for calculating direct costs for Department or component personnel searching for, duplication, and reviewing records are reflected in Table 1. Note that the 16% overhead has already been included in the hourly rates identified in Table 1.

(3)
Duplication
means the making of a copy of a record, or of the information contained in it, necessary to respond to a FOIA request. Copies may take the form of paper, microform, audiovisual materials, or electronic records, among others. A component shall honor a requester's specified preference of form or format of disclosure if the record is readily reproducible with reasonable efforts in the requested form or format.
(4)
Educational institution
is any school that operates a program of scholarly research. A requester in this fee category must show that the request is made in connection with his or her role at the educational institution. Educational institutions may include a
preschool, a public or private elementary or secondary school, an institution of undergraduate higher education, an institution of graduate higher education, an institution of professional education, or an institution of vocational education A Department component may seek verification from the requester that the request is in furtherance of scholarly research and agencies will advise requesters of their placement in this category. Verification may be supported by a letter from a teacher, instructor, or professor written on the institution's letterhead or from an institutional email address and in which the body of the email outlines the research to be conducted. Student requests may be supported by evidence that the records are sought for the student's academic research purposes, for example, through evidence of a class assignment or a letter from a teacher, instructor, or professor. A component's decision to grant a requester educational institution status will be made on a case-by-case basis based upon the requester's intended use of the material.

# Example 1.
A request from a professor or a student of geology at a university for records relating to soil erosion, written on letterhead of the Department of Geology, would be presumed to be from an educational institution.

# Example 2.
A request from the same professor or student of geology seeking drug information from the Food and Drug Administration in furtherance of a murder mystery he is writing would not be presumed to be an institutional request, regardless of whether it was written on institutional letterhead.

# Example 3.
A student who makes a request in furtherance of their coursework or other school-sponsored activities and provides a copy of a course syllabus or other reasonable documentation to indicate the research purpose for the request, would qualify as part of this fee category.
(5)
Noncommercial scientific institution
means an institution that is not operated on a “commercial” basis, as that term is defined in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, and that is operated solely for the purpose of conducting scientific research, the results of which are not intended to promote any particular product or industry. To be in this category, a requester must show that the request is authorized by and is made under the auspices of a qualifying institution and that the records are sought to further scientific research rather than for a commercial use.
(6)
Representative of the news media, or news media requester,
means any person or entity that actively gathers information of potential interest to a segment of the public, uses its editorial skills to turn the raw materials into a distinct work and distributes that work to an audience. The term “news” means information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. Examples of news-media entities are television or radio stations broadcasting to the public at-large and publishers of periodicals that disseminate “news” and make their products available through a variety of means to the general public including news organizations that disseminate solely on the internet. To be in this category, a requester must not be seeking the requested records for a commercial use. A request for records that supports the news-dissemination function of the requester shall not be considered to be for a commercial use. A freelance journalist shall be regarded as working for a news-media entity if the journalist can demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication through that entity, whether or not the journalist is actually employed by the entity. A publication contract would be the clearest proof, but components shall also look to the past publication record of a requester in making this determination. A component's decision to grant a requester media status will be made on a case-by-case basis based upon the requester's intended use of the material. The mere fact that a person or entity has been classified as news media with respect to one request does not mean they will be so considered as news media with respect to any other requests.
(7)
Review
means the examination of a record located in response to a request in order to determine whether any portion of it is exempt from disclosure. Review time includes processing any record for disclosure, such as doing all that is necessary to prepare the record for disclosure, including the process of redacting it and marking any applicable exemptions. Review
costs are recoverable even if a record ultimately is not disclosed. Review time includes time spent obtaining and considering any formal objection to disclosure made by a submitter under § 4.9, but does not include time spent resolving general legal or policy issues regarding the application of exemptions.
(8)
Search
means the process of looking for and retrieving records or information responsive to a request. It includes identification of information within records and also includes reasonable efforts to locate and retrieve information from records maintained in electronic form or format. Components shall ensure that searches are done in the most efficient and least expensive manner reasonably possible.
(c)
Fees.
In responding to FOIA requests, components shall charge the fees summarized in chart form in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section and explained in paragraphs (c)(3) through (c)(5) of this section, unless a waiver or reduction of fees has been granted under paragraph (l) of this section.
(1) The four categories and chargeable fees are:

(B) Other reproduction (e.g., converting paper into an electronic format (e.g., scanning), computer disk or printout, or other electronically-formatted reproduction (e.g., uploading records made available to the requester))
Actual direct cost, including operator time, using the hourly rate from Table 1, of the employee involved.
(3)
Search.
(i) Search fees shall be charged for all requests—other than requests made by educational institutions, noncommercial scientific institutions, or representatives of the news media—subject to the limitations of paragraph (d) of this section. Components shall charge for time spent searching even if they do not locate any responsive records or if they withhold any records located as entirely exempt from disclosure. Search fees shall be the direct costs of conducting the search by the involved employees.
(ii) For computer searches of records, requesters will be charged the direct costs of conducting the search, although certain requesters (as provided in paragraph (d)(1) of this section) will be charged no search fee and certain other requesters (as provided in paragraph (d)(3) of this section) are entitled to the cost equivalent of two hours of manual search time without charge. These direct costs will include the costs of the operator/programmer FOIA hourly processing rate apportionable to the search and any other tangible direct costs associated with a computer search.
(4)
Duplication.
Duplication fees shall be charged to all requesters, subject to the limitations of paragraph (d) of this section. A component shall honor a requester's preference for receiving a record in a particular form or format where it is readily producible by the component in the form or format requested. For either a photocopy or a computer-generated printout of a
record (no more than one copy of which need be supplied), the fee shall be $.08 per page. Requesters may reduce costs by specifying double-sided duplication, except where this is technically not feasible. For electronic forms of duplication, other than a computer-generated printout, components will charge the direct costs of that duplication. Such direct costs will include the costs of the requested electronic medium on which the copy is to be made and the actual operator time and computer resource usage required to produce the copy, to the extent they can be determined.
(5)
Review.
Review fees shall be charged to requesters who make a commercial use request. Review fees shall be charged only for the initial record review, in which a component determines whether an exemption applies to a particular record at the initial request level. No charge shall be imposed for review at the administrative appeal level for an exemption already applied. However, records withheld under an exemption that is subsequently determined not to apply may be reviewed again to determine whether any other exemption not previously considered applies, and the costs of that review are chargeable. Review fees shall be the direct costs of conducting the review by the involved employees.
(d)
Limitations on charging fees.
(1) No search fees shall be charged for requests from educational institutions, non-commercial scientific institutions, or representatives of the news media.
(2) No search fee or review fee shall be charged for a quarter-hour period unless more than half of that period is required for search or review.
(3) Except for requesters seeking records for a commercial use, components shall provide without charge:
(i) The first 100 pages of duplication (or the cost equivalent); and
(ii) The first two hours of search (or the cost equivalent).
(4) If a total fee calculated under paragraph (c) of this section is $20.00 or less for any request, no fee shall be charged. If such total fee is more than $20.00, the full amount of such fee shall be charged.
(5) The provisions of paragraphs (d) (3) and (4) of this section work together. This means that for requesters other than those seeking records for a commercial use, no fee shall be charged unless the cost of search in excess of two hours plus the cost of duplication in excess of 100 pages totals more than $20.00.
(6) No search fees shall be charged to a FOIA requester when a component does not comply with the statutory time limits at 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6) in which to respond to a request (this section only applies to FOIA requests, not appeals), except as described in paragraph (d)(8) of this section.
(7) No duplication fees shall be charged to requesters in the fee category of a representative of the news media or an educational or noncommercial scientific institution when a component does not comply with the statutory time limits at 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6) in which to respond to a request, except as described in paragraph (d)(8) of this section.
(8)(i) When a Department component determines that unusual circumstances, as those terms are defined in § 4.6(d)(2), apply to the processing of the request, and provides timely written notice to the requester in accordance with the FOIA, then the Department component is granted an additional ten days until the fee restrictions in paragraphs (d)(6) and (7) of this section apply.
(ii) The fee restrictions in paragraphs (d)(6) and (7) of this section do not apply:
(A) When a Department component determines that unusual circumstances, as those terms are defined in § 4.6(d)(2), apply to the processing of the request;
(B) More than 5,000 pages are necessary to respond to the request;
(C) The Department component provides timely written notice to the requester in accordance with the FOIA; and
(D) The Department component has discussed with the requester (or made three good faith attempts to do so) on how the requester can effectively limit the scope of the request.
(e)
Notice of anticipated fees in excess of $20.00.
(1) When a component determines or estimates that the fees for processing a FOIA request will total
more than $20.00 or total more than the amount the requester indicated a willingness to pay, the component shall notify the requester of the actual or estimated amount of the fees, unless the requester has stated in writing a willingness to pay fees as high as those anticipated. If only a portion of the fee can be estimated readily, the component shall advise the requester that the estimated fee may be only a portion of the total fee. A notice under this paragraph shall offer the requester an opportunity to discuss the matter with Departmental personnel in order to modify the request in an effort to meet the requester's needs at a lower cost. The requester may also contact the Department FOIA Public Liaison, the relevant component's FOIA Public Liaison or FOIA contact, or OGIS for further assistance, or file an administrative appeal of the fee estimate amount in accordance with § 4.10.
(2) When a requester has been notified that the actual or estimated fees will amount to more than $20.00, or amount to more than the amount the requester indicated a willingness to pay, the component will do no further work on the request until the requester agrees in writing to pay the actual or estimated total fee. The component will toll the processing of the request when it notifies the requester of the actual or estimated amount of fees and this time will be excluded from the twenty (20) working day time limit (as specified in § 4.6(b)). The requester's agreement to pay fees must be made in writing, must designate an exact dollar amount the requester is willing to pay, and must be received within 30 calendar days from the date of the notification of the fee estimate. If the requester fails to submit an agreement to pay the anticipated fees within 30 calendar days from the date of the component's fee notice, the component will presume that the requester is no longer interested and notify the requester that the request will be closed.
(f)
Charges for other services.
Apart from the other provisions of this section, if a component decides, as a matter of administrative discretion, to comply with a request for special services, the component shall charge the direct cost of providing them. Such services could include certifying that records are true copies or sending records by other than ordinary mail.
(g)
Charging interest.
Components shall charge interest on any unpaid bill starting on the 31st calendar day following the date of billing the requester. Interest charges shall be assessed at the rate provided in 31 U.S.C. 3717 and accrue from the date of the billing until the component receives payment. Components shall take all steps authorized by the Debt Collection Act of 1982, as amended by the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996, to effect payment, including offset, disclosure to consumer reporting agencies, and use of collection agencies.
(h)
Aggregating requests.
If a component reasonably believes that a requester or a group of requesters acting together is attempting to divide a request into a series of requests for the purpose of avoiding fees, the component may aggregate those requests and charge accordingly. Among the factors a component shall consider in deciding whether to aggregate are the closeness in time between the component's receipt of the requests, and the relatedness of the matters about which the requests are made. A component may generally presume that multiple requests that involve related matters made by the same requester or a closely related group of requesters within a 30 calendar day period have been made in order to avoid fees. If requests are separated by a longer period, a component shall aggregate them only if a solid basis exists for determining that aggregation is warranted under all the circumstances involved. Multiple requests involving unrelated matters shall not be aggregated.
(i)
Advance payments.
(1) For requests other than those described in paragraphs (i)(2) and (3) of this section, a component shall not require the requester to make an advance payment (
i.e.,
a payment made before a component begins to process or continues work on a request). Payment owed for work already completed (
i.e.,
a pre-payment before copies of responsive records are sent to a requester) is not an advance payment.
(2) When a component determines or estimates that the total fee for processing a FOIA request will be $250.00 or more, the component shall notify the requester of the actual or estimated fee and require the requester to make an advance payment of the entire anticipated fee before beginning to process the request. A notice under this paragraph shall offer the requester an opportunity to discuss the matter with Departmental personnel in order to modify the request in an effort to meet the requester's needs at a lower cost.
(3) When a requester has previously failed to pay a properly charged FOIA fee to any component or other Federal agency within 30 calendar days of the date of billing, the component shall notify the requester that he or she is required to pay the full amount due, plus any applicable interest, and to make an advance payment of the full amount of any anticipated fee, before the component begins to process a new request or continues to process a pending request from that requester. A notice under this paragraph shall offer the requester an opportunity to discuss the matter with Departmental personnel in order to modify the request in an effort to meet the requester's needs at a lower cost.
(4) When the component requires advance payment or payment due under paragraphs (i)(2) and (i)(3) of this section, the component will not further process the request until the required payment is made. The component will toll the processing of the request when it notifies the requester of the advanced payment due and this time will be excluded from the twenty (20) working day time limit (as specified in § 4.6(b)). If the requester does not pay the advance payment within 30 calendar days from the date of the component's fee notice, the component will presume that the requester is no longer interested and notify the requester that the request will be closed.
(j)
Tolling.
When necessary for the component to clarify issues regarding fee assessment with the FOIA requester, the time limit for responding to the FOIA request is tolled until the component resolves such issues with the requester. The tolling period is from the day a requester was contacted through the working day (
i.e.,
excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) on which a response was received by the responsible component.
(k)
Other statutes specifically providing for fees.
The fee schedule of this section does not apply to fees charged under any statute (except for the FOIA) that specifically requires an agency to set and collect fees for particular types of records. If records responsive to requests are maintained for distribution by agencies operating such statutorily based fee schedule programs, components shall inform requesters how to obtain records from those sources. Provision of such records is not handled under the FOIA.
(l)
Requirements for waiver or reduction of fees.
(1) Records responsive to a request will be furnished without charge, or at a charge reduced below that established under paragraph (c) of this section, if the requester asks for such a waiver in writing and the responsible component determines, after consideration of information provided by the requester, that the requester has demonstrated that:
(i) Disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the Government; and
(ii) Disclosure of the information is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.
(2) To determine whether the first fee waiver requirement is met, components shall consider the following factors:
(i)
The subject of the request:
whether the subject of the requested records concerns the operations or activities of the Government. The subject of the requested records must concern identifiable operations or activities of the Federal Government, with a connection that is direct and clear, not remote or attenuated.
(ii)
The informative value of the information to be disclosed:
whether the disclosure is “likely to contribute” to an understanding of Government operations or activities. The disclosable portions of the requested records must be meaningfully informative about Government operations or activities in order to be “likely to contribute” to an
increased public understanding of those operations or activities. The disclosure of information that already is in the public domain, in either a duplicative or a substantially identical form, would not be likely to contribute to such understanding.
(iii)
The contribution to an understanding of the subject by the public likely to result from disclosure:
Whether disclosure of the requested information will contribute to the understanding of a reasonably broad audience of persons interested in the subject, as opposed to the individual understanding of the requester. A requester's expertise in the subject area and ability and intention to effectively convey information to the public shall be considered. It shall be presumed that a representative of the news media satisfies this consideration.
(iv)
The significance of the contribution to public understanding:
whether the disclosure is likely to contribute “significantly” to public understanding of Government operations or activities. The public's understanding of the subject in question prior to the disclosure must be significantly enhanced by the disclosure.
(3) To determine whether the second fee waiver requirement (
i.e.
, that disclosure is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester) is met, components shall consider the following factors:
(i)
The existence and magnitude of a commercial interest:
whether the requester has a commercial interest that would be furthered by the requested disclosure. Components shall consider any commercial interest of the requester (with reference to the definition of “commercial use request” in paragraph (b)(1) of this section), or of any person on whose behalf the requester may be acting, that would be furthered by the requested disclosure. Requesters shall be given an opportunity to provide explanatory information regarding this consideration.
(ii)
The primary interest in disclosure:
Whether any identified commercial interest of the requester is sufficiently great, in comparison with the public interest in disclosure, that disclosure is “primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.” A fee waiver or reduction is justified if the public interest standard (paragraph (l)(1)(i) of this section) is satisfied and the public interest is greater than any identified commercial interest in disclosure. Components ordinarily shall presume that if a news media requester has satisfied the public interest standard, the public interest is the primary interest served by disclosure to that requester. Disclosure to data brokers or others who merely compile and market Government information for direct economic return shall not be presumed to primarily serve the public interest.
(4) If only some of the records to be released satisfy the requirements for a fee waiver, a waiver shall be granted for those records.
(5) Requests for the waiver or reduction of fees should address the factors listed in paragraphs (l)(2) and (3) of this section, insofar as they apply to each request.

[66 FR 65632, Dec. 20, 2001, as amended at 86 FR 21935, Apr. 26, 2021]
§ 4.23
Procedures for making inquiries.
(a) Any individual, regardless of age, who is a citizen of the United States or an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence into the United States may submit an inquiry to the Department. The inquiry should be made either in person or by mail addressed to the appropriate component identified in appendix A to this part or to the official identified in the notification procedures paragraph of the systems of records notice published in the
Federal Register.
2
If an individual believes the Department maintains a record pertaining to him or her but does not know which system of records might contain such a record and/or which component of the Department maintains the system of records, assistance in person or by mail will be provided at the first address listed in appendix A to this part.
2
The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), which is established as an agency of the United States within the Department of Commerce, operates under its own PA regulations at 37 CFR part 102, subpart B. Accordingly, requests concerning records maintained by the USPTO should be sent directly to the USPTO.
(b) Inquiries submitted by mail should include the words “PRIVACY ACT INQUIRY” in capital letters at the top of the letter and on the face of the envelope. If the inquiry is for general information regarding the Act and this subpart, no particular information is required. The Department reserves the right to require compliance with the identification procedures appearing at § 4.24(d). If the inquiry is a request that the Department determine whether it has a record pertaining to the individual, the following information should be submitted:
(1) Name of individual whose record is sought;
(2) Statement that individual whose record is sought is either a U.S. citizen or an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence;
(3) Identifying data that will help locate the record (for example, maiden name, occupational license number, period or place of employment, etc.);

(5) Action requested (that is, sending information on how to exercise rights under the Act; determining whether requested record exists; gaining access to requested record; or obtaining copy of requested record);
(6) Copy of court guardianship order or minor's birth certificate, as provided in § 4.24(d)(3), but only if requester is guardian or parent of individual whose record is sought;
(7) Requester's name (printed), signature, address, and (optional) telephone number;
(8) Date; and,
(9) Certification of request by notary or other official, but only if
(i) Request is for notification that requested record exists, for access to requested record, or for copy of requested record;
(ii) Record is not available to any person under 5 U.S.C. 552; and
(iii) Requester does not appear before an employee of the Department for verification of identity.
(c) Any inquiry which is not addressed as specified in paragraph (a) of this section or which is not marked as specified in paragraph (b) of this section will be so addressed and marked by Department personnel and forwarded immediately to the responsible Privacy Act Officer. An inquiry which is not properly addressed by the individual will not be deemed to have been “received” for purposes of measuring
the time period for response until actual receipt by the Privacy Act Officer. In each instance when an inquiry so forwarded is received, the Privacy Act Officer shall notify the individual that his or her inquiry was improperly addressed and the date the inquiry was received at the proper address.
(d)(1) Each inquiry received shall be acted upon promptly by the responsible Privacy Act Officer. Every effort will be made to respond within ten working days (
i.e.
, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and legal public holidays) of the date of receipt at the proper address. If a response cannot be made within ten working days, the Privacy Act Officer shall send an acknowledgment during that period providing information on the status of the inquiry and asking for such further information as may be necessary to process the inquiry. The first correspondence sent by the Privacy Act Officer to the requester shall contain the Department's control number assigned to the request, as well as a statement that the requester should use that number in all future contacts with the Department. The Department shall use that control number in all subsequent correspondence.
(2) If the Privacy Act Officer fails to send an acknowledgment within ten working days, as provided in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the requester may ask the Assistant General Counsel for Litigation, Employment, and Oversight to take corrective action. No failure of a Privacy Act Officer to send an acknowledgment shall confer administrative finality for purposes of judicial review.
(e) An individual shall not be required to state a reason for or otherwise justify his or her inquiry.
(f) Special note should be taken that certain agencies are responsible for publishing notices of systems of records having Government-wide application to other agencies, including the Department. The agencies known to be publishing these general notices and the types of records covered therein appear in appendix C to this part. These general notices do not identify the Privacy Act Officers in the Department to whom inquiries should be presented or mailed. The provisions of this section, and particularly paragraph (a) of this section, should be followed in making inquiries with respect to such records. Such records in the Department are subject to the provisions of this part to the extent indicated in appendix C to this part. The exemptions, if any, determined by the agency publishing a general notice shall be invoked and applied by the Department after consultation, as necessary, with that other agency.
§ 4.24
Procedures for making requests for records.
(a) Any individual, regardless of age, who is a citizen of the United States or an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence into the United States may submit a request to the Department for access to records. The request should be made either in person or by mail addressed to the appropriate office listed in appendix A to this part.
(b) Requests submitted by mail should include the words “PRIVACY ACT REQUEST” in capital letters at the top of the letter and on the face of the envelope. Any request which is not addressed as specified in paragraph (a) of this section or which is not marked as specified in this paragraph will be so addressed and marked by Department personnel and forwarded immediately to the responsible Privacy Act Officer. A request which is not properly addressed by the individual will not be deemed to have been “received” for purposes of measuring time periods for response until actual receipt by the Privacy Act Officer. In each instance when a request so forwarded is received, the Privacy Act Officer shall notify the individual that his or her request was improperly addressed and the date the request was received at the proper address.
(c) If the request follows an inquiry under § 4.23 in connection with which the individual's identity was established by the Department, the individual need only indicate the record to which access is sought, provide the Department control number assigned to the request, and sign and date the request. If the request is not preceded by an inquiry under § 4.23, the procedures of this section should be followed.
(d) The requirements for identification of individuals seeking access to records are:
(1)
In person.
Each individual making a request in person shall be required to present satisfactory proof of identity. The means of proof, in the order of preference and priority, are:
(i) A document bearing the individual's photograph (for example, driver's license, passport or military or civilian identification card);
(ii) A document, preferably issued for participation in a Federally-sponsored program, bearing the individual's signature (for example, unemployment insurance book, employer's identification card, national credit card, and professional, craft or union membership card); and,
(iii) A document bearing neither the photograph nor the signature of the individual, preferably issued for participation in a Federally-sponsored program (for example, Medicaid card). If the individual can provide no suitable documentation of identity, the Department will require a signed statement asserting the individual's identity and stipulating that the individual understands the penalty provision of 5 U.S.C. 552a(i)(3) recited in § 4.32(a). In order to avoid any unwarranted disclosure of an individual's records, the Department reserves the right to determine the adequacy of proof of identity offered by any individual, particularly if the request involves a sensitive record.
(2)
Not in person.
If the individual making a request does not appear in person before a Privacy Act Officer or other employee authorized to determine identity, then identity must be determined by:
(i) A certification of a notary public or equivalent officer empowered to administer oaths must accompany the request under the circumstances prescribed in § 4.23(b)(9). The certification in or attached to the letter must be substantially in accordance with the following text:
City of ____ County of ____. (Name of individual), who affixed (his) (her) signature below in my presence, came before me, a (title), in and for the aforesaid County and State, this __ day of __, 20_, and established (his) (her) identity to my satisfaction. My commission expires ____.
Signature: ______.; or
(ii) Statement of identity made under 28 U.S.C. 1746, a law that permits statements to be made under penalty of perjury as a substitute for notarization.
(3)
Parents of minors and legal guardians.
An individual acting as the parent of a minor or the legal guardian of the individual to whom a record pertains shall establish his or her personal identity in the same manner prescribed in either paragraph (d)(1) or (d)(2) of this section. In addition, such other individual shall establish his or her identity in the representative capacity of parent or legal guardian. In the case of the parent of a minor, the proof of identity shall be a certified or authenticated copy of the minor's birth certificate. In the case of a legal guardian of an individual who has been declared incompetent due to physical or mental incapacity or age by a court of competent jurisdiction, the proof of identity shall be a certified or authenticated copy of the court's order. For purposes of the Act, a parent or legal guardian may represent only a living individual, not a decedent. A parent or legal guardian may be accompanied during personal access to a record by another individual, provided the provisions of § 4.25(f) are satisfied.
(e) If the provisions of this subpart are alleged to impede an individual in exercising his or her right to access, the Department will consider, from an individual making a request, alternative suggestions regarding proof of identity and access to records.
(f) An individual shall not be required to state a reason for or otherwise justify his or her request for access to a record.

§ 4.25
Disclosure of requested records to individuals.
(a)(1) The responsible Privacy Act Officer shall act promptly upon each request. Every effort will be made to respond within ten working days (
i.e.
, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and legal public holidays) of the date of receipt. If a response cannot be made within ten working days due to unusual circumstances, the Privacy Act Officer shall send an acknowledgment during
that period providing information on the status of the request and asking for any further information that may be necessary to process the request. “Unusual circumstances” shall include circumstances in which:
(i) A search for and collection of requested records from inactive storage, field facilities or other establishments is required;
(ii) A voluminous amount of data is involved;
(iii) Information on other individuals must be separated or expunged from the particular record; or
(iv) Consultations with other agencies having a substantial interest in the determination of the request are necessary.
(2) If the Privacy Act Officer fails to send an acknowledgment within ten working days, as provided in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the requester may ask the Assistant General Counsel for Litigation, Employment, and Oversight to take corrective action. No failure of a Privacy Act Officer to send an acknowledgment shall confer administrative finality for purposes of judicial review.
(3) Inclusion of SSNs on responsive documents.
(i) The Department shall redact SSNs from responsive documents provided to requesters where feasible. Where full redaction is not feasible, partial redaction to create a truncated SSN shall be preferred to no redaction. The following conditions must be met for the inclusion of an unredacted (full) SSN or partially redacted (truncated) SSN on a responsive document:
(ii) The inclusion of the full SSN or truncated SSN of an individual must be required or authorized by law,
(iii) The inclusion of the full SSN or truncated SSN of an individual must be determined by the Senior Agency Official for Privacy and Departmental Privacy Act Officer to be necessary to fulfill a compelling Department business need; and
(iv) The full SSN of an individual may be included only on documents listed on the USMDL.
(4) The following requirements apply when the Department mails or delivers responsive documents containing SSNs or truncated SSNs:
(i) The full SSN of an individual may be included only on documents listed on the USMDL.
(ii) For documents that are listed on the USMDL and that include the full SSN of an individual, the signature of the recipient is required upon delivery.
(iii) For documents that include the truncated form of the SSN of an individual, the signature of the recipient is required upon delivery.
(iv) The full SSN, the truncated SSN, any part of the SSN of an individual must not be visible from the outside of the envelope or package.
(b) Grant of access: (1)
Notification.
An individual shall be granted access to a record pertaining to him or her, unless the provisions of paragraph (g)(1) of this section apply. The Privacy Act Officer shall notify the individual of a determination to grant access, and provide the following information:
(i) The methods of access, as set forth in paragraph (b)(2) of this section;
(ii) The place at which the record may be inspected;
(iii) The earliest date on which the record may be inspected and the period of time that the records will remain available for inspection. In no event shall the earliest date be later than thirty calendar days from the date of notification;
(iv) The estimated date by which a copy of the record will be mailed and the fee estimate pursuant to § 4.31. In no event shall the estimated date be later than thirty calendar days from the date of notification;
(v) The fact that the individual, if he or she wishes, may be accompanied by another individual during personal access, subject to the procedures set forth in paragraph (f) of this section; and,
(vi) Any additional prerequisites for granting access to a specific record.
(2)
Methods of access.
The following methods of access to records by an individual may be available depending on the circumstances of a given situation:
(i) Inspection in person may be had in the office specified by the Privacy Act Officer granting access, during the hours indicated in appendix A to this part;
(ii) Transfer of records to a Federal facility more convenient to the individual may be arranged, but only if the Privacy Act Officer determines that a suitable facility is available, that the individual's access can be properly supervised at that facility, and that transmittal of the records to that facility will not unduly interfere with operations of the Department or involve unreasonable costs, in terms of both money and manpower; and,
(iii) Copies of documents may be mailed at the request of the individual and may be subject to payment of the fees prescribed in §§ 4.25(a)(3) and 4.31. In the event that the Department, at its own initiative, elects to provide a copy by mail, no fee will be charged to the individual.
(iv) Copies of documents listed on the USMDL that include full SSNs and that are requested by an individual are subject to payment of the fees prescribed in § 4.31.
(v) Documents containing SSNs or truncated SSNs that are required to be returned by the individual to the Department will be mailed or delivered along with a prepaid mail or delivery service envelope at the expense of the Department.
(c) Access to medical records is governed by the provisions of § 4.26.
(d) The Department shall supply such other information and assistance at the time of access as to make the record intelligible to the individual.
(e) The Department reserves the right to limit access to copies and abstracts of original records, rather than the original records. This election would be appropriate, for example, when the record is in an automated data medium such as tape or disc, when the record contains information on other individuals, and when deletion of information is permissible under exemptions (for example, 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2)). In no event shall original records of the Department be made available to the individual except under the immediate supervision of the Privacy Act Officer or his or her designee.
(f) Any individual who requests access to a record pertaining to that individual may be accompanied by another individual of his or her choice. “Accompanied” includes discussing the record in the presence of the other individual. The individual to whom the record pertains shall authorize the presence of the other individual in writing. The authorization shall include the name of the other individual, a specific description of the record to which access is sought, the Department control number assigned to the request, the date, and the signature of the individual to whom the record pertains. The other individual shall sign the authorization in the presence of the Privacy Act Officer. An individual shall not be required to state a reason or otherwise justify his or her decision to be accompanied by another individual during personal access to a record.
(g) Initial denial of access: (1)
Grounds.
Access by an individual to a record that pertains to that individual will be denied only upon a determination by the Privacy Act Officer that:
(i) The record is exempt under § 4.33 or 4.34, or exempt by determination of another agency publishing notice of the system of records, as described in § 4.23(f);
(ii) The record is information compiled in reasonable anticipation of a civil action or proceeding;
(iii) The provisions of § 4.26 pertaining to medical records have been invoked; or
(iv) The individual unreasonably has failed to comply with the procedural requirements of this part.
(2)
Notification.
The Privacy Act Officer shall give notice of denial of access to records to the individual in writing, and the notice shall include the following information:
(i) The Privacy Act Officer's name and title or position;
(ii) The date of the denial;
(iii) The reasons for the denial, including citation to the appropriate section of the Act and this part;
(iv) The individual's opportunities, if any, for further administrative consideration, including the identity and address of the responsible official. If no further administrative consideration within the Department is available, the notice shall state that the denial is administratively final; and,
(v) If stated to be administratively final within the Department, the individual's right to judicial review provided under 5 U.S.C.552a(g)(1), as limited by 5 U.S.C. 552a(g)(5).
(3)
Administrative review.
If a Privacy Act Officer issues an initial denial of a request, the individual's opportunities for further consideration shall be as follows:
(i) As to denial under paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this section, two opportunities for further consideration are available in the alternative:
(A) If the individual contests the application of an exemption to the records, the review procedures in § 4.25(g)(3)(ii) shall apply; or,
(B) If the individual challenges the validity of the exemption itself, the individual must file a petition for the issuance, amendment, or repeal of a rule under 5 U.S.C. 553(e). If the exemption was determined by the Department, such petition shall be filed with the Assistant Secretary for Administration. If the exemption was determined by another agency (as described in § 4.23(f)), the Department will provide the individual with the name and address of the other agency and any relief sought by the individual shall be that provided by the regulations of the other agency. Within the Department, no such denial is administratively final until such a petition has been filed by the individual and disposed of on the merits by the Assistant Secretary for Administration.
(ii) As to denial under paragraphs (g)(1)(ii) of this section, (g)(1)(iv) of this section or (to the limited extent provided in paragraph (g)(3)(i)(A) of this section) paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this section, the individual may file for review with the Assistant General Counsel for Litigation, Employment, and Oversight, as indicated in the Privacy Act Officer's initial denial notification. The individual and the Department shall follow the procedures in § 4.28 to the maximum extent practicable.
(iii) As to denial under paragraph (g)(1)(iii) of this section, no further administrative consideration within the Department is available because the denial is not administratively final until expiration of the time period indicated in § 4.26(a).
(h) If a request is partially granted and partially denied, the Privacy Act Officer shall follow the appropriate procedures of this section as to the records within the grant and the records within the denial.

§ 4.26
Special procedures: Medical records.
When a request for access involves medical or psychological records, the records will be reviewed by the Department's medical officer for a determination on whether disclosure would be harmful to the individual to whom they relate. If it is determined that disclosure would be harmful, the Department may refuse to disclose the records directly to the requester but shall transmit them to a doctor authorized in writing by the individual to whom the records relate to receive the documents. If an individual refuses to provide written authorization to release his or her medical records to a doctor, barring any applicable exemption, the Department shall give the individual access to his or her records by means of a copy, provided without cost to the requester, sent registered mail, return receipt requested.

(a) Any individual, regardless of age, who is a citizen of the United States or an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence into the United States may submit a request for correction or amendment to the Department. The request should be made either in person or by mail addressed to the Privacy Act Officer who processed the individual's request for access to the record, and to whom is delegated authority to make initial determinations on requests for correction or amendment.

A request that is not properly addressed by the individual will not be deemed to have been “received” for purposes of measuring the time period for response until actual receipt by the Privacy Act Officer. In each instance when a request so forwarded is received, the Privacy Act Officer shall notify the individual that his or her request was improperly addressed and the date the request was received at the proper address.

i.e.
, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and legal public holidays) after receipt of a request to correct or amend a record, the Privacy Act Officer shall send an acknowledgment providing an estimate of time within which action will be taken on the request and asking for such further information as may be necessary to process the request. The estimate of time may take into account unusual circumstances as described in § 4.25(a). No acknowledgment will be sent if the request can be reviewed, processed and the individual notified of the results of review (either compliance or denial) within the ten working days. Requests filed in person will be acknowledged in writing at the time submitted.

No failure of a Privacy Act Officer to send an acknowledgment shall confer administrative finality for purposes of judicial review.
(2) Promptly after acknowledging receipt of a request, or after receiving such further information as might have been requested, or after arriving at a decision within the ten working days, the Privacy Act Officer shall either:
(i) Make the requested correction or amendment and advise the individual in writing of such action, providing either a copy of the corrected or amended record or, in cases in which a copy cannot be provided, a statement as to the means by which the correction or amendment was effected; or

(b) Whenever an individual's record is corrected or amended pursuant to a request from that individual, the Privacy Act Officer shall notify all persons and agencies to which the corrected or amended portion of the record had been disclosed prior to its correction or amendment, if an accounting of such disclosure required by the Act was made. The notification shall require a recipient agency maintaining the record to acknowledge receipt of the notification, to correct or amend the record, and to apprise any agency or person to which it had disclosed the record of the substance of the correction or amendment.

(d) The Department will not undertake to gather evidence for the individual, but does reserve the right to verify the evidence the individual submits.
(e) Correction or amendment of a record requested by an individual will be denied only upon a determination by the Privacy Act Officer that:
(1) The individual has failed to establish, by a preponderance of the evidence, the propriety of the correction or amendment in light of the criteria set forth in paragraph (c) of this section;
(2) The record sought to be corrected or amended is part of the official record in a terminated judicial, quasi-judicial or quasi-legislative proceeding to which the individual was a party or participant;
(3) The information in the record sought to be corrected or amended, or the record sought to be corrected or amended, is the subject of a pending judicial, quasi-judicial or quasi-legislative proceeding to which the individual is a party or participant;
(4) The correction or amendment would violate a duly enacted statute or promulgated regulation; or,
(5) The individual unreasonably has failed to comply with the procedural requirements of this part.
(f) If a request is partially granted and partially denied, the Privacy Act Officer shall follow the appropriate procedures of this section as to the records within the grant and the records within the denial.

(1) The individual has a right under the Act to file with the Assistant General Counsel for Litigation, Employment, and Oversight, or in the case of an initial denial by the Office of the Inspector General, the Counsel to the Inspector General, a concise statement of reasons for disagreeing with the final determination. The statement ordinarily should not exceed one page and the Department reserves the right to reject an excessively lengthy statement. It should provide the Department control number assigned to the request, indicate the date of the final determination and be signed by the individual. The Assistant General Counsel for Litigation, Employment, and Oversight, or in the case of an initial denial by the Office of the Inspector General, the Counsel to the Inspector General, shall acknowledge receipt of such statement and inform the individual of the date on which it was received;
(2) Any such disagreement statement submitted by the individual would be noted in the disputed record, and filed with it;

(4) The Department would append to any such disagreement statement a copy of the final determination or summary thereof, which also would be provided to persons and agencies to which the disagreement statement is disclosed; and
(5) The individual has a right to judicial review of the final determination under 5 U.S.C. 552a(g)(1)(A), as limited by 5 U.S.C. 552a(g)(5).

(i) If an appeal is partially granted and partially denied, the Assistant General Counsel for Litigation, Employment, and Oversight, or in the case of an initial denial by the Office of the Inspector General, the Counsel to the Inspector General, shall follow the appropriate procedures of this section as to the records within the grant and the records within the denial.
(j) Although a copy of the final determination or a summary thereof will be treated as part of the individual's record for purposes of disclosure in instances where the individual has filed a disagreement statement, it will not be subject to correction or amendment by the individual.
(k) The provisions of paragraphs (g)(1) through (g)(3) of this section satisfy the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(3).

§ 4.33
General exemptions.
(a) Individuals may not have access to records maintained by the Department but which were provided by another agency which has determined by regulation that such information is subject to general exemption under 5 U.S.C. 552a(j). If such exempt records are within a request for access, the Department will advise the individual of their existence and of the name and address of the source agency. For any further information concerning the record and the exemption, the individual must contact that source agency.
(b) The general exemptions determined to be necessary and proper with respect to systems of records maintained by the Department, including the parts of each system to be exempted, the provisions of the Act from which they are exempted, and the justification for the exemption, are as follows:
(1)
Individuals identified in Export Transactions—COMMERCE/BIS-1.

These exemptions are necessary to ensure the proper functioning of the law enforcement activity, to protect confidential sources of information, to fulfill promises of confidentiality, to maintain the integrity of the law enforcement process, to avoid premature disclosure of the knowledge of criminal activity and the evidentiary bases of possible enforcement actions, to prevent interference with law enforcement proceedings, to avoid disclosure of investigative techniques, and to avoid endangering law enforcement personnel.

(2)
Fisheries Law Enforcement Case Files—COMMERCE/NOAA-5.
Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2), these records are hereby determined to be exempt from all provisions of the Act, except 5 U.S.C. 552a (b), (c) (1) and (2), (e) (4) (A) through (F), (e) (6), (7), (9), (10), and (11), and (i). These exemptions are necessary to ensure the proper functioning of the law enforcement activity, to protect confidential sources of information, to fulfill promises of confidentiality, to prevent interference with law enforcement proceedings, to avoid the disclosure of investigative techniques, to avoid the endangering of law enforcement personnel, to avoid premature disclosure of the knowledge of criminal activity and the evidentiary bases of possible enforcement actions, and to maintain the integrity of the law enforcement process.
(3)

of the law enforcement activity, to protect confidential sources of information, to fulfill promises of confidentiality, to prevent interference with law enforcement proceedings, to avoid the disclosure of investigative techniques, to avoid the endangering of law enforcement personnel, to avoid premature disclosure of the knowledge of criminal activity and the evidentiary bases of possible enforcement actions, and to maintain the integrity of the law enforcement process.
(4)
Access Control and Identity Management System—COMMERCE/DEPT-25.

These exemptions are necessary to ensure the proper functioning of the law enforcement activity of the agency, to prevent disclosure of classified information as required by Executive Order 13526, to assure the protection of the President, to prevent subjects of investigation from frustrating the investigatory process, to prevent the disclosure of investigative techniques, to fulfill commitments made to protect the confidentiality of information, and to avoid endangering these sources and law enforcement personnel.
[66 FR 65632, Dec. 20, 2001, as amended at 79 FR 62565, Oct. 20, 2014; 80 FR 68443, Nov. 5, 2015; 86 FR 49921, Sept. 7, 2021]
§ 4.34
Specific exemptions.
(a)(1) Certain systems of records under the Act that are maintained by the Department may occasionally contain material subject to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(1), relating to national defense and foreign policy materials. The systems of records published in the

(2) The Department hereby asserts a claim to exemption of such materials wherever they might appear in such systems of records, or any systems of records, at present or in the future. The materials would be exempt from 5 U.S.C. 552a (c)(3), (d), (e)(1), (e)(4) (G), (H), and (I), and (f), because the materials are required by Executive order to be kept secret in the interest of the national defense and foreign policy.
(b) The specific exemptions determined to be necessary and proper with respect to systems of records maintained by the Department, including the parts of each system to be exempted, the provisions of the Act from which they are exempted, and the justification for the exemption, are as follows:
(1) Exempt under 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(1). The systems of records exempt hereunder appear in paragraph (a) of this section. The claims for exemption of COMMERCE/DEPT-12, COMMERCE/BIS-1, COMMERCE/NOAA-5, COMMERCE/DEPT-25, and COMMERCE/DEPT-27 under this paragraph are subject to the condition that the general exemption claimed in § 4.33(b) is held to be invalid.
(2)(i) Exempt under 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2). The systems of records exempt (some only conditionally), the
sections of the Act from which exempted, and the reasons therefor are as follows:
(A) Individuals identified in Export Administration compliance proceedings or investigations—COMMERCE/BIS-1, but only on condition that the general exemption claimed in § 4.33(b)(1) is held to be invalid;
(B) Individuals involved in export transactions—COMMERCE/ITA-2;
(C) Fisheries Law Enforcement Case Files—COMMERCE/NOAA-5, but only on condition that the general exemption claimed in § 4.33(b)(2) is held to be invalid;
(D) Investigative and Inspection Records—COMMERCE/DEPT-12, but only on condition that the general exemption claimed in § 4.33(b)(3) is held to be invalid;
(E) Investigative Records—Persons Within the Investigative Jurisdiction of the Department—COMMERCE/DEPT-13;
(F) Access Control and Identity Management System—COMMERCE/DEPT-25, but only on condition that the general exemption claimed in § 4.33(b)(4) is held to be invalid;
(G) Investigation and Threat Management Records—COMMERCE/DEPT-27, but only on condition that the general exemption claimed in § 4.33(b)(4) is held to be invalid;
(ii) The foregoing are exempted from 5 U.S.C. 552a (c)(3), (d), (e)(1), (e)(4)(G), (H), and (I), and (f). The reasons for asserting the exemption are to prevent subjects of investigation from frustrating the investigatory process; to ensure the proper functioning and integrity of law enforcement activities; to prevent disclosure of investigative techniques; to maintain the ability to obtain necessary information; to fulfill commitments made to sources to protect their identities and the confidentiality of information; and to avoid endangering these sources and law enforcement personnel. Special note is taken that the proviso clause in this exemption imports due process and procedural protections for the individual. The existence and general character of the information exempted shall be made known to the individual to whom it pertains.
(3)(i) Exempt under 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(4). The systems of records exempt, the sections of the Act from which exempted, and the reasons therefor are as follows:
(A) Special Censuses, Surveys, and Other Studies—COMMECE/CENSUS-3;
(B) Economic Survey Collection—COMMERCE/CENSUS-4;
(C) Decennial Census Program—COMMERCE/CENSUS-5;
(D) Population Census Records for 1910
All Subsequent Decennial Census—COMMERCE/CENSUS-6;
(E) Other Agency Surveys
Reimbursable—COMMERCE/CENSUS-7;
(F) Statistical Administrative Records System—COMMERCE/CENSUS-8;
(G) Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics System—COMMERCE/CENSUS-9; and
(H) Foreign Trade Statistics—COMMERCE/CENSUS-12.
(ii) The foregoing are exempted from 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3), (d), (e)(1), (e)(4)(G) (H), and (I), and (f). The reasons for asserting the exemption are to comply with the prescription of Title 13 of the United States Code, especially sections 8 and 9 relating to prohibitions against disclosure, and to avoid needless consideration of these records whose sole statistical use comports fully with a basic purpose of the Act, namely, that no adverse determinations are made from these records as to any identifiable individual.
(4)(i) Exempt under 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(5). The systems of records exempt (some only conditionally), the sections of the Act from which exempted, and the reasons therefor are as follows:
(A) Applications to U.S. Merchant Marine Academy (USMMA)—COMMERCE/MA-1;
(B) USMMA Midshipman Medical Files—COMMERCE/MA-17;
(C) USMMA Midshipman Personnel Files—COMMERCE/MA-18;
(D) USMMA Non-Appropriated Fund Employees—COMMERCE/MA-19;
(E) Applicants for the NOAA Corps—COMMERCE/NOAA-I;
(F) Commissioned Officer Official Personnel Folders—COMMERCE/NOAA-3;
(G) Conflict of lnterest Records, Appointed Officials—COMMERCE/DEPT-3;
(H) Investigative and Inspection Records—COMMERCE/DEPT-12, but only on condition that the general exemption claimed in § 4.33(b)(3) is held to be invalid;

(J) Litigation, Claims, and Administrative Proceeding Records—COMMERCE/DEPT-14;
(K) Access Control and Identity Management System—COMMERCE/DEPT-25, but only on condition that the general exemption claimed in § 4.33(b)(4) is held to be invalid; and
(L) Investigation and Threat Management Records—COMMERCE/DEPT-27, but only on condition that the general exemption claimed in § 4.33(b)(4) is held to be invalid.
(ii) The foregoing are exempted from 5 U.S.C. 552a (c)(3), (d), (e)(1), (e)(4) (G), (H), and (I), and (f). The reasons for asserting the exemption are to maintain the ability to obtain candid and necessary information, to fulfill commitments made to sources to protect the confidentiality of information, to avoid endangering these sources and, ultimately, to facilitate proper selection or continuance of the best applicants or persons for a given position or contract. Special note is made of the limitation on the extent to which this exemption may be asserted. The existence and general character of the information exempted will be made known to the individual to whom it pertains.
(c) At the present time, the Department claims no exemption under 5 U.S.C. 552a(k) (3), (6) and (7).

§ 4a.1
General.
Executive Order 13526 provides the only basis for classifying information within the Department of Commerce (Department), except as provided in the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended. The Department's policy is to make information concerning its activities available to the public, consistent with the need to protect the national defense and foreign relations of the United States. Accordingly, security classification shall be applied only to protect the national security.
[85 FR 35375, June 10, 2020]
§ 4a.2
Director for Security.
The Director for Security is responsible for implementing and ensuring compliance with E.O. 13526 and this part.
[85 FR 35375, June 10, 2020]
§ 4a.3
Classification levels.
Information may be classified as national security information by a designated original classifier of the Department if it is determined the information concerns one or more of the categories described in section 1.4 of E.O. 13526. The levels established in section 1.2 of E.O. 13526 (Top Secret, Secret, and Confidential) are the only terms that may be applied to national security information. Except as provided by statute, no other terms shall be used within the Department for the three classification levels.
[85 FR 35375, June 10, 2020]
§ 4a.4
Classification authority.
(a) Authority to originally classify information as Secret or Confidential may be exercised only by the Secretary of Commerce and by officials to whom such authority is specifically delegated. No official of the Department is authorized to originally classify information as Top Secret.
(b) In accordance with section 1.3(c)(1) of E.O. 13526, delegations of original classification authority shall be limited to the minimum required to administer E.O. 13526. The Secretary of Commerce shall ensure that designated subordinate officials have a demonstrable and continuing need to exercise delegated original classification authority.
(c) In accordance with section 1.3(c)(4) of E.O. 13526, each delegation of original classification authority shall be in writing and the authority shall not be redelegated except as provided in E.O. 13526.
(d) In accordance with section 1.3(c)(4) of E.O. 13526, each delegation shall identify the official by name or position.
(e) In accordance with section 1.3(c)(5) of E.O. 13526, delegations of original classification authority shall be reported or made available by name or position to the Director of the Information Security Oversight Office in the National Archives and Records Administration.
(f) In accordance with section 1.3(d) of E.O. 13526, all original classification authorities and their designates shall receive training in proper classification (including the avoidance of over-classification) and declassification as
provided in E.O. 13526 and its implementing directives at least once a calendar year.
[85 FR 35375, June 10, 2020]
§ 4a.5
Duration of classification.
(a) Information shall remain classified no longer than ten years from the date of its original classification, unless, in accordance with section 1.5(b) of E.O. 13526, the original classification authority otherwise determines that the sensitivity of the information requires that it be marked for declassification for up to 25 years from the date of the original decision.
(b) For Department of Commerce originally classified information marked for an indefinite duration which contains incomplete declassification instructions, or lacks them entirely:
(1) The information shall be declassified in accordance with E.O. 13526 as soon as it no longer meets the standards for classification under E.O. 13526, or
(2) if the standards for classification under E.O. 13526 are met, the information shall be declassified after 10 years from the date of the original classification, unless the original classification authority determines that the sensitivity of the information requires that it remain classified for up to 25 years from the date of the original classification, as provided in section 1.5.(b) of E.O. 13526.
[85 FR 35375, June 10, 2020]
§ 4a.6
General.
National security information over which the Department exercises final classification jurisdiction shall be declassified or downgraded as soon as national security considerations permit. If information is declassified, it may continue to be exempt from public disclosure by the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) or other applicable law.
§ 4a.7
Mandatory review for declassification.
(a)
Requests.
Classified information under the jurisdiction of the Department is subject to review for declassification in accordance with 32 CFR 2001.33, upon receipt of a written request that describes the information with sufficient specificity to locate it with a reasonable amount of effort. Requests must be submitted to the Director for Security, U.S. Department of Commerce, 1401 Constitution Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20230.
(b)
Exemptions.
The following are exempt from mandatory review for declassification:
(1) Information that has been reviewed for declassification within the past two years;
(2) Information that is the subject of pending litigation;
(3) Information originated by the incumbent President, the incumbent President's White House Staff, committees, commissions, or boards appointed by the incumbent President, or other entities within the Executive Office of the President that solely advise and assist the incumbent President; and
(4) Information specifically exempt from such review by law.
(c)
Processing requirements.
(1) For requests for review of classified information not received from the National Archives and Records Administration, the Director for Security, or their designate, shall acknowledge receipt of the request directly to the requester. If a request does not adequately describe the information sought in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, the requester shall be notified that unless additional information is provided, no further action will be taken. The request shall be forwarded to the component that originated the information or that has primary interest in the subject matter. The component assigned action shall review the information in accordance with § 4a.7(c)(2) through (4) within twenty working days.
(2) The component assigned action shall determine whether, under the declassification provisions of the U.S. Department of Commerce's Manual of Security, the entire document or portions thereof may be declassified. Declassification of the information shall be
accomplished by a designated declassification authority. Upon declassification, the information shall be remarked. If the information is not partially or entirely declassified, the reviewing official shall provide the reasons for denial by citing the applicable provisions of E.O. 13526. If the classification is a derivative decision based on classified source material of another Federal agency, the component shall provide the information to the originator for review.
(3) If information is declassified, the component shall also determine whether it is releasable under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) as amended (5 U.S.C. 552). If the information is not releasable, the component shall advise the Director for Security that the information has been declassified but that it is exempt from disclosure, citing the appropriate exemption of the FOIA as amended.
(4) If the request for declassification is denied in whole or in part, the requester shall be notified of the right to appeal the determination within sixty calendar days and of the procedures for such an appeal. If declassified information remains exempt from disclosure under the FOIA as amended, the requester shall be advised of the appellate procedures under that law.
(d)
Fees.
If the request requires services for which fees are chargeable, the component assigned action shall calculate the anticipated fees to be charged, and may be required to ascertain the requester's willingness to pay the allowable charges as a precondition to taking further action on the request, in accordance with Department of Commerce rules promulgated under 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4)(A) of the Freedom of Information Act as amended and Department of Commerce rules promulgated under 5 U.S.C. 552a(f)(5) of the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a).
(e)
Right of appeal.
(1) A requester may appeal to the Director for Security when information requested under this section is not completely declassified and released after expiration of the applicable time limits. Within thirty working days (
i.e.,
excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) of receipt of a written appeal:
(i) The Director for Security shall determine whether continued classification of the requested information is required in whole or in part;
(ii) If information is declassified, determine whether it is releasable under the Freedom of Information Act as amended; and
(iii) Notify the requester of his or her determination, making available any information determined to be releasable. If continued classification is required under the provisions of the Department of Commerce Manual for Security, the Director for Security shall notify the requester of his or her determination, including the reasons for denial based on applicable provisions of E.O. 13526, and of the right of final appeal to the Interagency Security Classification Appeals Panel.
(2) During the declassification review of information under appeal the Director for Security may overrule previous determinations in whole or in part if continued protection in the interest of national security is no longer required. If the Director for Security determines that the information no longer requires classification, it shall be declassified and, unless it is otherwise exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act as amended, released to the requester. The Director for Security shall advise the original reviewing component of his or her decision.
[66 FR 65650, Dec. 20, 2001, as amended at 85 FR 35376, June 10, 2020]
§ 4a.8
Access to classified information by individuals outside the Government.
(a)
Industrial, Educational, and Commercial Entities.
Certain bidders, contractors, grantees, educational, scientific, or industrial organizations may receive classified information under the procedures prescribed by the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual.
(b)
Access by historical researchers and former Presidential appointees.
An individual engaged in historical research projects or who has previously occupied a policy-making position to which he or she was appointed by the President may be authorized access to classified information for a limited period,
provided that the head of the component with jurisdiction over the information:
(1) Determines in writing that:
(i) Access is consistent with national security;
(ii) The individual has a compelling need for access; and
(iii) The Department's best interest is served by providing access;
(2) Obtains in writing from the individual:
(i) Consent to a review by the Department of any resultant notes and manuscripts for the purpose of determining that no classified information is contained in them; and
(ii) Agreement to safeguard classified information in accordance with applicable requirements; and
(iii) A detailed description of the individual's research;
(3) Ensures that custody of classified information is maintained at a Department facility;
(4) Limits access granted to former Presidential appointees to items that the individual originated, reviewed, signed, or received while serving as a Presidential appointee; and
(5) Receives from the Director for Security:
(i) A determination that the individual is trustworthy; and
(ii) Approval to grant access to the individual.
(c) An individual seeking access should describe the information with sufficient specificity to locate and compile it with a reasonable amount of effort. If the access requested by a historical researcher or former Presidential appointee requires services for which fees are chargeable, the responsible component shall notify the individual in advance.
(d) This section applies only to classified information originated by the Department, or to information in the sole custody of the Department. Otherwise, the individual shall be referred to the classifying agency.

Purpose.
This part prescribes regulations to assure the granting of preference to blind persons licensed under the provisions of the Randolph-Sheppard Vending Stand Act (49 Stat. 1559, as amended by the act of August 3, 1954, 68 Stat. 663; 20 U.S.C. 107) for the operation of vending stands (which term as used in this order includes vending machines).
§ 5.2
Policy.

Due regard shall be given to laws and regulations for the public welfare which are applicable, or would be applicable, if the property involved was not owned or controlled by the Federal Government.
(c) The permit shall specify the types of articles specified in section 2(a)(4) of the Act as amended (newspapers, periodicals, confections, tobacco products, articles dispensed automatically or in containers or wrappings in which they are placed before delivery to the vending stand). Such other related articles as the State licensing agency asks to be included shall be permitted to be sold, unless such factors as inadequacy of available facilities, safety, health, public welfare, or legal requirements demand otherwise.
(d) The permit shall contain a provision that alterations made by other than the United States shall be approved by and conducted under the supervision of an appropriate official of the Department or the primary organization unit concerned.
(e) The permit may contain other reasonable conditions necessary for the protection of the Government and prospective patrons of the stand.
(f) The permit shall describe the location of the stand proper and the location of any vending machines which are operated in conjunction with it.

§ 5.6
Appeals.
(a) In any instance where the Department of Commerce official as provided
in § 5.3(c) and the State licensing agency fail to reach agreement concerning the granting, revocation, or modification of a permit, the location, method of operation, assignment of proceeds, or other terms of a permit (including articles which may be sold), the State licensing agency shall be notified in writing by the Commerce official concerned that it has the right to appeal such disagreements, within 30 days of the notice, to the Assistant Secretary for Administration for investigation and final decision.
(b) Upon receipt of a timely appeal the Assistant Secretary for Administration will cause a full investigation to be made.

This part is consistent with achievement of the objectives of the statutes authorizing the financial assistance given by the Department of Commerce as provided in section 602 of the Act.

Application of this part.
(a) This part applies to any program for which Federal financial assistance is authorized under a law administered by the Department, including the types of Federal financial assistance listed in appendix A to this part and as said appendix may be amended.

[38 FR 17938, July 5, 1973; 38 FR 23777, Sept. 4, 1973]
§ 8.5
Nondiscrimination clause.
(a)
Applicability.
Every application for, and every grant, loan, or contract authorizing approval of, Federal financial assistance and to provide a facility subject to this part, and every modification or amendment thereof, shall, as a condition to its approval and to the extension of any Federal financial assistance pursuant thereto, contain or be accompanied by an assurance that the program will be conducted in compliance with all requirements imposed by or pursuant to this part. The assurances shall be set forth in a nondiscrimination clause. The responsible Department official shall specify the form and contents of the nondiscrimination clause for each program as appropriate.
(b)
Contents.
Without limiting its scope or language in any way, a nondiscrimination clause shall contain, where determined to be appropriate, and in an appropriate form, reference to the following assurances, undertakings, and other provisions:
(1) That the recipient or other party subject to this part will not participate directly or indirectly in the discrimination prohibited by § 8.4, including employment practices when a program covering such is involved.
(2) That when employment practices are covered, the recipient or other party subject to this part will (i) in all solicitations or advertisements for employees placed by or for the recipient, state that qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, or national origin; (ii) notify each labor union or representative of workers with which it has a collective bargaining agreement or other contract or understanding of the recipient's commitments under this section; (iii) post the nondiscrimination clause and the notice to labor unions in conspicuous places available to employees and applicants for employment; and (iv) otherwise comply with the requirements of § 8.4(c).
(3) When continuing Federal financial assistance is involved, the recipient thereunder (i) will state that the program is (or, in the case of a new program, will be) conducted in compliance with all requirements imposed by or pursuant to this part, and (ii) will provide for such methods of administration for the program as are found by the responsible Department official to give reasonable assurance that all recipients of Federal financial assistance under such program and any other parties connected therewith subject to this part will comply with all requirements imposed by or pursuant to this part.
(4) That the recipient agrees to secure the compliance or to cooperate actively with the Department to secure the compliance by others with this part and the nondiscrimination clause as may be directed under an applicable program. For instance, the recipient may be requested by the responsible Department official to undertake and agree (i) to obtain or enforce or to assist and cooperate actively with the responsible Department official in obtaining or enforcing, the compliance of other recipients or of other parties subject to this part with the nondiscrimination required by this part; (ii) to insert appropriate nondiscrimination clauses in the respective contracts with or grants to such parties; (iii) to obtain and to furnish to the responsible Department official such information as he may require for the supervision or securing of such compliance; (iv) to carry out sanctions for noncompliance with the obligations imposed upon recipients and other parties subject to this part; and (v) to comply with such additional provisions as the responsible Department official
deems appropriate to establish and protect the interests of the United States in the enforcement of these obligations. In the event that the cooperating recipient becomes involved in litigation with a noncomplying party as a result of such departmental direction, the cooperating recipient may request the Department to enter into such litigation to protect the interests of the United States.
(5) In the case of real property, structures or improvements thereon, or interests therein, which are acquired for a program receiving Federal financial assistance, or in the case where Federal financial assistance is provided in the form of a transfer of real property or interest therein from the Federal Government, the instrument effecting or recording the transfer shall contain a covenant running with the land assuring nondiscrimination for the period during which the real property is used for a purpose for which the Federal financial assistance is extended or for another purpose involving the provision of similar services or benefits, or for as long as the recipient retains ownership or possession of the property, whichever, is longer. Where no transfer of property is involved, but property is improved with Federal financial assistance, the recipient shall agree to include such a covenant in any subsequent transfer of such property. Where the property is obtained from the Federal Government, such covenant may also include a condition coupled with a right to be reserved by the Department to revert title to the property in the event of a breach of the covenant where, in the discretion of the responsible Department official, such a condition and right of reverter is appropriate to the statute under which the real property is obtained and to the nature of the grant and the grantee. In such event if a transferee of real property proposes to mortgage or otherwise encumber the real property as security for financing construction of new, or improvement of existing facilities on such property for the purposes for which the property was transferred, the responsible Department official may agree, upon request of the transferee and if necessary to accomplish such financing, and upon such conditions as he deems appropriate to forebear the exercise of such right to revert title for so long as the lien of such mortgage or other encumbrance remains effective.
(6) In programs receiving Federal financial assistance in the form, or for the acquisition, of real property or an interest in real property to the extent that rights to space on, over, or under any such property are included as part of the program receiving such assistance the nondiscrimination requirements of this part shall extend to any facility located wholly or in part in such space.
(7) That a recipient shall not take action that is calculated to bring about indirectly what this part forbids it to accomplish directly.
(8) Provisions specifying the extent to which like assurances will be required of subgrantees, contractors and subcontractors, lessees, transferees, successors in interest, and other participants in the program.
(9) Provisions which give the United States a right to seek judicial enforcement of the assurances.
(10) In the case where any assurances are required from an academic, a medical care, detention or correctional, or any other institution or facility, insofar as the assurances relate to the institution's practices with respect to the admission, care, or other treatment of persons by the institution or with respect to the opportunity of persons to participate in the receiving or providing of services, treatment, or benefits, such assurances shall be applicable to the entire institution or facility.
(11) In the case where the Federal financial assistance is in the form of or to aid in the acquisition of personal property, or real property or interest therein or structures thereon, the assurance shall obligate the recipients, or, in the case of a subsequent transfer, the transferee, for the period during which the property is used for a purpose for which the Federal financial assistance is extended or for another purpose involving the provision of similar services and benefits, or for as long as the recipient or transferee retains ownership or possession of the property, whichever is longer. In the case of any other type or form of assistance, the
assurances shall be in effect for the duration of the period during which Federal financial assistance is extended to the program.

A recipient or other party may waive a hearing and submit written information and argument for the record. The failure of a recipient or other party to request a hearing under this paragraph of this section or to appear at a hearing for which a date has been set shall be deemed to be a waiver of the right to a hearing under section 602 of the Act and § 8.11(c) and consent to the making of a decision on the basis of such information as is available.
(b)
Time and place of hearing.
Hearings shall be held at the offices of the Department in Washington, D.C., at a time fixed by the responsible Department official or hearing officer unless he determines that the convenience of the recipient or other party or of the Department requires that another place be selected. Hearings shall be held before the responsible Department official, or at his discretion, before a hearing officer.
(c)
Right to counsel.
In all proceedings under this section, the recipient or other party and the Department shall have the right to be represented by counsel.

Both the Department and the recipient or other party shall be entitled to introduce all relevant evidence on the issues as stated in the notice for hearing or as determined by the officer conducting the hearing at the outset of or during the hearing.
(2) Technical rules of evidence shall not apply to hearings conducted pursuant to this part, but rules or principles designed to assure production of the most credible evidence available and to subject testimony to test by cross-examination shall be applied where reasonably necessary by the officer conducting the hearing. The hearing officer may exclude irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious evidence. All documents and other evidence offered or taken for the record shall be open to examination by the parties and opportunity shall be given to refute facts and arguments advanced on either side of the issues. A transcript shall be made of the oral evidence except to the extent the substance thereof is stipulated for the record. All decisions shall be based upon the hearing record and written findings shall be made.
(e)
Consolidated or joint hearings.
In cases in which the same or related facts are asserted to constitute noncompliance with this part with respect to two or more Federal statutes, authorities, or other means by which Federal financial assistance is extended and to which this part applies, or noncompliance with this part and the regulations of one or more other Federal departments or agencies issued under Title VI of the Act, the Secretary may, by agreement with such other departments or agencies where applicable, provide for the conduct of consolidated or joint hearings and for the application to such hearings of rules of procedures not inconsistent with this part. Final decisions in such cases, insofar as this part is concerned, shall be made in accordance with § 8.13.
§ 8.13
Decisions and notices.
(a)
Decision by person other than the responsible Department official.
If the hearing is held by a hearing officer such hearing officer shall either make an initial decision, if so authorized, or certify the entire record including his recommended findings and proposed decision to the responsible Department official for a final decision, and a copy of such initial decision or certification shall be mailed to the recipient or other party subject to this part. Where the initial decision is made by the hearing officer, the recipient or other party may within 30 days of the mailing of such notice of initial decision file with the responsible Department
official his exceptions to the initial decision, with his reasons therefor. In the absence of exceptions, the responsible Department official may on his own motion within 45 days after the initial decision serve on the recipient or other party a notice that he will review the decision. Upon the filing of such exceptions or of such notice of review, the responsible Department official shall review the initial decision and issue his own decision thereon including the reasons therefor. In the absence of either exceptions or a notice of review the initial decision shall constitute the final decision of the responsible Department official.
(b)
Decisions on record or review by the responsible Department official.
Whenever a record is certified to the responsible Department official for decision or he reviews the decision of a hearing officer pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, or whenever the responsible Department official conducts the hearing, the recipient or other party shall be given reasonable opportunity to file with him briefs or other written statements of its contentions, and a copy of the final decision of the responsible Department official shall be given in writing to the recipient or other party and to the complainant, if any.
(c)
Decisions on record where a hearing is waived.

(e)
Approval by Secretary.
Any final decision of a responsible Department official (other than the Secretary) which provides for the suspension or termination of, or the refusal to grant or continue, Federal financial assistance, or the imposition of any other sanction available under this part of the Act, shall promptly be transmitted to the Secretary, who may approve such decision, may vacate it, or remit or mitigate any sanction imposed.
(f)
Content of orders.
The final decision may provide for suspension or termination of, or refusal to grant or continue, Federal financial assistance, in whole or in part, to which this regulation applies, and may contain such terms, conditions, and other provisions as are consistent with and will effectuate the purposes of the Act and this part, including provisions designed to assure that no Federal financial assistance to which this regulation applies will thereafter be extended to the recipient or other party determined by such decision to be in default in its performance of an assurance given by it pursuant to this part, or to have otherwise failed to comply with this part, unless and until it corrects its noncompliance and satisfies the responsible Department official that it will fully comply with this part.
(g)
Posttermination proceedings.
(1) Any recipient or other party which is adversely affected by an order issued under paragraph (f) of this section shall be restored to full eligibility to receive Federal financial assistance if it satisfies the terms and conditions of that order for such eligibility or if it brings itself into compliance with this part and provides reasonable assurance that it will fully comply with this part.
(2) Any recipient or other party adversely affected by an order entered pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section may at any time request the responsible Department official to restore fully its eligibility to receive Federal financial assistance. Any such request shall be supported by information showing that the recipient or other party has met the requirements of paragraph (g)(1) of this section. If the responsible Department official determines that those requirements have been satisfied, he shall restore such eligibility.
(3) If the responsible Department official denies any such request, the recipient or other party may submit a request for a hearing in writing, specifying why it believes such official to have been in error. It shall thereupon be given an expeditious hearing, with a decision on the record in accordance
with rules of procedure issued by the responsible Department official. The recipient or other party will be restored to such eligibility if it proves at such a hearing that it satisfied the requirements of paragraph (g)(1) of this section. While proceedings under this paragraph are pending, the sanctions imposed by the order issued under paragraph (f) of this section shall remain in effect.
§ 8.14
Judicial review.
Action taken pursuant to section 602 of the Act is subject to judicial review as provided in section 603 of the Act.
§ 8.15
Effect on other laws; supplementary instructions; coordination.
(a)
Effect on other laws.
All regulations, orders, or like directions heretofore issued by any officer of the Department which impose requirements designed to prohibit any discrimination against individuals on the ground of race, color, or national origin under any program to which this part applies, and which authorizes the suspension or termination of or refusal to grant or to continue Federal financial assistance to any recipient or other party subject to this part of such assistance for failure to comply with such requirements, are hereby superseded to the extent that such discrimination is prohibited by this part, except that nothing in this part shall be deemed to relieve any one of any obligations assumed or imposed under any such superseded regulation, order, instruction, or like direction prior to January 9, 1965. Nothing in this part, however, shall be deemed to supersede any of the following (including future amendments thereof):
(1) Executive Order 11246 and regulations issued thereunder, or
(2) Executive Order 11063 and regulations issued thereunder, or any other regulations or instructions, insofar as such order, regulations, or instructions prohibit discrimination on the ground of race, color, or national origin in any program or situation to which this part is inapplicable, or prohibit discrimination on any other ground.

Forms and instructions.
Each responsible Department official shall issue and promptly make available to interested parties forms and detailed instructions and procedures for effectuating this part as applied to programs to which this part applies and for which he is responsible.

Any action taken, determination made, or requirement imposed by an official of another Department or agency acting pursuant to an assignment of responsibility under this paragraph shall have the same effect as though such action had been taken by the responsible official of this Department.

An assurance of compliance with these Title IX regulations shall not be satisfactory to the designated agency official if the applicant or recipient to whom such assurance applies fails to commit itself to take whatever remedial action is necessary in accordance with § 8a.110(a) to eliminate existing discrimination on the basis of sex or to eliminate the effects of past discrimination whether occurring prior to or subsequent to the submission to the designated agency official of such assurance.
(b)
Duration of obligation.
(1) In the case of Federal financial assistance extended to provide real property or structures thereon, such assurance shall obligate the recipient or, in the case of a subsequent transfer, the transferee, for the period during which the real property or structures are used to provide an education program or activity.
(2) In the case of Federal financial assistance extended to provide personal property, such assurance shall obligate the recipient for the period during which it retains ownership or possession of the property.
(3) In all other cases such assurance shall obligate the recipient for the period during which Federal financial assistance is extended.
(c)
Form.
(1) The assurances required by paragraph (a) of this section, which may be included as part of a document
that addresses other assurances or obligations, shall include that the applicant or recipient will comply with all applicable Federal statutes relating to nondiscrimination. These include but are not limited to: Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, as amended (20 U.S.C. 1681-1683, 1685-1688).
(2) The designated agency official will specify the extent to which such assurances will be required of the applicant's or recipient's subgrantees, contractors, subcontractors, transferees, or successors in interest.
§ 8a.120
Transfers of property.
If a recipient sells or otherwise transfers property financed in whole or in part with Federal financial assistance to a transferee that operates any education program or activity, and the Federal share of the fair market value of the property is not upon such sale or transfer properly accounted for to the Federal Government, both the transferor and the transferee shall be deemed to be recipients, subject to the provisions of §§ 8a.205 through 8a.235(a).
§ 8a.125
Effect of other requirements.
(a)
Effect of other Federal provisions.
The obligations imposed by these Title IX regulations are independent of, and do not alter, obligations not to discriminate on the basis of sex imposed by Executive Order 11246, 3 CFR, 1964-1965 Comp., p. 339; as amended by Executive Order 11375, 3 CFR, 1966-1970 Comp., p. 684; as amended by Executive Order 11478, 3 CFR, 1966-1970 Comp., p. 803; as amended by Executive Order 12087, 3 CFR, 1978 Comp., p. 230; as amended by Executive Order 12107, 3 CFR, 1978 Comp., p. 264; sections 704 and 855 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 295m, 298b-2); Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000e
et seq.
); the Equal Pay Act of 1963 (29 U.S.C. 206); and any other Act of Congress or Federal regulation.
(b)
Effect of State or local law or other requirements.
The obligation to comply with these Title IX regulations is not obviated or alleviated by any State or local law or other requirement that would render any applicant or student ineligible, or limit the eligibility of any applicant or student, on the basis of sex, to practice any occupation or profession.
(c)
Effect of rules or regulations of private organizations.
The obligation to comply with these Title IX regulations is not obviated or alleviated by any rule or regulation of any organization, club, athletic or other league, or association that would render any applicant or student ineligible to participate or limit the eligibility or participation of any applicant or student, on the basis of sex, in any education program or activity operated by a recipient and that receives Federal financial assistance.
§ 8a.130
Effect of employment opportunities.
The obligation to comply with these Title IX regulations is not obviated or alleviated because employment opportunities in any occupation or profession are or may be more limited for members of one sex than for members of the other sex.

for admission and employment, students and parents of elementary and secondary school students, employees, sources of referral of applicants for admission and employment, and all unions or professional organizations holding collective bargaining or professional agreements with the recipient, that it does not discriminate on the basis of sex in the educational programs or activities that it operates, and that it is required by Title IX and these Title IX regulations not to discriminate in such a manner. Such notification shall contain such information, and be made in such manner, as the designated agency official finds necessary to apprise such persons of the protections against discrimination assured them by Title IX and these Title IX regulations, but shall state at least that the requirement not to discriminate in education programs or activities extends to employment therein, and to admission thereto unless §§ 8a.300 through 8a.310 do not apply to the recipient, and that inquiries concerning the application of Title IX and these Title IX regulations to such recipient may be referred to the employee designated pursuant to § 8a.135, or to the designated agency official.

(a)
Assistance by recipient in making available outside employment.
A recipient that assists any agency, organization, or person in making employment available to any of its students:
(1) Shall assure itself that such employment is made available without discrimination on the basis of sex; and
(2) Shall not render such services to any agency, organization, or person that discriminates on the basis of sex in its employment practices.
(b)
Employment of students by recipients.
A recipient that employs any of its students shall not do so in a manner that violates §§ 8a.500 through 8a.550.
§ 8a.440
Health and insurance benefits and services.
Subject to § 8a.235(d), in providing a medical, hospital, accident, or life insurance benefit, service, policy, or plan to any of its students, a recipient shall not discriminate on the basis of sex, or provide such benefit, service, policy, or plan in a manner that would violate §§ 8a.500 through 8a.550 if it were provided to employees of the recipient. This section shall not prohibit a recipient from providing any benefit or service that may be used by a different proportion of students of one sex than of the other, including family planning services. However, any recipient that provides full coverage health service shall provide gynecological care.
§ 8a.445
Marital or parental status.
(a)
Status generally.
A recipient shall not apply any rule concerning a student's actual or potential parental, family, or marital status that treats students differently on the basis of sex.
(b)
Pregnancy and related conditions.
(1) A recipient shall not discriminate against any student, or exclude any student from its education program or
activity, including any class or extracurricular activity, on the basis of such student's pregnancy, childbirth, false pregnancy, termination of pregnancy, or recovery therefrom, unless the student requests voluntarily to participate in a separate portion of the program or activity of the recipient.
(2) A recipient may require such a student to obtain the certification of a physician that the student is physically and emotionally able to continue participation as long as such a certification is required of all students for other physical or emotional conditions requiring the attention of a physician.
(3) A recipient that operates a portion of its education program or activity separately for pregnant students, admittance to which is completely voluntary on the part of the student as provided in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, shall ensure that the separate portion is comparable to that offered to non-pregnant students.
(4) Subject to § 8a.235(d), a recipient shall treat pregnancy, childbirth, false pregnancy, termination of pregnancy and recovery therefrom in the same manner and under the same policies as any other temporary disability with respect to any medical or hospital benefit, service, plan, or policy that such recipient administers, operates, offers, or participates in with respect to students admitted to the recipient's educational program or activity.
(5) In the case of a recipient that does not maintain a leave policy for its students, or in the case of a student who does not otherwise qualify for leave under such a policy, a recipient shall treat pregnancy, childbirth, false pregnancy, termination of pregnancy, and recovery therefrom as a justification for a leave of absence for as long a period of time as is deemed medically necessary by the student's physician, at the conclusion of which the student shall be reinstated to the status that she held when the leave began.
§ 8a.450
Athletics.
(a)
General.
No person shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, be treated differently from another person, or otherwise be discriminated against in any interscholastic, intercollegiate, club, or intramural athletics offered by a recipient, and no recipient shall provide any such athletics separately on such basis.
(b)
Separate teams.
Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, a recipient may operate or sponsor separate teams for members of each sex where selection for such teams is based upon competitive skill or the activity involved is a contact sport. However, where a recipient operates or sponsors a team in a particular sport for members of one sex but operates or sponsors no such team for members of the other sex, and athletic opportunities for members of that sex have previously been limited, members of the excluded sex must be allowed to try out for the team offered unless the sport involved is a contact sport. For the purposes of these Title IX regulations, contact sports include boxing, wrestling, rugby, ice hockey, football, basketball, and other sports the purpose or major activity of which involves bodily contact.
(c)
Equal opportunity.
(1) A recipient that operates or sponsors interscholastic, intercollegiate, club, or intramural athletics shall provide equal athletic opportunity for members of both sexes. In determining whether equal opportunities are available, the designated agency official will consider, among other factors:
(i) Whether the selection of sports and levels of competition effectively accommodate the interests and abilities of members of both sexes;
(ii) The provision of equipment and supplies;
(iii) Scheduling of games and practice time;
(iv) Travel and per diem allowance;
(v) Opportunity to receive coaching and academic tutoring;
(vi) Assignment and compensation of coaches and tutors;
(vii) Provision of locker rooms, practice, and competitive facilities;
(viii) Provision of medical and training facilities and services;
(ix) Provision of housing and dining facilities and services;
(x) Publicity.
(2) For purposes of paragraph (c)(1) of this section, unequal aggregate expenditures for members of each sex or unequal expenditures for male and female teams if a recipient operates or sponsors separate teams will not constitute noncompliance with this section, but the designated agency official may consider the failure to provide necessary funds for teams for one sex in assessing equality of opportunity for members of each sex.
(d)
Adjustment period.
A recipient that operates or sponsors interscholastic, intercollegiate, club, or intramural athletics at the elementary school level shall comply fully with this section as expeditiously as possible but in no event later than one year from September 29, 2000. A recipient that operates or sponsors interscholastic, intercollegiate, club, or intramural athletics at the secondary or postsecondary school level shall comply fully with this section as expeditiously as possible but in no event later than three years from September 29, 2000.

(d)
Pregnancy leave.
In the case of a recipient that does not maintain a leave policy for its employees, or in the case of an employee with insufficient leave or accrued employment time to qualify for leave under such a policy, a recipient shall treat pregnancy, childbirth, false pregnancy, termination of pregnancy, and recovery therefrom as a justification for a leave of absence without pay for a reasonable period of time, at the conclusion of which the employee shall be reinstated to the status that she held when the leave began or to a comparable position, without decrease in rate of compensation or loss of promotional opportunities, or any other right or privilege of employment.
§ 8a.535
Effect of state or local law or other requirements.
(a)
Prohibitory requirements.
The obligation to comply with §§ 8a.500 through 8a.550 is not obviated or alleviated by the existence of any State or local law or other requirement that imposes prohibitions or limits upon employment of members of one sex that are not imposed upon members of the other sex.
(b)
Benefits.
A recipient that provides any compensation, service, or benefit to members of one sex pursuant to a State or local law or other requirement shall provide the same compensation, service, or benefit to members of the other sex.

§ 8a.550
Sex as a bona fide occupational qualification.
A recipient may take action otherwise prohibited by §§ 8a.500 through 8a.550 provided it is shown that sex is a bona fide occupational qualification for that action, such that consideration of sex with regard to such action is essential to successful operation of the employment function concerned. A recipient shall not take action pursuant to this section that is based upon alleged comparative employment characteristics or stereotyped characterizations of one or the other sex, or upon preference based on sex of the recipient, employees, students, or other persons, but nothing contained in this section shall prevent a recipient from considering an employee's sex in relation to employment in a locker room or toilet facility used only by members of one sex.

§ 8b.4
Discrimination prohibited.
(a)
General.
No qualified handicapped individual shall, on the basis of handicap, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or otherwise be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity that receives Federal financial assistance.
(b)
Discriminatory actions prohibited.
(1) A recipient, in providing any aid, benefit, or service, may not, directly or through contractual, licensing, or other arrangements, on the basis of handicap:
(i) Deny a qualified handicapped individual the opportunity to participate in or benefit from the aid, benefit, or service;
(ii) Afford a qualified handicapped individual an opportunity to participate in or benefit from the aid, benefit, or service that is not equal to that afforded others;
(iii) Provide a qualified handicapped individual with any aid, benefit, or service that is not as effective as that provided to others;
(iv) Provide different or separate aid, benefits, or services to handicapped individuals or to any class of handicapped individuals, unless such action is necessary to provide qualified handicapped individuals with aid, benefits, or services that are as effective as those provided to others;
(v) Aid or perpetuate discrimination against a qualified handicapped individual by providing significant assistance to an agency, organization, or person that discriminates on the basis of handicap in providing any aid, benefit, or service to beneficiaries of the recipient's program or activity;
(vi) Deny a qualified handicapped individual the opportunity to participate as a member of planning or advisory boards; or
(vii) Otherwise limit a qualified handicapped individual in the enjoyment of any right, privilege, advantage, or opportunity enjoyed by others receiving any aid, benefits, or services.
(2) For purposes of this part, aid, benefits, and services must afford handicapped individuals an equal opportunity to obtain the same result, to gain the same benefit, or to reach the same level of achievement as afforded to others, in the most integrated setting appropriate to the individual's needs. However, aid, benefits and services, to be equally effective, need not produce the identical result or level of achievement for handicapped and nonhandicapped individuals.
(3) A recipient may not deny a qualified handicapped individual the opportunity to participate in its regular aid, benefits, or services, despite the existence of separate or different aid, benefits, or services which are established in accordance with this part.
(4) A recipient may not, directly or through contractual or other arrangements, use criteria or methods of administration:
(i) That have the effect of subjecting qualified handicapped individuals to discrimination on the basis of handicap;
(ii) That have the purpose or effect of defeating or substantially impairing accomplishment of the objectives of the recipient's program or activity with respect to handicapped individuals; or
(iii) That perpetuate the discrimination of another recipient if both recipients are subject to common administrative control or are agencies of the same state.
(5) In determining the geographic site or location of a facility, an applicant for assistance or a recipient may not make selections:
(i) That have the effect of excluding handicapped individuals from, denying them the benefit of, or otherwise subjecting them to discrimination under any program or activity that receives Federal financial assistance; or
(ii) That have the purpose or effect of defeating or substantially impairing the accomplishment of the objectives of the program or activity with respect to handicapped individuals.
(6) As used in this section, the aid, benefit, or service provided under a program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance includes any aid, benefit, or service provided in or through a facility that has been constructed, expanded, altered, leased, rented or otherwise acquired, in whole or in part, with Federal financial assistance.
(7)(i) In providing services, recipients to which this subpart applies, except small recipients, shall ensure that no handicapped participant is denied the benefits of, excluded from participation in, or otherwise subjected to discrimination under the program or activity operated by the recipient because of the absence of auxiliary aids for participants with impaired sensory, manual or speaking skills. A recipient shall operate each program or activity to which this subpart applies so that, when viewed in its entirety, auxiliary aids are readily available. The Secretary may require small recipients to provide auxiliary aids in order to ensure that no handicapped participant is denied the benefits of, excluded from participation in, or otherwise subjected to discrimination under the program or activity operated by small recipients, when this would not significantly impair the ability of the small recipient to provide benefits or services.
(ii) Auxiliary aids may include brailled and taped materials, interpreters, telecommunications devices, or other equally effective methods of making orally delivered information available to persons with hearing impairments, readers for persons with visual impairments, equipment adapted for use by persons with manual impairments, and other similar devices and actions. Recipients need not provide attendants, individually prescribed devices, readers for personal use or study, or other devices or services of a personal nature.
(c)
Aid, benefits, or services limited by Federal law.
The exclusion of non-handicapped persons from aid, benefits, or services limited by Federal statute
or Executive order to handicapped individuals, or the exclusion of a specific class of handicapped individuals from aid, benefits, or services limited by Federal statute or Executive order to a different class of handicapped individuals is not prohibited by this part.
(d)
Integrated setting.
Recipients shall administer programs or activities in the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of qualified handicapped individuals.
(e)
Communications with individuals with impaired vision and hearing.
Recipients shall ensure that communications with their applicants, employees and beneficiaries are available to persons with impaired vision or hearing. Appropriate modes of communication may include braille, enlarged type, sign language and telecommunications devices.
[47 FR 17746, Apr. 23, 1982, as amended at 68 FR 51353, Aug. 26, 2003]
§ 8b.5
Assurances required.
(a)
Assurances.
An applicant for Federal financial assistance to which this part applies shall submit an assurance, on a form specified by the Secretary, that the program or activity will be operated in compliance with this part. An applicant may incorporate these assurances by reference in subsequent applications to the Department.
(b)
Duration of obligation.
(1) In the case of Federal financial assistance extended in the form of real property or structures on the property, the assurance will obligate the recipient or, in the case of a subsequent transfer, the transferee, for the period during which the real property or structures are used for the purpose for which Federal financial assistance is extended, or for another purpose involving the provision of similar services or benefits.
(2) In case of Federal financial assistance extended to provide personal property, the assurance will obligate the recipient for the period during which it retains ownership or possession of the property.
(3) In all other cases, the assurance will obligate the recipient for the period during which Federal financial assistance is extended or the federally-funded program or activity is operated, whichever is longer.
(c)
Covenants.
(1) Where Federal financial assistance is provided in the form of real property or interest in the property from the Department, the instrument effecting or recording this transfer shall contain a covenant running with the land to assure nondiscrimination for the period during which the real property is used for a purpose for which the Federal financial assistance is extended or for another purpose involving the provision of similar services or benefits.
(2) Where no transfer or property is involved but property is purchased or improved with Federal financial assistance, the recipient shall agree to include the covenant described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section in the instrument effecting or recording any subsequent transferee of the property.
(3) Where Federal financial assistance is provided in the form of real property or interest in the property from the Department, the covenant shall also include a condition coupled with a right to be reserved by the Department to revert title to the property in the event of a breach of the covenant. If a transferee of real property proposed to mortgage or otherwise encumber the real property as security to finance construction of new, or improvement of existing, facilities on the property for the purposes for which the property was transferred, the Secretary may agree to forbear the exercise of such right to revert title for so long as the lien of such mortgage or other encumbrance remains effective. Such an agreement by the Secretary may be entered into only upon the request of the transferee (recipient) if it is necessary to accomplish such financing and upon such terms and conditions as the Secretary deems appropriate.
(d)
Interagency agreements.
Where funds are granted by the Department to another Federal agency to carry out the objectives of Federal financial assistance under a law administered by the Department, and where the grant obligates the recipient agency to comply with the rules and regulations of the Department applicable to that grant the provisions of this part shall apply to programs or activities operated with such funds.
§ 8b.6
Remedial action, voluntary action, and self-evaluation.
(a)
Remedial action.

(3) The Secretary may, where necessary to overcome the effects of discrimination in violation of section 504 or this part, require a recipient to take remedial action:
(i) With respect to handicapped individuals who would have been participants in the program or activity had the discrimination not occurred; and
(ii) With respect to handicapped persons who are no longer participants in the recipient's program or activity, but who were participants in the program or activity when the discrimination occurred; and
(iii) with respect to employees and applicants for employment.
(b)
Voluntary action.
A recipient may take steps, in addition to any action that is required by this part, to overcome the effects of conditions that resulted in limited participation in the recipient's program or activity by qualified handicapped individuals.
(c)
Self-evaluation.
(1) A recipient shall, within one year of the effective date of this part:
(i) Evaluate, with the assistance of interested persons, including handicapped individuals or organizations representing handicapped individuals, its current policies and practices and the effects thereof that do not or may not meet the requirements of this part;

(b) The obligation to comply with this part is not obviated or alleviated because employment opportunities in any occupation or profession are or may be more limited for handicapped individuals than for nonhandicapped persons.

# Subpart B—Employment Practices
§ 8b.11
Discrimination prohibited.
(a)
General.
(1) No qualified handicapped individual shall, on the basis of handicap, be subjected to discrimination in employment under any program or activity that receives Federal financial assistance.
(2) A recipient shall make all decisions concerning employment under any program or activity to which this part applies in a manner which ensures that discrimination on the basis of handicap does not occur and may not limit, segregate, or classify applicants or employees in any way that adversely affects their opportunities or status because of handicap.
(3) A recipient may not participate in a contractual or other relationship that has the effect of subjecting qualified handicapped applicants or employees to discrimination prohibited by this subpart. The relationships referred to in this subparagraph include relationships with employment and referral agencies, with labor unions, with organizations providing or administering fringe benefits to employees of the recipient, and with organizations providing training and apprenticeships.
(b)
Specific activities.
The prohibition against discrimination in employment applies to the following activities:
(1) Recruitment, advertising and the processing of applicants for employment;
(2) Hiring, upgrading, promotion, award of tenure, demotion, transfer, layoff, termination, right of return from layoff and rehiring;
(3) Rates of pay or any other form of compensation and changes in compensation; pension or other benefit the applicant or employee receives from any other source.
§ 8b.12
Reasonable accommodation.
(a) A recipient shall make reasonable accommodation to the known physical or metal limitations of an otherwise qualified handicapped applicant or employee unless the recipient can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of its program or activity.
(b) Reasonable accommodation may include:
(1) Making the facilities used by the employees in the area where the program or activity is conducted, including common areas used by all employees such as hallways, restrooms, cafeterias and lounges, readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons; and
(2) Job restructuring, part-time or modified work schedules, acquisition or modification of equipment or devices, the provision of readers or interpreters, and other similar actions.
(c) In determining pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section whether an accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of a recipient's program or activity, factors to be considered include:
(1) The overall size of the recipient's program or activity with respect to number of employees, number of participants, number and type of facilities, and size of budget;
(2) The type of the recipient's operation, including the composition and structure of the recipient's workforce; and
(3) The nature and cost of the accommodation needed.
(d) A recipient may not deny any employment opportunity to a qualified handicapped employee or applicant if the basis for the denial is the need to make reasonable accommodation to the physical or mental limitations of the employee or applicant.
(e) Nothing in this paragraph shall relieve a recipient of its obligation to make its program or activity accessible as required in subpart C of this part, or to provide auxiliary aids, as required by § 8b.4(b)(7).
§ 8b.13
Employment criteria.
(a) A recipient may not make use of any employment test or other selection criterion that screens out or tends to screen out handicapped individuals or any class of handicapped individuals unless;
(1) The test score or other selection criterion, as used by the recipient, is shown to be job-related for the position in question; and
(2) Alternative job-related tests or criteria that do not screen out or tend to screen out as many handicapped individuals are not shown by the Secretary to be available.
(b) A recipient shall select and administer tests concerning employment so as best to ensure that, when administered to an applicant or employee who has a handicap that impairs sensory, manual, or speaking skills, the test results accurately to reflect the applicant's or employee's job skills aptitude, or whatever factor the test purports to measure, rather than reflecting the applicant's or employee's impaired sensory, manual, or speaking skills (except where those skills are the factors that the test purports to measure).
§ 8b.14
Preemployment inquiries.
(a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, a recipient may not conduct preemployment inquiry of an applicant for employment as to whether the applicant is a handicapped individual, or as to the nature or severity of a handicap. A recipient may, however, make preemployment inquiry into an applicant's ability to perform job-related functions.
(b) When a recipient is taking remedial action to correct the effects of past discrimination pursuant to § 8b.6(a), when a recipient is taking voluntary action to overcome the effects of conditions that resulted in limited participation in this federally assisted program or activity pursuant to § 8b.6(b), or when a recipient is taking
affirmative action pursuant to section 503 of the Act, the recipient may invite applicants for employment to indicate whether and to what extent they are handicapped,
Provided,
That:
(1) The recipient states clearly on any written questionnaire used for this purpose or makes clear orally, if no written questionnaire is used, that the information requested is intended for use solely in connection with its remedial action obligations or its voluntary or affirmative action efforts; and
(2) The recipient states clearly that the information is being requested on a voluntary basis, that it will be kept confidential as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, that refusal to provide it will not subject the applicant or employee to any adverse treatment, and that it will be used only in accordance with this part.
(c) Nothing in this section shall prohibit a recipient from conditioning an offer of employment on the results of a medical examination conducted prior to the employee's entrance on duty,
Provided,
That:
(1) All employees are subject to such an examination regardless of handicap, and
(2) The results of such an examination are used only in accordance with the requirements of this part.
(d) Information obtained in accordance with this section as to the medical condition or history of the applicant shall be collected and maintained on separate forms that shall be accorded confidentiality as medical records, except:
(1) Employing officials may obtain the information after making a conditional decision to make a job offer to the applicant or the applicant was placed conditionally in a job pool or placed conditionally on an eligibility list;
(2) Supervisors and managers may be informed regarding restrictions on the work or duties of qualified handicapped individuals and regarding necessary accommodations;
(3) First aid and safety personnel may be informed, where appropriate, if the condition might require emergency treatment; and

et seq.
shall, on the basis of handicap, be subjected to discrimination in employment on ships under any program or activity to which this part applies.

# Subpart C—Accessibility
§ 8b.16
Discrimination prohibited.

§ 8b.17
Existing facilities.
(a)
Accessibility.
A recipient shall operate each program or activity to which this part applies so that when each part is viewed in its entirety it is readily accessible to qualified handicapped individuals. This paragraph does not require a recipient to make each of its existing facilities or every part of a facility accessible to and usable by qualified handicapped individuals. However, if a particular program is available in only one location, that site must be made accessible or the aid, benefit, or service must be made available at an alternative accessible site or sites. Accessibility requires nonpersonal aids to make the aid, benefit, or service accessible to mobility impaired persons.
(b)
Methods.
A recipient may comply with the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section through such means as redesign of equipment, reassignment of classes or other services to accessible buildings, assignment of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of services at alternate accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities and construction of new facilities in conformance with the requirement of § 8b.19, or
any other method that results in making its program or activity accessible to handicapped individuals. A recipient is not required to make structural changes in existing facilities where other methods are effective in achieving compliance with paragraph (a) of this section. In choosing among available methods for meeting the requirement of paragraph (a) of this section, a recipient shall give priority to those methods that serve handicapped individuals in the most integrated setting appropriate.
(c) If a small recipient finds, after consultation with a qualified handicapped individual seeking its services, that there is no method of complying with paragraph (a) of this section other than making a significant alteration in its existing facilities or facility, the small recipient may, as an alternative, refer the qualified handicapped individual to other providers of those services that are accessible at no additional cost to the handicapped.
(d)
Time period.
A recipient shall comply with the requirement of paragraph (a) of this section within 60 days of the effective date of this part. Where structural changes in facilities are necessary, such changes shall be made within three years of the effective date of this part, but in any event as expeditiously as possible.
(e)
Transition plan.
In the event that structural changes to facilities are necessary to meet the requirement of paragraph (a) of this section, a recipient shall develop, within six months of the effective date of this part, a transition plan setting forth the steps necessary to complete such changes. The plan shall be developed with the assistance of interested persons, including handicapped persons or organizations representing handicapped persons. A copy of the transition plan shall be made available for public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum:
(1) Identify physical obstacles in the recipient's facilities that limit the accessibility of its program or activity to qualified handicapped individuals;
(2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the facilities accessible;
(3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve full accessibility under § 8b.17(a) and, if the time period of the transition plan is longer than one year, identify the steps that will be taken during each year of the transition period; and
(4) Indicate the person responsible for implementation of the plan.
(f)
Notice.
The recipient shall adopt and implement procedures to ensure that interested persons, including persons with impaired vision or hearing, can obtain information as to the existence and location of services, activities and facilities that are accessible to and usable by qualified handicapped individuals.

§ 8b.18
New construction.
(a)
Design and construction.
Each facility or part of a facility constructed by, on behalf of, or for the use of a recipient shall be designed and constructed in such manner that the facility or part of the facility is readily accessible to and usable by qualified handicapped individuals, if the construction was commenced after the effective date of this part.
(b)
Alteration.
Each facility or part of a facility which is altered by, on behalf of, or for the use of a recipient after the effective date of this part of the facility shall, to the maximum extent feasible, be altered in such manner that the altered portion of the facility is readily accessible to and usable by qualified handicapped individuals.
(c)
Conformance with Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards.
(1) Effective as of August 17, 1990, design, construction, or alteration of buildings in conformance with sections 3-8 of the Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards (UFAS) (Appendix A to 41 CFR subpart 101-19.6) shall be deemed to comply with the requirements of this section with respect to those buildings. Departures from particular technical and scoping requirements of UFAS by the use of other methods are permitted where substantially equivalent or greater access to and usability of the building is provided.
(2) For purposes of this section, section 4.1.6(1)(g) of UFAS shall be interpreted to exempt from the requirements of UFAS only mechanical rooms and other spaces that, because of their intended use, will not require accessibility to the public or beneficiaries or result in the employment or residence therein of persons with physical handicaps.
(3) This section does not require recipients to make building alterations that have little likelihood of being accomplished without removing or altering a load-bearing structural member.

(1) May not apply limitations upon the number or proportion of handicapped individuals who may be admitted; and
(2) May not make use of any test or criterion for admission that has a disproportionate, adverse effect on handicapped individuals or any class of handicapped individuals unless:
(i) The test or criterion, as used by the recipient, has been validated as a predictor of success in the education program or activity in question; and
(ii) Alternate tests or criteria that have a less disproportionate, adverse effect are not shown by the Secretary to be available.
(3) Shall assure itself that (i) admissions tests are selected and administered so as best to ensure that, when a test is administered to an applicant who has a handicap that impairs sensory, manual, or speaking skills, the test results accurately reflect the applicant's aptitude or achievement level of whatever other factor the test purports to measure, rather than reflecting the applicant's impaired sensory, manual, or speaking skills (except where those skills are the factors that the test purports to measure); (ii) admissions tests that are designed for persons with impaired sensory, manual, or speaking skills are offered as often and in as timely a manner as are other admissions tests; and (iii) admissions tests are administered in facilities that, on the whole, are accessible to handicapped individuals; and
(4) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, may not make pre-admission inquiry as to whether an applicant for admission is a handicapped individual but, after admission, may make inquiries on a confidential basis as to handicaps that may require accommodation.
(c)
Pre-admission inquiry exception.
When a recipient is taking remedial action to correct the effects of past discrimination pursuant to § 8b.6(a) or when a recipient is taking voluntary action to overcome the effects of conditions that resulted in limited participation in its federally assisted program or activity pursuant to § 8b.6(b), the recipient may invite applicants for admission to indicate whether and to what extent they are handicapped,
Provided,
That:
(1) The recipient states clearly on any written questionnaire used for this purpose or makes clear orally, if no written questionnaire is used, that the information requested is intended for use solely in connection with its remedial action obligations or its voluntary action efforts; and
(2) The recipient states clearly that the information is being requested on a voluntary basis, that it will be kept confidential, that refusal to provide it will not subject the applicant to any adverse treatment, and that it will be used only in accordance with this part.
(d)
Validity studies.
For the purpose of paragraph (b)(2) of this section, a recipient may base prediction equations on first year grades, but shall conduct periodic validity studies against the criterion of overall success in the education program or activity in question in order to monitor the general validity of the test scores.
§ 8b.21
Treatment of students.
(a)
General.
No qualified handicapped student shall, on the basis of handicap, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or otherwise be subjected to discrimination under any academic research, occupational training, housing, health insurance, counseling, financial aid, physical education, athletics, recreation, transportation, other extracurricular, or other post secondary education aid, benefits, or services to which this subpart applies.
(b) A recipient to which this subpart applies that considers participation by students in education programs or activities not operated wholly by the recipient as part of, or equivalent to, education programs or activities operated by the recipient shall assure itself that the other education program or activity, as a whole, provides an equal opportunity for the participation of qualified handicapped persons.
(c) A recipient to which this subpart applies may not, on the basis of handicap exclude any qualified handicapped student from any course or study, or other part of its education program or activity.

(c)
Course examinations.
In its course examinations or other procedures for evaluating student's academic achievement, a recipient to which this subpart applies shall provide such methods for evaluating the achievement of students who have a handicap that impairs sensory, manual, or speaking skills as will best ensure that the results of the evaluation represents the student's achievement in the course, rather than reflecting the student's impaired sensory, manual, or speaking skills (except where such skills are the factors that the test purports to measure).
(d)
Auxiliary aids.
(1) A recipient to which this subpart applies shall ensure that no handicapped student is denied the benefits of, excluded from participation in, or otherwise subjected to discrimination because of the absence of educational auxiliary aids for students with impaired sensory, manual, or speaking skills.

§ 8c.50
Program accessibility: Existing facilities.
(a)
General.
The agency shall operate each program or activity so that the program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. This paragraph does not—
(1) Necessarily require the agency to make each of its existing facilities accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps; or
(2) Require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with section § 8c.50(a) would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the Secretary of Commerce or the Secretary's designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that individuals with handicaps receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.
(b)
Methods.
The agency may comply with the requirements of this section through such means as redesign of equipment, reassignment of services to accessible buildings, assignment of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of services at alternate accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities and construction of new facilities, use of accessible rolling stock, or any other methods that result in making its programs or activities readily accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. The agency is not required to make structural changes in existing facilities where other methods are effective in achieving compliance with this section. The agency, in making alterations to existing buildings, shall meet accessibility requirements to the extent compelled by the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), and any regulations implementing it. In choosing
among available methods for meeting the requirements of this section, the agency shall give priority to those methods that offer programs and activities to qualified individuals with handicaps in the most integrated setting appropriate.
(c)
Time period for compliance.
The agency shall comply with the obligations established under this section by September 26, 1988, except that where structural changes in facilities are undertaken, such changes shall be made by July 26, 1991, but in any event as expeditiously as possible.
(d)
Transition plan.
In the event that structural changes to facilities will be undertaken to achieve program accessibility, the agency shall develop, by January 26, 1989, a transition plan setting forth the steps necessary to complete such changes. The agency shall provide an opportunity to interested persons, including individuals with handicaps or organizations representing individuals with handicaps, to participate in the development of the transition plan by submitting comments (both oral and written). A copy of the transition plan shall be made available for public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum—
(1) Identify physical obstacles in the agency's facilities that limit the accessibility of its program or activities to individuals with handicaps;
(2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the facilities accessible;
(3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve compliance with this section and, if the time period of the transition plan is longer than one year, identify steps that will be taken during each year of the transition period; and
(4) Indicate the official responsible for implementation of the plan.

The definitions, requirements, and standards of the Architectural Barriers Act (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), as established in 41 CFR 101-19.600 to 101-19.607, apply to buildings covered by this section.
§§ 8c.52-8c.59
[Reserved]
§ 8c.60
Communications.
(a) The agency shall take appropriate steps to ensure effective communication with applicants, participants, personnel of other Federal entities, and members of the public.
(1) The agency shall furnish appropriate auxiliary aids where necessary to afford an individual with handicaps an equal opportunity to participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a program or activity conducted by the agency.
(i) In determining what type of auxiliary aid is necessary, the agency shall give primary consideration to the requests of the individual with handicaps.
(ii) The agency need not provide individually prescribed devices, readers for personal use or study, or other devices of a personal nature.
(2) Where the agency communicates with applications and beneficiaries by telephone, telecommunication devices for deaf persons (TDD's) or equally effective telecommunication systems shall be used.
(b) The agency shall ensure that interested persons, including persons with impaired vision or hearing, can obtain information as to the existence and location of accessible services, activities, and facilities.
(c) The agency shall provide signs at a primary entrance to each of its inaccessible facilities, directing users to a location at which they can obtain information about accessible facilities. The international symbol for accessibility shall be used at each primary entrance of an accessible facility.
(d) This section does not require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens,
the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 8c.60 would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration of burdens must be made by the Secretary of Commerce or the Secretary's designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action required to comply with this section would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum extent possible, individuals with handicaps receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.

§ 10.0
General.
(a)
Introduction.
The Department of Commerce (hereinafter referred to as the “Department”) recognizes the importance, the advantages, and the benefits of voluntary standards and standardization activities. Such standards may cover, but are not limited to, terms, classes, sizes (including quantities of packaged consumer commodities), dimensions, capacities, quality levels, performance criteria, inspection requirements, marking requirements, testing equipment, test procedures and installation procedures. Economic growth is promoted through:
(1) Reduction of manufacturing costs, inventory costs, and distribution costs;
(2) Better understanding among manufacturers, producers, or packagers (hereinafter referred to as producers), distributors, users, and consumers; and
(3) Simplification of the purchase, installation, and use of the product being standardized.
(b)
Requirements for Department of Commerce sponsorship.
The Department may sponsor the development of a voluntary Product Standard if, upon receipt of a request, the Department determines that:
(1) The proposed standard is likely to have substantial public impact;
(2) The proposed standard reflects the broad interest of an industry group or an organization concerned with the manufacture, production, packaging, distribution, testing, consumption, or use of the product, or the interest of a Federal or State agency;
(3) The proposed standard would not duplicate a standard published by, or actively being developed or revised by, a private standards-writing organization to such an extent that it would
contain similar requirements and test methods for identical types of products, unless such duplication was deemed by the Department to be in the public interest;
(4) Lack of government sponsorship would result in significant public disadvantage for legal reasons or reasons of domestic and international trade;
(5) The proposed standard is not appropriate for development and maintenance by a private standards-writing organization; and
(6) The proposed standard will be funded by a proponent organization or government agency to cover costs for administrative and technical support services provided by the Department.
(c)
Role of the Department.
The Department assists in the establishment of a Voluntary Product Standard as follows:
(1) Acts as an unbiased coordinator in the development of the standard;
(2) Provides editorial assistance in the preparation of the standard;
(3) Supplies such assistance and review as is required to assure the technical soundness of the standard;
(4) Seeks satisfactory adjustment of valid points of disagreement;
(5) Determines the compliance with the criteria established in these procedures for such voluntary standards;
(6) Provides secretarial functions for each committee appointed by the Department under these procedures;
(7) Publishes the standard as a public document;
(8) Administers the funds for administrative and technical support services; and
(9) Seeks listing for standards developed under these procedures as American National Standards through the American National Standards Institute, when deemed appropriate by the Department.
(d)
Role of producers, distributors, users, and consumers.
Producers, distributors, users, consumers, and other interested groups may contribute to the development of a Voluntary Product Standard as follows:
(1) Initiate and participate in the development of the standard;
(2) Provide technical or other relevant counsel, as appropriate, relating to the standard;
(3) Promote the use of, and support for, the standard; and
(4) Assist in keeping the standard current with respect to advancing technology and marketing practices.
(e)
Role of the National Institute of Standards
Technology.
The National Institute of Standards
Technology (NIST) administers these procedures for the Department. Any communications concerning these procedures (e.g., questions, clarifications, appeals) should be addressed to the Office of Product Standards Policy, National Institute of Standards
Technology, Gaithersburg, Maryland 20899.

§ 10.1
Initiating development of a new standard.
(a) Any group or association of producers, distributors, users, or consumers, or a testing laboratory, or a State or Federal agency, may request the Department to initiate the development and publication of a Voluntary Product Standard under these procedures. Requests shall be in writing, signed by a representative of the group or agency, and forwarded to the Department. The initial request may be accompanied by a copy of a draft of the suggested standard.
(b) The request shall include a commitment to provide sufficient funding to cover all costs associated with the development and maintenance of the proposed Voluntary Product Standard.
(c) The Department may require additional information such as technical, marketing, or other appropriate data essential to discussion and development of the proposed standard, including, but not limited to, physical, mechanical, chemical, or performance characteristics, and production figures.
(d) Upon receipt of an appropriate request and after a determination by the Department that the development of a Voluntary Product Standard is justified, the Department may initiate the development by requesting that a draft of the suggested standard be prepared by an appropriate committee, provided such a draft has not previously been submitted under paragraph (a) of this section.
(e) The Department may initiate the development of a Voluntary Product Standard, if such action is deemed by the Department to be in the public interest, notwithstanding the absence of a request from an outside source. A voluntary standard initiated by the Department shall be processed in accordance with all requirements of these procedures and shall be developed in the same manner as a voluntary standard initiated by any group referred to in paragraph (a) of this section.
(f) An agreement regarding funding procedures and receipt of a deposit estimated by the Department to be sufficient to cover the first year's costs shall occur prior to the initiation of any project.
§ 10.2
Funding.
Groups who represent producers, distributors, consumers or users, or others that wish to act or continue to act as proponent organizations for the development or maintenance of a Voluntary Product Standard will be required to pay for administrative and technical support services provided by the National Institute of Standards
Technology and such other direct or indirect costs associated with the development or maintenance of that standard as may be deemed appropriate by the Department, including costs to the Department in connection with the operation of the Standard Review Committee and the Standing Committee. Funds may also be provided by a government agency at the request of a proponent organization or when acting on its own behalf for the development or maintenance of a Voluntary Product Standard. Proponents of standards that meet sponsorship criteria established in these procedures shall furnish an initial deposit of funds sufficient to cover the first year's services and other costs. Estimated annual costs will be based on an hourly rate for salary and overhead established by the Department for the National Institute of Standards
Technology's administrative and technical support services plus estimates of direct costs to provide funds for such items as the travel of consumer representatives unable to otherwise attend committee meetings, travel for Department staff, and printing costs. Project funds will be reviewed annually. Excess funds may be refunded or applied to the next accounting period. Should funds from deposits be inadequate during an accounting period, work on the project will continue only if funds are restored to a level estimated adequate to complete the 12-month period.
[51 FR 22497, June 20, 1986, as amended at 55 FR 38315, Sept. 18, 1990]
§ 10.3
Development of a proposed standard.
(a) A proposed standard as submitted to the Department:
(1) Shall be based on adequate technical information, or, in the case of size standards (including standards covering the quantities for packaged consumer commodities), on adequate marketing information, or both, as determined to be appropriate by the Department;
(2) Shall not be contrary to the public interest;
(3) Shall be technically appropriate and such that conformance or nonconformance with the standard can be determined either during or after the manufacturing process by inspection or other procedures which may be utilized by either an individual or a testing facility competent in the particular field;
(4) Shall follow the format prescribed by the National Institute of Standards
Technology. (Copies of the recommended format may be obtained from the Office of Product Standards Policy, National Institute of Standards
Technology, Gaithersburg, Maryland 20899.);
(5) Shall include performance requirements if such are deemed by the Department to be technically sound, feasible, and practical, and the inclusion of such is deemed to be appropriate;
(6) May include dimensions, sizes, material specifications, product requirements, design stipulations, component requirements, test methods, testing equipment descriptions, and installation procedures. The appropriateness of the inclusion in a standard of any particular item listed in this subparagraph shall be determined by the Department; and
(7) Shall be accompanied by rational statements pertaining to the requirements and test methods contained in the standard, if deemed necessary by the Department.
(b) A proposed standard that is determined by the Department to meet the criteria set forth in paragraph (a) of this section may be subjected to further review by an appropriate individual, committee, organization, or agency (either government or nongovernment, but not associated with the proponent group).
(c) A proposed standard may be circulated by the Department to appropriate producers, distributors, users, consumers, and other interested groups for consideration and comment as well as to others requesting the opportunity to comment.
(d) The proponent group or appropriate committee which drafted the initial proposal under § 10.1(d) shall consider all comments and suggestions submitted by the reviewer designated under paragraph (b) of this section, and those received by the Department as a result of any circulation under paragraph (c) of this section, and may make such adjustments in the proposal as are technically sound and as are believed to cause the standard to be generally acceptable to producers, distributors, users, consumers, and other interested parties. The proposal will then be submitted to the Department for further processing.
[51 FR 22497, June 20, 1986, as amended at 55 FR 38315, Sept. 18, 1990]
§ 10.4
Establishment of the Standard Review Committee.
(a) The Department shall establish and appoint the members of a Standard Review Committee within a reasonable time after receiving a proposed standard. The committee shall consist of qualified representatives of producers, distributors, and users or consumers of product for which a standard is sought or any other appropriate general interest groups such as State and Federal agencies. When requested by the Standard Review Committee, the Department shall appoint one voting member from among the representatives of the Federal agencies, other than the Department of Commerce. All other representatives of Federal agencies on the Standard Review Committees shall be advisory nonvoting members. (Alternates to committee members may be designated by the Department.) When deemed appropriate by the Department, project funds under § 10.2 may be made available to assure participation by consumer interests on the committee at required meetings.
(b) A Standard Review Committee may remain in existence for a period necessary for the final development of the standard, or for 2 years, whichever is less.
(c) The Department shall be responsible for the organization of the committee. Any formal operating procedures developed by the committee shall be subject to approval by the Department. The committee may conduct business either in a meeting or through correspondence, but only if a quorum participates. A quorum shall consist of two-thirds of all voting members of the committee. A majority of the voting members of the committee participating shall be required to approve any actions taken by the committee except for the action of recommending a standard to the Department, the requirements for which are contained in § 10.5(b).
§ 10.5
Development of a recommended standard.
(a) The Standard Review Committee, with the guidance and assistance of the Department and, if appropriate, the reviewer designated under § 10.3(b), shall review a proposed standard promptly. If the committee finds that the proposal meets the requirements set forth in § 10.3(a), it may recommend to the Department that the proposal be circulated for acceptance under § 10.6. If, however, the committee finds that the proposal being reviewed does not meet the requirements set forth in § 10.3(a), the committee shall change the proposal, after consulting with the proponent group, so that these requirements are met, before recommending such proposal to the Department.
(b) The recommendation of a standard by the Standard Review Committee shall be approved by at least three-quarters, or rejected by more than one-quarter, of all of the members of the
committee eligible to vote. The voting on the recommendation of a standard shall be conducted by the Department if conducted by letter ballot. If such voting is accomplished at a meeting of the committee, the balloting shall be either by roll call or by signed written ballot conducted by the Department or the chairman of this committee. If conducted by the chairman, a report of the vote shall be made to the Department within 15 days. If the balloting at the meeting does not result in either approval by at least three-quarters of all members (or alternates) eligible to vote (whether present or not), or rejection by more than one-quarter of the members (or alternates) or the committee eligible to vote, the balloting shall be disregarded and the Department shall subsequently conduct a letter ballot of all members of the committee.
(c) Any member of the committee casting a negative ballot shall have the right to support an objection by furnishing the chairman of the committee and the Department with a written statement setting forth the basis for the objection. The written statement of objection shall be filed within 15 days after the date of the meeting during which the voting on the standard was accomplished, or, in the case of a letter ballot, within the time limit established for the return of the ballot.
(d) At the time a recommended standard is submitted to the Department, the Chairman of the Standard Review Committee shall furnish a written report in support of the committee's recommendation. Such report shall include a statement with respect to compliance with the requirements as established by these procedures, a discussion of the manner in which any objections were resolved, and a discussion of any unresolved objections together with the committee's reasons for rejecting such unresolved objections.
§ 10.6
Procedures for acceptance of a recommended standard.
(a) Upon receipt from the Standard Review Committee of a recommended standard and report, the Department shall give appropriate public notice and distribute the recommended standard for acceptance unless:
(1) Upon a showing by any member of the committee who has voted to oppose the recommended standard on the basis of an unresolved objection, the Department determines that if such objection were not resolved, the recommended standard:
(i) Would be contrary to the public interest, if published;
(ii) Would be technically inadequate; or
(iii) Would be inconsistent with law or established public policy; or
(2) The Department determines that all criteria and procedures set forth herein have not been met satisfactorily or that there is a legal impediment to the recommended standard.
(b) Distribution for acceptance or rejection for the purpose of determining general concurrence will be made to a list compiled by the Department, which, in the judgment of the Department, shall be representative of producers, distributors, and users and consumers.
(c) Distribution for comment will be made to any party filing a written request with the Department, and to such other parties as the Department may deem appropriate, including testing laboratories and interested State and Federal agencies.
(d) The Department shall analyze the recommended standard and the responses received under paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section. If such analysis indicates that the recommended standard is supported by a consensus, it shall be published as a Voluntary Product Standard by the Department: Provided, That all other requirements listed in these procedures have been satisfied.
(e) The following definitions shall apply to the term used in this section:
(1) “Consensus” means general concurrence and, in addition, no substantive objection deemed valid by the Department.
(2) “General concurrence” means acceptance among those responding to the distribution made under paragraph (b) of this section in accordance with the conditions set forth in paragraph (f) of this section.
(3) “Substantive objection” means a documented objection based on grounds that one or more of the criteria set forth in these procedures has not been satisfied.
(4) “Average industry acceptance” means a percentage equal to the sum of the percentages of acceptance obtained from responses to distribution of the recommended standard in the producer segment, the distributor segment, and the user and consumer segment, divided by three. No consideration will be given to volume of production or volume of distribution in determining average industry acceptance.
(5) “Producer segment” means those persons who manufacture or produce the product covered by the standard.
(6) “Distributor segment” means those persons who distribute at wholesale or retail the product covered by the standard.
(7) “User and consumer segment” means those persons who use or consume the product covered by the standard.
(8) “Acceptance by volume of production” means the weighted percentage of acceptance of those responding to the distribution in the producer segment. The weighting of each response will be made in accordance with the volume of production represented by each respondent.
(9) “Acceptance by volume of distribution” means the weighted percentage of acceptance of those responding to the distribution in the distributor segment. The weighting of each response will be made in accordance with the volume of distribution represented by each respondent.
(f) A recommended standard shall be deemed to be supported by general concurrence whenever:
(1) An analysis of the responses to the distribution under paragraph (b) of this section indicates:
(i) An average industry acceptance of not less than 75 percent;
(ii) Acceptance of not less than 70 percent by the producer segment, the distributor segment, and the user and consumer segment, each segment being considered separately; and
(iii) Acceptance by volume of production and acceptance by volume of distribution of not less than 70 percent in each case:
Provided,
That the Department shall disregard acceptance by volume of production or acceptance by volume of distribution or both unless, in the judgment of the Department, accurate figures for the volume of production or distribution are reasonably available and an evaluation of either or both of such acceptances is deemed necessary by the Department; or
(2) The Department determines that publication of the standard is appropriate under the procedures set forth in paragraph (g) of this section and, in addition, an analysis of the responses to the distribution under paragraph (b) of this section indicates:
(i) An average industry acceptance of not less than 66
2/3
percent;
(ii) Acceptance of not less than 60 percent by the producer segment, the distributor segment, and the user and consumer segment, each segment being considered separately; and
(iii) Acceptance by volume of production and acceptance by volume of distribution of not less than 60 percent in each case:
Provided,
That the Department shall disregard acceptance by volume of production or acceptance by volume of distribution or both unless, in the judgment of the Department, accurate figures for the volume of production or distribution are reasonably available and an evaluation of either or both of such acceptances is deemed necessary by the Department.
(g) A recommended standard which fails to achieve the acceptance requirements of paragraph (f)(1) of this section, but which satisfies the acceptance criteria of paragraph (f)(2) of this section, shall be returned to the Standard Review Committee for reconsideration. The committee, by the affirmative vote of not less than three-quarters of all members eligible to vote, may resubmit the recommended standard without change to the Department with a recommendation that the standard be published as a Voluntary Product Standard. The Department shall then conduct a public rulemaking hearing in accordance with the requirements of law as set forth in section 553 of Title 5, United States Code, to assist it in determining whether publication of the standard is in the public interest. If the Department determines that
publication of the standard is in the public interest, the standard shall be published as a Voluntary Product Standard.
§ 10.7
Procedure when a recommended standard is not supported by a consensus.
If the Department determines that a recommended standard is not supported by a consensus, the Department may:
(a) Return the recommended standard to the Standard Review Committee for further action, with or without suggestions;
(b) Terminate the development of the recommended standard under these procedures; or
(c) Take such other action as it may deem necessary or appropriate under the circumstances.
§ 10.8
Standing Committee.
(a) The Department shall establish and appoint the members of a Standing Committee prior to the publication of a standard. The committee may include members from the Standard Review Committee, and shall consist of qualified representatives of producers, distributors, and users or consumers of the product covered by the standard, and representatives of appropriate general interest groups such as municipal, State, and Federal agencies. When requested by the Standing Committee, the Department shall appoint one voting member from among the representatives of the Federal agencies, other than the Department of Commerce. When requested by the Standing Committee for PS 20-70, “American Softwood Lumber Standard,” the Department shall appoint two voting members from among the representatives of the Federal agencies, other than the Department of Commerce. All other representatives of Federal agencies shall be advisory nonvoting members of Standing Committees. (Alternates to committee members may be designated by the Department.) When deemed appropriate by the Department, project funds under § 10.2, may be made available to assure participation by consumer interests on the committee at required meetings.
(b) Appointments to a Standing Committee may not exceed a term of 5 years. However, the committee may be reconstituted by the Department whenever appropriate, and members may be reappointed by the Department to succeeding terms. Appointments to the committee will be terminated upon the withdrawal of the standard.
(c) The Department shall be responsible for the organization of the committee. Any formal operating procedures developed by the committee shall be subject to approval by the Department. The committee may conduct business either in a meeting or through correspondence, but only if a quorum participates. A quorum shall consist of two-thirds of all voting members of the committee. A majority of the voting members of the committee participating shall be required to approve any actions taken by the committee except for the approval of revisions of the standard which shall be governed by the provisions of § 10.5 (b), (c), and (d),
(d) The members of a Standing Committee should be knowledgeable about:
(1) The product or products covered by the standard;
(2) The standard itself; and
(3) Industry and trade practices relating to the standard.
(e) The committee shall:
(1) Keep itself informed of any advancing technology that might affect the standard;
(2) Provide the Department with interpretations of provisions of the standard upon request;
(3) Make recommendations to the Department concerning the desirability or necessity of revising or amending the standard;
(4) Receive and consider proposals to revise or amend the standard; and
(5) Recommend to the Department the revision or amendment of a standard.
§ 10.9
Publication of a standard.
A Voluntary Product Standard published by the department under these procedures shall be assigned an appropriate number for purposes of identification and reference. Public notice shall be given regarding the publication and identification of the standard. A voluntary standard by itself has no
mandatory or legally binding effect. Any person may choose to use or not to use such a standard. Appropriate reference in contracts, codes, advertising, invoices, announcements, product labels, and the like may be made to a Voluntary Product Standard published under these procedures. Such reference shall be in accordance with such policies as the Department may establish, but no product may be advertised or represented in any manner which would imply or tend to imply approval or endorsement of that product by the Department or by the Federal Government.
§ 10.10
Review of published standards.
(a) Each standard published under these or previous procedures shall be reviewed regularly to determine the feasibility of transferring sponsorship to a private standards-writing organization. While the Department encourages the development of standards to replace Voluntary Product Standards by private standards-writing organizations, withdrawal of a Voluntary Product Standard, which meets the requirements of § 10.0(b), shall not be considered until a replacement standard is published.
(b) Each standard published under these or previous procedures shall be reviewed by the Department, with such assistance of the Standing Committee or others as may be deemed appropriate by the Department, within 5 years after initial issuance or last revision and at least every 5 years thereafter. The purpose of this review shall be to determine whether the standard has become obsolete, technically inadequate, no longer acceptable to or used by the industry, or inconsistent with law or established public policy.
(c) If any of the above conditions is found to exist, the Department shall initiate action to amend, revise, or withdraw the standard in accordance with § 10.11 or § 10.13. If none is found to exist, the standard shall be kept in effect provided adequate funding is maintained.
§ 10.11
Revision or amendment of a standard.
(a) A published standard shall be subject to revision or amendment when it is determined to be inadequate by its Standing Committee or by the Department of one or more of the following reasons or for any other appropriate reasons:
(1) Any portion of the standard is obsolete, technically inadequate, or no longer generally acceptable to or used by the industry;
(2) The standard or any part of it is inconsistent with law or established public policy; or
(3) The standard or any part of it is being used to mislead users or consumers or is determined to be against the interest of users, consumers, or the public in general.
(b) A revision of a standard shall be considered by the Department to include changes which are comprehensive in nature, which have a substantive effect on the standards, which change the level of performance or safety or the design characteristics of the product being standardized, or which cannot reasonably be injected into a standard without disturbing the general applicability of the standard. Each suggestion for revision shall be submitted by the Department to the Standing Committee for appropriate consideration. The Standing Committee shall serve the same functions in the revision of a standard as the Standard Review Committee serves in the development of a new standard. The processing of a revision of a standard shall be dependent upon the age of the standard as computed from its effective date and shall be accomplished as follows:
(1) A proposed revision of a standard older than 5 years at the time such proposed revision is submitted to the Standing Committee by the Department shall be processed as a new standard under these procedures and, when approved for publication, the standard shall be republished and reidentified to indicate the year in which the revision became effective. The revised standard shall supersede the previously published standard.
(2) A proposed revision of a standard less than 5 years at the time such proposed revision is submitted to the Standing Committee by the Department shall be processed as a new standard except that:
(i) Distribution for acceptance or rejection shall be made to an appropriate list of producers, distributors, and users and consumers compiled by the Department;
(ii) If the revision affects only one subsection of the requirement section and/or only one subsection of the test methods section, it may be circulated separately for determining consensus and subsequently published as an addendum to the standard with appropriate dissemination and public notice of the addendum; and
(iii) If the revision does not change the level of performance or safety or the design characteristics of the product being standardized, the standard need not be reidentified.
(c) An amendment to a standard shall be considered by the Department to be any non-editorial change which is not comprehensive in nature, which has no substantive effect on the standard, which does not change the level of performance or safety or the design characteristics of the product being standardized, and which reasonably can be injected into a standard without disturbing the general applicability of the standard. Each suggestion for amendment shall be submitted by the Department to the Standing Committee for appropriate consideration. An amendment to a standard recommended by not less than 90 percent of the members of the committee eligible to vote and found acceptable by the Department, shall be published as an addendum (until the standard is republished) and distributed to acceptors of record. Public notice of the amendment shall be given and copies of the amendment shall be distributed to those filing written requests.
§ 10.12
Editorial changes.
The Department may, without prior notice, make such editorial or other minor changes as it deems necessary to reduce ambiguity or to improve clarity in any proposed, recommended, or published standard, or revision or amendment thereof.
§ 10.13
Withdrawal of a published standard.
(a) Standards published under these and previous procedures may be withdrawn by the Director of the National Institute of Standards
Technology at any time. Such action will be taken if, after consultation with the Standing Committee as provided in paragraph (a)(1) of this section and after public notice, the Director determines that the standard is: Obsolete; technically inadequate; no longer generally acceptable to and used by the industry; inconsistent with law or established public policy; not in the public interest; or otherwise inappropriate; and revision or amendment is not feasible or would serve no useful purpose. Additionally, a standard may be withdrawn if it cannot be demonstrated that a particular standard has substantial public impact, that it does not duplicate a standard published by a private standards-writing organization, or that lack of government sponsorship would result in significant public disadvantage for legal reasons or for reasons of domestic and international trade. The Director may withdraw a standard if costs to maintain such a standard are not reimbursed by the proponent or other government agencies.
(1) Before withdrawing a standard published under these procedures, the Director will review the relative advantages and disadvantages of amendment, revision, development of a new standard, or withdrawal with the members of the Standing Committee, if such committee was appointed or reappointed within the previous five years.
(2) Public notice of intent to withdraw an existing standard published under these procedures shall be given and a 30-day period will be provided for the filing with the Director or written objections to the withdrawal. Such objections will be considered and analyzed by the Director before a determination is made to withdraw the standard. If the Director determines that a particular standard does not meet the criteria set out in § 10.0(b), the standard will be withdrawn.
(b) The filing under paragraph (a) of this section of a request to retain a standard or standards shall operate to stay the withdrawal of such standard or standards until the Director's determination has been made. If the Director determines that the requested
standard or standards shall be withdrawn, the stay will remain in effect, if an appeal is filed in accordance with the requirements of § 10.14, until the decision of the Director is announced in the
Federal Register.
If, however, no appeal is received, the Director shall announce withdrawal of the particular standard or standards.
(c) Notice of the withdrawal action will be published in the
Federal Register
and such withdrawal will take effect 60 days from the date the withdrawal notice is published.

L. 89-755, 80 Stat. 1299), hereinafter called the “Act”. The word “Secretary”, as used hereinafter, shall refer to the Secretary of Commerce or his authorized delegate.
(b) The Secretary does not have the responsibility or the authority under
the Act to issue any regulations governing the packaging or labeling practices of private industry.
(c) The Secretary does have the responsibility and authority to:
(1) Determine whether the reasonable ability of consumers to make value comparisions with respect to any consumer commodity or reasonably comparable consumer commodities is impaired by undue proliferation of the weights, measures, or quantities in which such commodity or commodities are being distributed in packages for sale at retail.
(2) Request manufacturers, packers, and distributors, where a determination of undue proliferation has been made, to participate in the development of a voluntary product standard under the procedures governing the Department's voluntary standards program.
(3) Report to Congress with a recommendation as to whether legislation providing regulatory authority should be enacted, when after 1 year following the date private industry has been requested to participate in the development of a voluntary product standard it is determined that such a standard will not be published, or when following the publication of such a standard it is determined that the standard has not been observed.
(d) The Act does not furnish a detailed, definitive explanation of “undue proliferation”. It does, however, point out that the condition of “undue proliferation” must be one which “impairs the reasonable ability of consumers to make value comparisons” with respect to consumer commodities. Generally, therefore, the Department will determine “undue proliferation” on a case-by-case basis, and, accordingly, is establishing by these procedures an orderly process for such determinations.
(e) As used hereinafter the term “undue proliferation” shall refer to such undue proliferation—of the weights, measures or quantities in which any consumer commodity or reasonably comparable consumer commodities are being distributed for sale at retail—as impairs the reasonable ability of consumers to make value comparisons with respect to such consumer commodity or commodities, as set out in section 5(d) of the Act.
§ 12.2
Undue proliferation.
(a)
Information as to possible undue proliferation.
Any person or group, including a State or local governmental entity, is invited to communicate information to the Secretary concerning the possible existence of undue proliferation. Such communications should be in writing and include supporting information and explanations.
(b)
Initiation of inquiry as to undue proliferation.
Upon receipt of information regarding the possible existence of undue proliferation, the Secretary will determine whether there has been a showing of good cause warranting an inquiry. If the Secretary determines that good cause exists, he shall initiate an inquiry for the purpose of finding facts concerning the existence of undue proliferation.
(c)
Procedures for inquiry
—(1)
Cooperation with State and local officials.
Any inquiry initiated under paragraph (b) of this section may be conducted in cooperation with State and local weights and measures officials.
(2)
Participation by interested persons.
The Secretary may, during the course of the inquiry, afford interested persons or groups an opportunity to submit in writing comments, data, arguments, views, or other information relevant to the inquiry.
(d)
Proposed determination as to existence of undue proliferation.
(1) If, after consideration of all relevant information, the Secretary concludes that undue proliferation appears to exist, he shall publish a proposed determination to this effect. The proposed determination shall identify the particular consumer commodity or commodities involved and shall be accompanied by a concise statement of the facts upon which it is based.
(2) Within 60 days after publication of the proposed determination, any interested party may submit in writing comments, data, arguments, views, or other information relevant to the proposed determination. All written submissions shall be made a part of the public record.
(3) Within 30 days after the proposed determination has been published, any
interested party may request in writing an oral hearing to present his views. The granting of such a hearing shall be at the discretion of the Secretary. Any such hearing shall be public and notice thereof shall be published at least 15 days in advance. A transcript of the hearing shall be made part of the public record.
(e)
Final determination as to undue proliferation.
As soon as practicable following the conclusion of the proceedings described in paragraph (d) of this section, the Secretary shall either publish a final determination of undue proliferation, or he shall publish a notice withdrawing his proposed determination of undue proliferation. In no event shall the withdrawal of a proposed determination operate to preclude the initiation of another inquiry regarding the same or similar subject matter under paragraph (b) of this section.
§ 12.3
Development of voluntary product standards.
(a)
Invitation to participate in the development of a voluntary product standard.
Whenever the Secretary publishes a final determination of undue proliferation under § 12.2(e), he shall invite manufacturers, packers, and distributors of the commodity or commodities involved to participate in the development of a voluntary product standard in accordance with the terms of the Act and the Department's published procedures for voluntary product standards. The term “Voluntary Product Standard” as used in this section means a standard for weights, measures or quantities in which the commodity or commodities are being distributed in packages for sale at retail.
(b)
Determination that voluntary product standard will not be published.
(1) If a voluntary product standard has not been developed within one year from the date on which participation was invited, the Secretary may conclude that a voluntary product standard will not likely be published. Upon reaching such a conclusion, the Secretary will publish a proposed determination that a voluntary product standard will not be published.
(2) Within 60 days after publication of the proposed determination, any interested party may submit in writing comments, data, arguments, views, or other information relevant to the proposed determination. All written submissions shall be made a part of the public record.
(3) Within 30 days after the proposed determination has been published, any interested party may request in writing an oral hearing to present his views. The granting of such a hearing shall be at the discretion of the Secretary. Any such hearing shall be public and notice thereof shall be published at least 15 days in advance. A transcript of the hearing shall be made part of the public record.
(4) As soon as practicable following the conclusion of the proceedings described in paragraphs (b)(2) and (3) of this section, the Secretary shall either publish a final determination that a voluntary product standard will not be published, or he shall publish a notice withdrawing his proposed determination under paragraph (b)(1) of this section. In no event shall the withdrawal of a proposed determination operate to preclude the publication of another proposed determination under paragraph (b)(1) of this section with respect to the same or similar subject matter.
(c)
Determination that a published voluntary product standard has not been observed.
(1) Whenever the Secretary has reason to believe that a voluntary product standard published under these procedures is not being observed he shall initiate an inquiry to determine such fact.
(2) If, on the basis of the information developed during the inquiry, the Secretary concludes that the voluntary product standard is not being observed, he shall publish a proposed determination to this effect. The proposed determination shall identify the particular standard involved and shall be accompanied by a concise statement of the facts upon which it is based.
(3) Within 60 days after publication of the proposed determination, any interested party may submit in writing comments, data, arguments, views, or other information relevant to the proposed determination. All written submissions shall be made a part of the public record.
(4) Within 30 days after the proposed determination has been published, any interested party may request in writing an oral hearing to present his views. The granting of such a hearing shall be at the discretion of the Secretary. Any such hearing shall be public and notice thereof shall be published at least 15 days in advance. A transcript of the hearing shall be made part of the public record.
(5) As soon as practicable following the conclusion of the proceedings described in paragraphs (c)(3) and (4) of this section, and upon consideration of all relevant information, the Secretary shall either publish a final determination that the voluntary product standard is not being observed, or he shall publish a notice withdrawing his proposed determination under paragraph (c)(2) of this section. In no event shall the withdrawal of a proposed determination operate to preclude the initiation of another inquiry regarding the same standard under paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
§ 12.4
Report to the Congress.
Whenever the Secretary publishes a final determination under § 12.3(b)(4) or § 12.3(c)(5), he shall promptly report such determination to the Congress with a statement of the efforts that have been made under the voluntary standards program and his recommendation as to whether Congress should enact legislation providing regulatory authority to deal with the situation in question.

(1) A demand for the testimony of an employee or for the production of documents of the Department shall be made in writing and addressed to the Assistant General Counsel for Employment, Litigation, and Information, U.S. Department of Commerce, 1401 Constitution Avenue NW, Room 5896, Washington, DC 20230; or by email to:
Touhy@doc.gov;
or to appropriate agency counsel.
(2) The process for any demand for testimony of an employee or for the production of documents of the USPTO can be found at 37 CFR 104.21 through 104.24, and any such demands should be sent directly to the USPTO, in accordance with § 15.11(d).
(c)
Employee procedure.
Whenever a Department employee receives an inquiry or demand for testimony or production of documents, that employee shall not respond, and shall immediately notify the Office of the Assistant General Counsel for Employment, Litigation, and Information as provided in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, or appropriate agency counsel, and provide a copy of the demand. An employee may not answer inquiries from a person not employed by the Department regarding testimony or documents subject to a demand or a potential demand under the provisions of this subpart without the approval of the General Counsel or appropriate agency counsel.
(d)
Subpoenas.
A subpoena for testimony or production of documents by a Department employee must be served in person, at the office or home, or by mail in accordance with the Federal Rules of Civil or Criminal Procedure or applicable state procedure. Service solely by electronic means is not authorized. If service is made upon anyone other than the General Counsel or appropriate agency counsel, then a copy of the subpoena shall also be contemporaneously sent to the General Counsel at the appropriate addresses in paragraph (b) of this section, or appropriate agency counsel.
(1) An employee who receives such a subpoena shall not respond and shall immediately forward the subpoena to the Office of the Assistant General Counsel for Employment, Litigation, and Information or the appropriate agency counsel. The General Counsel or appropriate agency counsel will determine the extent to which a Department employee will comply with the subpoena.
(2) If the General Counsel or appropriate agency counsel determines that an employee should not comply with a properly-served subpoena, the General Counsel or agency counsel will attempt to have the subpoena withdrawn or modified. If this cannot be done with regard to a subpoena for documents, the Department will provide the tribunal with an objections letter or other notification that the documents will not be produced. If this cannot be done with regard to a subpoena for testimony, the General Counsel or appropriate agency counsel will attempt to obtain U.S. Department of Justice representation for the employee and move to have the subpoena modified or quashed. If, because of time constraints, this is not possible prior to the compliance date specified in the subpoena, the employee should appear at the time and place set forth in the subpoena. If legal counsel cannot appear on behalf of the employee, the employee should produce a copy of the Department's regulations in this subpart and inform the legal tribunal that the employee has been advised by counsel not to provide the requested testimony and/or produce documents. If the legal tribunal rules that the demand in the subpoena must be complied with, the employee shall respectfully decline to comply with the demand.

v.
Ragen,

[87 FR 162, Jan. 4, 2022]
§ 15.14
Demand for testimony or production of documents in matters in which the United States is not a party.
(a)
General.
Every demand for testimony or documents in a legal matter in which the United States is not a
named party shall be made in writing, delivered in accordance with § 15.13(b) no later than 30 days before the document or testimony is required, and shall be accompanied by an affidavit or written declaration under 28 U.S.C. 1746, or, if an affidavit or declaration is not feasible, a written statement setting forth:
(1) The title of the legal proceeding,
(2) The forum;
(3) The requesting party's interest in the legal proceeding;
(4) The reason for the demand and the relevance of the request to the legal proceeding;
(5) A showing that the desired testimony or document is not reasonably available from any other source; and
(6) If testimony is requested, the intended use of the testimony; a general summary of the desired testimony; the time that will be required to prepare for, travel to, and present testimony; and a showing that no document could be provided and used in lieu of testimony, including from opposing parties via discovery proceedings.
(b)
Purpose.
The purpose of the requirement in this section is to assist the General Counsel or appropriate agency counsel in making an informed decision regarding whether testimony or the production of a document(s) should be authorized, in accordance with § 15.16. Any authorization for testimony by an employee of the Department shall be limited to the scope of the demand as summarized in the statement or as negotiated in paragraph (e) of this section.
(c)
Prior authorization.
A certified copy of a document that has been authorized pursuant to § 15.16(a) for use in a legal proceeding may be provided upon written request and payment of applicable fees. Written requests for certification must be addressed to the agency counsel for the component having possession, custody, or control of the document. The requestor must provide the agency with information regarding the prior authorization for release of the requested document pursuant to § 15.16(a), including date of release and parties to whom the document was released.
(d)
Secretary's authority.
The Secretary retains the authority to authorize and direct testimony in those cases where a statute or Presidential order mandates a personal decision by the Secretary.
(e)
Consultation.
The General Counsel or appropriate agency counsel may consult or negotiate with an attorney for a party, or with the party if not represented by an attorney, to refine or limit a demand so that compliance is less burdensome or seek additional information about the demand necessary to make the determination required by paragraph (b) of this section. Failure of the attorney or party to cooperate in good faith to enable the General Counsel or the appropriate agency counsel to make an informed decision under this subpart may serve, where appropriate, as a basis for a determination not to comply with the demand. In addition, the General Counsel or appropriate agency counsel may impose further conditions or restrictions on the production of any document or testimony when that is in the best interests of the United States.
(f)
Fact witness.
If an employee is authorized to give testimony in a legal proceeding not involving the United States, the testimony, if otherwise proper, shall be limited to facts within the personal knowledge of the employee that are not classified, privileged, or protected from disclosure under applicable law or regulation. If asked to provide factual testimony that the employee believes may be classified, privileged, or protected from disclosure under applicable law or regulation, then the witness shall:
(1) Respectfully decline to answer on the grounds that such testimony is prohibited; and
(2) Request an opportunity to consult with the General Counsel or appropriate agency counsel.
(g)
Expert or opinion witness.
(1) Current employees, with or without compensation, shall not provide expert or opinion testimony in any legal proceedings regarding Department information, subjects, or activities except on behalf of the United States or a party represented by the United States Department of Justice. However, upon a showing by the requester that there are exceptional circumstances and that the anticipated testimony will not be
adverse to the interests of the Department or the United States, the General Counsel, or appropriate agency counsel after consultation with the Office of the General Counsel, may grant special authorization in writing for a current employee to appear and give the expert or opinion testimony.
(i) If, while testifying in any legal proceeding, an employee is asked for expert or opinion testimony regarding official information, subjects, or activities, which testimony has not been approved in advance in accordance with the regulations in this subpart, the witness shall:
(A) Respectfully decline to answer on the grounds that such expert or opinion testimony is forbidden by the regulations in this subpart;
(B) Request an opportunity to consult with the General Counsel or appropriate agency counsel before giving such testimony; and
(C) Explain that upon such consultation, approval for such testimony may be provided.
(ii) If the body conducting the proceeding then orders the witness to provide expert or opinion testimony regarding official information, subjects, or activities without the opportunity to consult with either the General Counsel or appropriate agency counsel, the witness shall respectfully refuse to provide such testimony.
See United States ex rel. Touhy
v.
Ragen,
340 U.S. 462 (1951).
(iii) If an employee is unaware of the regulations in this subpart and provides expert or opinion testimony regarding official information, subjects, or activities in a legal proceeding without the consultation discussed in paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this section, the witness must, as soon as possible after testifying, inform the General Counsel or appropriate agency counsel that such testimony was given and provide a written summary of the expert or opinion testimony provided.
(2) Former employees may provide opinion or expert testimony if:
(i) The testimony does not involve non-public facts, information, or documents about a particular matter that were acquired by the former employee during the performance of their employment with the United States; and
(ii) The involvement of the former employee in the proceeding as a witness complies with 18 U.S.C. 207 and applicable post-employment ethics rules.
See
5 CFR part 2641. Former employees offering expert or opinion testimony and those seeking such testimony from former employees, must confer with the General Counsel or appropriate agency counsel to ascertain if the prospective expert or opinion testimony is consistent with this subpart.
(h)
Decision.
A decision under this subpart to comply or not to comply with a demand is neither an assertion or waiver of privilege, nor an assertion of lack of relevance or technical deficiency, nor does it reflect any other ground for noncompliance.
(i)
Waiver.
The General Counsel or appropriate agency counsel may waive any requirements set forth under this section to the extent allowed by law, when circumstances warrant.
[87 FR 162, Jan. 4, 2022]
§ 15.15
Demand for testimony or production of documents in matters in which the United States is a party.
If a demand is received pertaining to a legal matter in which the United States but not the Department is a named party, or where a party other than the Department is represented by the Department of Justice, the following rules apply.
(a)
Demand not from the United States.
For demands for documents from, or testimony of an employee of the Department, from an entity other than the United States pursuant to a legal proceeding in which the United States is a party, the demand must be in writing and signed, delivered in accordance with § 15.13(b), setting forth the information required in § 15.14(a), and copied to the attorneys of record representing or acting under the authority of the United States in the legal proceeding. Upon receipt of the demand, the General Counsel or appropriate agency counsel shall promptly contact the appropriate Department of Justice office to coordinate any response in accordance with applicable Federal or state rules of civil procedure governing discovery matters.
(b)
Demand from the United States.
When a demand for documents from,
testimony of, or consultation with an employee of the Department comes from an attorney representing or acting under the authority of the United States concerning a legal proceeding in which the United States is a party, every such demand should be accompanied by a statement setting forth the legal proceeding, the forum, the United States' interest in the legal proceeding, and the relevance and use of the requested documents or testimony. The purpose of the requirement in this paragraph (b) is to assist the General Counsel or the appropriate agency counsel in making all necessary arrangements to facilitate the demand on behalf of the United States. Where appropriate, the General Counsel or appropriate agency counsel may require reimbursement to the Department of the expenses associated with a Department employee giving testimony or providing consultation on behalf of the United States.
(c)
Expert or opinion witness.
In a legal proceeding in which the United States is a party, a current Department employee may not testify as an expert or opinion witness for any other party other than the United States. However, a former employee may provide opinion or expert testimony for a party other than the United States if:
(1) The testimony does not involve facts, information, or documents about a particular matter that were acquired by the former employee during the performance of their official duties as an employee of the United States; and
(2) The involvement of the former employee in the proceeding as a witness complies with applicable post-employment conflict of interest laws.
See
18 U.S.C. 207 and 5 CFR part 2641. A former employee offering expert or opinion testimony or consulting, and those seeking such testimony from a former employee, shall confer with the General Counsel or appropriate agency counsel to ascertain if the prospective expert or opinion testimony or consulting is consistent with this subpart.
[87 FR 162, Jan. 4, 2022]
§ 15.16
Demand for testimony or production of documents: Department policy and considerations.
(a)
Decision.
In deciding whether to authorize a demand for testimony or documents under this subpart, the General Counsel or appropriate agency counsel shall consider whether the disclosure or testimony is in the interests of the Department. The following factors should be considered:
(1) Conserving the time of Department employees for conducting official business;
(2) Minimizing the possibility of involving the Department in controversial issues that are not related to the Department's mission or matters that do not further the Department's mission;
(3) Preventing the possibility that the public will misconstrue variances between personal opinions of Department employees and official Department policy;
(4) Avoiding spending the time and money of the United States for private purposes;
(5) Preserving the integrity of the administrative or judicial process;
(6) Protecting classified, confidential, or controlled unclassified information, and the deliberative process of the Department;
(7) Preventing the appearance of improperly favoring one litigant over another;
(8) Avoiding the denial of a party's constitutional or statutory rights;
(9) Whether such disclosure is appropriate under the rules of procedure governing the case or matter in which the demand arose;
(10) Whether disclosure is appropriate under the relevant substantive law concerning privilege; and
(11) Any other issue that is relevant to the decision.
(b)
Non-disclosure factors.
Demands for testimony or documents in response to which disclosure will not be made by any Department official include, but are not limited to, those demands with respect to which any of the following factors exist:
(1) Disclosure is restricted by statute or regulation, or would violate a rule of procedure, Executive order, policy, or an applicable Government directive;
(2) Disclosure would reveal classified or controlled unclassified information, unless appropriately declassified or decontrolled by the originating agency;
(3) Disclosure would reveal a confidential source or informant, unless the investigative agency and the source or informant have no objection;
(4) Disclosure would reveal investigatory records compiled for law enforcement purposes and would interfere with enforcement proceedings or disclose investigative techniques and procedures, the effectiveness of which would thereby be impaired;
(5) Disclosure would improperly reveal trade secrets or disclose information protected by law, a non-disclosure agreement, or court order without authorized consent;
(6) Disclosure would be unduly costly, burdensome, or otherwise inappropriate under applicable court rules;
(7) Disclosure would involve the Department in controversial issues that are not related to the Department's mission or issues that do not further the Department's mission; or
(8) Disclosure would involve scientific or expert opinion on research that is controversial or contrary to Department policy, or would result in burdensome repetition of similar testimony in subsequent proceedings.
[87 FR 162, Jan. 4, 2022]
§ 15.17
Subpoenas and demands served upon employees or former employees of the Office of the Inspector General.
Notwithstanding the requirements set forth in §§ 15.11 through 15.16, this subpart is applicable to demands served on employees or former employees of the Office of the Inspector General (OIG), except that wherever in §§ 15.11 through 15.16 there appear the phrases General Counsel, agency counsel, or Assistant General Counsel for Employment, Litigation, and Information, there shall be substituted in lieu thereof the Inspector General or Counsel to the Inspector General.

§ 16.1
Purpose.
The purpose of this part is to establish procedures under which a voluntary consumer product information labeling program administered by the Department of Commerce will function.
§ 16.2
Description and goal of program.
(a) The Department's Voluntary Consumer Product Information Labeling Program makes available to consumers, at the point of sale, information on consumer product performance in an understandable and useful form so as to facilitate accurate consumer purchasing decisions and enhance consumer satisfaction. It also educates consumers, distributors and retailers in the use of the product performance information displayed and provides manufacturers and other persons who participate in the program with an opportunity to convey to the public the particular advantages of their products. These objectives are accomplished by:
(1) Selecting or developing standardized test methods by which selected product performance characteristics can be measured;
(2) Developing labeling methods by which information concerning product performance can be transmitted in useful form to consumers at the point of sale;
(3) Encouraging manufacturers and other participants in the program voluntarily to test and label their products according to the selected or developed methods; and
(4) Encouraging consumers through various informational and educational programs to utilize the product performance information provided.
(b) The program involves voluntary labeling by enrolled participants of selected categories of consumer products with information concerning selected performance characteristics of those products. The performance characteristics selected are those that are of demonstrable importance to consumers, that consumers cannot evaluate through mere inspection of the product, and that can be measured objectively and reported understandably to consumers. The consumer products covered include those for which incorrect purchase decision can result in financial loss, dissatisfaction, or inconvenience. The program seeks to avoid the duplication of other Federal programs under which performance characteristics are labeled by exempting those performance characteristics from this program. However, where the Federal agency concerned agrees, the Department of Commerce may include information about those performance characteristics in CPILP labels if, by doing so, product comparison at the point of sale is simplified for consumers, and the complexity of product labeling is reduced for the manufacturers by enabling them to comply with the labeling requirements of other Federal agencies through participation in CPILP.
(c) For selected categories of consumer products, the program includes advertising guidelines covering situations where quantitative performance values are stated in advertising or where qualitative comparisons are made of the performance of different products.

§ 16.4
Finding of need to establish a specification for labeling a consumer product.
(a) Any person may request the Secretary to find that there is a need to label a particular consumer product with information concerning one or more specific performance characteristics of that product.
(b) Such a request shall be in writing and will, to the extent practicable, include the following information:
(1) Identification of the consumer product;
(2) Extent that the product identified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section is used by the public and, if known, what the production or sales volume is of such product;
(3) Nature and extent of difficulty experienced by consumers in making informed purchase decisions because of a lack of knowledge regarding the performance characteristics of the identified consumer product;
(4) Potential or actual loss to consumers as a result of an incorrect decision based on an inadequate understanding of the performance characteristics of the identified consumer product;
(5) Extent of incidence of consumer complaints arising from or reasonably traceable to lack of knowledge regarding the performance characteristics of the identified consumer product;
(6) If known, whether there currently exist test methods which could be used to test the performance characteristics of the identified consumer product and an identification of those test methods;
(7) Reasons why it is felt, in cases where existing test methods are identified in responding to paragraph (b)(6) of this section, that such test methods are suitable for making objective measurements of the performance characteristics of the identified consumer product; and
(8) Estimated cost to participants to test and label the product.
(c) The Secretary may ask for more information to support a request made under paragraph (a) of this section if she feels it is necessary to do so, or, if she deems it to be in the public interest, may develop such information herself as by consultation on a one-time basis with consumers, consumer organizations, and others. The Secretary shall act expeditiously on all requests and shall notify the requester of her decision in writing. If the Secretary determines that there is no need to establish a Specification for labeling the requested consumer product performance characteristics, or because of a lack of resources, she will decline to act further on the request. In those instances where the Secretary declines a request, she shall state the reasons for so declining.
(d) If the Secretary finds that a need exists to establish a Specification for labeling a consumer product under this program, she shall publish a notice in the
Federal Register
setting out such finding and its basis and stating that she is developing a proposed Specification in accordance with § 16.5.
§ 16.5
Development of performance information labeling specifications.
(a) If the Secretary makes a finding of need pursuant to § 16.4, she will publish a proposed Performance Information Labeling Specification in the
Federal Register
with a notice giving the complete text of the proposed Specification and any other pertinent information. The notice will invite any interested person to submit written comments on the proposed Specification within 45 days after its publication in the
Federal Register,
unless another time limit is provided by the Secretary. Interested persons wanting to express their views in an informal hearing may do so, if within 15 days after the proposed Specification is published in the
Federal Register,
they request the Secretary to hold a hearing. Such informal hearings shall be held so as to give all interested persons an opportunity for the oral presentation of data, views, or arguments in addition to the opportunity to make written submissions. Notice of such hearings shall be published in the
Federal Register.
A transcript shall be kept of any oral presentations.
(b) Each Specification shall as a minimum include:
(1) A description of the performance characteristics of the consumer product covered;
(2) An identification by reference of the test methods to be used in measuring the performance characteristics. The test methods, where they exist and are deemed appropriate for inclusion in the particular Specification involved, shall be those which are described in nationally-recognized voluntary standards. Where appropriate test methods do not exist, they will be developed by the Department of Commerce in cooperation with interested parties and set out in full in the Specification;
(3) A prototype label and directions for displaying the label on or with the consumer product concerned. Such directions will not prohibit the display of additional information by the participant on space adjacent to the marked boundaries of the label; and
(4) Conditions of participation.
(c) The Secretary, after consideration of all written and oral comments and other materials received in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, shall publish in the
Federal Register
within 30 days after the final date for receipt of comments, or as soon as practicable thereafter, a notice either:
(1) Giving the complete text of a final Specification, including conditions of use, and stating that any prospective participant in the program desiring voluntarily to use the Department of Commerce Mark developed under § 16.10 must advise the Department of Commerce: or
(2) Stating that the proposed Specification will be further developed before final publication; or
(3) Withdrawing the proposed Specification from further consideration.
§ 16.6
Establishment of fees and charges.
(a) The Secretary in conjunction with the use of the Working Capital Fund of the National Institute of Standards
Technology, as authorized under section 12 of the Act of March 3, 1901, as amended (15 U.S.C. 278b), for this program, shall establish fees and charges for use of the Department of Commerce Label and Mark on each product. Such fees and charges shall be related to the number of units of products labeled, where appropriate. The fees and charges established by the Secretary, which may be revised by her when she deems it appropriate to do so, shall be in amounts calculated to make the operation of this program as self-sufficient as reasonable. A separate notice will be published in the
Federal Register
simultaneously with the notice of each proposed Specification referred to in § 16.5(a). Such notice will set out a schedule of estimated fees and charges the Secretary proposes to establish. The notice would be furnished for informational and guidance purposes only in order that the public may evaluate the proposed Specification in light of the expected fees to be charged.
(b) At such time as the Secretary publishes the notice announcing the final Specification referred to in § 16.5(c)(1), she shall simultaneously publish a separate notice in the
Federal Register
setting forth the final schedule of fees that will be charged participants in the program. The effective date of such final schedule of fees shall be the same as the date on which the final Specification takes effect.
(c) Revisions, if any, to the fees and charges established by the Secretary under paragraph (b) of this section shall be published in subsequent
Federal Register
notices and shall take effect not less than thirty (30) days after the date of publication of such notice.
(d) The establishment of fees and charges under this section may, at any time, be suspended by the Secretary for any length of time.
[42 FR 26648, May 25, 1977, as amended at 42 FR 57686, Nov. 4, 1977; 55 FR 38315, Sept. 18, 1990]

(b) The Secretary shall act expeditiously on all requests to participate in the program and shall notify each prospective participant of her decision in writing. In those instances where the Secretary declines a request, she shall state the reasons for so declining.
(c) If a prospective participant seeking to participate in the program is notified by the Secretary that she proposes to deny that prospective participant the right to participate, that prospective participant shall have thirty (30) days from the receipt of such notification to request a hearing under the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 556. The Secretary's proposed denial shall become final through the issuance of a written decision to such prospective participant in the event that he does not appeal such notification by the end of the thirty (30) day period. If however, such prospective participant requests a hearing within that thirty (30) day period, the Secretary's proposed denial shall be stayed pending the outcome of the hearing held pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 556.
(d) The conditions set out in each Specification will include, but not be limited to, the following:
(1) Prior to the use of a Label, the participant will make or have made the measurements to obtain the information required for inclusion on the Label and, if requested, will forward within 30 days such measurement data to the Secretary. Such measurement data will be kept on file by the participant or his agent for two years after that product is no longer manufactured unless otherwise provided in the Specification.
(2) The participant will describe the test results on the Label as prescribed in the Specification.
(3) The participant will display or arrange to display, in accordance with the appropriate Specification, the Label on or with each individual product of the type covered except for units exported from the U.S. Participants who utilized more than one brand name may participate by labeling some or all of the brand names. All models with the same brand name must be included in the program unless they are for export only.
(4) The participant agrees at his expense to comply with any reasonable request of the Secretary to have consumer products manufactured, assembled, imported, or privately brand labeled by him tested to determine that testing has been done according to the relevant Specification.
(5) Participants may reproduce the Department of Commerce Label and Mark in advertising:
Provided,
That the entire Label, complete with all information required to be displayed at the point of retail sale, is shown legibly and is not combined or associated directly with any other mark or logo.

Termination of participation.
(a) The Secretary upon finding that a participant is not complying with the conditions set out in these procedures or in a Specification may terminate upon 30 days notice the participant's right to continue his participation in the program:
Provided,
That the participant shall first by given an opportunity to show cause why the participation should not be terminated.
(b) Upon receipt of a notice from the Secretary of the proposed termination, which notice shall set forth the reasons for such proposed termination, the participant shall have thirty (30) days from the date of receipt of such notification to request a hearing under the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 556. The Secretary's proposed termination shall become final through the issuance of a written decision to the participant in the event such participant does not appeal the proposed termination within the thirty (30) day period. If, however, the participant requests a hearing within the thirty (30) day period, the Secretary's proposed termination shall be stayed pending the outcome of the hearing held pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 556.
(c) A participant may at any time terminate his participation and responsibilities under this program with regard to a specific type of product by giving written notice to the Secretary that he has discontinued use of the Department of Commerce Label and Mark for all consumer products of the type involved.

§ 17.1
Scope.
(a) The Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980, Public Law 96-480, as amended (codified at title 15 of the United States Code (U.S.C.), section 3701
et seq.
) (the Stevenson-Wydler Act), sets forth a national policy to renew, expand, and strengthen cooperation among academia, Federal laboratories, labor, and industry, in forms including personnel exchanges (15 U.S.C. 3701(3)). One proven method to ensure that Federal innovations are passed to industry and the public is to encourage frequent interactions among Federal laboratories, academic institutions, and industry, including both large and small businesses. In accordance with applicable ethics regulations and Agency policies, exchanges of personnel between Federal laboratories and outside collaborators should be encouraged (15 U.S.C. 3702(5)). Models that include Federal funding, as well as those that are executed without Federal funding, are encouraged.
(b) This part implements 15 U.S.C. 3712 and provides clarification regarding the appropriate use of personnel exchanges in relation to Federal laboratory Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADAs) under the authority of 15 U.S.C. 3710a.
(c) This part is applicable to exchanges of personnel between Federal laboratories and parties to a CRADA under 15 U.S.C. 3710a(a)(1).
§ 17.2
Definitions.
(a) The term
funding agreement
shall have the meaning according to it under 35 U.S.C. 201(b).
(b) The term
contractor
shall have the meaning according to it under 35 U.S.C. 201(c).
(c) The term
Federal laboratory
shall have the meaning according to it under 15 U.S.C. 3703(4).
§ 17.3
Exchange of Federal laboratory personnel with recipients of Federal funding.
(a) In accordance with 15 U.S.C. 3710a(b)(3)(A) and 3710a(d)(1), a Federal laboratory may provide personnel, services, property, and other resources to a collaborating party, with or without reimbursement (but not funds to non-Federal parties) for the conduct of specified research or development efforts under a CRADA which are consistent with the missions of the Federal laboratory. The existence of a funding agreement between a Federal laboratory and a contractor shall not preclude the Federal laboratory from using its authority under 15 U.S.C. 3710a to enter into a CRADA with the contractor as a collaborating party for the conduct of specified research or development efforts, where the director of the Federal laboratory determines that the technical subject matter of the funding agreement is sufficiently distinct from that of the CRADA. In no event shall a contractor which is a collaborating party transfer funds to a Federal laboratory under a CRADA using funds awarded to the contractor by that laboratory.
(b) (1) A Federal laboratory may enter into a CRADA with a contractor as a collaborating party for the purpose of exchange of personnel for the conduct of specified research or development efforts where the determination required under paragraph (a) of this section could not be made, provided that:
(i) The CRADA includes at least one collaborating party in addition to the Federal laboratory and that contractor; and
(ii) The Federal laboratory shall not provide services, property or other resources to that contractor under the CRADA.
(2) Where a Federal laboratory enters into a CRADA with a contractor under this paragraph (b), the terms of that contractor's funding agreement shall normally supersede the terms of the CRADA, to the extent that any individual terms conflict, as applied to
that contractor and the Federal laboratory only.
(c) In making the determination required under paragraph (a) of this section, the director of a Federal laboratory may consider factors including the following:
(1) Whether the conduct of specified research or development efforts under the CRADA would require the contractor to perform tasks identical to those required under the funding agreement;
(2) Whether existing intellectual property to be provided by the Federal laboratory or the contractor under the CRADA is the same as that provided under, or referenced in, the funding agreement;
(3) Whether the contractor's employees performing the specified research or development efforts under the CRADA are the same employees performing the tasks required under the funding agreement; and
(4) Whether services, property or other resources contemplated by the Federal laboratory to be provided to the contractor for the specified research or development efforts under the CRADA would materially benefit the contractor in the performance of tasks required under the funding agreement.
§ 17.4
Personnel exchanges from a Federal laboratory.
(a) For personnel exchanges in which a Federal laboratory maintains funding for Federal personnel provided to a collaborating party—
(1) in accordance with 15 U.S.C. 3710a(b)(3)(A), a Federal laboratory may exchange personnel with a collaborating party for the purposes of specified scientific or technical research towards a mutual goal consistent with the mission of the Agency, where no invention currently exists, or
(2) in accordance with 15 U.S.C. 3710a(b)(3)(C), a Federal laboratory may exchange personnel with a non-Federal collaborating party for the purposes of developing or commercializing an invention in which the Federal government has an ownership interest, including an invention made by an employee or former employee while in the employment or service of the Federal government, and such personnel exchanged may include such employee who is an inventor.
(i) Funding may be provided under a CRADA by the non-Federal collaborating party to the Federal laboratory for the participation of the Federal employee in developing or commercializing an invention, including costs for salary and other expenses, such as benefits and travel.
(ii) Royalties from inventions received through a license agreement negotiated with the Federal laboratory and paid by the Federal laboratory to an inventor who is a Federal employee are considered Federal compensation.
(3) Where an employee leaves Federal service in order to receive salary or other compensation from a non-Federal organization, a Federal laboratory may use reinstatement authority in accordance with 5 CFR 315.401, or other applicable authorities, to rehire the former Federal employee at the conclusion of the exchange.
§ 17.5
Personnel exchanges to a Federal laboratory.
For exchanges in which a Federal laboratory provides funds for the non-federal personnel—
(a) Outside personnel with expertise in scientific commercialization may be brought in to a Federal laboratory through the Presidential Innovation Fellows program or related programs (see 5 CFR 213.3102(r)) for Entrepreneur-In-Residence programs or similar, related programs run by the General Services Administration (GSA) or other Federal Agencies.
(b) A laboratory may engage with the GSA or other relevant Agency to transfer funding for exchanged personnel, and may work with such agency to select and place Entrepreneurs-In-Residence at the laboratory for the purposes of evaluating the laboratory's technologies, and providing technical consulting to facilitate readying a technology for commercialization by an outside entity.

# General Provisions
§ 18.1
Purpose of these rules.
The Equal Access to Justice Act, 5 U.S.C. 504 (called “the Act” in this part), provides for the award of attorney fees and other expenses to eligible individuals and entities who are parties to certain administrative proceedings (called “adversary adjudications”) before the Department of Commerce (the word Department includes its component agencies). An eligible party may receive an award when it prevails over the Department, unless the Department's position in the proceeding was substantially justified or special circumstances make an award unjust. The rules in this part describe the parties that are eligible for awards and the Department's proceedings that are covered by the Act. They also explain how to apply for awards, and the procedures and standards that the Department will use to make them.
§ 18.2
Definitions.
As used in this part:
(a)
Adversary adjudication
means an adjudication under 5 U.S.C. 554 in which the position of the United States is represented by counsel or otherwise, but excludes an adjudication for the purpose of establishing or fixing a rate or for the purpose of granting or renewing a license.
(b)
Adjudicative officer
means the official, without regard to whether the official is designated as an administrative law judge, a hearing officer or examiner, or otherwise, who presided at the adversary adjudication.
§ 18.3
When the Act applies.
The Act applies to any adversary adjudication pending or commenced before the Department on or after August 5, 1985. It also applies to any adversary adjudication commenced on or after October 1, 1984, and finally disposed of before August 5, 1985, provided that an application for fees and expenses, as described in §§ 18.11 through 18.14 of this part, has been filed with the Department within 30 days after August 5, 1985, and to any adversary adjudication pending on or commenced on or after October 1, 1981, in which an application for fees and other expenses was timely filed and was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.
[53 FR 6798, Mar. 3, 1988]
§ 18.4
Proceedings covered.
(a) The Act applies to adversary adjudications conducted by the Department and to appeals of decisions of contracting officers of the Department made pursuant to section 6 of the Contract Disputes Act of 1978 (41 U.S.C. 605) before agency boards of contract appeals as provided in section 8 of that Act (41 U.S.C. 607). Adversary adjudications conducted by the Department are adjudications under 5 U.S.C. 554 in which the position of this or any other agency of the United States, or any component of an agency, is presented by an attorney or other representative who enters an appearance and participates in the proceeding. Pursuant to section 8(c) of the Contract Disputes Act (41 U.S.C. 607(c)), the Department has arranged for appeals from decisions by contracting officers of the Department to be decided by the General
Services Administration Board of Contract Appeals. This Board, in accordance with its own procedures, shall be responsible for making determinations on applications pursuant to the Act relating to appeals to the Board from decisions of contracting officers of the Department. Such determinations are final, subject to appeal under § 18.23. Any proceeding in which the Department may prescribe a lawful present or future rate is not covered by the Act. Proceedings to grant or renew licenses are also excluded, but proceedings to modify, suspend, or revoke licenses are covered if they are otherwise “adversary adjudications.” The Department proceedings covered are:
(1)
Department-wide.
(i) Title VI Civil Rights hearings conducted by the Department under 42 U.S.C. 2000d-1 and 15 CFR 8.12(d).
(ii) Handicap discrimination hearings conducted by the Department under 29 U.S.C. 794(a) and 15 CFR 8.12(d).
(2) National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (“NOAA”)
(i) Proceedings concerning suspension, revocation, or modification of a permit or license issued by NOAA.
(ii) Proceedings to assess civil penalties under any of the statutes administered by NOAA.
(3)
International Trade Administration.
Enforcement proceedings under the AntiBoycott provisions of the Export Administration Act of 1979, 50 U.S.C. app. 2407.
(4)
Patent and Trademark Office.
Disbarment proceedings of attorneys and agents under 35 U.S.C. 32.
(b) The Department may also designate a proceeding not listed in paragraph (a) of this section as an adversary adjudication for purposes of the Act by so stating in an order initiating the proceeding or designating the matter for hearing. The Department's failure to designate a proceeding as an adversary adjudication shall not preclude the filing of an application by a party who believes the proceeding is covered by the Act; whether the proceeding is covered will then be an issue for resolution in proceedings on the application.
(c) If a proceeding includes both matters covered by the Act and matters specifically excluded from coverage, any award made will include only fees and expenses related to covered issues.
[47 FR 13510, Mar. 31, 1982, as amended at 53 FR 6798, Mar. 3, 1988]
§ 18.5
Eligibility of applicants.
(a) To be eligible for an award of attorney fees and other expenses under the Act, the applicant must be a party to the adversary adjudication for which it seeks an award. The term “party” is defined in 5 U.S.C. 551(3). The applicant must show that it meets all conditions of eligibility set out in this part.
(b) The types of eligible applicants are as follows:
(1) An individual with a net worth of not more than $2 million;
(2) The sole owner of an unincorporated business who has a net worth of not more than $7 million, including both personal and business interests, and not more than 500 employees;
(3) A charitable or other tax-exempt organization described in section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3)) with not more than 500 employees;
(4) A cooperative association as defined in section 15(a) of the Agricultural Marketing Act (12 U.S.C. 1141j(a)) with not more than 500 employees; and
(5) Any other partnership, corporation, association, unit of local government, or organization with a net worth of not more than $7 million and not more than 500 employees.
(c) For the purpose of eligibility, the net worth and number of employees of an applicant shall be determined as of the date the proceeding was initiated.
(d) An applicant who owns an unincorporated business will be considered as an “individual” rather than a “sole owner of an unincorporated business” if the issues on which the applicant prevails are related primarily to personal interests rather than to business interests.
(e) The employees of an applicant include all persons who regularly perform services for remuneration for the applicant, under the applicant's direction and control. Part-time employees shall be included on a proportional basis.
(f) The net worth and number of employees of the applicant and all of its
affiliates shall be aggregated to determine eligibility. Any individual, corporation or other entity that directly or indirectly controls or owns a majority of the voting shares or other interest of the applicant, or any corporation or other entity of which the applicant directly or indirectly owns or controls a majority of the voting shares or other interest, will be considered an affiliate for purposes of this part, unless the adjudicative officer determines that such treatment would be unjust and contrary to the purposes of the Act in light of the actual relationship between the affiliated entities. In addition, the adjudicative officer may determine that financial relationships of the applicant other than those described in this paragraph constitute special circumstances that would make an award unjust.
(g) An applicant that participates in a proceeding primarily on behalf of one or more other persons or entities that would be ineligible is not itself eligible for an award.
[47 FR 13510, Mar. 31, 1982, as amended at 53 FR 6798, Mar. 3, 1988]
§ 18.6
Standards for awards.
(a) A prevailing applicant may receive an award for fees and expenses incurred in connection with a proceeding, or in a significant and discrete substantive portion of the proceedings, unless the position of the Department over which the applicant has prevailed was substantially justified. The position of the Department includes, in addition to the position taken by the Department in the adversary adjudication, the action or failure to act by the Department upon which the adversary adjudication is based. The burden of proof that an award should not be made to an eligible prevailing applicant because the Department's position was substantially justified is on the agency counsel.
(b) An award will be reduced or denied if the applicant has unduly or unreasonably protracted the proceeding or if special circumstances make the award sought unjust.
[47 FR 13510, Mar. 31, 1982, as amended at 53 FR 6799, Mar. 3, 1988]
§ 18.7
Allowable fees and expenses.
(a) Awards will be based on rates customarily charged by persons engaged in the business of acting as attorneys, agents and expert witnesses, even if the services were made available without charge or at a reduced rate to the applicant.
(b) No award for the fee of an attorney or agent under this rule may exceed $75.00 per hour. No award to compensate an expert witness may exceed the highest rate at which the Department pays expert witnesses. However, an award may also include the reasonable expenses of the attorney, agent, or witness as a separate item, if the attorney, agent, or witness ordinarily charges clients separately for such expenses.
(c) In determining the reasonableness of the fee sought for an attorney, agent, or expert witness, the adjudicative officer shall consider the following:
(1) If the attorney, agent, or witness is in private practice, his or her customary fee for similar services, or, if an employee of the applicant, the fully allocated cost of the services;
(2) The prevailing rate for similar services in the community in which the attorney, agent or witness ordinarily performs services;
(3) The time actually spent in the representation of the applicant;
(4) The time reasonably spent in light of the difficulty or complexity of the issues in the proceedings; and
(5) Such other factors as may bear on the value of the services provided.
(d) The reasonable cost of any study, analysis, engineering report, test, project, or similar matter prepared on behalf of a party may be awarded, to the extent that the charge for the service does not exceed the prevailing rate for similar services, and the study or other matter was necessary for preparation of the applicant's case.
[47 FR 13510, Mar. 31, 1982, as amended at 53 FR 6799, Mar. 3, 1988]
§ 18.8
Rulemaking on maximum rates for attorney fees.
(a) If warranted by an increase in the cost of living or by special circumstances (such as limited availability of attorneys qualified to handle certain types of proceedings), the Department may adopt regulations providing that attorney fees may be awarded at a rate higher than the ceiling set forth in § 18.7(b) in some or all of the types of proceedings covered by this part. The Department will conduct any rulemaking proceedings for this purpose under the informal rulemaking procedures of the Administrative Procedure Act.
(b) Any person may file with the Department a petition for rulemaking to increase the maximum rate for attorney fees. The petition should be sent to the General Counsel, Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, Room 5870, Washington, D.C. 20230. The petition should identify the rate the petitioner believes the Department should establish and the types of proceedings in which the rate should be used. It should also explain fully the reasons why higher rate is warranted. The Department will respond to the petition within 60 days after it is filed, by initiating a rulemaking proceeding, denying the petition, or taking other appropriate action.
§ 18.9
Awards against other agencies.
If an applicant is entitled to an award because it prevailed over another agency of the United States that participated in a proceeding before the Department and took a position that was not substantially justified, the award or an appropriate portion of the award shall be made against that agency.
§ 18.10
Delegations of authority.
The Secretary delegates to the General Counsel the authority to take final action on matters pertaining to the Act.

# Information Required from Applicants
§ 18.11
Contents of application.
(a) An application for an award of fees and expenses under the Act shall identify the applicant and the proceeding for which an award is sought. The application shall show that the applicant has prevailed and identify the position of the Department or other agency in the proceeding that the applicant alleges was not substantially justified. Unless the applicant is an individual, the application shall also state the number of employees of the applicant and describe briefly the type and purpose of its organization or business.
(b) The application shall also include a statement that the applicant's net worth does not exceed $2 million (if an individual) or $7 million (for all other applicants, including their affiliates). However, an applicant may omit this statement if:
(1) It attaches a copy of a ruling by the Internal Revenue Service that it qualifies as an organization described in section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3)), or, in the case of a tax-exempt organization not required to obtain a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service on its exempt status, a statement that describes the basis for the applicant's belief that it qualifies under such section; or
(2) It states that it is a cooperative association as defined in section 15(a) of the Agricultural Marketing Act (12 U.S.C. 1141j(a)) and includes a copy of its charter or articles of incorporation.
(c) The application shall state the amount of fees and expenses for which an award is sought.
(d) The application may also include any other matters that the applicant wishes the adjudicative officer to consider in determining whether and in what amount an award should be made.
(e) The application shall be signed by the applicant or an authorized officer or attorney of the applicant. It shall also contain or be accompanied by a written verification under oath or
under penalty of perjury that the information provided in the application is true and correct.
[47 FR 13510, Mar. 31, 1982, as amended at 53 FR 6799, Mar. 3, 1988]
§ 18.12
Net worth exhibit.
(a) Each applicant except a qualified tax-exempt organization or cooperative association must provide with its application a detailed exhibit showing the net worth of the applicant and any affiliates (as defined in § 18.5(f) of this part) when the proceeding was initiated. Unless regulations issued by a component of the Department establish particular requirements, the exhibit may be in any form convenient to the applicant that provides full disclosure of the applicant's and its affiliates' assets and liabilities and is sufficient to determine whether the applicant qualifies under the standards in this part. The adjudicative officer may require an applicant to file additional information to determine its eligibility for an award.
(b) Ordinarily, the net worth exhibit will be included in the public record of the proceeding. However, an applicant that objects to public disclosure of information in any portion of the exhibit and believes there are legal grounds for withholding it from disclosure may submit that portion of the exhibit directly to the adjudicative officer in a sealed envelope labeled “Confidential Financial Information,” accompanied by a motion to withhold the information from public disclosure. The motion shall describe the information sought to be withheld and explain, in detail, why it falls within one or more of the specific exemptions from mandatory disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(1)-(9), why public disclosure of the information would adeversely affect the applicant, and why disclosure is not required in the public interest. The material in question shall be served on counsel representing the agency against which the applicant seeks an award, but need not be served on any other party to the proceeding. If the adjudicative officer finds that the information should not be withheld from disclosure, it shall be placed in the public record of the proceeding. Otherwise, any request to inspect or copy the exhibit shall be disposed of in accordance with the Department's established procedures under the Freedom of Information Act (15 CFR Part 4).
[47 FR 13510, Mar. 31, 1982, as amended at 53 FR 6799, Mar. 3, 1988]
§ 18.13
Documentation of fees and expenses.
The application shall be accompanied by full documentation of the fees and expenses, including the cost of any study, analysis, engineering report, test, project, or similar matter for which an award is sought. A separate itemized statement shall be submitted for each professional firm or individual whose services are covered by the application, showing the hours spent in connection with the proceeding by each individual, a description of the specific services performed, the rate at which each fee has been computed, any expenses for which reimbursement is sought, the total amount claimed, and the total amount paid or payable by the applicant or by any other person or entity for the services provided. The adjudicative officer may require the applicant to provide vouchers, receipts, or other substantiation for any expenses claimed.
§ 18.14
When an application may be filed.
(a) An application may be filed whenever the applicant has prevailed in the proceeding or in a significant and discrete substantive portion of the proceeding, but in no case later than 30 days after the Department's final disposition of the proceeding.
(b) For purposes of this rule, final disposition means the date on which a decision or order disposing of the merits of the proceeding or any other complete resolution of the proceeding, such as a settlement or voluntary dismissal, becomes final and unappealable, both within the agency and to the courts.
(c) If review or reconsideration is sought or taken of a decision as to which an applicant believes it has prevailed, proceedings for the award of fees shall be stayed pending final disposition of the underlying controversy.
When the United States appeals the underlying merits of an adversary adjudication to a court, no decision on an application for fees and other expenses in connection with that adversary adjudication shall be made until a final and unreviewable decision is rendered by the court on the appeal or until the underlying merits of the case have been finally determined pursuant to the appeal.
[47 FR 13510, Mar. 31, 1982, as amended at 53 FR 6799, Mar. 3, 1988]

# Procedures for Considering Applications
§ 18.15
Filing and service of documents.
Any application for an award or other pleading or document related to an application shall be filed and served on all parties to the proceeding in the same manner as other pleadings in the proceeding, except as provided in § 18.12(b) for confidential financial information.
§ 18.16
Answer to application.
(a) Within 30 calendar days after service of an application, counsel representing the agency against which an award is sought may file an answer to the application. Unless agency counsel requests an extension of time for filing (an extension for an additional 30 days is available as a matter of right) or files a statement of intent to negotiate under paragraph (b) of this section, failure to file an answer within the 30 calendar day period may be treated as a consent to the award requested.
(b) If agency counsel and the applicant believe that the issues in the fee application can be settled, they may jointly file a statement of their intent to negotiate a settlement. The filing of this statement shall extend the time for filing an answer for an additional 30 days, and further extensions may be granted by the adjudicative officer upon request by agency counsel and the applicant.
(c) The answer shall explain in detail any objections to the award requested and identify the facts relied on in support of the agency counsel's position. If the answer is based on any alleged facts not already in the record of the proceeding, agency counsel shall include with the answer either supporting affidavits or a request for further proceedings under § 18.20.
[47 FR 13510, Mar. 31, 1982, as amended at 53 FR 6799, Mar. 3, 1988]
§ 18.17
Reply.
Within 15 calendar days after service of an answer, the applicant may file a reply. If the reply is based on any alleged facts not already in the record of the proceeding, the applicant shall include with the reply either supporting affidavits or a request for further proceedings under § 18.20.
§ 18.18
Comments by other parties.
Any party to a proceeding other than the applicant and the agency counsel may file comments on an application within 30 calendar days after it is served or on an answer within 15 calendar days after it is served. A commenting party may not participate further in proceedings on the application unless the adjudicative officer determines that the public interest requires such participation in order to permit full exploration of matters raised in the comments.
[47 FR 13510, Mar. 31, 1982, as amended at 53 FR 6799, Mar. 3, 1988]
§ 18.19
Settlement.
The applicant and agency counsel may agree on a proposed settlement of the award before final action on the application, either in connection with a settlement of the underlying proceeding, or after the underlying proceeding has been concluded, in accordance with the component agency's standard settlement procedure. If a prevailing party and agency counsel agree on a proposed settlement of an award before an application has been filed, the application shall be filed with the proposed settlement.
[47 FR 13510, Mar. 31, 1982, as amended at 53 FR 6799, Mar. 3, 1988]
§ 18.20
Further proceedings.
(a) Ordinarily, the determination of an award will be made on the basis of the written record. However, on request of either the applicant or agency counsel, or on his or her own initiative,
the adjudicative officer may order further proceedings, such as an informal conference, oral argument, additional written submissions or, as to issues other than substantial justification (such as the applicant's eligibility or substantiation of fees and expenses), pertinent discovery or an evidentiary hearing. Such further proceedings shall be held only when necessary for full and fair resolution of the issues arising from the application, and shall be conducted as promptly as possible. Whether or not the position of the agency was substantially justified shall be determined on the basis of the administrative record, as a whole, which is made in the adversary adjudication for which fees and other expenses are sought.
(b) A request that the adjudicative officer order further proceedings under this section shall specifically identify the information sought or the disputed issues and shall explain why the additional proceedings are necessary to resolve the issues.
[47 FR 13510, Mar. 31, 1982, as amended at 53 FR 6799, Mar. 3, 1988]
§ 18.21
Decision.
The adjudicative officer shall issue an initial decision on the application within 30 calendar days after completion of proceedings on the application. The initial decision of the adjudicative officer shall include written findings and conclusions on the applicant's eligibility and status as a prevailing party, and an explanation of the reasons for any difference between the amount requested and the amount awarded. The decision shall also include, if at issue, findings on whether the Department's position was substantially justified, whether the applicant unduly protracted the proceedings, or whether special circumstances make an award unjust. If the applicant has sought an award against more than one agency, the decision shall allocate responsibility for payment of any award made among the agencies, and shall explain the reasons for the allocation made.
[47 FR 13510, Mar. 31, 1982, as amended at 53 FR 6799, Mar. 3, 1988]
§ 18.22
Agency review.
Either the applicant or agency counsel may file a petition for review of the initial decision on the fee application, or the Department may decide to review the decision on its own initiative. The petition must be filed with the General Counsel, Office of the Assistant General Counsel for Administration, Rm. 5882, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20230, not later than 30 calendar days after the initial decision is issued. For purposes of this section, a document will be considered filed with the General Counsel as of the date of the postmark (or for government penalty mail, as shown by a certificate of mailing), if mailed, or if not mailed, as of the date actually delivered to the Office of General Counsel. A petition for review must be accompanied by a full written statement in support thereof, including a precise statement of why the petitioner believes the initial decision should be reversed or modified, and proof of service upon all parties. A response to the petition may be filed by another party to the proceeding and must be filed with the General Counsel at the above address not more than 30 calendar days after the date of service of the petition for review. The General Counsel may request any further submissions deemed helpful in resolving the petition for review. If neither the applicant nor agency counsel seeks review and the Department does not take review on its own initiative, the initial decision on the application shall become a final decision of the Department 30 calendar days after it is issued. Whether to review a decision is a matter within the discretion of the General Counsel. If review is taken, the General Counsel will issue the Department's final decision on the application or remand the application to the adjudicative officer for further proceedings. The standard of review exercised by the General Counsel shall be that which was required for the highest level of Departmental review which could have been exercised on the underlying covered proceeding.
[53 FR 6799, Mar. 3, 1988]
§ 18.23
Judicial review.
Judicial review of final agency decisions on awards may be sought as provided in 5 U.S.C. 504(c)(2).
§ 18.24
Payment of award.
An applicant seeking payment of an award by the Department shall submit a copy of the final decision granting the award, accompanied by a certification that the applicant will not seek review of the decision in the United States courts to the General Counsel, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, NW., Room 5870, Washington, D.C. 20230. The Department will pay the amount awarded to the applicant within 60 calendar days, unless judicial review of the award or of the underlying decision of the adversary adjudication has been sought by the applicant or any other party to the proceeding.

Why did the Commerce Department issue these regulations and what do they cover?
(a)
Scope.
This part provides procedures for the collection of Commerce Department debts.

Applicability.
(1) This part applies to Commerce Department when collecting a Commerce Department debt, to persons who owe Commerce Department debts, to persons controlled by or controlling persons who owe Federal agency debts, and to Federal agencies requesting offset of a payment issued by Commerce Department as a payment agency (including salary payments to Commerce Department employees).
(2) This part does not apply to tax debts nor to any debt for which there is an indication of fraud or misrepresentation, as described in section 900.3 of the FCCS, unless the debt is returned by the Department of Justice to Commerce Department for handling.
(3) Nothing in this part precludes collection or disposition of any debt under statutes and regulations other than those described in this part.
See,
for example, 5 U.S.C. 5705, Advancements and Deductions, which authorizes Commerce entities to recover travel advances by offset of up to 100 percent of a Federal employee's accrued pay.
See,
also, 5 U.S.C. 4108, governing the collection of training expenses. To the extent that the provisions of laws, other regulations, and Commerce Department enforcement policies differ from the provisions of this part, those provisions of law, other regulations, and Commerce Department enforcement policies apply to the remission or mitigation of fines, penalties, and forfeitures, and to debts arising under the tariff laws of the United States, rather than the provisions of this part.
(c)
Additional policies and procedures.
Commerce entities may, but are not required to, promulgate additional policies and procedures consistent with this part, the FCCS, and other applicable Federal law, policies, and procedures, subject to the approval of Deputy Chief Financial Officer.
(d)
Duplication not required.
Nothing in this part requires a Commerce entity to duplicate notices or administrative proceedings required by contract, this part, or other laws or regulations, including but not limited to those required by financial assistance awards such as grants, cooperative agreements, loans or loan guarantees.
(e)
Use of multiple collection remedies allowed.
Commerce entities and other Federal agencies may simultaneously use multiple collection remedies to collect a debt, except as prohibited by law. This part is intended to promote aggressive debt collection, using for each debt all available and appropriate collection remedies. These remedies are not listed in any prescribed order to provide Commerce entities with flexibility in determining which remedies will be most efficient in collecting the particular debt.
§ 19.3
Do these regulations adopt the Federal Claims Collection Standards (FCCS)?
This part adopts and incorporates all provisions of the FCCS (31 CFR Chapter IX parts 900-904). This part also supplements the FCCS by prescribing procedures consistent with the FCCS, as necessary and appropriate for Commerce Department operations.

(c)
Respond to debtors; comply with FCCS.
Commerce entities should respond promptly to communications from debtors and comply with other FCCS provisions applicable to the administrative collection of debts.
See
31 CFR part 901.
§ 19.5
How will Commerce entities add interest, penalty charges, and administrative costs to a Commerce debt?
(a)
Assessment and notice.
Commerce entities shall assess interest, penalties and administrative costs on Commerce debts in accordance with the provisions of 31 U.S.C. 3717 and 31 CFR 901.9. Interest shall be charged in accordance with the requirements of 31 U.S.C. 3717(a). Penalties shall accrue at a rate of not more than 6% per year or such other higher rate as authorized by law. Administrative costs, that is, the costs of processing and handling a delinquent debt, shall be determined by the Commerce entity collecting the debt, as directed by the Office of the Deputy Chief Financial Officer. Commerce entities may have additional policies regarding how interest, penalties, and administrative costs are assessed on particular types of debts, subject to the approval of the Deputy Chief Financial Officer. Commerce entities are required to explain in the notice to the debtor described in § 19.4 of this part how interest, penalties, costs, and other charges are assessed, unless the requirements are included in a contract or other legally binding agreement.
(b)
Waiver of interest, penalties, and administrative costs.
Unless otherwise required by law or contract, Commerce entities may not charge interest if the amount due on the Commerce debt is paid within 30 days after the date from which the interest accrues.
See
31 U.S.C. 3717(d). Commerce entities may, with legal counsel approval, waive interest, penalties, and administrative costs, or any portion thereof, when it would be against equity and good conscience or not in the United States' best interest to collect such charges, in accordance with Commerce guidelines for such waivers. (
See
Commerce Department Credit and Debt Management Operating Standards and Procedures Handbook, available at
http://www.osec.doc.gov/ofm/credit/cover.html.)
(c)
Accrual during suspension of debt collection.
In most cases, interest, penalties and administrative costs will continue to accrue during any period when collection has been suspended for any reason (for example, when the debtor has requested a hearing). Commerce entities may suspend accrual of any or all of these charges when accrual would be against equity and good conscience or not in the United States' best interest, in accordance with Commerce guidelines for such waivers. (
See
Commerce Department Credit and Debt Management Operating Standards and Procedures Handbook, available at
http://www.osec.doc.gov/ofm/credit.cover.html.
)
§ 19.6
When will Commerce entities allow a debtor to pay a Commerce debt in installments instead of one lump sum?
If a debtor is financially unable to pay the Commerce debt in one lump sum, a Commerce entity may accept payment of a Commerce debt in regular installments, in accordance with the provisions of 31 CFR 901.8 and the Commerce entity's policies and procedures.
§ 19.7
When will Commerce entities compromise a Commerce debt?
If a Commerce entity cannot collect the full amount of a Commerce debt, the Commerce entity may, with legal counsel approval, compromise the Commerce debt in accordance with the provisions of 31 CFR part 902 and the Commerce entity's policies and procedures. (
See
Commerce Department Credit and Debt Management Operating Standards and Procedures Handbook, available at
http://www.osec.doc.gov/ofm/credit.cover.html.
)
§ 19.8
When will Commerce entities suspend or terminate debt collection on a Commerce debt?
If, after pursuing all appropriate means of collection, a Commerce entity determines that a Commerce debt is uncollectible, the Commerce entity may, with legal counsel approval, suspend or terminate debt collection activity in accordance with the provisions of 31 CFR part 903 and the Commerce entity's policies and procedures. Termination of debt collection activity by a Commerce entity does not discharge the indebtedness. (
See
Commerce Department Credit and Debt Management Operating Standards and Procedures Handbook, available at
http://www.osec.doc.gov/ofm/credit/cover.html.
)
§ 19.9
When will Commerce entities transfer a Commerce debt to the Treasury Department's Bureau of the Fiscal Service for collection?
(a) Commerce entities will transfer any Commerce debt that is more than 120 days delinquent to the Bureau of the Fiscal Service for debt collection services, a process known as “cross-servicing.”
See
31 U.S.C. 3711(g), 31 CFR 285.12, and 31 U.S.C. 3716(c)(6). Commerce entities may transfer Commerce debts delinquent 120 days or less to the Bureau of the Fiscal Service in accordance with the procedures described in 31 CFR 285.12. The Bureau of the Fiscal Service takes appropriate action to collect or compromise the transferred Commerce debt, or to suspend or terminate collection action thereon, in accordance with the statutory and regulatory requirements and authorities applicable to the Commerce debt and the collection action to be taken.
See
31 CFR 285.12(b) and 285.12(c)(2). Appropriate action can include, but is not limited to, contact with the debtor, referral of the Commerce debt to the Treasury Offset Program, private collection agencies or the Department of Justice, reporting of the Commerce debt to credit bureaus, and administrative wage garnishment.
(b) At least sixty (60) days prior to transferring a Commerce debt to the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, Commerce entities will send notice to the debtor as required by § 19.4 of this part. Commerce entities will certify to the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, in writing, that the Commerce debt is valid, delinquent, legally enforceable, and that there are no legal bars to collection. In addition, Commerce entities will certify their compliance with all applicable due process and other requirements as described in this part and other Federal laws.
See
31 CFR 285.12(i) regarding the certification requirement.
(c) As part of its debt collection process, the Bureau of the Fiscal Service uses the Treasury Offset Program to collect Commerce debts by administrative and tax refund offset.
See
31 CFR 285.12(g). The Treasury Offset Program is a centralized offset program administered by the Bureau of the Fiscal Service to collect delinquent debts owed to Federal agencies and states (including past-due child support). Under the Treasury Offset Program, before a Federal payment is disbursed, the Bureau of the Fiscal Service compares the name and taxpayer identification number (TIN) of the payee with the names and TINs of debtors that have been submitted by Federal agencies and states to the Treasury Offset Program database. If there is a match, the Bureau of the Fiscal Service (or, in some cases, another Federal disbursing agency) offsets all or a portion of the Federal payment, disburses any remaining payment to the payee, and pays the offset amount to the creditor agency. Federal payments eligible for offset include, but are not limited to, income tax refunds, salary, travel advances and reimbursements, retirement and vendor payments, and Social Security and other benefit payments.
§ 19.10
How will Commerce entities use administrative offset (offset of non-tax Federal payments) to collect a Commerce debt?
(a)
Centralized administrative offset through the Treasury Offset Program.
(1) In most cases, the Bureau of the Fiscal Service uses the Treasury Offset Program to collect Commerce debts by the offset of Federal payments.
See
§ 19.9(c) of this part. If not already transferred to the Bureau of the Fiscal Service under § 19.9 of this part, Commerce entities will refer Commerce debt over 120 days delinquent to the Treasury Offset Program for collection by centralized administrative offset.
See
31 U.S.C. 3716(c)(6); 31 CFR part 285, subpart A; and 31 CFR 901.3(b). Commerce entities may refer to the Treasury Offset Program for offset any Commerce debt that has been delinquent for 120 days or less.
(2) At least sixty (60) days prior to referring a Commerce debt to the Treasury Offset Program, in accordance with paragraph (a)(1) of this section, Commerce entities will send notice to the debtor in accordance with the requirements of § 19.4 of this part. Commerce entities will certify to the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, in writing, that the Commerce debt is valid, delinquent, legally enforceable, and that there are no
legal bars to collection by offset. In addition, Commerce entities will certify their compliance with the requirements described in this part.
(b)
Non-centralized administrative offset for Commerce debts.
(1) When centralized administrative offset through the Treasury Offset Program is not available or appropriate, Commerce entities may collect past-due, legally enforceable Commerce debts through non-centralized administrative offset.
See
31 CFR 901.3(c). In these cases, Commerce entities may offset a payment internally or make an offset request directly to a Federal payment agency. If the Federal payment agency is another Commerce entity, the Commerce entity making the request shall do so through the Deputy Chief Financial Officer as described in § 19.20(c) of this part.
(2) At least thirty (30) days prior to offsetting a payment internally or requesting a Federal payment agency to offset a payment, Commerce entities will send notice to the debtor in accordance with the requirements of § 19.4 of this part. When referring a Commerce debt for offset under this paragraph (b), Commerce entities making the request will certify, in writing, that the Commerce debt is valid, delinquent, legally enforceable, and that there are no legal bars to collection by offset. In addition, Commerce entities will certify their compliance with these regulations concerning administrative offset.
See
31 CFR 901.3(c)(2)(ii).
(c)
Administrative review.
The notice described in § 19.4 of this part shall explain to the debtor how to request an administrative review of a Commerce entity's determination that the debtor owes a Commerce debt and how to present evidence that the Commerce debt is not delinquent or legally enforceable. In addition to challenging the existence and amount of the Commerce debt, the debtor may seek a review of the terms of repayment. In most cases, Commerce entities will provide the debtor with a “paper hearing” based upon a review of the written record, including documentation provided by the debtor. Commerce entities shall provide the debtor with a reasonable opportunity for an oral hearing when the debtor requests reconsideration of the Commerce debt and the Commerce entity determines that the question of the indebtedness cannot be resolved by review of the documentary evidence, for example, when the validity of the Commerce debt turns on an issue of credibility or veracity. Unless otherwise required by law, an oral hearing under this section is not required to be a formal evidentiary hearing, although Commerce entities should carefully document all significant matters discussed at the hearing. Commerce entities may suspend collection through administrative offset and/or other collection actions pending the resolution of a debtor's dispute.
(d)
Procedures for expedited offset.
Under the circumstances described in 31 CFR 901.3(b)(4)(iii), Commerce entities may, with legal counsel approval, effect an offset against a payment to be made to the debtor prior to sending a notice to the debtor, as described in § 19.4 of this part, or completing the procedures described in paragraph (b)(2) and (c) of this section. Commerce entities shall give the debtor notice and an opportunity for review as soon as practicable and promptly refund any money ultimately found not to have been owed to the Government. (
See
Commerce Department Credit and Debt Management Operating Standards and Procedures Handbook, available at
http://www.osec.doc.gov/ofm/credit.cover.html.
)
§ 19.11
How will Commerce entities use tax refund offset to collect a Commerce debt?
(a)
Tax refund offset.
In most cases, the Bureau of the Fiscal Service uses the Treasury Offset Program to collect Commerce debts by the offset of tax refunds and other Federal payments.
See
§ 19.9(c) of this part. If not already transferred to the Bureau of the Fiscal Service under § 19.9 of this part, Commerce entities will refer to the Treasury Offset Program any past-due, legally enforceable Commerce debt for collection by tax refund offset.
See
26 U.S.C. 6402(d), 31 U.S.C. 3720A and 31 CFR 285.2.
(b)
Notice.
At least sixty (60) days prior to referring a Commerce debt to the Treasury Offset Program, Commerce entities will send notice to the
debtor in accordance with the requirements of § 19.4 of this part. Commerce entities will certify to the Bureau of the Fiscal Service's Treasury Offset Program, in writing, that the Commerce debt is past due and legally enforceable in the amount submitted and that the Commerce entities have made reasonable efforts to obtain payment of the Commerce debt as described in 31 CFR 285.2(d). In addition, Commerce entities will certify their compliance with all applicable due process and other requirements described in this part and other Federal laws.
See
31 U.S.C. 3720A(b) and 31 CFR 285.2.
(c)
Administrative review.
The notice described in § 19.4 of this part shall provide the debtor with at least 60 days prior to the initiation of tax refund offset to request an administrative review as described in § 19.10(c) of this part. Commerce entities may suspend collection through tax refund offset and/or other collection actions pending the resolution of the debtor's dispute.
§ 19.12
How will Commerce entities offset a Federal employee's salary to collect a Commerce debt?
(a)
Federal salary offset.
(1) Salary offset is used to collect debts owed to the United States by Commerce Department and other Federal employees. If a Federal employee owes a Commerce debt, Commerce entities may offset the employee's Federal salary to collect the Commerce debt in the manner described in this section. For information on how a Federal agency other than a Commerce entity may collect debt from the salary of a Commerce Department employee,
see
§§ 19.20 and 19.21, subpart C, of this part.
(2) Nothing in this part requires a Commerce entity to collect a Commerce debt in accordance with the provisions of this section if Federal law allows otherwise.
See,
for example, 5 U.S.C. 5705 (travel advances not used for allowable travel expenses are recoverable from the employee or his estate by setoff against accrued pay and other means) and 5 U.S.C. 4108 (recovery of training expenses).
(3) Commerce entities may use the administrative wage garnishment procedure described in § 19.13 of this part to collect a Commerce debt from an individual's non-Federal wages.
(b)
Centralized salary offset through the Treasury Offset Program.
As described in § 19.9(a) of this part, Commerce entities will refer Commerce debts to the Bureau of the Fiscal Service for collection by administrative offset, including salary offset, through the Treasury Offset Program. When possible, Commerce entities should attempt salary offset through the Treasury Offset Program before applying the procedures in paragraph (c) of this section.
See
5 CFR 550.1108 and 550.1109.
(c)
Non-centralized salary offset for Commerce debts.
When centralized salary offset through the Treasury Offset Program is not available or appropriate, Commerce entities may collect delinquent Commerce debts through non-centralized salary offset.
See
5 CFR 550.1109. In these cases, Commerce entities may offset a payment internally or make a request directly to a Federal payment agency to offset a salary payment to collect a delinquent Commerce debt owed by a Federal employee. If the Federal payment agency is another Commerce entity, the Commerce entity making the request shall do so through the Deputy Chief Financial Officer as described in § 19.20(c) of this part. At least thirty (30) days prior to offsetting internally or requesting a Federal agency to offset a salary payment, Commerce entities will send notice to the debtor in accordance with the requirements of § 19.4 of this part. When referring a Commerce debt for offset, Commerce entities will certify to the payment agency, in writing, that the Commerce debt is valid, delinquent and legally enforceable in the amount stated, and there are no legal bars to collection by salary offset. In addition, Commerce entities will certify that all due process and other prerequisites to salary offset have been met.
See
5 U.S.C. 5514, 31 U.S.C. 3716(a), and this section for a description of the due process and other prerequisites for salary offset.
(d)
When prior notice not required.
Commerce entities are not required to provide prior notice to an employee when the following adjustments are made by a Commerce entity to a Commerce employee's pay:
(1) Any adjustment to pay arising out of any employee's election of coverage or a change in coverage under a Federal benefits program requiring periodic deductions from pay, if the amount to be recovered was accumulated over four pay periods or less;
(2) A routine intra-agency adjustment of pay that is made to correct an overpayment of pay attributable to clerical or administrative errors or delays in processing pay documents, if the overpayment occurred within the four pay periods preceding the adjustment, and, at the time of such adjustment, or as soon thereafter as practical, the individual is provided written notice of the nature and the amount of the adjustment and point of contact for contesting such adjustment; or
(3) Any adjustment to collect a Commerce debt amounting to $50 or less, if, at the time of such adjustment, or as soon thereafter as practical, the individual is provided written notice of the nature and the amount of the adjustment and a point of contact for contesting such adjustment.
(e)
Hearing procedures
—(1)
Request for a hearing.
A Federal employee who has received a notice that his or her Commerce debt will be collected by means of salary offset may request a hearing concerning the existence or amount of the Commerce debt. The Federal employee also may request a hearing concerning the amount proposed to be deducted from the employee's pay each pay period. The employee must send any request for hearing, in writing, to the office designated in the notice described in § 19.4.
See
§ 19.4(a)(11). The request must be received by the designated office on or before the 15th day following the employee's receipt of the notice. The employee must sign the request and specify whether an oral or paper hearing is requested. If an oral hearing is requested, the employee must explain why the matter cannot be resolved by review of the documentary evidence alone. All travel expenses incurred by the Federal employee in connection with an in-person hearing will be borne by the employee.
See
31 CFR 901.3(a)(7).
(2)
Failure to submit timely request for hearing.
If the employee fails to submit a request for hearing within the time period described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, the employee will have waived the right to a hearing, and salary offset may be initiated. However, Commerce entities should accept a late request for hearing if the employee can show that the late request was the result of circumstances beyond the employee's control or because of a failure to receive actual notice of the filing deadline.
(3)
Hearing official.
Commerce entities must obtain the services of a hearing official who is not under the supervision or control of the Secretary. Commerce entities may contact the Deputy Chief Financial Officer as described in § 19.20(c) of this part or an agent of any Commerce agency designated in appendix A to 5 CFR part 581 (List of Agents Designated to Accept Legal Process) to request a hearing official.
(4)
Notice of hearing.
After the employee requests a hearing, the designated hearing official shall inform the employee of the form of the hearing to be provided. For oral hearings, the notice shall set forth the date, time and location of the hearing. For paper hearings, the notice shall notify the employee of the date by which he or she should submit written arguments to the designated hearing official. The hearing official shall give the employee reasonable time to submit documentation in support of the employee's position. The hearing official shall schedule a new hearing date if requested by both parties. The hearing official shall give both parties reasonable notice of the time and place of a rescheduled hearing.
(5)
Oral hearing.
The hearing official will conduct an oral hearing if he or she determines that the matter cannot be resolved by review of documentary evidence alone (for example, when an issue of credibility or veracity is involved). The hearing need not take the form of an evidentiary hearing, but may be conducted in a manner determined by the hearing official, including but not limited to:
(i) Informal conferences with the hearing official, in which the employee and agency representative will be given full opportunity to present evidence, witnesses and argument;
(ii) Informal meetings with an interview of the employee by the hearing official; or
(iii) Formal written submissions, with an opportunity for oral presentation.
(6)
Paper hearing.
If the hearing official determines that an oral hearing is not necessary, he or she will make the determination based upon a review of the available written record, including any documentation submitted by the employee in support of his or her position.
See
31 CFR 901.3(a)(7).
(7)
Failure to appear or submit documentary evidence.
In the absence of good cause shown (for example, excused illness), if the employee fails to appear at an oral hearing or fails to submit documentary evidence as required for a paper hearing, the employee will have waived the right to a hearing, and salary offset may be initiated. Further, the employee will have been deemed to admit the existence and amount of the Commerce debt as described in the notice of intent to offset. If the Commerce entity representative fails to appear at an oral hearing, the hearing official shall proceed with the hearing as scheduled, and make his or her determination based upon the oral testimony presented and the documentary evidence submitted by both parties.
(8)
Burden of proof.
Commerce entities will have the initial burden to prove the existence and amount of the Commerce debt. Thereafter, if the employee disputes the existence or amount of the Commerce debt, the employee must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that no such Commerce debt exists or that the amount of the Commerce debt is incorrect. In addition, the employee may present evidence that the proposed terms of the repayment schedule are unlawful, would cause a financial hardship to the employee, or that collection of the Commerce debt may not be pursued due to operation of law.
(9)
Record.
The hearing official shall maintain a summary record of any hearing provided by this part. Witnesses will testify under oath or affirmation in oral hearings.
See
31 CFR 901.3(a)(7).
(10)
Date of decision.
The hearing official shall issue a written opinion stating his or her decision, based upon documentary evidence and information developed at the hearing, as soon as practicable after the hearing, but not later than 60 days after the date on which the request for hearing was received by the Commerce entity. If the employee requests a delay in the proceedings, the deadline for the decision may be postponed by the number of days by which the hearing was postponed. When a decision is not timely rendered, the Commerce entity shall waive interest and penalties applied to the Commerce debt for the period beginning with the date the decision is due and ending on the date the decision is issued.
(11)
Content of decision.
The written decision shall include:
(i) A statement of the facts presented to support the origin, nature, and amount of the Commerce debt;
(ii) The hearing official's findings, analysis, and conclusions; and
(iii) The terms of any repayment schedules, if applicable.
(12)
Final agency action.
The hearing official's decision shall be final.
(f)
Waiver not precluded.
Nothing in this part precludes an employee from requesting waiver of an overpayment under 5 U.S.C. 5584 or 8346(b), 10 U.S.C. 2774, 32 U.S.C. 716, or other statutory authority. Commerce entities may grant such waivers when it would be against equity and good conscience or not in the United States' best interest to collect such Commerce debts, in accordance with those authorities, 5 CFR 550.1102(b)(2), and Commerce policies and procedures.

(g)
Salary offset process
—(1)
Determination of disposable pay.
The Deputy Chief Financial Officer will consult with the appropriate Commerce entity payroll office to determine the amount of a Commerce Department employee's disposable pay (as defined in § 19.1 of this part) and will implement salary offset when requested to do so by a Commerce entity, as described in paragraph (c) of this section, or another agency, as described in § 19.20 of this part. If the debtor is not employed by Commerce Department, the agency employing the
debtor will determine the amount of the employee's disposable pay and will implement salary offset upon request.
(2)
When salary offset begins.
Deductions shall begin within three official pay periods following receipt of the creditor agency's request for offset.
(3)
Amount of salary offset.
The amount to be offset from each salary payment will be up to 15 percent of a debtor's disposable pay, as follows:
(i) If the amount of the Commerce debt is equal to or less than 15 percent of the disposable pay, such Commerce debt generally will be collected in one lump sum payment;
(ii) Installment deductions will be made over a period of no greater than the anticipated period of employment. An installment deduction will not exceed 15 percent of the disposable pay from which the deduction is made unless the employee has agreed in writing to the deduction of a greater amount or the creditor agency has determined that smaller deductions are appropriate based on the employee's ability to pay.
(4)
Final salary payment.
After the employee has separated either voluntarily or involuntarily from the payment agency, the payment agency may make a lump sum deduction exceeding 15 percent of disposable pay from any final salary or other payments pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3716 in order to satisfy a Commerce debt.
(h)
Payment agency's responsibilities.
(1) As required by 5 CFR 550.1109, if the employee separates from the payment agency from which a Commerce entity has requested salary offset, the payment agency must certify the total amount of its collection and notify the Commerce entity and the employee of the amounts collected. If the payment agency is aware that the employee is entitled to payments from the Civil Service Retirement Fund and Disability Fund, the Federal Employee Retirement System, or other similar payments, it must provide written notification to the payment agency responsible for making such payments that the debtor owes a Commerce debt, the amount of the Commerce debt, and that the Commerce entity has complied with the provisions of this section. Commerce entities must submit a properly certified claim to the new payment agency before the collection can be made.
(2) If the employee is already separated from employment and all payments due from his or her former payment agency have been made, Commerce entities may request that money due and payable to the employee from the Civil Service Retirement Fund and Disability Fund, the Federal Employee Retirement System, or other similar funds, be administratively offset to collect the Commerce debt. Generally, Commerce entities will collect such monies through the Treasury Offset Program as described in § 19.9(c) of this part.
(3) When an employee transfers to another agency, Commerce entities should resume collection with the employee's new payment agency in order to continue salary offset.
§ 19.13
How will Commerce entities use administrative wage garnishment to collect a Commerce debt from a debtor's wages?
(a) Commerce entities are authorized to collect Commerce debts from an individual debtor's wages by means of administrative wage garnishment in accordance with the requirements of 31 U.S.C. 3720D and 31 CFR 285.11. This part adopts and incorporates all of the provisions of 31 CFR 285.11 concerning administrative wage garnishment, including the hearing procedures described in 31 CFR 285.11(f). Commerce entities may use administrative wage garnishment to collect a delinquent Commerce debt unless the debtor is making timely payments under an agreement to pay the Commerce debt in installments (
see
§ 19.6 of this part). At least thirty (30) days prior to initiating an administrative wage garnishment, Commerce entities will send notice to the debtor in accordance with the requirements of § 19.4 of this part, including the requirements of § 19.4(a)(10) of this part. For Commerce debts referred to the Bureau of the Fiscal Service under § 19.9 of this part, Commerce entities may authorize the Bureau of the Fiscal Service to send a notice informing the debtor that administrative wage garnishment will be
initiated and how the debtor may request a hearing as described in § 19.4(a)(10) of this part. If a debtor makes a timely request for a hearing, administrative wage garnishment will not begin until a hearing is held and a decision is sent to the debtor.
See
31 CFR 285.11(f)(4). Even if a debtor's hearing request is not timely, Commerce entities may suspend collection by administrative wage garnishment in accordance with the provisions of 31 CFR 285.11(f)(5). All travel expenses incurred by the debtor in connection with an in-person hearing will be borne by the debtor.
(b) This section does not apply to Federal salary offset, the process by which Commerce entities collect Commerce debts from the salaries of Federal employees (
see
§ 19.12 of this part).
§ 19.14
How will Commerce entities report Commerce debts to credit bureaus?
Commerce entities shall report delinquent Commerce debts to credit bureaus in accordance with the provisions of 31 U.S.C. 3711(e), 31 CFR 901.4, and the Office of Management and Budget Circular A-129, “Policies for Federal Credit Programs and Non-tax Receivables.” For additional information,
see
Bureau of the Fiscal Service's “Guide to the Federal Credit Bureau Program,” available at
https://www.fiscal.treasury.gov/fsreports/fs_reference.htm.
At least sixty (60) days prior to reporting a delinquent Commerce debt to a consumer reporting agency, Commerce entities will send notice to the debtor in accordance with the requirements of § 19.4 of this part. Commerce entities may authorize the Bureau of the Fiscal Service to report to credit bureaus those delinquent Commerce debts that have been transferred to the Bureau of the Fiscal Service under § 19.9 of this part.
§ 19.15
How will Commerce entities refer Commerce debts to private collection agencies?
Commerce entities will transfer delinquent Commerce debts to the Bureau of the Fiscal Service to obtain debt collection services provided by private collection agencies.
See
§ 19.9 of this part.
§ 19.16
When will Commerce entities refer Commerce debts to the Department of Justice?
(a)
Compromise or suspension or termination of collection activity.
Commerce entities shall refer Commerce debts having a principal balance over $100,000, or such higher amount as authorized by the Attorney General, to the Department of Justice for approval of any compromise of a Commerce debt or suspension or termination of collection activity.
See
§§ 19.7 and 19.8 of this part; 31 CFR 902.1; 31 CFR 903.1.
(b)
Litigation.
Commerce entities shall promptly refer to the Department of Justice for litigation delinquent Commerce debts on which aggressive collection activity has been taken in accordance with this part and that should not be compromised, and on which collection activity should not be suspended or terminated.
See
31 CFR part 904. Commerce entities may authorize the Bureau of the Fiscal Service to refer to the Department of Justice for litigation those delinquent Commerce debts that have been transferred to the Bureau of the Fiscal Service under § 19.9 of this part.
§ 19.17
Will a debtor who owes a Commerce or other Federal agency debt, and persons controlled by or controlling such debtors, be ineligible for Federal loan assistance, grants, cooperative agreements, or other sources of Federal funds or for Federal licenses, permits, or privileges?
(a) Delinquent debtors are ineligible for and barred from obtaining Federal loans or loan insurance or guaranties. As required by 31 U.S.C. 3720B and 31 CFR 901.6, Commerce entities will not extend financial assistance in the form of a loan, loan guarantee, or loan insurance to any person delinquent on a debt owed to a Federal agency. Commerce Department may issue standards under which Commerce Department may determine that persons controlled by or controlling such delinquent debtors are similarly ineligible in accordance with 31 CFR 285.13(c)(2). This prohibition does not apply to disaster loans. Commerce entities may extend credit after the delinquency has been resolved.
See
31 CFR 285.13. Waivers of ineligibility may be granted by the
Secretary or designee on a person by person basis in accordance with 31 CFR 285.13(g). However, such authority may not be delegated below the Deputy Chief Financial Officer.
(b) A debtor who has a judgment lien against the debtor's property for a debt to the United States is not eligible to receive grants, loans or funds directly or indirectly from the United States until the judgment is paid in full or otherwise satisfied. This prohibition does not apply to funds to which the debtor is entitled as beneficiary. Commerce Department may promulgate regulations to allow for waivers of this ineligibility.
See
28 U.S.C. 3201(e).
(c) Suspension or revocation of eligibility for licenses, permits, or privileges. Unless prohibited by law, Commerce entities with the authority to do so under the circumstances should deny, suspend or revoke licenses, permits, or other privileges for any inexcusable or willful failure of a debtor to pay a debt. The Commerce entity responsible for distributing the licenses, permits, or other privileges will establish policies and procedures governing suspension and revocation for delinquent debtors. If applicable, Commerce entities will advise the debtor in the notice required by § 19.4 of this part of the Commerce entities' ability to deny, suspend or revoke licenses, permits or privileges.
See
§ 19.4(a)(16) of this part.
(d) To the extent that a person delinquent on a Commerce debt is not otherwise barred under § 19.17(a) and § 19.17 (c) of this part from becoming or remaining a recipient of a Commerce Department grant or cooperative agreement, it is Commerce Department policy that no award of Federal funds shall be made to a Commerce Department grant or cooperative agreement applicant who has an outstanding delinquent Commerce debt until:
(1) The delinquent Commerce debt is paid in full,
(2) A negotiated repayment schedule acceptable to Commerce Department is established and at least one payment is received, or
(3) Other arrangements satisfactory to Commerce Department are made.
§ 19.18
How does a debtor request a special review based on a change in circumstances such as catastrophic illness, divorce, death, or disability?
(a)
Material change in circumstances.
A debtor who owes a Commerce debt may, at any time, request a special review by the applicable Commerce entity of the amount of any offset, administrative wage garnishment, or voluntary payment, based on materially changed circumstances beyond the control of the debtor such as, but not limited to, catastrophic illness, divorce, death, or disability.
(b)
Inability to pay.
For purposes of this section, in determining whether an involuntary or voluntary payment would prevent the debtor from meeting essential subsistence expenses (e.g., costs incurred for food, housing, clothing, transportation, and medical care), the debtor shall submit a detailed statement and supporting documents for the debtor, his or her spouse, and dependents, indicating:
(1) Income from all sources;
(2) Assets;
(3) Liabilities;
(4) Number of dependents;
(5) Expenses for food, housing, clothing, and transportation;
(6) Medical expenses;
(7) Exceptional expenses, if any; and
(8) Any additional materials and information that the Commerce entity may request relating to ability or inability to pay the amount(s) currently required.
(c)
Alternative payment arrangement.
If the debtor requests a special review under this section, the debtor shall submit an alternative proposed payment schedule and a statement to the Commerce entity collecting the Commerce debt, with supporting documents, showing why the current offset, garnishment or repayment schedule imposes an extreme financial hardship on the debtor. The Commerce entity will evaluate the statement and documentation and determine whether the current offset, garnishment, or repayment schedule imposes extreme financial hardship on the debtor. The Commerce entity shall notify the debtor in writing of such determination, including, if appropriate, a revised offset, garnishment, or payment schedule. If
the special review results in a revised offset, garnishment, or repayment schedule, the Commerce entity will notify the appropriate Federal agency or other persons about the new terms.
§ 19.19
Will Commerce entities issue a refund if money is erroneously collected on a Commerce debt?
Commerce entities shall promptly refund to a debtor any amount collected on a Commerce debt when the Commerce debt is waived or otherwise found not to be owed to the United States, or as otherwise required by law. Refunds under this part shall not bear interest unless required by law.

# Subpart C—Procedures for Offset of Commerce Department Payments To Collect Debts Owed to Other Federal Agencies
§ 19.20
How do other Federal agencies use the offset process to collect debts from payments issued by a Commerce entity?
(a)
Offset of Commerce entity payments to collect debts owed to other Federal agencies.
(1) In most cases, Federal agencies submit debts to the Treasury Offset Program to collect delinquent debts from payments issued by Commerce entities and other Federal agencies, a process known as “centralized offset.” When centralized offset is not available or appropriate, any Federal agency may ask a Commerce entity (when acting as a “payment agency”) to collect a debt owed to such agency by offsetting funds payable to a debtor by the Commerce entity, including salary payments issued to Commerce entity employees. This section and § 19.21 of this subpart C apply when a Federal agency asks a Commerce entity to offset a payment issued by the Commerce entity to a person who owes a debt to the United States.
(2) This subpart C does not apply to Commerce debts.
See
§§ 19.10 through 19.12 of this part for offset procedures applicable to Commerce debts.
(3) This subpart C does not apply to the collection of non-Commerce debts through tax refund offset.
See
31 CFR 285.2 for tax refund offset procedures.
(b)
Administrative offset (including salary offset); certification.
A Commerce entity will initiate a requested offset only upon receipt of written certification from the creditor agency that the debtor owes the past-due, legally enforceable debt in the amount stated, and that the creditor agency has fully complied with all applicable due process and other requirements contained in 31 U.S.C. 3716, 5 U.S.C. 5514, and the creditor agency's regulations, as applicable. Offsets will continue until the debt is paid in full or otherwise resolved to the satisfaction of the creditor agency.
(c)
Where a creditor agency makes requests for offset.
Requests for offset under this section shall be sent to the Department of Commerce, ATTN: Deputy Chief Financial Officer, 1401 Constitution Avenue NW., Room D200, Washington, DC 20230. The Deputy Chief Financial Officer will forward the request to the appropriate Commerce entity for processing in accordance with this subpart C.
(d)
Incomplete certification.
A Commerce entity will return an incomplete debt certification to the creditor agency with notice that the creditor agency must comply with paragraph (b) of this section before action will be taken to collect a debt from a payment issued by a Commerce entity.
(e)
Review.
A Commerce entity is not authorized to review the merits of the creditor agency's determination with respect to the amount or validity of the debt certified by the creditor agency.
(f)
When Commerce entities will not comply with offset request.
A Commerce entity will comply with the offset request of another agency unless the Commerce entity determines that the offset would not be in the best interests of the United States, or would otherwise be contrary to law.
(g)
Multiple debts.
When two or more creditor agencies are seeking offsets from payments made to the same person, or when two or more debts are owed to a single creditor agency, the Commerce entity that has been asked to offset the payments may determine the order in which the debts will be collected or whether one or more debts
should be collected by offset simultaneously.
(h)
Priority of debts owed to Commerce entity.
For purposes of this section, debts owed to a Commerce entity generally take precedence over debts owed to other agencies. The Commerce entity that has been asked to offset the payments may determine whether to pay debts owed to other agencies before paying a debt owed to a Commerce entity. The Commerce entity that has been asked to offset the payments will determine the order in which the debts will be collected based on the best interests of the United States.
§ 19.21
What does a Commerce entity do upon receipt of a request to offset the salary of a Commerce entity employee to collect a debt owed by the employee to another Federal agency?
(a)
Notice to the Commerce employee.
When a Commerce entity receives proper certification of a debt owed by one of its employees, the Commerce entity will begin deductions from the employee's pay at the next officially established pay interval. The Commerce entity will send a written notice to the employee indicating that a certified debt claim has been received from the creditor agency, the amount of the debt claimed to be owed by the creditor agency, the date deductions from salary will begin, and the amount of such deductions.
(b)
Amount of deductions from Commerce employee's salary.
The amount deducted under § 19.20(b) of this part will be the lesser of the amount of the debt certified by the creditor agency or an amount up to 15 percent of the debtor's disposable pay. Deductions shall continue until the Commerce entity knows that the debt is paid in full or until otherwise instructed by the creditor agency. Alternatively, the amount offset may be an amount agreed upon, in writing, by the debtor and the creditor agency.
See
§ 19.12(g) (salary offset process).
(c)
When the debtor is no longer employed by the Commerce entity
—(1)
Offset of final and subsequent payments.
If a Commerce entity employee retires or resigns or if his or her employment ends before collection of the debt is complete, the Commerce entity will continue to offset, under 31 U.S.C. 3716, up to 100 percent of an employee's subsequent payments until the debt is paid or otherwise resolved. Such payments include a debtor's final salary payment, lump-sum leave payment, and other payments payable to the debtor by the Commerce entity.
See
31 U.S.C. 3716 and 5 CFR 550.1104(l) and 550.1104(m).
(2)
Notice to the creditor agency.
If the employee is separated from the Commerce entity before the debt is paid in full, the Commerce entity will certify to the creditor agency the total amount of its collection. If the Commerce entity is aware that the employee is entitled to payments from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund, Federal Employee Retirement System, or other similar payments, the Commerce entity will provide written notice to the agency making such payments that the debtor owes a debt (including the amount) and that the provisions of 5 CFR 550.1109 have been fully complied with. The creditor agency is responsible for submitting a certified claim to the agency responsible for making such payments before collection may begin. Generally, creditor agencies will collect such monies through the Treasury Offset Program as described in § 19.9(c) of this part.
(3)
Notice to the debtor.
The Commerce entity will provide to the debtor a copy of any notices sent to the creditor agency under paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
(d)
When the debtor transfers to another Federal agency
—(1)
Notice to the creditor agency.
If the debtor transfers to another Federal agency before the debt is paid in full, the Commerce entity will notify the creditor agency and will certify the total amount of its collection on the debt. The Commerce entity will provide a copy of the certification to the creditor agency. The creditor agency is responsible for submitting a certified claim to the debtor's new employing agency before collection may begin.
(2)
Notice to the debtor.
The Commerce entity will provide to the debtor a copy of any notices and certifications sent to the creditor agency under paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
(e)
Request for hearing official.
A Commerce entity will provide a hearing official upon the creditor agency's request with respect to a Commerce entity employee.

5 CFR 550.1107(a).

# Subpart B—Standards for Determining Age Discrimination
§ 20.4
Rules against age discrimination.
The rules stated in this section are limited by the exceptions contained in § 20.5.
(a) General rule: No person in the United States shall, on the basis of age, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.
(b) Specific rules: A recipient may not, in any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance, directly or through contractual licensing, or other arrangements, use age distinctions or take any other actions which have the effect, on the basis of age, of:
(1) Excluding individuals from, denying them the benefits of, or subjecting them to discrimination under, a program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance, or
(2) Denying or limiting individuals in their opportunity to participate in any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.
(c) The specific forms of age discrimination listed in paragraph (b) of this section do not necessarily constitute a complete list.
(d) If a recipient operating a program or activity provides special benefits to the elderly or to children, such use of age distinctions shall be presumed to be necessary to the normal operation of the program or activity, notwithstanding the provisions of § 20.5.
§ 20.5
Exceptions to the rules.
(a)
Normal operations or statutory objective of any program or activity.
A recipient is permitted to take an action otherwise prohibited by § 20.4 if the action reasonably considers age as a factor necessary to the normal operation or the achievement of any statutory objective of a program or activity. An action meets this standard if:
(1) Age is used as a measure or approximation of one or more other characteristics; and
(2) The other characteristic(s) must be measured or approximated in order for the normal operation of the program or activity to continue, or to achieve any statutory objective or the program or activity; and
(3) The other characteristic(s) can be reasonably measured or approximated by the use of age; and
(4) The other characteristic(s) are impractical to measure directly on an individual bases.
(b)
Reasonable factors other than age.
A recipient is permitted to take an action otherwise prohibited by § 20.4 which is based on a factor other than age, even though that action may have a disproportionate effect on persons of different ages. An action may be based on a factor other than age only if the factor bears a direct and substantial relationship to the normal operation of the program or activity or to the achievement of a statutory objective.
§ 20.6
Burden of proof.
The burden of proving that an age distinction or other action falls within the exceptions outlined in § 20.5 is on the recipient of Federal financial assistance.

# Subpart C—Responsibilities of DOC Recipients
§ 20.7
General responsibilities.
Each DOC recipient has primary responsibility to ensure that its programs or activities are in compliance with the Act, the general regulations, and these regulations, and shall take steps to eliminate violation of the Act.
(a) Each DOC recipient will provide an assurance that the program or activity for which it is receiving Federal financial assistance will be conducted in compliance with all requirements for the Act and these and other DOC regulations. A recipient also has responsibility to maintain records, provide information, and to afford DOC
reasonable access to its records and facilities to the extent necessary to determine whether it is in compliance with the Act and these regulations.
(b)
Recipient assessment of age distinctions.
(1) To assess the recipient's compliance with the Act, DOC may, as part of a compliance review under § 20.10 or a complaint investigation under § 20.11, require a recipient employing the equivalent or 15 or more employees, to complete, in a manner specified by the responsible Department official, a written self-evaluation of any age distinction imposed in its program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance from DOC.
(2) Whenever an assessment indicates a violation of the Act and the DOC regulations, the recipient shall take corrective action.
§ 20.8
Notice to subrecipients.

The review may be as comprehensive as necessary to determine whether a violation of the Act and these regulations has occurred.
(b) If a compliance review of pre-award review indicates a violation of the Act or these regulations, DOC will attempt to achieve voluntary compliance with the Act. If voluntary compliance cannot be achieved, DOC will arrange for enforcement as described in § 20.15.
§ 20.11
Complaints.
(a) Any person, individually, or as a member of a class, or on behalf of others, may file a complaint with DOC alleging discrimination prohibited by the Act or these regulations based on an action occurring on or after July 1, 1979. A complainant shall file a complaint within 180 days from the date the complainant first had knowledge of the alleged act of discrimination. However, for good cause shown, DOC may extend this time limit.
(b) DOC will attempt to facilitate the filing of complaints wherever possible, including taking the following measures:
(1) Accepting as a sufficient complaint, any written statement which: identifies the parties involved and the date the complainant first had knowledge of the alleged violation; describes generally the action or practice complained of; and is signed by the complainant;
(2) Freely permitting a complainant to add information to the complaint to meet the requirements of a sufficient complaint;
(3) Considering as the filing date, the date on which a complaint is sufficient to be processed;
(4) Notifiying the complainant and the recipient of their rights and obligations under the compliant procedure, including the right to have a representative at all stages of the process;
(5) Notifying the complainant and the recipient (or their representatives) of their right to contact DOC for information and assistance regarding the complaint resolution process.
(c) DOC will return to the complainant any complaint outside the jurisdiction of these regulations, and will state the reason(s) why it is outside the jurisdiction of these regulations.
§ 20.12
Mediation.
(a) DOC will refer to a mediation service designated by the Secretary all sufficient complaints that:
(1) Fall within the jurisdiction of the Act and these regulations, unless the
age distinction complained of is clearly within an exception; and
(2) Contain all information necessary for further processing.
(b) Both the complainant and the recipient shall participate in the mediation process to the extent necessary to reach an agreement or to make an informed judgment that an agreement is not possible.
(c) If the complainant and the recipient reach an agreement, the mediator shall prepare a written statement of the agreement and have the complainant and the recipient sign it. The mediator shall send a copy of the agreement to DOC. DOC will take no further action on the complaint unless the complainant or the recipient fails to comply with the agreement.
(d) The mediator is required to protect the confidentiality of all information obtained in the course of the mediation process. No mediator shall testify in any adjudicative proceeding, produce any document, or otherwise disclose any information obtained, in the course of the mediation process without prior approval of the head or the mediation service.
(e) The mediation will proceed for a maximum of 60 days after a complaint is filed with DOC. Mediation ends if:
(1) 60 days elapse from the time DOC receives the complaint;
or
(2) Prior to the end of that 60-day period, an agreement is reached;
or
(3) Prior to the end of that 60-day period, the mediator determines that an agreement cannot be reached.
(f) The mediator shall return unresolved complaints to DOC.
§ 20.13
Investigation.
(a) Informal investigation:
(1) DOC will investigate complaints that are unresolved after mediation or are reopended because of a violation of a mediation agreement.
(2) As part of the initial investigation, DOC will use informal factfinding methods, including joint or separate discussions with the complainant and recipient, to establish the facts and, if possible, settle the complaint on terms that are mutually agreeable to the parties. DOC may seek the assistance of any involved State agency.
(3) DOC will put any agreement in writing and have it signed by the parties and an authorized offical at DOC.
(4) The settlement shall not affect the operation of any other enforcement effort of DOC, including compliance reviews and investigation or other complaints which may involve the recipient.
(5) The settlement is not a finding of discrimination against a recipient.
(b) Formal investigation: If DOC cannot resolve the complaint through informal investigation, it will begin to develop formal findings through further investigation of the complaint. If the investigation indicates a violation of these regulations, DOC will attempt to obtain voluntary compliance. If DOC cannot obtain voluntary compliance, it will begin enforcement as described in § 8a.15.
§ 20.14
Prohibition against intimidation or retaliation.
A recipient may not engage in acts of intimidation or retaliation against any person who:
(a) Attempts to assert a right protected by the Act or these regulations; or
(b) Cooperates in any mediation, investigation, hearing, or other part of DOC's investigation, conciliation, and enforcement process.
§ 20.15
Compliance procedure.
(a) DOC may enforce the Act and these regulations by:
(1) Terminating the Federal financial assistance to the recipient under the program or activity found to have violated the Act or these regulations. The determination of the recipient's violation may be made only after a recipient has had an opportunity for a hearing on the record before an administrative law judge. If a case is settled during mediation, or prior to hearing, Federal financial assistance to the program or activity will not be terminated.
(2) Any other means authorized by law including but not limited to:
(i) Referral to the Department of Justice for proceedings to enforce any rights of the United States or obligations of the recipient created by the Act or these regulations.
(ii) Use of any requirement of or referral to any Federal, State, or local government agency that will have the effect of correcting a violation of the Act or these regulations.
(b) DOC will limit any termination under this section to the particular recipient and particular program or activity or part of such program or activity DOC finds in violation of these regulations. DOC will not base any part of a termination on a finding with respect to any program or activity of the recipient which does not receive Federal financial assistance from DOC.
(c) DOC will take no action under paragraph (a) until:
(1) The head of the organization providing the financial assistance has advised the recipient of its failure to comply with the Act and these regulations and has determined that voluntary compliance cannot be obtained.
(2) Thirty days have elapsed after the Secretary has sent a written report of the circumstances and grounds of the action to the committees of the Congress having legislative jurisdiction over the program or activity involved. The Secretary will file a report whenever any action is taken under paragraph (a).
(d) DOC also may defer granting new Federal financial assistance to a recipient when a hearing under § 20.16 is initiated.
(1) New Federal financial assistance from DOC includes all assistance for which DOC requires an application or approval, including renewal or continuation of existing activities, or authorization of new activities, during the deferral period. New Federal financial assistance from DOC does not include increases in funding as a result of changed computation of formula awards or assistance approved prior to the beginning of a hearing under § 20.16.
(2) DOC will not begin a deferral until the recipient has received a notice of an opportunity for a hearing under § 20.16. DOC will not continue a deferral for more than 60 days unless a hearing has begun within that time, or the time for beginning the hearing has been extended by mutual consent of the recipient and the head of the organization providing Federal financial assistance. DOC will not continue a deferral for more than 30 days after the close of the hearing, unless the hearing results in a finding against the recipient.
(3) DOC will limit any deferral to the particular recipient and particular program or activity or part of such program or activity DOC finds in violation of these regulations. DOC will not base any part of a deferral on a finding with respect to any program or activity of the recipient which does not, and would not in connection with the new funds, receive Federal financial assistance for DOC.
§ 20.16
Hearings, decisions, post-termination proceedings.
Certain DOC procedural provisions applicable to Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 apply to DOC enforcement of these regulations. They are found in 15 CFR Part 8, § 8.12 and § 8.13.
§ 20.17
Remedial action by recipients.
(a) Where DOC finds that a recipient has discriminated on the basis of age, the recipient shall take any remedial action that DOC may require to overcome the effects of the discrimination. If another recipient exercises control over the recipient that has discriminated, DOC may require both recipients to take remedial action.
(b) Even in the absence of a finding of discrimination, a recipient may take affirmative action to overcome the effects of conditions that resulted in limited participation in the recipient's program or activity on the basis of age.
§ 20.18
Alternative funds disbursal procedure.
(a) When, under the provisions of these regulations, DOC terminates the funding of a recipient, the Secretary may, using undisbursed funds from the terminated award, make a new award to an alternate recipient,
i.e.
any public or non-profit private organization or agency, or State or political subdivision of the State.
(b) The Secretary will require any alternate recipient to demonstrate:
(1) The ability to comply with these regulations; and
(2) The ability to achieve the goals of the Federal statute authorizing the Federal financial assistance.
§ 20.19
Private lawsuits after exhaustion of administrative remedies.
(a) A complainant may file a civil action following the exhaustion of administrative remedies under the Act. Administrative remedies are exhausted if:
(1) 180 days have elapsed since the complainant filed the complaint and DOC has made no finding with regard to the complaint; or
(2) DOC issues any finding in favor of the recipient.
(b) If DOC fails to make a finding within 180 days or issues a finding in favor of recipient, DOC shall:
(1) Promptly advise the complainant of this fact; and
(2) Advise the complainant of his or her right to bring civil action for injunctive relief; and
(3) Inform the complainant that:
(i) The complainant may bring a civil action only in a United States district court for the district in which the recipient is located or transacts business;
(ii) A complainant prevailing in a civil action has the right to be awarded the costs of the action, including reasonable attorney's fees, but that the complainant must demand these costs in the complaint;
(iii) Before commencing the action, the complainant shall give 30 days notice by registered mail to the Secretary, the Attorney General of the United States, and the recipient;
(iv) The notice shall contain the alleged violation of the Act, the relief requested, the court in which the complainant is bringing the action, and whether or not attorney's fees are demanded in the event the complainant prevails; and
(v) The complainant may not bring an action if the same alleged violation of the Act by the same recipient is the subject of a pending action in any court of the United States.

§ 23.1
Purpose.
These regulations are intended to comply with 39 U.S.C. 3220(a)(2), and the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP) guidelines (50 FR 46622), to assist in the location and recovery of missing children through the use of penalty mail.

§ 23.3
Plan.
(a) The Department of Commerce will supplement and expand the national effort to assist in the location and recovery of missing children through the economical use of missing children information in domestic penalty mail directed to the public and Federal employees.
(b) The Department of Commerce may include, on or inside authorized types of penalty mail, pictures and biographical data related to missing children, provided such use is determined to be cost effective. The authorized types of penalty mail include:
(1) All envelopes; and
(2) Self-mailer publications (newsletters, bulletins, etc.) with a shelf-life of no more than 90 days.
(c) The manner in which pictures and biographical data may be used includes:
(1) Printing on envelopes at the time they are initially printed with the United States Postal Service (USPS) required postal code identification;
(2) Printed inserts that are placed in envelopes along with other mailing material;
(3) Stickers that are printed and placed on envelopes prior to mailing; and
(4) Printing as part of the content of self-mailers such as bureau newsletters, bulletins, etc.
(d) Missing children information will not be placed on letter-size envelopes in the areas described as the “Penalty Indicia Area,” “OCR Read Area,” “Bar Code Read Area,” and “Return Address Area” per Appendix A of the OJJDP guidelines.
(e) The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (National Center) will be the sole source from which the Department of Commerce will obtain the camera-ready and other photographic and biographical materials for use by organizational units. Photographs which were reasonably current as of the time of the child's disappearance shall be the only acceptable form of visual media or pictorial likeness used on or in penalty mail.
(f) The Department of Commerce will remove all printed penalty mail envelopes and other materials from circulation or other use (
i.e.
, use or destroy) within 90 days of notification by the National Center of the need to withdraw penalty mail envelopes and other materials related to a particular child from circulation. The Department of Commerce will not include missing children information on blank pages or covers of items such as those to be included in the Superintendent of Documents' Sales Program, or to be distributed to Depository Libraries, as such material generally could not be withdrawn from use within 90 days of notification. The National Center will be responsible for immediately notifying the Department Contact Person, in writing, of the need to withdraw from circulation penalty mail envelopes and other materials related to a particular child.
(g) The Department of Commerce will give priority:
(1) To penalty mail that is addressed to the public for receipt in the United States, its territories and possessions; and
(2) To inter- and intra-agency publications and other media that will be widely disseminated to and viewed by Federal employees.
(h) All suggestions and/or recommendations for innovative, cost-effective techniques should be forwarded to the Department Contact Person. The Department Contact Person shall conduct biannual meetings of departmental representatives to discuss the current plan and recommendations for future plans.
(i) This shall be the sole regulation implementing this program for the Department of Commerce.
§ 23.4
Cost and percentage estimates.
It is estimated that this program will cost the Department of Commerce $39,530 in the first year. It is the Department of Commerce's estimate that 9% of its penalty mail will transmit missing children photographs and information when the program is fully implemented.
§ 23.5
Report to the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention.
The Department of Commerce will compile and submit a consolidated report to OJJDP, by June 30, 1987, on its experience in implementation of 39 U.S.C. 3220(a) (2), the OJJDP guidelines, and the Department of Commerce's regulation.

(9) Whether the respondent attempted to conceal the misconduct;
(10) The degree to which the respondent has involved others in the misconduct or in concealing it;

(12) Whether the respondent cooperated in or obstructed an investigation of the misconduct;
(13) Whether the respondent assisted in identifying and prosecuting other wrongdoers;
(14) The complexity of the program or transaction, and the degree of the respondent's sophistication with respect to it, including the extent of the respondent's prior participation in the program or in similar transactions;

Prior written statements of witnesses proposed to testify at the hearing and deposition transcripts shall be exchanged as provided in § 25.22(a).
(c) The ALJ shall exercise reasonable control over the mode and order of interrogating witnesses and presenting evidence so as to—

§ 27.101
To what does this policy apply?
(a) Except as detailed in § 27.104, this policy applies to all research involving human subjects conducted, supported, or otherwise subject to regulation by any Federal department or agency that takes appropriate administrative action to make the policy applicable to such research. This includes research conducted by Federal civilian employees or military personnel, except that each department or agency head may adopt such procedural modifications as may be appropriate from an administrative standpoint. It also includes research conducted, supported, or otherwise subject to regulation by the Federal Government outside the United States. Institutions that are engaged in research described in this paragraph and institutional review boards (IRBs) reviewing research that is subject to this policy must comply with this policy.
(b) [Reserved]
(c) Department or agency heads retain final judgment as to whether a particular activity is covered by this
policy and this judgment shall be exercised consistent with the ethical principles of the Belmont Report.
62
62
The National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research.- Belmont Report. Washington, DC: U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. 1979.
(d) Department or agency heads may require that specific research activities or classes of research activities conducted, supported, or otherwise subject to regulation by the Federal department or agency but not otherwise covered by this policy comply with some or all of the requirements of this policy.
(e) Compliance with this policy requires compliance with pertinent federal laws or regulations that provide additional protections for human subjects.
(f) This policy does not affect any state or local laws or regulations (including tribal law passed by the official governing body of an American Indian or Alaska Native tribe) that may otherwise be applicable and that provide additional protections for human subjects.
(g) This policy does not affect any foreign laws or regulations that may otherwise be applicable and that provide additional protections to human subjects of research.
(h) When research covered by this policy takes place in foreign countries, procedures normally followed in the foreign countries to protect human subjects may differ from those set forth in this policy. In these circumstances, if a department or agency head determines that the procedures prescribed by the institution afford protections that are at least equivalent to those provided in this policy, the department or agency head may approve the substitution of the foreign procedures in lieu of the procedural requirements provided in this policy. Except when otherwise required by statute, Executive Order, or the department or agency head, notices of these actions as they occur will be published in the
Federal Register
or will be otherwise published as provided in department or agency procedures.
(i) Unless otherwise required by law, department or agency heads may waive the applicability of some or all of the provisions of this policy to specific research activities or classes of research activities otherwise covered by this policy, provided the alternative procedures to be followed are consistent with the principles of the Belmont Report.
63
Except when otherwise required by statute or Executive Order, the department or agency head shall forward advance notices of these actions to the Office for Human Research Protections, Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), or any successor office, or to the equivalent office within the appropriate Federal department or agency, and shall also publish them in the
Federal Register
or in such other manner as provided in department or agency procedures. The waiver notice must include a statement that identifies the conditions under which the waiver will be applied and a justification as to why the waiver is appropriate for the research, including how the decision is consistent with the principles of the Belmont Report.
63
Id.
(j) Federal guidance on the requirements of this policy shall be issued only after consultation, for the purpose of harmonization (to the extent appropriate), with other Federal departments and agencies that have adopted this policy, unless such consultation is not feasible.

§ 27.103
Assuring compliance with this policy—research conducted or supported by any Federal department or agency.
(a) Each institution engaged in research that is covered by this policy, with the exception of research eligible for exemption under § 27.104, and that is conducted or supported by a Federal department or agency, shall provide written assurance satisfactory to the department or agency head that it will comply with the requirements of this policy. In lieu of requiring submission of an assurance, individual department or agency heads shall accept the existence of a current assurance, appropriate for the research in question, on file with the Office for Human Research Protections, HHS, or any successor office, and approved for Federal-wide use by that office. When the existence of an HHS-approved assurance is accepted in lieu of requiring submission of an assurance, reports (except certification) required by this policy to be made to department and agency heads shall also be made to the Office
for Human Research Protections, HHS, or any successor office. Federal departments and agencies will conduct or support research covered by this policy only if the institution has provided an assurance that it will comply with the requirements of this policy, as provided in this section, and only if the institution has certified to the department or agency head that the research has been reviewed and approved by an IRB (if such certification is required by § 27.103(d)).
(b) The assurance shall be executed by an individual authorized to act for the institution and to assume on behalf of the institution the obligations imposed by this policy and shall be filed in such form and manner as the department or agency head prescribes.
(c) The department or agency head may limit the period during which any assurance shall remain effective or otherwise condition or restrict the assurance.
(d) Certification is required when the research is supported by a Federal department or agency and not otherwise waived under § 27.101(i) or exempted under § 27.104. For such research, institutions shall certify that each proposed research study covered by the assurance and this section has been reviewed and approved by the IRB. Such certification must be submitted as prescribed by the Federal department or agency component supporting the research. Under no condition shall research covered by this section be initiated prior to receipt of the certification that the research has been reviewed and approved by the IRB.
(e) For nonexempt research involving human subjects covered by this policy (or exempt research for which limited IRB review takes place pursuant to § 27.104(d)(2)(iii), (d)(3)(i)(C), or (d)(7) or (8)) that takes place at an institution in which IRB oversight is conducted by an IRB that is not operated by the institution, the institution and the organization operating the IRB shall document the institution's reliance on the IRB for oversight of the research and the responsibilities that each entity will undertake to ensure compliance with the requirements of this policy (e.g., in a written agreement between the institution and the IRB, by implementation of an institution-wide policy directive providing the allocation of responsibilities between the institution and an IRB that is not affiliated with the institution, or as set forth in a research protocol).
(Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under Control Number 0990-0260)
§ 27.104
Exempt research.
(a) Unless otherwise required by law or by department or agency heads, research activities in which the only involvement of human subjects will be in one or more of the categories in paragraph (d) of this section are exempt from the requirements of this policy, except that such activities must comply with the requirements of this section and as specified in each category.
(b) Use of the exemption categories for research subject to the requirements of subparts B, C, and D: Application of the exemption categories to research subject to the requirements of 45 CFR part 46, subparts B, C, and D, is as follows:
(1)
Subpart B.
Each of the exemptions at this section may be applied to research subject to subpart B if the conditions of the exemption are met.
(2)
Subpart C.
The exemptions at this section do not apply to research subject to subpart C, except for research aimed at involving a broader subject population that only incidentally includes prisoners.
(3)
Subpart D.
The exemptions at paragraphs (d)(1), (4), (5), (6), (7), and (8) of this section may be applied to research subject to subpart D if the conditions of the exemption are met. Paragraphs (d)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section only may apply to research subject to subpart D involving educational tests or the observation of public behavior when the investigator(s) do not participate in the activities being observed. Paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section may not be applied to research subject to subpart D.
(c) [Reserved]
(d) Except as described in paragraph (a) of this section, the following categories of human subjects research are exempt from this policy:
(1) Research, conducted in established or commonly accepted educational settings, that specifically involves normal educational practices that are not likely to adversely impact students' opportunity to learn required educational content or the assessment of educators who provide instruction. This includes most research on regular and special education instructional strategies, and research on the effectiveness of or the comparison among instructional techniques, curricula, or classroom management methods.
(2) Research that only includes interactions involving educational tests (cognitive, diagnostic, aptitude, achievement), survey procedures, interview procedures, or observation of public behavior (including visual or auditory recording) if at least one of the following criteria is met:
(i) The information obtained is recorded by the investigator in such a manner that the identity of the human subjects cannot readily be ascertained, directly or through identifiers linked to the subjects;
(ii) Any disclosure of the human subjects' responses outside the research would not reasonably place the subjects at risk of criminal or civil liability or be damaging to the subjects' financial standing, employability, educational advancement, or reputation; or
(iii) The information obtained is recorded by the investigator in such a manner that the identity of the human subjects can readily be ascertained, directly or through identifiers linked to the subjects, and an IRB conducts a limited IRB review to make the determination required by § 27.111(a)(7).
(3)(i) Research involving benign behavioral interventions in conjunction with the collection of information from an adult subject through verbal or written responses (including data entry) or audiovisual recording if the subject prospectively agrees to the intervention and information collection and at least one of the following criteria is met:
(A) The information obtained is recorded by the investigator in such a manner that the identity of the human subjects cannot readily be ascertained, directly or through identifiers linked to the subjects;
(B) Any disclosure of the human subjects' responses outside the research would not reasonably place the subjects at risk of criminal or civil liability or be damaging to the subjects' financial standing, employability, educational advancement, or reputation; or
(C) The information obtained is recorded by the investigator in such a manner that the identity of the human subjects can readily be ascertained, directly or through identifiers linked to the subjects, and an IRB conducts a limited IRB review to make the determination required by § 27.111(a)(7).
(ii) For the purpose of this provision, benign behavioral interventions are brief in duration, harmless, painless, not physically invasive, not likely to have a significant adverse lasting impact on the subjects, and the investigator has no reason to think the subjects will find the interventions offensive or embarrassing. Provided all such criteria are met, examples of such benign behavioral interventions would include having the subjects play an online game, having them solve puzzles under various noise conditions, or having them decide how to allocate a nominal amount of received cash between themselves and someone else.
(iii) If the research involves deceiving the subjects regarding the nature or purposes of the research, this exemption is not applicable unless the subject authorizes the deception through a prospective agreement to participate in research in circumstances in which the subject is informed that he or she will be unaware of or misled regarding the nature or purposes of the research.
(4) Secondary research for which consent is not required: Secondary research uses of identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens, if at least one of the following criteria is met:
(i) The identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens are publicly available;

§ 27.107
IRB membership.
(a) Each IRB shall have at least five members, with varying backgrounds to promote complete and adequate review of research activities commonly conducted by the institution. The IRB shall be sufficiently qualified through the experience and expertise of its members (professional competence), and the diversity of its members, including race, gender, and cultural backgrounds and sensitivity to such issues as community attitudes, to promote respect for its advice and counsel in safeguarding the rights and welfare of human subjects. The IRB shall be able to ascertain the acceptability of proposed research in terms of institutional commitments (including policies and resources) and regulations, applicable law, and standards of professional conduct and practice. The IRB shall therefore include persons knowledgeable in these areas. If an IRB regularly reviews research that involves a category of subjects that is vulnerable to coercion or undue influence, such as children, prisoners, individuals with impaired decision-making capacity, or economically or educationally disadvantaged persons, consideration shall be given to the inclusion of one or more individuals who are knowledgeable about and experienced in working with these categories of subjects.
(b) Each IRB shall include at least one member whose primary concerns are in scientific areas and at least one member whose primary concerns are in nonscientific areas.
(c) Each IRB shall include at least one member who is not otherwise affiliated with the institution and who is not part of the immediate family of a person who is affiliated with the institution.
(d) No IRB may have a member participate in the IRB's initial or continuing review of any project in which the member has a conflicting interest, except to provide information requested by the IRB.
(e) An IRB may, in its discretion, invite individuals with competence in special areas to assist in the review of issues that require expertise beyond or in addition to that available on the IRB. These individuals may not vote with the IRB.
§ 27.108
IRB functions and operations.
(a) In order to fulfill the requirements of this policy each IRB shall:
(1) Have access to meeting space and sufficient staff to support the IRB's review and recordkeeping duties;
(2) Prepare and maintain a current list of the IRB members identified by name; earned degrees; representative capacity; indications of experience such as board certifications or licenses sufficient to describe each member's chief anticipated contributions to IRB deliberations; and any employment or other relationship between each member and the institution, for example, full-time employee, part-time employee, member of governing panel or board, stockholder, paid or unpaid consultant;
(3) Establish and follow written procedures for:
(i) Conducting its initial and continuing review of research and for reporting its findings and actions to the investigator and the institution;
(ii) Determining which projects require review more often than annually and which projects need verification from sources other than the investigators that no material changes have occurred since previous IRB review; and
(iii) Ensuring prompt reporting to the IRB of proposed changes in a research activity, and for ensuring that investigators will conduct the research activity in accordance with the terms
of the IRB approval until any proposed changes have been reviewed and approved by the IRB, except when necessary to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to the subject.
(4) Establish and follow written procedures for ensuring prompt reporting to the IRB; appropriate institutional officials; the department or agency head; and the Office for Human Research Protections, HHS, or any successor office, or the equivalent office within the appropriate Federal department or agency of
(i) Any unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others or any serious or continuing noncompliance with this policy or the requirements or determinations of the IRB; and
(ii) Any suspension or termination of IRB approval.
(b) Except when an expedited review procedure is used (as described in § 27.110), an IRB must review proposed research at convened meetings at which a majority of the members of the IRB are present, including at least one member whose primary concerns are in nonscientific areas. In order for the research to be approved, it shall receive the approval of a majority of those members present at the meeting.

§ 27.109
IRB review of research.
(a) An IRB shall review and have authority to approve, require modifications in (to secure approval), or disapprove all research activities covered by this policy, including exempt research activities under § 27.104 for which limited IRB review is a condition of exemption (under § 27.104(d)(2)(iii), (d)(3)(i)(C), and (d)(7), and (8)).
(b) An IRB shall require that information given to subjects (or legally authorized representatives, when appropriate) as part of informed consent is in accordance with § 27.116. The IRB may require that information, in addition to that specifically mentioned in § 27.116, be given to the subjects when in the IRB's judgment the information would meaningfully add to the protection of the rights and welfare of subjects.
(c) An IRB shall require documentation of informed consent or may waive documentation in accordance with § 27.117.
(d) An IRB shall notify investigators and the institution in writing of its decision to approve or disapprove the proposed research activity, or of modifications required to secure IRB approval of the research activity. If the IRB decides to disapprove a research activity, it shall include in its written notification a statement of the reasons for its decision and give the investigator an opportunity to respond in person or in writing.
(e) An IRB shall conduct continuing review of research requiring review by the convened IRB at intervals appropriate to the degree of risk, not less than once per year, except as described in § 27.109(f).

(Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under Control Number 0990-0260)
§ 27.110
Expedited review procedures for certain kinds of research involving no more than minimal risk, and for minor changes in approved research.
(a) The Secretary of HHS has established, and published as a Notice in the
Federal Register,
a list of categories of research that may be reviewed by the IRB through an expedited review
procedure. The Secretary will evaluate the list at least every 8 years and amend it, as appropriate, after consultation with other federal departments and agencies and after publication in the
Federal Register
for public comment. A copy of the list is available from the Office for Human Research Protections, HHS, or any successor office.
(b)(1) An IRB may use the expedited review procedure to review the following:
(i) Some or all of the research appearing on the list described in paragraph (a) of this section, unless the reviewer determines that the study involves more than minimal risk;
(ii) Minor changes in previously approved research during the period for which approval is authorized; or
(iii) Research for which limited IRB review is a condition of exemption under § 27.104(d)(2)(iii), (d)(3)(i)(C), and (d)(7) and (8).
(2) Under an expedited review procedure, the review may be carried out by the IRB chairperson or by one or more experienced reviewers designated by the chairperson from among members of the IRB. In reviewing the research, the reviewers may exercise all of the authorities of the IRB except that the reviewers may not disapprove the research. A research activity may be disapproved only after review in accordance with the nonexpedited procedure set forth in § 27.108(b).
(c) Each IRB that uses an expedited review procedure shall adopt a method for keeping all members advised of research proposals that have been approved under the procedure.
(d) The department or agency head may restrict, suspend, terminate, or choose not to authorize an institution's or IRB's use of the expedited review procedure.
§ 27.111
Criteria for IRB approval of research.
(a) In order to approve research covered by this policy the IRB shall determine that all of the following requirements are satisfied:
(1) Risks to subjects are minimized:
(i) By using procedures that are consistent with sound research design and that do not unnecessarily expose subjects to risk, and
(ii) Whenever appropriate, by using procedures already being performed on the subjects for diagnostic or treatment purposes.
(2) Risks to subjects are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits, if any, to subjects, and the importance of the knowledge that may reasonably be expected to result. In evaluating risks and benefits, the IRB should consider only those risks and benefits that may result from the research (as distinguished from risks and benefits of therapies subjects would receive even if not participating in the research). The IRB should not consider possible long-range effects of applying knowledge gained in the research (e.g., the possible effects of the research on public policy) as among those research risks that fall within the purview of its responsibility.
(3) Selection of subjects is equitable. In making this assessment the IRB should take into account the purposes of the research and the setting in which the research will be conducted. The IRB should be particularly cognizant of the special problems of research that involves a category of subjects who are vulnerable to coercion or undue influence, such as children, prisoners, individuals with impaired decision-making capacity, or economically or educationally disadvantaged persons.
(4) Informed consent will be sought from each prospective subject or the subject's legally authorized representative, in accordance with, and to the extent required by, § 27.116.
(5) Informed consent will be appropriately documented or appropriately waived in accordance with § 27.117.
(6) When appropriate, the research plan makes adequate provision for monitoring the data collected to ensure the safety of subjects.
(7) When appropriate, there are adequate provisions to protect the privacy of subjects and to maintain the confidentiality of data.
(i) The Secretary of HHS will, after consultation with the Office of Management and Budget's privacy office and other Federal departments and agencies that have adopted this policy,
issue guidance to assist IRBs in assessing what provisions are adequate to protect the privacy of subjects and to maintain the confidentiality of data.
(ii) [Reserved]
(8) For purposes of conducting the limited IRB review required by § 27.104(d)(7)), the IRB need not make the determinations at paragraphs (a)(1) through (7) of this section, and shall make the following determinations:
(i) Broad consent for storage, maintenance, and secondary research use of identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens is obtained in accordance with the requirements of § 27.116(a)(1)-(4), (a)(6), and (d);
(ii) Broad consent is appropriately documented or waiver of documentation is appropriate, in accordance with § 27.117; and
(iii) If there is a change made for research purposes in the way the identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens are stored or maintained, there are adequate provisions to protect the privacy of subjects and to maintain the confidentiality of data.
(b) When some or all of the subjects are likely to be vulnerable to coercion or undue influence, such as children, prisoners, individuals with impaired decision-making capacity, or economically or educationally disadvantaged persons, additional safeguards have been included in the study to protect the rights and welfare of these subjects.
§ 27.112
Review by Institution
Research covered by this policy that has been approved by an IRB may be subject to further appropriate review and approval or disapproval by officials of the institution. However, those officials may not approve the research if it has not been approved by an IRB.
§ 27.113
Suspension or Termination of IRB Approval of Research.
An IRB shall have authority to suspend or terminate approval of research that is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB's requirements or that has been associated with unexpected serious harm to subjects. Any suspension or termination of approval shall include a statement of the reasons for the IRB's action and shall be reported promptly to the investigator, appropriate institutional officials, and the department or agency head.
(Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under Control Number 0990-0260)
§ 27.114
Cooperative Research.
(a) Cooperative research projects are those projects covered by this policy that involve more than one institution. In the conduct of cooperative research projects, each institution is responsible for safeguarding the rights and welfare of human subjects and for complying with this policy.
(b)(1) Any institution located in the United States that is engaged in cooperative research must rely upon approval by a single IRB for that portion of the research that is conducted in the United States. The reviewing IRB will be identified by the Federal department or agency supporting or conducting the research or proposed by the lead institution subject to the acceptance of the Federal department or agency supporting the research.
(2) The following research is not subject to this provision:
(i) Cooperative research for which more than single IRB review is required by law (including tribal law passed by the official governing body of an American Indian or Alaska Native tribe); or
(ii) Research for which any Federal department or agency supporting or conducting the research determines and documents that the use of a single IRB is not appropriate for the particular context.
(c) For research not subject to paragraph (b) of this section, an institution participating in a cooperative project may enter into a joint review arrangement, rely on the review of another IRB, or make similar arrangements for avoiding duplication of effort.
§ 27.115
IRB Records.
(a) An institution, or when appropriate an IRB, shall prepare and maintain adequate documentation of IRB activities, including the following:
(1) Copies of all research proposals reviewed, scientific evaluations, if any, that accompany the proposals, approved sample consent forms, progress
reports submitted by investigators, and reports of injuries to subjects.
(2) Minutes of IRB meetings, which shall be in sufficient detail to show attendance at the meetings; actions taken by the IRB; the vote on these actions including the number of members voting for, against, and abstaining; the basis for requiring changes in or disapproving research; and a written summary of the discussion of controverted issues and their resolution.
(3) Records of continuing review activities, including the rationale for conducting continuing review of research that otherwise would not require continuing review as described in § 27.109(f)(1).
(4) Copies of all correspondence between the IRB and the investigators.
(5) A list of IRB members in the same detail as described in § 27.108(a)(2).
(6) Written procedures for the IRB in the same detail as described in § 27.108(a)(3) and (4).
(7) Statements of significant new findings provided to subjects, as required by § 27.116(c)(5).
(8) The rationale for an expedited reviewer's determination under § 27.110(b)(1)(i) that research appearing on the expedited review list described in § 27.110(a) is more than minimal risk.
(9) Documentation specifying the responsibilities that an institution and an organization operating an IRB each will undertake to ensure compliance with the requirements of this policy, as described in § 27.103(e).
(b) The records required by this policy shall be retained for at least 3 years, and records relating to research that is conducted shall be retained for at least 3 years after completion of the research. The institution or IRB may maintain the records in printed form, or electronically. All records shall be accessible for inspection and copying by authorized representatives of the Federal department or agency at reasonable times and in a reasonable manner.

(iii) If the research involves using identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens, the research could not practicably be carried out without using such information or biospecimens in an identifiable format;
(iv) The waiver or alteration will not adversely affect the rights and welfare of the subjects; and
(v) Whenever appropriate, the subjects or legally authorized representatives will be provided with additional pertinent information after participation.
(g)
Screening, recruiting, or determining eligibility.
An IRB may approve a research proposal in which an investigator will obtain information or biospecimens for the purpose of screening, recruiting, or determining the eligibility of prospective subjects without the informed consent of the prospective subject or the subject's legally authorized representative, if either of the following conditions are met:
(1) The investigator will obtain information through oral or written communication with the prospective subject or legally authorized representative, or
(2) The investigator will obtain identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens by accessing records or stored identifiable biospecimens.
(h)
Posting of clinical trial consent form.
(1) For each clinical trial conducted or supported by a Federal department or agency, one IRB-approved informed consent form used to enroll subjects must be posted by the awardee or the Federal department or agency component conducting the trial on a publicly available Federal Web site that will be established as a repository for such informed consent forms.
(2) If the Federal department or agency supporting or conducting the clinical trial determines that certain information should not be made publicly available on a Federal Web site (e.g. confidential commercial information), such Federal department or agency may permit or require redactions to the information posted.
(3) The informed consent form must be posted on the Federal Web site after the clinical trial is closed to recruitment, and no later than 60 days after the last study visit by any subject, as required by the protocol.
(i)
Preemption.
The informed consent requirements in this policy are not intended to preempt any applicable Federal, state, or local laws (including tribal laws passed by the official governing body of an American Indian or Alaska Native tribe) that require additional information to be disclosed in order for informed consent to be legally effective.
(j)
Emergency medical care.
Nothing in this policy is intended to limit the authority of a physician to provide emergency medical care, to the extent the physician is permitted to do so under applicable Federal, state, or local law (including tribal law passed by the official governing body of an American Indian or Alaska Native tribe).
(Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under Control Number 0990-0260)
§ 27.117
Documentation of informed consent.
(a) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, informed consent shall be documented by the use of a written informed consent form approved by the IRB and signed (including in an electronic format) by the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative. A written copy shall be given to the person signing the informed consent form.
(b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, the informed consent form may be either of the following:
(1) A written informed consent form that meets the requirements of § 27.116. The investigator shall give either the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative adequate opportunity to read the informed consent form before it is signed; alternatively, this form may be read to the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative.
(2) A short form written informed consent form stating that the elements of informed consent required by § 27.116 have been presented orally to the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative, and that the key information required by § 27.116(a)(5)(i) was presented first to the subject, before other information, if any, was provided. The IRB shall approve a written summary of what is to be said to the subject or the legally authorized representative. When this method is used, there shall be a witness to the oral presentation. Only the short form itself is to be signed by the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative. However, the witness shall sign both the short form and a copy of the summary, and the person actually obtaining consent shall sign a copy of the summary. A copy of the summary shall be given to the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative, in addition to a copy of the short form.
(c)(1) An IRB may waive the requirement for the investigator to obtain a signed informed consent form for some or all subjects if it finds any of the following:
(i) That the only record linking the subject and the research would be the
informed consent form and the principal risk would be potential harm resulting from a breach of confidentiality. Each subject (or legally authorized representative) will be asked whether the subject wants documentation linking the subject with the research, and the subject's wishes will govern;
(ii) That the research presents no more than minimal risk of harm to subjects and involves no procedures for which written consent is normally required outside of the research context; or
(iii) If the subjects or legally authorized representatives are members of a distinct cultural group or community in which signing forms is not the norm, that the research presents no more than minimal risk of harm to subjects and provided there is an appropriate alternative mechanism for documenting that informed consent was obtained.
(2) In cases in which the documentation requirement is waived, the IRB may require the investigator to provide subjects or legally authorized representatives with a written statement regarding the research.
(Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under Control Number 0990-0260)
§ 27.118
Applications and proposals lacking definite plans for involvement of human subjects.
Certain types of applications for grants, cooperative agreements, or contracts are submitted to Federal departments or agencies with the knowledge that subjects may be involved within the period of support, but definite plans would not normally be set forth in the application or proposal. These include activities such as institutional type grants when selection of specific projects is the institution's responsibility; research training grants in which the activities involving subjects remain to be selected; and projects in which human subjects' involvement will depend upon completion of instruments, prior animal studies, or purification of compounds. Except for research waived under § 27.101(i) or exempted under § 27.104, no human subjects may be involved in any project supported by these awards until the project has been reviewed and approved by the IRB, as provided in this policy, and certification submitted, by the institution, to the Federal department or agency component supporting the research.
§ 27.119
Research undertaken without the intention of involving human subjects.
Except for research waived under § 27.101(i) or exempted under § 27.104, in the event research is undertaken without the intention of involving human subjects, but it is later proposed to involve human subjects in the research, the research shall first be reviewed and approved by an IRB, as provided in this policy, a certification submitted by the institution to the Federal department or agency component supporting the research, and final approval given to the proposed change by the Federal department or agency component.
§ 27.120
Evaluation and disposition of applications and proposals for research to be conducted or supported by a Federal department or agency.
(a) The department or agency head will evaluate all applications and proposals involving human subjects submitted to the Federal department or agency through such officers and employees of the Federal department or agency and such experts and consultants as the department or agency head determines to be appropriate. This evaluation will take into consideration the risks to the subjects, the adequacy of protection against these risks, the potential benefits of the research to the subjects and others, and the importance of the knowledge gained or to be gained.
(b) On the basis of this evaluation, the department or agency head may approve or disapprove the application or proposal, or enter into negotiations to develop an approvable one.
§ 27.121
[Reserved]
§ 27.122
Use of Federal funds.
Federal funds administered by a Federal department or agency may not be expended for research involving human subjects unless the requirements of this policy have been satisfied.
§ 27.123
Early termination of research support: Evaluation of applications and proposals.
(a) The department or agency head may require that Federal department or agency support for any project be terminated or suspended in the manner prescribed in applicable program requirements, when the department or agency head finds an institution has materially failed to comply with the terms of this policy.
(b) In making decisions about supporting or approving applications or proposals covered by this policy the department or agency head may take into account, in addition to all other eligibility requirements and program criteria, factors such as whether the applicant has been subject to a termination or suspension under paragraph (a) of this section and whether the applicant or the person or persons who would direct or has/have directed the scientific and technical aspects of an activity has/have, in the judgment of the department or agency head, materially failed to discharge responsibility for the protection of the rights and welfare of human subjects (whether or not the research was subject to federal regulation).
§ 27.124
Conditions.
With respect to any research project or any class of research projects the department or agency head of either the conducting or the supporting Federal department or agency may impose additional conditions prior to or at the time of approval when in the judgment of the department or agency head additional conditions are necessary for the protection of human subjects.

# Subpart B—Activities by Own Employees
§ 28.200
Agency and legislative liaison.
(a) The prohibition on the use of appropriated funds, in § 28.100 (a), does not apply in the case of a payment of reasonable compensation made to an officer or employee of a person requesting or receiving a Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement if the payment is for agency and legislative liaison activities not directly related to a covered Federal action.
(b) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, providing any information specifically requested by an agency or Congress is allowable at any time.
(c) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, the following agency and legislative liaison activities are allowable at any time only where they are not related to a specific solicitation for any covered Federal action:
(1) Discussing with an agency (including individual demonstrations) the
qualities and characteristics of the person's products or services, conditions or terms of sale, and service capabilities; and,
(2) Technical discussions and other activities regarding the application or adaptation of the person's products or services for an agency's use.
(d) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, the following agencies and legislative liaison activities are allowable only where they are prior to formal solicitation of any covered Federal action:
(1) Providing any information not specifically requested but necessary for an agency to make an informed decision about initiation of a covered Federal action;
(2) Technical discussions regarding the preparation of an unsolicited proposal prior to its official submission; and,
(3) Capability presentations by persons seeking awards from an agency pursuant to the provisions of the Small Business Act, as amended by Public Law 95-507 and other subsequent amendments.
(e) Only those activities expressly authorized by this section are allowable under this section.
§ 28.205
Professional and technical services.
(a) The prohibition on the use of appropriated funds, in § 28.100(a), does not apply in the case of a payment of reasonable compensation made to an officer or employee of a person requesting or receiving a Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement or an extension, continuation, renewal, amendment, or modification of a Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement if payment is for professional or technical services rendered directly in the preparation, submission, or negotiation of any bid, proposal, or application for that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement or for meeting requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement.
(b) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, “professional and technical services” shall be limited to advice and analysis directly applying any professional or technical discipline. For example, drafting of a legal document accompanying a bid or proposal by a lawyer is allowable. Similarly, technical advice provided by an engineer on the performance or operational capability of a piece of equipment rendered directly in the negotiation of a contract is allowable. However, communications with the intent to influence made by a professional (such as a licensed lawyer) or a technical person (such as a licensed accountant) are not allowable under this section unless they provide advice and analysis directly applying their professional or technical expertise and unless the advice or analysis is rendered directly and solely in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action. Thus, for example, communications with the intent to influence made by a lawyer that do not provide legal advice or analysis directly and solely related to the legal aspects of his or her client's proposal, but generally advocate one proposal over another are not allowable under this section because the lawyer is not providing professional legal services. Similarly, communications with the intent to influence made by an engineer providing an engineering analysis prior to the preparation or submission of a bid or proposal are not allowable under this section since the engineer is providing technical services but not directly in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action.
(c) Requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving a covered Federal award include those required by law or regulation, or reasonably expected to be required by law or regulation, and any other requirements in the actual award documents.
(d) Only those services expressly authorized by this section are allowable under this section.
§ 28.210
Reporting.
No reporting is required with respect to payments of reasonable compensation made to regularly employed officers or employees of a person.

# Subpart C—Activities by Other Than Own Employees
§ 28.300
Professional and technical services.
(a) The prohibition on the use of appropriated funds, in § 28.100 (a), does not apply in the case of any reasonable payment to a person, other than an officer or employee of a person requesting or receiving a covered Federal action, if the payment is for professional or technical services rendered directly in the preparation, submission, or negotiation of any bid, proposal, or application for that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement or for meeting requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement.
(b) The reporting requirements in § 28.110 (a) and (b) regarding filing a disclosure form by each person, if required, shall not apply with respect to professional or technical services rendered directly in the preparation, submission, or negotiation of any commitment providing for the United States to insure or guarantee a loan.
(c) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, “professional and technical services” shall be limited to advice and analysis directly applying any professional or technical discipline. For example, drafting or a legal document accompanying a bid or proposal by a lawyer is allowable. Similarly, technical advice provided by an engineer on the performance or operational capability of a piece of equipment rendered directly in the negotiation of a contract is allowable. However, communications with the intent to influence made by a professional (such as a licensed lawyer) or a technical person (such as a licensed accountant) are not allowable under this section unless they provide advice and analysis directly applying their professional or technical expertise and unless the advice or analysis is rendered directly and solely in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action. Thus, for example, communications with the intent to influence made by a lawyer that do not provide legal advice or analysis directly and solely related to the legal aspects of his or her client's proposal, but generally advocate one proposal over another are not allowable under this section because the lawyer is not providing professional legal services. Similarly, communications with the intent to influence made by an engineer providing an engineering analysis prior to the preparation or submission of a bid or proposal are not allowable under this section since the engineer is providing technical services but not directly in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action.
(d) Requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving a covered Federal award include those required by law or regulation, or reasonably expected to be required by law or regulation, and any other requirements in the actual award documents.
(e) Persons other than officers or employees of a person requesting or receiving a covered Federal action include consultants and trade associations.
(f) Only those services expressly authorized by this section are allowable under this section.

# Subpart D—Penalties and Enforcement
§ 28.400
Penalties.
(a) Any person who makes an expenditure prohibited herein shall be subject to a civil penalty of not less than $10,000 and not more than $100,000 for each such expenditure made on or before October 23, 1996, and of not less than $11,000 and not more than $110,000 for each such expenditure made after October 23, 1996.
(b) Any person who fails to file or amend the disclosure form (see appendix B of this part) to be filed or amended if required herein, shall be subject to a civil penalty of not less than $10,000 and not more than $100,000 for each such failure occurring on or before October 23, 1996, and of not less than $11,000 and not more than $110,000 for each such failure occurring after October 23, 1996.
(c) A filing or amended filing on or after the date on which an administrative action for the imposition of a civil
penalty is commenced does not prevent the imposition of such civil penalty for a failure occurring before that date. An administrative action is commenced with respect to a failure when an investigating official determines in writing to commence an investigation of an allegation of such failure.
(d) In determining whether to impose a civil penalty, and the amount of any such penalty, by reason of a violation by any person, the agency shall consider the nature, circumstances, extent, and gravity of the violation, the effect on the ability of such person to continue in business, any prior violations by such person, the degree of culpability of such person, the ability of the person to pay the penalty, and such other matters as may be appropriate.
(e) First offenders under paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section shall be subject to a civil penalty of $10,000, absent aggravating circumstances for each such offense committed on or before October 23, 1996, and $11,000 for each such offense committed after October 23, 1996. Second and subsequent offenses by persons shall be subject to an appropriate civil penalty between $10,000 and $100,000 for each such offense committed on or before October 23, 1996, and between $11,000 and $110,000 for each such offense committed after October 23, 1996, as determined by the agency head or his or her designee.
(f) An imposition of a civil penalty under this section does not prevent the United States from seeking any other remedy that may apply to the same conduct that is the basis for the imposition of such civil penalty.
[55 FR 6737, 6748, Feb. 26, 1990, as amended at 61 FR 55095, Oct. 24, 1996]
§ 28.405
Penalty procedures.
Agencies shall impose and collect civil penalties pursuant to the provisions of the Program Fraud and Civil Remedies Act, 31 U.S.C. sections 3803 (except subsection (c)), 3804, 3805, 3806, 3807, 3808, and 3812, insofar as these provisions are not inconsistent with the requirements herein.
§ 28.410

The Secretary shall transmit a copy of each such written exemption to Congress immediately after making such a determination.
(b) The Department of Defense may issue supplemental regulations to implement paragraph (a) of this section.

# Subpart F—Agency Reports
§ 28.600
Semi-annual compilation.
(a) The head of each agency shall collect and compile the disclosure reports (see appendix B) and, on May 31 and November 30 of each year, submit to the Secretary of the Senate and the Clerk of the House of Representatives a report containing a compilation of the information contained in the disclosure reports received during the six-month period ending on March 31 or September 30, respectively, of that year.
(b) The report, including the compilation, shall be available for public inspection 30 days after receipt of the report by the Secretary and the Clerk.

# Subpart A—General Requirements
§ 30.1
Purpose and definitions.
(a) This part sets forth the Foreign Trade Regulations (FTR) as required under the provisions of Title 13, United States Code (U.S.C.), Chapter 9, section 301. These regulations are revised pursuant to provisions of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Public Law 107-228 (the Act). This Act authorizes the Secretary of Commerce, with the concurrence of the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security, to publish regulations mandating that all persons who are required to file export information under Chapter 9 of 13 U.S.C., file such information through the Automated Export System (AES) for all shipments where a Shipper's Export Declaration (SED) was previously required. The law further authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to issue regulations regarding imposition of civil and criminal penalties for violations of the provisions of the Act and these regulations.
(b) Electronic filing through the AES strengthens the U.S. government's ability to prevent the export of certain items to unauthorized destinations and/or end users because the AES aids in targeting, identifying, and when necessary confiscating suspicious or illegal shipments prior to exportation.

# Note to paragraph (
a

# )(1)(
iv

# ):
For the filing requirement for exports destined for a country in Country Group E:1 or E:2 as set forth in the Supplement No. 1 to 15 CFR part 740, see FTR § 30.16.
(2)
Filing methods.
The USPPI has four means for filing EEI: use AES
Direct;
develop AES software using the AESTIR (see
www.cbp.gov/xp/cgov/trade/automated/aes/tech_docs/aestir/
); purchase software developed by certified vendors using the AESTIR; or use an authorized agent. An FPPI can only use an authorized agent in a routed transaction.
(b)
General requirements
—(1) The EEI shall be filed prior to exportation (see § 30.4) unless the USPPI has been approved to submit export data on a postdeparture basis (see § 30.5(c)). Shipments requiring a license or license exemption may be filed postdeparture only when the appropriate licensing agency has granted the USPPI authorization. See Subpart B of this part.
(2) Specific data elements required for EEI filing are contained in § 30.6.
(3) The AES downtime procedures provide uniform instructions for processing export transactions when the government's AES or AES
Direct
is unavailable for transmission. (See § 30.4(b)(1) and (4)).
(4) Instructions for particular types of transactions and exemptions from these requirements are found in Subparts C and D of this part.
(5) The EEI is required to be filed in the AES prior to export for shipments by vessel going directly to the countries identified in U.S. Customs and Border Protection regulations 19 CFR 4.75(c) and by aircraft going directly or indirectly to those countries. (See U.S. Customs and Border Protection regulations 19 CFR 122.74(b)(2).)
(c)
Application and certification process.
The USPPI or authorized agent will either submit an ACE Exporter Account Application or a Letter of Intent based on their transmission method and, as a result, may be subject to the certification process.
(1)
AESDirect.
USPPIs or authorized agents who choose to file via the AESDirect shall complete an online ACE Exporter Account Application. In addition, once the ACE Exporter Account is created, all users must agree to the AES Certification Statements prior to filing through AESDirect.
(2)
Methods other than AESDirect.
USPPIs or authorized agents who choose to file by a means other than AESDirect shall submit a Letter of Intent to CBP and may be required to complete the certification process.
(i)
Certification.
A two-part communication test to ascertain whether the system is capable of both transmitting data to and receiving responses from the AES. CBP client representatives make the sole determination as to whether or not the system of the self-programming filer, service center, or software vendor passes certification.
(ii)
Parties requiring certification:
(A) Self-programming USPPIs or authorized agents;
(B) Service centers; and
(C) Software vendors who develop AES software.
(d)
Exclusions from filing EEI.
The following types of transactions are outside the scope of this part and shall be excluded from EEI filing.
(1) Goods shipped under CBP bond through the United States, Puerto Rico, or the U.S. Virgin Islands from one foreign country or area to another where such goods do not enter the consumption channels of the United States.
(2) Except Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, goods shipped from the U.S. territories and goods shipped between the United States and these territories do not require EEI filing. However, goods transiting U.S. territories to foreign destinations require EEI filing.
(3) Electronic transmissions and intangible transfers.
(4) Goods shipped to Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba from the United States, Puerto Rico, or the U.S. Virgin Islands and from Guantanamo Bay Naval Base to the United States, Puerto Rico, or the U.S. Virgin Islands.

(5) Goods licensed by a U.S. federal government agency where the country of ultimate destination is the United States or goods destined to international waters where the person(s) or entity assuming control of the item(s) is a citizen or permanent resident alien of the United States or a juridical entity organized under the laws of the United States or a jurisdiction within the United States.
(e)
Penalties.
Failure of the USPPI, the authorized agent of either the USPPI or the FPPI, the exporting carrier, or any other person subject thereto to comply with any of the requirements of the regulations in this part renders such persons subject to the penalties provided for in Subpart H of this part.
[73 FR 31555, June 2, 2008, as amended at 78 FR 16375, Mar. 14, 2013; 82 FR 18389, Apr. 19, 2017; 88 FR 54326, Aug. 10, 2023]
§ 30.3
Electronic Export Information filer requirements, parties to export transactions, and responsibilities of parties to export transactions.
(a)
General requirements.
The filer of EEI for export transactions is either the USPPI, or the U.S. authorized agent. All EEI submitted to the AES shall be complete, correct, and based on personal knowledge of the facts stated or on information furnished by the parties to the export transaction. The filer shall be physically located in the United States at the time of filing, have an EIN or DUNS and be certified to report in the AES. In the event that the filer does not have an EIN or DUNS, the filer must obtain an EIN from the Internal Revenue Service. The filer is responsible for the truth, accuracy, and completeness of the EEI, except insofar as that party can demonstrate that it reasonably relied on information furnished by other responsible persons participating in the transaction. All parties involved in export transactions, including U.S. authorized agents, should be aware that
invoices and other commercial documents may not necessarily contain all the information needed to prepare the EEI. The parties shall ensure that all information needed for reporting to the AES, including correct export licensing information, is provided to the U.S. authorized agent for the purpose of correctly preparing the EEI.
(b)
Parties to the export transaction
—(1)
Principal parties in interest.
Those persons in a transaction that receive the primary benefit, monetary or otherwise, are considered principal parties to the transaction. Generally, the principal parties in interest in a transaction are the seller and buyer. In most cases, the forwarding or other agent is not a principal party in interest.
(2)
USPPI.
For purposes of filing EEI, the USPPI is the person or legal entity in the United States that receives the primary benefit, monetary or otherwise, from the transaction. Generally, that person or entity is the U.S. seller, manufacturer, order party, or foreign entity if in the United States at the time goods are purchased or obtained for export. The foreign entity shall be listed as the USPPI if it is in the United States when the items are purchased or obtained for export. The foreign entity shall then follow the provisions for filing the EEI specified in §§ 30.3 and 30.6 pertaining to the USPPI.
(i) If a U.S. manufacturer sells goods directly to an entity in a foreign area, the U.S. manufacturer shall be listed as the USPPI in the EEI.
(ii) If a U.S. manufacturer sells goods, as a domestic sale, to a U.S. buyer (wholesaler/distributor) and that U.S. buyer sells the goods for export to a FPPI, the U.S. buyer (wholesaler/distributor) shall be listed as the USPPI in the EEI.
(iii) If a U.S. order party directly arranges for the sale and export of goods to the FPPI, the U.S. order party shall be listed as the USPPI in the EEI.
(iv) If a customs broker is listed as the importer of record when entering goods into the United States for immediate consumption or warehousing entry, the customs broker may be listed as the USPPI in the EEI if the goods are subsequently exported without change or enhancement.
(v) If a foreign person is listed as the importer of record when entering goods into the United States for immediate consumption or warehousing entry, the customs broker who entered the goods, may be listed as the USPPI in the EEI if the goods are subsequently exported without change or enhancement.
(3)
Authorized agent.
The agent shall be authorized by the USPPI or, in the case of a routed export transaction, the agent shall be authorized by the FPPI to prepare and file the EEI. In a routed export transaction, the authorized agent can be the “exporter” for export control purposes as defined in 15 CFR 772.1 of the U.S. Department of Commerce EAR. However, the authorized agent shall not be shown as the USPPI in the EEI unless the agent acts as a USPPI in the export transaction as defined in paragraphs (b)(2)(iii), (iv), and (v) of this section.
(4)
Carrier.
A carrier is an individual or legal entity in the business of transporting passengers or goods. Airlines, trucking companies, railroad companies, shipping lines, and pipeline companies are all examples of carriers.
(c)
General responsibilities of parties in export transactions
—(1)
USPPI responsibilities.
(i) The USPPI can prepare and file the EEI itself, or it can authorize an agent to prepare and file the EEI on its behalf. If the USPPI prepares the EEI itself, the USPPI is responsible for the accuracy and timely transmission of all the export information reported to the AES.
(ii) When the USPPI authorizes an agent to file the EEI on its behalf, the USPPI is responsible for:
(A) Providing the authorized agent with accurate and timely export information necessary to file the EEI.
(B) Providing the authorized agent with a power of attorney or written authorization to file the EEI (see paragraph (f) of this section for written authorization requirements for agents).
(C) Retaining documentation to support the information provided to the authorized agent for filing the EEI, as specified in § 30.10.
(2)
Authorized agent responsibilities.
The agent, when authorized by a USPPI to prepare and file the EEI for an export transaction, is responsible for performing the following activities:

(ii) Obtaining a power of attorney or written authorization from the USPPI to file the EEI.
(iii) Retaining documentation to support the information reported to the AES, as specified in § 30.10.
(iv) Upon request, providing the USPPI with a copy of the export information filed in a mutually agreed upon format.
(3)
Carrier responsibilities.
(i) The carrier must not load or move cargo unless the required documentation, from the USPPI or authorized agent, contains the required AES proof of filing, postdeparture, downtime, exclusion or exemption citations. This information must be cited on the first page of the bill of lading, air waybill, or other commercial loading documents.
(ii) The carrier must annotate the AES proof of filing, postdeparture, downtime, exclusion or exemption citations on the carrier's outbound manifest when required.
(iii) The carrier is responsible for presenting the required AES proof of filing, postdeparture, downtime, exclusion or exemption citations to the CBP Port Director at the port of export as stated in Subpart E of this part. Such presentation shall be without material change or amendment of the proof of filing, postdeparture, downtime, exclusion or exemption citation.
(iv) The carrier shall notify the USPPI or the authorized agent of changes to the transportation data, and the USPPI or the authorized agent shall electronically transmit the corrections, cancellations, or amendments as soon as the corrections are known in accordance with § 30.9. Manifest amendments must be made in accordance with CBP regulations.
(v) Retain documents pertaining to the export shipment as specified in § 30.10.
(d)

(e)
Responsibilities of parties in a routed export transaction.
The Census Bureau recognizes “routed export transactions” as a subset of export transactions. A routed export transaction is a transaction in which the FPPI authorizes a U.S. agent to facilitate the export of items from the United States and to prepare and file EEI.
(1)
USPPI responsibilities.
In a routed export transaction, the FPPI may authorize or agree to allow the USPPI to prepare and file the EEI. If the FPPI agrees to allow the USPPI to file the EEI, the FPPI must provide a written authorization to the USPPI assuming the responsibility for filing. The USPPI may authorize an agent to file the EEI on its behalf. If the USPPI or its agent prepares and files the EEI, it shall retain documentation to support the EEI filed. If the FPPI agrees to allow the USPPI to file EEI, the filing of the export transaction shall be treated as a routed export transaction. If the FPPI authorizes an agent to prepare and file the EEI, the USPPI shall retain documentation to support the information provided to the agent for preparing the EEI as specified in § 30.10 and provide the agent with the following information to assist in preparing the EEI:
(i) Name and address of the USPPI.
(ii) USPPI Identification Number.
(iii) State of origin (State).
(iv) FTZ if applicable.
(v) Commercial description of commodities.
(vi) Origin of goods indicator: Domestic (D) or Foreign (F).
(vii) Schedule B or HTSUSA, Classification Commodity Code.
(viii) Quantities/units of measure.
(ix) Value.
(x) Export Control Classification Number (ECCN) or sufficient technical information to determine the ECCN.
(xi) All licensing information necessary to file the EEI for commodities where the Department of State, the Department of Commerce, or other U.S. government agency issues a license for the commodities being exported, or the merchandise is being exported under a license exemption or license exception.
(xii) Any information that it knows will affect the determination of license authorization (see Subpart B of this part for additional information on licensing requirements).

# Note to paragraph (
e

# )(1) of this section:
For items in paragraph (e) (1) (ix), (x),(xi) and (xii) of this section, where the FPPI has assumed responsibility for determining and obtaining license authority see requirements set forth in 15 CFR 758.3 of the EAR.
(2)
Authorized agent responsibilities.
In a routed export transaction, if an authorized agent is preparing and filing the EEI on behalf of the FPPI, the authorized agent must obtain a power of attorney or written authorization from the FPPI and prepare and file the EEI based on information obtained from the USPPI or other parties involved in the transaction. The authorized agent shall be responsible for filing EEI accurately and timely in accordance with the FTR. Upon request, the authorized agent will provide the USPPI with a copy of the power of attorney or written authorization from the FPPI. The authorized agent shall also retain documentation to support the EEI reported through the AES. The authorized agent shall upon request, provide the USPPI with the data elements in paragraphs (e)(1)(i) through (xii) of this section, the date of export as submitted through the AES, the filer name, and the ITN. The authorized agent shall provide the following information through the AES:

(x) Port of export.
(xi) Foreign port of unlading.
(xii) Shipping weight.
(xiii) ECCN.
(xiv) License or license exemption information.
(xv) Ultimate consignee type.

# Note to paragraph (
e

# )(2) of this section:
For items in paragraphs (e)(2)(xiii) and (xiv) of this section, where the FPPI has assumed responsibility for determining and obtaining license authority, see requirements set forth in 15 CFR 758.3 of the EAR.
(f)
Authorizing an agent.
In a power of attorney or other written authorization, authority is conferred upon an agent to perform certain specified acts or kinds of acts on behalf of a principal (see 15 CFR 758.1(h) of the EAR). In cases where an authorized agent is filing EEI to the AES, the agent shall obtain a power of attorney or written authorization from a principal party in interest to file the information on its behalf. A power of attorney or written authorization should specify the responsibilities of the parties with particularity and should state that the agent has authority to act on behalf of a principal party in interest as its true and lawful agent for purposes of creating and filing EEI in accordance with the laws and regulations of the United States. In routed export transactions the USPPI is not required to provide an agent of the FPPI with a power of attorney or written authorization.

# Note to § 30.3:
The EAR defines the “exporter” as the person in the United States who has the authority of a principal party in interest to determine and control the sending of items out of the United States (see 15 CFR 772 of the EAR). For statistical purposes “exporter” is not defined in the FTR. Instead, however, the USPPI is defined in the FTR.
For purposes of licensing responsibility under the EAR, the U.S. agent of the FPPI may be the “exporter” or applicant on the license in certain routed export transactions (see 15 CFR 758.3 of the EAR). Therefore, due to the differences in export reporting requirements among Federal agencies, conformity of documentation is not required in the FTR.

§ 30.4
Electronic Export Information filing procedures, deadlines, and certification statements.
Two electronic filing options (predeparture and postdeparture) for transmitting EEI are available to the USPPI or authorized agent. The electronic postdeparture filing takes into account that complete information concerning export shipments may not always be available prior to exportation and accommodates these circumstances by providing, when authorized, for filing of EEI after departure. For example, for exports of seasonal and agricultural commodities, only estimated quantities, values, and consignees may be known prior to exportation. The procedures for obtaining certification as an AES filer and for applying for authorization to file on a postdeparture basis are described in § 30.5.
(a)
EEI transmitted predeparture.
The EEI shall always be transmitted prior to departure for the following types of shipments:
(1) Used self-propelled vehicles as defined in 19 CFR 192.1 of U.S. Customs and Border Protection regulations.
(2) Essential and precursor chemicals requiring a permit from the DEA;
(3) Shipments defined as “sensitive” by Executive Order;
(4) Shipments where a U.S. government agency requires predeparture filing;
(5) Shipments defined as “routed export transactions” (see § 30.3(e));
(6) Shipments where complete outbound manifests are required prior to clearing vessels going directly to the countries identified in U.S. Customs and Border Protection regulations 19 CFR 4.75(c) and aircraft going directly or indirectly to those countries. (See U.S. Customs and Border Protection regulation 19 CFR 122.74(b)(2));
(7) Items identified on the USML of the ITAR (22 CFR 121);
(8) Shipments that require a license from the BIS and exports listed under BIS's grounds for denial of postdeparture filing status (see 15 CFR 758.2);
(9) Shipments that require a license from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
(10) Shipments of rough diamonds classified under HS subheadings 7102.10, 7102.21, and 7102.31 and exported (reexported) in accordance with the Kimberley Process; and
(11) Shipments for which the USPPI has not been approved for postdeparture filing.
(b)
Filing deadlines for EEI transmitted predeparture.
The USPPI or the authorized agent shall file the required EEI and have received the AES ITN no later than the time period specified as follows:
(1) For USML shipments, refer to the ITAR (22 CFR 123.22(b)(1)) for specific requirements concerning predeparture filing time frames. In addition, if a filer is unable to acquire an ITN because the AES or AES
Direct
is not operating, the filer shall not export until the AES is operating and an ITN is acquired. The downtime filing citation is not to be used when the filer's system is down or experiencing delays.
(2) For non-USML shipments, except shipments between the United States and Puerto Rico, file the EEI and provide the ITN as follows (See § 30.4(b)(3), for filing timeframes for shipments between the United States and Puerto Rico):
(i) For vessel cargo, the USPPI or the authorized agent shall file the EEI required by § 30.6 and provide the filing citation or exemption legend to the exporting carrier twenty-four hours prior to loading cargo on the vessel at the U.S. port where the cargo is laden.
(ii) For air cargo, including cargo being transported by Air Express Couriers, the USPPI or the authorized agent shall file the EEI required by § 30.6 and provide the filing citation or
exemption legend to the exporting carrier no later than two (2) hours prior to the scheduled departure time of the aircraft.
(iii) For truck cargo, including cargo departing by Express Consignment Couriers, the USPPI or the authorized agent shall file the EEI required by § 30.6 and provide the filing citation or exemption legend to the exporting carrier no later than one (1) hour prior to the arrival of the truck at the United States border to go foreign.
(iv) For rail cargo, the USPPI or the authorized agent shall file the EEI required by § 30.6 and provide the filing citation or exemption legend to the exporting carrier no later than two (2) hours prior to the time the train arrives at the U.S. border to go foreign.
(v) For mail, the USPPI or the authorized agent shall file the EEI as required by § 30.6 and provide the proof of filing citation, postdeparture filing citation, AES downtime filing citation, exemption or exclusion legend to the U.S. Postal Service no later than two (2) hours prior to exportation.
(vi) For all other modes, the USPPI or the authorized agent shall file the required EEI no later than two (2) hours prior to exportation.
(3) For shipments between the United States and Puerto Rico, the USPPI or authorized agent shall provide the proof of filing citation, postdeparture filing citation, AES downtime filing citation, exemption or exclusion legend to the exporting carrier by the time the shipment arrives at the port of unlading.
(4) For non-USML shipments when the AES or AES
Direct
is unavailable, use the following instructions:
(i) If the participant's AES is unavailable, the filer must delay the export of the goods or find an alternative filing method;
(ii) If AES or AES
Direct
is unavailable, the goods may be exported and the filer must:
(A) Provide the appropriate downtime filing citation as described in § 30.7(b) and appendix B of this part; and
(B) Report the EEI at the first opportunity AES or AES
Direct
is available.
(5) For used self-propelled vehicles as defined in 19 CFR 192.1 of U.S. Customs and Border Protection regulations, the USPPI or the authorized agent shall file the EEI as required by § 30.6 and provide the filing citation to the CBP at least 72 hours prior to export. The filer must also provide the carrier with the filing citation as required by paragraph (b) of this section.
(c)
EEI transmitted postdeparture
—(1)
Postdeparture filing procedures.
Postdeparture filing is only available for approved USPPIs. For all methods of transportation other than pipeline, approved USPPIs or their authorized agent may file data elements required in accordance with § 30.6 no later than five (5) calendar days after the date of exportation, except for shipments where predeparture filing is specifically required.
(2)
Pipeline filing procedures.
USPPIs or authorized agents may file data elements required by § 30.6 no later than four (4) calendar days following the end of the month. The operator of a pipeline may transport goods to a foreign country without the prior filing of the proof of filing citation, exemption, or exclusion legend, on the condition that within four (4) calendar days following the end of each calendar month the operator will deliver to the CBP Port Director the proof of filing citation, exemption, or exclusion legend covering all exports through the pipeline to each consignee during the month.
(d)
Proof of filing citation and exemption and exclusion legends.
The USPPI or the authorized agent shall provide the exporting carrier with the proof of filing citation and exemption and exclusion legends as described in § 30.7.
(e)
Collection of KPCs and voided KPCs.
Any voided KPC must be faxed by the voiding party to the Census Bureau on (800) 457-7328, or provided by other methods as permitted by the Census Bureau, immediately upon voiding. The collection of KPCs, including voided KPCs, is performed pursuant to the Clean Diamond Trade Act, Public Law 108-19, 19 U.S.C. Section 3901
et seq.
(CDTA), and Executive Order 13312, and not Title 13, U.S.C.
[73 FR 31555, June 2, 2008, as amended at 78 FR 16376, Mar. 14, 2013; 82 FR 18390, Apr. 19, 2017; 82 FR 43843, Sept. 20, 2017; 83 FR 17751, Apr. 24, 2018]
§ 30.5
Electronic Export Information filing processes and standards.
(a)-(b) [Reserved]
(c)
Postdeparture filing approval process.
Postdeparture filing is a privilege granted to approved USPPIs for their EEI to be filed up to five (5) calendar days after the date of export. The USPPI or its authorized agent may not transmit EEI postdeparture for certain types of shipments that are identified in § 30.4(a). The USPPI may apply for postdeparture filing privileges by submitting a postdeparture filing application at
www.census.gov/aes.
An authorized agent may not apply on behalf of a USPPI. The Census Bureau will distribute the applications submitted by USPPI's who are applying for postdeparture to the CBP and the other federal government partnership agencies for their review and approval. Failure to meet the standards of the Census Bureau, CBP or any of the partnership agencies is reason for denial of the AES applicant for postdeparture filing privileges. Each partnership agency will develop its own internal postdeparture filing acceptance standards, and each agency will notify the Census Bureau of the USPPI's success or failure to meet that agency's acceptance standards. Any partnership agency may require additional information from USPPIs that are applying for postdeparture filing. The Census Bureau will notify the USPPI of the decision to either deny or approve its application for postdeparture filing privileges within ninety (90) calendar days of receipt of the postdeparture filing application by the Census Bureau.
(1)
Grounds for denial of postdeparture filing status.
The Census Bureau may deny a USPPI's application for postdeparture filing privileges for any of the following reasons:
(i) There is no history of filing for the USPPI through the AES.
(ii) The USPPI's volume of EEI reported through the AES does not warrant participation in postdeparture filing.
(iii) The USPPI or its authorized agent has failed to submit EEI through the AES in a timely and accurate manner.
(iv) The USPPI has a history of noncompliance with the Census Bureau export regulations contained in this part.
(v) The USPPI has been indicted, convicted, or is currently under investigation for a felony involving a violation of federal export laws or regulations and the Census Bureau has evidence of probable cause supporting such violation, or the USPPI is in violation of Census Bureau export regulations contained in this part.
(vi) The USPPI has made or caused to be made in the LOI a false or misleading statement or omission with respect to any material fact.
(vii) The USPPI would pose a significant threat to national security interests such that its participation in postdeparture filing should be denied.
(viii) The USPPI has multiple violations of either the EAR (15 CFR 730 through 774) or the ITAR (22 CFR 120 through 130) within the last three (3) years.
(ix) The USPPI fails to demonstrate the ability to meet the AES predeparture filing requirements.
(2)
Notice of denial.
A USPPI denied postdeparture filing privileges by other agencies shall contact those agencies regarding the specific reason(s) for nonselection and for their appeal procedures. A USPPI denied postdeparture filing status by the Census Bureau will be provided with a specific reason for nonselection and a Census Bureau point of contact in an electronic notification letter. A USPPI may appeal the Census Bureau's nonselection decision by following the appeal procedure and reapplication procedure provided in paragraph (c)(5) of this section.
(3)
Revocation of postdeparture filing privileges
—(i)
Revocation by the Census Bureau.
The Census Bureau may revoke postdeparture filing privileges of an approved USPPI for the following reasons:
(A) The USPPI's volume of EEI reported in the AES does not warrant continued participation in postdeparture filing;
(B) The USPPI or its authorized agent has failed to submit EEI through the AES in a timely and accurate manner;
(C) The USPPI has made or caused to be made in the LOI a false or misleading statement or omission with respect to material fact;
(D) The USPPI submitting the LOI has been indicted, convicted, or is currently under investigation for a felony involving a violation of federal export laws or regulations and the Census Bureau has evidence of probable cause supporting such violation, or the AES applicant is in violation of export rules and regulations contained in this part;
(E) The USPPI has failed to comply with existing export regulations or has failed to pay any outstanding penalties assessed in connection with such noncompliance; or
(F) The USPPI would pose a significant threat to national security interests such that its continued participation in postdeparture filing should be terminated.
(G) The USPPI or its authorized agent files postdeparture for commodities that are identified in § 30.4(a).
(ii)
Revocation by other agencies.
Any of the other agencies may revoke a USPPI's postdeparture filing privileges with respect to transactions subject to the jurisdiction of that agency. When doing so, the agency shall notify both the Census Bureau and the USPPI whose authorization is being revoked.
(4)
Notice of revocation.
Approved postdeparture filing USPPIs whose postdeparture filing privileges have been revoked by other agencies shall contact those agencies for their specific revocation and appeal procedures. When the Census Bureau makes a determination to revoke an approved USPPI's postdeparture filing privileges, the USPPI will be notified electronically of the reason(s) for the decision. In most cases, the revocation shall become effective when the USPPI has either exhausted all appeal procedures, or thirty (30) calendar days after receipt of the notice of revocation, if no appeal is filed. However, in cases judged to affect national security, revocations shall become effective immediately upon notification.
(5)
Appeal procedure.
Any USPPI whose request for postdeparture filing privileges has been denied by the Census Bureau or whose postdeparture filing privileges have been revoked by the Census Bureau may appeal the decision by filing an appeal within thirty (30) calendar days of receipt of the notice of decision. Appeals should be addressed to the Chief, Foreign Trade Division, U.S. Census Bureau, Washington, DC 20233-6700. The Census Bureau will issue a written decision to the USPPI within thirty (30) calendar days from the date of receipt of the appeal by the Census Bureau. If a written decision is not issued within thirty (30) calendar days, the Census Bureau will forward to the USPPI a notice of extension within that time period. The USPPI will be provided with the reasons for the extension of this time period and an expected date of decision. The USPPIs who have had their postdeparture filing status denied or revoked may not reapply for this privilege for one year following written notification of the denial or revocation.
(d)
Electronic Export Information filing standards.
The data elements required for filing EEI are contained in § 30.6. When filing EEI, the USPPI or authorized agent shall comply with the data transmission procedures determined by CBP and the Census Bureau and shall agree to stay in complete compliance with all export rules and regulations in this part. Failure of the USPPI or the authorized agent of either the USPPI or FPPI to comply with these requirements constitutes a violation of the regulations in this part, and renders such principal party or the authorized agent subject to the penalties provided for in Subpart H of this part. In the case of AES
Direct
, when submitting a registration form to AES
Direct
, the registering company is certifying that it will be in compliance with all applicable export rules and regulations. This includes complying with the following security requirements:
(1) AES
Direct
user names and passwords are to be kept secure by the account administrator and not disclosed to any unauthorized user or any persons outside the registered company.
(2) Registered companies are responsible for those persons having a user name and password. If an employee with a user name and password leaves the company or otherwise is no longer an authorized user, the company shall immediately deactivate that username
in the system to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of Title 13 data.
(e)
Monitoring the filing of EEI.
The USPPI's or the authorized agent's AES filings will be monitored and reviewed for quality, timeliness, and coverage. The Census Bureau will provide performance reports to USPPIs and authorized agents who file EEI. The Census Bureau will take appropriate action to correct specific situations where the USPPI or authorized agent fails to maintain acceptable levels of data quality, timeliness, or coverage.
(f)
Support.
The Census Bureau provides online services that allow the USPPI and the authorized agent to seek assistance pertaining to the AES and this part. For AES assistance, filers may send an email to
ASKAES@census.gov.
For FTR assistance, filers may send an email to
itmd.askregs@census.gov.
[73 FR 31555, June 2, 2008, as amended at 78 FR 16376, Mar. 14, 2013; 82 FR 18390, Apr. 19, 2017]
§ 30.6
Electronic Export Information data elements.
The information specified in this section is required for EEI transmitted to the AES. The data elements identified as “mandatory” shall be reported for each transaction. The data elements identified as “conditional” shall be reported if they are required for or apply to the specific shipment. The data elements identified as “optional” may be reported at the discretion of the USPPI or the authorized agent. Additional data elements may be required to be reported in the AES in accordance with other federal agencies' regulations. Refer to the other agencies' regulations for reporting requirements.
(a) Mandatory data elements are as follows:
(1)
USPPI.
The person or legal entity in the United States that receives the primary benefit, monetary or otherwise, from the export transaction. Generally, that person or entity is the U.S. seller, manufacturer, or order party, or the foreign entity while in the United States when purchasing or obtaining the goods for export. The name, address, identification number, and contact information of the USPPI shall be reported to the AES as follows:
(i)
Name of the USPPI.
In all export transactions, the name listed in the USPPI field in the EEI shall be the USPPI in the transaction. (See § 30.1 for the definition of the USPPI and § 30.3 for details on the USPPI's reporting responsibilities.)
(ii)
Address of the USPPI.
In all EEI filings, the USPPI shall report the address or location (no post office box number) from which the goods actually begin the journey to the port of export even if the USPPI does not own/lease the facility. For example, the EEI covering goods laden aboard a truck at a warehouse in Georgia for transport to Florida for loading onto a vessel for export to a foreign country shall show the address of the warehouse in Georgia. For shipments with multiple origins, report the address from which the commodity with the greatest value begins its export journey. If such information is not known, report the address in the state where the commodities are consolidated for export.
(iii)
USPPI identification number.
Report the Employer Identification Number (EIN) of the USPPI. If the USPPI has only one EIN, report that EIN. If the USPPI has more than one EIN, report the EIN that the USPPI uses to report employee wages and withholdings, and not the EIN used to report only company earnings or receipts. Use of another company's EIN is prohibited. If a USPPI reports a DUNS, the EIN is also required to be reported. If a foreign entity is in the United States at the time goods are purchased or obtained for export, the foreign entity is the USPPI. In such situations, when the foreign entity does not have an EIN, the authorized agent shall report a border crossing number, passport number, or any number assigned by CBP on behalf of the foreign entity.
(iv)
USPPI contact information.
The person who has the most knowledge regarding the specific shipment or related export controls.
(2)
Date of export.
The date of export is the date when goods are scheduled to leave the port of export on the exporting carrier that is taking the goods out of the United States.
(3)
Ultimate consignee.
The ultimate consignee is the person, party, or designee that is located abroad and actually receives the export shipment. The name and address of the ultimate consignee, whether by sale in the United States or abroad or by consignment, shall be reported in the EEI. The ultimate consignee as known at the time of export shall be reported. For shipments requiring an export license including shipments to international waters, the ultimate consignee reported in the AES shall be the person so designated on the export license or authorized to be the ultimate consignee under the applicable license exemption or exception in conformance with the EAR or ITAR, as applicable. For goods sold en route, report the appropriate “To be Sold En Route” indicator in the EEI, and report corrected information as soon as it is known (see § 30.9 for procedures on correcting AES information).
(4)
U.S. state of origin.
The U.S. state of origin is the 2-character postal code for the state in which the goods begin their journey to the port of export. For example, a shipment covering goods laden aboard a truck at a warehouse in Georgia for transport to Florida for loading onto a vessel for export to a foreign country shall show Georgia as the state of origin. The U.S. state of origin may be different from the U.S. state where the goods were produced, mined, or grown. For shipments of multi-state origin, reported as a single shipment, report the U.S. state of the commodity with the greatest value. If such information is not known, report the state in which the commodities are consolidated for export.
(5)
Country of ultimate destination.
The country of ultimate destination is the country in which goods are to be consumed, further processed, stored, or manufactured, as known to the USPPI at the time of export. The country of ultimate destination is the code issued by the ISO.
(i)
Shipments under an export license.
For shipments under an export license issued by the Department of State, Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (DDTC), or the Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS), the country of ultimate destination shall conform to the country of ultimate destination as shown on the license. In the case of a DDTC or BIS license, the country of ultimate destination is the country specified with respect to the end user, which may also be the ultimate consignee. For goods licensed by other government agencies, refer to the agencies' specific requirements for providing country of ultimate destination information.
(ii)
Shipments not moving under an export license.
The country of ultimate destination is the country known to the USPPI or U.S. authorized agent at the time of exportation. The country to which the goods are being shipped is not the country of ultimate destination if the USPPI or U.S. authorized agent has knowledge, at the time the goods leave the United States, that they are intended for reexport or transshipment in the form received to another known country. For goods shipped to Canada, Mexico, Panama, Hong Kong, Belgium, United Arab Emirates, The Netherlands, or Singapore, special care should be exercised before reporting these countries as the ultimate destinations because these are countries through which goods from the United States are frequently transshipped. If the USPPI or U.S. authorized agent does not know the ultimate destination of the goods, the country of ultimate destination to be shown is the last country, as known to the USPPI or U.S. authorized agent at the time the goods leave the United States, to which the goods are to be shipped in their present form. (For instructions as to the reporting of country of ultimate destination for vessels sold or transferred from the United States to foreign ownership, see § 30.26). In addition, the following types of shipments must be reported as follows:
(A)
Department of State, DDTC, license exemption.
The country of ultimate destination is the country specified with respect to the end user as noted in the ITAR (22 CFR 123.9(a)).
(B)
Department of Commerce, BIS, license exception.
The country of ultimate destination is the country of the end user as defined in 15 CFR 772.1 of the Export Administration Regulations (EAR).
(C)
For shipments to international waters.
The country of ultimate destination is the nationality of the person(s) or entity assuming control of the good(s) exported to international waters.
(iii) For goods to be sold en route, report the country of the first port of call and then report corrected information as soon as it is known.
(6)
Method of transportation.
The method of transportation is the means by which the goods are exported from the United States.
(i)
Conveyances exported under their own power.
The mode of transportation for aircraft, vessels, or locomotives (railroad stock) transferring ownership or title and moving out of the United States under its own power is the mode of transportation by which the conveyance moves out of the United States.
(ii)
Exports through Canada, Mexico, or other foreign countries for transshipment to another destination.
For transshipments through Canada, Mexico, or another foreign country, the mode of transportation is the mode of the carrier transporting the goods out of the United States.
(7)
Conveyance name/carrier name.
The conveyance name/carrier name is the name of the conveyance/carrier transporting the goods out of the United States as known at the time of exportation. For exports by sea, the conveyance name is the vessel name. For exports by air, rail, or truck, the carrier name is that which corresponds to the carrier identification as specified in paragraph (a)(8) of this section. Terms, such as airplane, train, rail, truck, vessel, barge, or international footbridge are not acceptable. For shipments by other methods of transportation, including mail, fixed methods (pipeline), the conveyance/carrier name is not required.
(8)
Carrier identification.
The carrier identification is the Standard Carrier Alpha Code (SCAC) for vessel, rail, and truck shipments or the International Air Transport Association (IATA) code for air shipments. The carrier identification specifies the carrier that transports the goods out of the United States. The carrier transporting the goods to the port of export and the carrier transporting the goods out of the United States may be different. For vessel shipments, report the carrier identification code of the party whose booking number was reported in the AES. For transshipments through Canada, Mexico, or another foreign country, the carrier identification is that of the carrier that transports the goods out of the United States. For modes other than vessel, air, rail and truck valid methods of transportation, including but not limited to mail, fixed transport (pipeline), and passenger hand carried, the carrier identification is not required. The National Motor Freight Traffic Association (NMFTA) issues and maintains the SCAC. (See
www.nmfta.org.
) The IATA issues and maintains the IATA codes. (See
www.census.gov/trade
for a list of IATA codes.)
(9)
Port of export.
The port of export is the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) seaport or airport where the goods are loaded on the carrier that is taking the goods out of the United States, or the CBP port where exports by overland transportation cross the U.S. border into Canada or Mexico. For EEI reporting purposes only, for goods loaded aboard a conveyance (aircraft or vessel) that stops at several ports before clearing to the foreign country, the port of export is the first port where the goods were loaded on this conveyance. For goods off-loaded from the original conveyance to another conveyance (even if the aircraft or vessel belongs to the same carrier) at any of the ports, the port where the goods were loaded on the last conveyance before going foreign is the port of export. The port of export shall be reported in terms of Schedule D, “Classification of CBP Districts and Ports.” Use port code 8000 for shipments by mail.
(10)
Related party indicator.
Used to indicate when a transaction involving trade between a USPPI and an ultimate consignee where either party owns directly or indirectly 10 percent or more of the other party.
(11)
Domestic or foreign indicator.
Indicates if the goods exported are of domestic or foreign origin. Report foreign goods as a separate line item from domestic goods even if the commodity classification number is the same.
(12)
Commodity classification number.
Report the 10-digit commodity classification number as provided in Schedule B,
Statistical Classification of Domestic and Foreign Commodities Exported from the United States
in the EEI. The 10-digit commodity classification number provided in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUSA) may be reported in lieu of the Schedule B commodity classification number except as noted in the headnotes of the HTSUSA. The HTSUSA is a global classification system used to describe most world trade in goods. Furnishing the correct Schedule B or HTSUSA number does not relieve the USPPI or the authorized agent of furnishing a complete and accurate commodity description. When reporting the Schedule B number or HTSUSA number, the decimals shall be omitted. (See
http://www.census.gov/trade
for a list of Schedule B classification numbers.)
(13)
Commodity description.
Report the description of the goods shipped in English in sufficient detail to permit verification of the Schedule B or HTSUSA number. Clearly and fully state the name of the commodity in terms that can be identified or associated with the language used in Schedule B or HTSUSA (usually the commercial name of the commodity), and any and all characteristics of the commodity that distinguish it from commodities of the same name covered by other Schedule B or HTSUSA classifications. If the shipment requires a license, the description reported in the EEI shall conform with that shown on the license. If the shipment qualifies for a license exemption, the description shall be sufficient to ensure compliance with that license exemption. However, where the description on the license does not state all of the characteristics of the commodity that are needed to completely verify the commodity classification number, as described in this paragraph, report the missing characteristics, as well as the description shown on the license, in the commodity description field of the EEI.
(14)
Primary unit of measure.
The unit of measure shall correspond to the primary quantity as prescribed in the Schedule B or HTSUSA. If neither Schedule B nor HTSUSA specifies a unit of measure for the item, an “X” is required in the unit of measure field.
(15)
Primary quantity.
The quantity is the total number of units that correspond to the first unit of measure specified in the Schedule B or HTSUSA. Where the unit of measure is in terms of weight (grams, kilograms, metric tons, etc.), the quantity reflects the net weight, not including the weight of barrels, boxes, or other bulky coverings, and not including salt or pickle in the case of salted or pickled fish or meats. For a few commodities where “content grams” or “content kilograms” or some similar weight unit is specified in Schedule B or HTSUSA, the quantity may be less than the net weight. The quantity is reported as a whole unit only, without commas or decimals. If the quantity contains a fraction of a whole unit, round fractions of one-half unit or more up and fractions of less than one-half unit down to the nearest whole unit. (For example, where the unit for a given commodity is in terms of “tons,” a net quantity of 8.4 tons would be reported as 8 for the quantity. If the quantity is less than one unit, the quantity is 1.)
(16)
Shipping weight.
The shipping weight is the weight in kilograms, which includes the weight of the commodity, as well as the weight of normal packaging, such as boxes, crates, barrels, etc. The shipping weight is required for exports by air, vessel, rail, and truck, and required for exports of household goods transported by all methods. For exports (except household goods) by mail, fixed transport (pipeline), or other valid methods, the shipping weight is not required and shall be reported as zero. For containerized cargo in lift vans, cargo vans, or similar substantial outer containers, the weight of such containers is not included in the shipping weight. If the shipping weight is not available for each Schedule B or HTSUSA item included in one or more containers, the approximate shipping weight for each item is estimated and reported. The total of these estimated weights equals the actual shipping weight of the entire container or containers.
(17)
Value.
In general, the value to be reported in the EEI shall be the value of the goods at the U.S. port of export in U.S. dollars. The value shall be the selling price (or the cost, if the goods are not sold), plus inland or domestic freight, insurance, and other charges to the U.S. seaport, airport, or land border port of export. Cost of goods is the sum of expenses incurred in the USPPI's acquisition or production of the goods. Report the value to the nearest dollar, omit cents. Fractions of a dollar less than 50 cents should be ignored, and fractions of 50 cents or more should be rounded up to the next dollar.
(i)
Selling price.
The selling price for goods exported pursuant to sale, and the value to be reported in the EEI, is the USPPI's price to the FPPI (the foreign buyer). Deduct from the selling price any unconditional discounts, but do not deduct discounts that are conditional upon a particular act or performance on the part of the foreign buyer. For goods shipped on consignment without a sale actually having been made at the time of export, the selling price to be reported in the EEI is the market value at the time of export at the U.S. port.
(ii)
Adjustments.
When necessary, make the following adjustments to obtain the value.
(A) Where goods are sold at a point other than the port of export, freight, insurance, and other charges required in moving the goods from their U.S. point of origin to the exporting carrier at the port of export or border crossing point shall be added to the selling price (as defined in paragraph (a)(17)(i) of this section) for purposes of reporting the value in the EEI.
(B) Where the actual amount of freight, insurance, and other domestic costs is not available, an estimate of the domestic costs shall be made and added to the cost of the goods or selling price to derive the value to be reported in the EEI. Add the estimated domestic costs to the cost or selling price of the goods to obtain the value to be reported in the EEI.
(C) Where goods are sold at a “delivered” price to the foreign destination, the cost of loading the goods on the exporting carrier, if any, and freight, insurance, and other costs beyond the port of export shall be subtracted from the selling price for purposes of reporting value in the EEI. If the actual amount of such costs is not available, an estimate of the costs should be subtracted from the selling price.
(D) Costs added to or subtracted from the selling price in accordance with the instructions in this paragraph (a)(17)(ii) should not be shown separately in the EEI, but the value reported should be the value after making such adjustments, where required, to arrive at the value of the goods at the U.S. port of export.
