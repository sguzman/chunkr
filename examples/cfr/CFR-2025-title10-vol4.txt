# Explanation
The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.
Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:
Title 1 through Title 16
as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27
as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41
as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50
as of October 1
The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.

# LEGAL STATUS
The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

# HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS
The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, January 1, 2025), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

# EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES
Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.

# OMB CONTROL NUMBERS
The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request.
Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.

# PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE
Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.

# “[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY
The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not dropped in error.

# INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE
What is incorporation by reference?
Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.
What is a proper incorporation by reference?
The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:
(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.
(b) The matter incorporated is adequately summarized in the preamble of the final rule and is available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.
(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?
If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or email fr.inspection@nara.gov.

# CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES
A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR
Index and Finding Aids.
This volume contains the Parallel Table of Authorities and Rules. A list of CFR titles, chapters, subchapters, and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in this volume.
An index to the text of “Title 3—The President” is carried within that volume.
The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. This index is based on a consolidation of the “Contents” entries in the daily Federal Register.
A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

# REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL
There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing in the Code of Federal Regulations.

(e) For purposes of determining the required minimum nominal full-load efficiency of an electric motor that has a horsepower or kilowatt rating between two horsepower or two kilowatt ratings listed in any table of energy conservation standards in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section, each such motor shall be deemed to have a listed horsepower or kilowatt rating, determined as follows:
(1) A horsepower at or above the midpoint between the two consecutive horsepowers shall be rounded up to the higher of the two horsepowers;
(2) A horsepower below the midpoint between the two consecutive horsepowers shall be rounded down to the lower of the two horsepowers; or
(3) A kilowatt rating shall be directly converted from kilowatts to horsepower using the formula 1 kilowatt = (
1
/
0.746
) horsepower. The conversion should be calculated to three significant decimal places, and the resulting horsepower shall be rounded in accordance with paragraph (e)(1) or (e)(2) of this section, whichever applies.
(f) The standards in Table 1 through Table 4 of this section do not apply to definite purpose electric motors, special purpose electric motors, or those motors exempted by the Secretary.
(g) The standards in Table 5 through Table 7 of this section apply only to electric motors, including partial electric motors, that satisfy the following criteria:
(1) Are single-speed, induction motors;
(2) Are rated for continuous duty (MG 1) operation or for duty type S1 (IEC);
(3) Contain a squirrel-cage (MG 1) or cage (IEC) rotor;
(4) Operate on polyphase alternating current 60-hertz sinusoidal line power;
(5) Are rated 600 volts or less;
(6) Have a 2-, 4-, 6-, or 8-pole configuration,
(7) Are built in a three-digit or four-digit NEMA frame size (or IEC metric equivalent), including those designs between two consecutive NEMA frame sizes (or IEC metric equivalent), or an enclosed 56 NEMA frame size (or IEC metric equivalent),
(8) Produce at least one horsepower (0.746 kW) but not greater than 500 horsepower (373 kW), and
(9) Meet all of the performance requirements of one of the following motor types: A NEMA Design A, B, or C motor or an IEC Design N, NE, NEY, NY or H, HE, HEY, HY motor.
(h) Each NEMA Design A motor, NEMA Design B motor, and IEC Design N (including NE, NEY, or NY variants) motor that is an electric motor meeting the criteria in paragraph (g) of this section and with a power rating from 1 horsepower through 500 horsepower,
but excluding fire pump electric motors, manufactured (alone or as a component of another piece of equipment) on or after June 1, 2016, but before June 1, 2027, shall have a nominal full-load efficiency of not less than the following:

# Certification
§ 431.35
Applicability of certification requirements.
Section 431.36 sets forth the procedures for manufacturers to certify that electric motors comply with the applicable energy efficiency standards set forth in this subpart.
§ 431.36
Compliance Certification.
(a)
General.
A manufacturer or private labeler shall not distribute in commerce any basic model of an electric motor which is subject to an energy efficiency standard set forth in this subpart unless it has submitted to the Department a Compliance Certification certifying, in accordance with the provisions of this section, that the basic model meets the requirements of the applicable standard. The representations in the Compliance Certification must be based upon the basic model's energy efficiency as determined in accordance with the applicable requirements of this subpart. This means, in part, that either:
(1) The representations as to the basic model must be based on use of a certification organization; or
(2) Any testing of the basic model on which the representations are based must be conducted at an accredited laboratory.
(b)
Required contents
—(1)
General representations.
Each Compliance Certification must certify that:
(i) The nominal full load efficiency for each basic model of electric motor distributed is not less than the minimum nominal full load efficiency required for that motor by § 431.25;
(ii) All required determinations on which the Compliance Certification is based were made in compliance with the applicable requirements prescribed in this subpart;
(iii) All information reported in the Compliance Certification is true, accurate, and complete; and
(iv) The manufacturer or private labeler is aware of the penalties associated with violations of the Act and the regulations thereunder, and of 18 U.S.C. 1001 which prohibits knowingly making false statements to the Federal Government.
(2)
Specific data.
(i) For each rating of electric motor (as the term “rating” is defined in the definition of basic model) which a manufacturer or private labeler distributes, the Compliance Certification must report the nominal full load efficiency, determined pursuant to §§ 431.16 and 431.17, of the least efficient basic model within that rating.
(ii) The Compliance Certification must identify the basic models on which actual testing has been performed to meet the requirements of § 431.17.
(iii) The format for a Compliance Certification is set forth in appendix C of this subpart.
(c)
Optional contents.
In any Compliance Certification, a manufacturer or private labeler may at its option request that DOE provide it with a unique Compliance Certification number (“CC number”) for any brand name, trademark or other label name under which the manufacturer or private labeler distributes electric motors covered by the Certification. Such a Compliance Certification must also identify all other names, if any, under which the manufacturer or private labeler distributes electric motors, and to which the request does not apply.
(d)
Signature and submission.
A manufacturer or private labeler must submit the Compliance Certification either on its own behalf, signed by a corporate official of the company, or through a third party (for example, a trade association or other authorized representative) acting on its behalf. Where a third party is used, the Compliance Certification must identify the official of the manufacturer or private labeler who authorized the third party to make representations on the company's behalf, and must be signed by a corporate official of the third party. The Compliance Certification must be submitted to the Department electronically at
https://www.regulations.doe.gov/ccms.
Alternatively, the Compliance Certification may be submitted by certified mail to: Certification and Compliance Reports, U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Building Technologies Program, EE-2J, Forrestal Building, 1000 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20585-0121.
(e)
New basic models.
For electric motors, a Compliance Certification must be submitted for a new basic model only if the manufacturer or private labeler has not previously submitted to DOE a Compliance Certification, that meets the requirements of this section, for a basic model that has the same rating as the new basic model, and that has a lower nominal full load efficiency than the new basic model.
(f)
Response to Compliance Certification; Compliance Certification Number (CC number)
—(1) DOE processing of Certification. Promptly upon receipt of a Compliance Certification, the Department will determine whether the document contains all of the elements required by this section, and may, in its discretion, determine whether all or part of the information provided in the document is accurate. The Department will then advise the submitting party in writing either that the Compliance Certification does not satisfy the requirements of this section, in which case the document will be returned, or that the Compliance Certification satisfies this section. The Department will also advise the submitting party of the basis for its determination.
(2)
Issuance of CC number(s).
(i) Initial Compliance Certification. When DOE advises that the initial Compliance Certification submitted by or on behalf of a manufacturer or private labeler is acceptable, either:
(A) DOE will provide a single unique CC number, “CC________,” to the manufacturer or private labeler, and such CC number shall be applicable to all electric motors distributed by the manufacturer or private labeler, or
(B) When required by paragraph (f)(3) of this section, DOE will provide more than one CC number to the manufacturer or private labeler.
(ii) Subsequent Compliance Certification. When DOE advises that any other Compliance Certification is acceptable, it will provide a unique CC
number for any brand name, trademark or other name when required by paragraph (f)(3) of this section.
(iii) When DOE declines to provide a CC number as requested by a manufacturer or private labeler in accordance with § 431.36(c), DOE will advise the requester of the reasons for such refusal.
(3)
Issuance of two or more CC numbers.
(i) DOE will provide a unique CC number for each brand name, trademark or other label name for which a manufacturer or private labeler requests such a number in accordance with § 431.36(c), except as follows. DOE will not provide a CC number for any brand name, trademark or other label name
(A) For which DOE has previously provided a CC number, or
(B) That duplicates or overlaps with other names under which the manufacturer or private labeler sells electric motors.
(ii) Once DOE has provided a CC number for a particular name, that shall be the only CC number applicable to all electric motors distributed by the manufacturer or private labeler under that name.
(iii) If the Compliance Certification in which a manufacturer or private labeler requests a CC number is the initial Compliance Certification submitted by it or on its behalf, and it distributes electric motors not covered by the CC number(s) DOE provides in response to the request(s), DOE will also provide a unique CC number that shall be applicable to all of these other motors.

Record the manufacturer, brand and model number of the inverter used for the test. If there are no inverters specified in the manufacturer catalogs or offered for sale with the electric motor, testing must be conducted using an inverter that meets the criteria described in section 2.4.2.2. of this appendix.
2.4.2.1. The inverter shall be set up according to the manufacturer's instructional and operational manual included with the product. Manufacturers shall also record switching frequency in Hz, max frequency in Hz, Max output voltage in V, motor control method (
i.e.,
V/f ratio, sensor less vector, etc.), load profile setting (constant torque, variable torque, etc.), and saving energy mode (if used). Deviation from the resulting settings, such as switching frequency or load torque curves for the purpose of optimizing test results shall not be permitted.
2.4.2.2. If there are no inverters specified in the manufacturer catalogs or offered for sale with the electric motor, test with a two-level voltage source inverter.

# 3. Procedures for the Testing of Certain Electric Motor Categories
Prior to testing according to section 2 of this appendix, each basic model of the electric motor categories listed below must be set up in accordance with the instructions of this section to ensure consistent test results. These steps are designed to enable a motor to be attached to a dynamometer and run continuously for testing purposes. For the purposes of this appendix, a “standard bearing” is a 600- or 6000-series, either open or grease-lubricated double-shielded, single-row, deep groove, radial ball bearing.
3.1. Brake Electric Motors:
Brake electric motors shall be tested with the brake component powered separately from the motor such that it does not activate during testing. Additionally, for any 10-minute period during the test and while the brake is being powered such that it remains disengaged from the motor shaft, record the power consumed (
i.e.,
watts). Only power used to drive the motor is to be included in the efficiency calculation; power supplied to prevent the brake from engaging is not included in this calculation. In lieu of powering the brake separately, the brake may be disengaged mechanically, if such a mechanism exists and if the use of this mechanism does not yield a different efficiency value than separately powering the brake electrically.
3.2. Close-Coupled Pump Electric Motors and Electric Motors with Single or Double Shaft Extensions of Non-Standard Dimensions or Design:
To attach the unit under test to a dynamometer, close-coupled pump electric motors and electric motors with single or double shaft extensions of non-standard dimensions or design must be tested using a special coupling adapter.
3.3. Electric Motors with Non-Standard Endshields or Flanges:
If it is not possible to connect the electric motor to a dynamometer with the non-standard endshield or flange in place, the testing laboratory shall replace the non-standard endshield or flange with an endshield or flange meeting NEMA or IEC specifications. The replacement component should be obtained from the manufacturer or, if the manufacturer chooses, machined by the testing laboratory after consulting with the manufacturer regarding the critical characteristics of the endshield.
3.4. Electric Motors with Non-Standard Bases, Feet or Mounting Configurations:
An electric motor with a non-standard base, feet, or mounting configuration may be mounted on the test equipment using adaptive fixtures for testing as long as the mounting or use of adaptive mounting fixtures does not have an adverse impact on the performance of the electric motor, particularly on the cooling of the motor.
3.5. Electric Motors with a Separately-Powered Blower:
For electric motors furnished with a separately-powered blower, the losses from the blower's motor should not be included in any efficiency calculation. This can be done either by powering the blower's motor by a source separate from the source powering the electric motor under test or by connecting leads such that they only measure the power of the motor under test.
3.6. Immersible Electric Motors:
Immersible electric motors shall be tested with all contact seals removed but be otherwise unmodified.
3.7. Partial Electric Motors:
Partial electric motors shall be disconnected from their mated piece of equipment. After disconnection from the equipment, standard bearings and/or endshields shall be added to the motor, such that it is capable of operation. If an endshield is necessary, an endshield meeting NEMA or IEC specifications should be obtained from the manufacturer or, if the manufacturer chooses, machined by the testing laboratory after consulting with the manufacturer regarding the critical characteristics of the endshield.
3.8. Vertical Electric Motors and Electric Motors with Bearings Incapable of Horizontal Operation:
Vertical electric motors and electric motors with thrust bearings shall be tested in a horizontal or vertical configuration in accordance with the applicable test procedure under section 2 through section 2.4.3. of this appendix, depending on the testing facility's capabilities and construction of the motor, except if the motor is a vertical solid shaft normal thrust general purpose electric motor (subtype II), in which case it shall be tested in a horizontal configuration in accordance with the applicable test procedure under section 2 through section 2.4.3. of this appendix. Preference shall be given to testing a motor in its native orientation. If the unit under test cannot be reoriented horizontally due to its bearing construction, the electric motor's bearing(s) shall be removed and replaced with standard bearings. If the unit under test contains oil-lubricated bearings, its bearings shall be removed and replaced with standard bearings. If necessary, the unit under test may be connected to the dynamometer using a coupling of torsional rigidity greater than or equal to that of the motor shaft.

** Ice-cream freezer is defined in 10 CFR 431.62 as a commercial freezer that is designed to operate at or below −5 °F (−21 °C) and that the manufacturer designs, markets, or intends for the storing, displaying, or dispensing of ice cream.
(2) For commercial refrigeration equipment with two or more compartments (
i.e.
, hybrid refrigerators, hybrid freezers, hybrid refrigerator-freezers, and non-hybrid refrigerator-freezers), the maximum daily energy consumption (MDEC) for each model shall be the sum of the MDEC values for all of its compartments. For each compartment, measure the TDA or volume of that compartment, and determine the appropriate equipment class based on that compartment's equipment family, condensing unit configuration, and designed operating temperature. The MDEC limit for each compartment shall be the calculated value obtained by entering that compartment's TDA or volume into the standard equation in paragraph (d)(1) of this section for that compartment's equipment class. Measure the calculated daily energy consumption (CDEC) or total daily energy consumption (TDEC) for the entire case:
(i) For remote condensing commercial hybrid refrigerators, hybrid freezers, hybrid refrigerator-freezers, and non-hybrid refrigerator-freezers, where two or more independent condensing units each separately cool only one compartment, measure the total refrigeration load of each compartment separately according to the ARI Standard 1200-2006 test procedure (incorporated by reference, see § 431.63). Calculate compressor energy consumption (CEC) for each compartment using Table 1 in ARI Standard 1200-2006 using the saturated evaporator temperature for that compartment. The CDEC for the entire case shall be the sum of the CEC for each compartment, fan energy consumption (FEC), lighting energy consumption (LEC), anti-condensate energy consumption (AEC), defrost energy consumption (DEC), and condensate evaporator pan energy consumption (PEC) (as measured in ARI Standard 1200-2006).
(ii) For remote condensing commercial hybrid refrigerators, hybrid freezers, hybrid refrigerator-freezers, and non-hybrid refrigerator-freezers, where two or more compartments are cooled collectively by one condensing unit, measure the total refrigeration load of the entire case according to the ARI Standard 1200-2006 test procedure (incorporated by reference, see § 431.63). Calculate a weighted saturated evaporator temperature for the entire case by:
(A) Multiplying the saturated evaporator temperature of each compartment by the volume of that compartment (as measured in ARI Standard 1200-2006),
(B) Summing the resulting values for all compartments, and
(C) Dividing the resulting total by the total volume of all compartments.
Calculate the CEC for the entire case using Table 1 in ARI Standard 1200-2006 (incorporated by reference, see § 431.63), using the total refrigeration load and the weighted average saturated evaporator temperature. The CDEC for the entire case shall be the sum of the CEC, FEC, LEC, AEC, DEC, and PEC.
(iii) For self-contained commercial hybrid refrigerators, hybrid freezers, hybrid refrigerator-freezers, and non-hybrid refrigerator-freezers, measure the TDEC for the entire case according to the ARI Standard 1200-2006 test procedure (incorporated by reference, see § 431.63).
(3) For remote-condensing and self-contained wedge cases, measure the CDEC or TDEC according to the ARI Standard 1200-2006 test procedure (incorporated by reference, see § 431.63). The MDEC for each model shall be the amount derived by incorporating into the standards equation in paragraph (d)(1) of this section for the appropriate equipment class a value for the TDA that is the product of:
(i) The vertical height of the air-curtain (or glass in a transparent door) and (ii) The largest overall width of the case, when viewed from the front.
(e) Each commercial refrigerator, freezer, and refrigerator-freezer with a self-contained condensing unit designed for holding temperature applications and with solid or transparent doors; commercial refrigerator with a self-contained condensing unit designed for pull-down temperature applications and with transparent doors;
commercial refrigerator, freezer, and refrigerator-freezer with a self-contained condensing unit and without doors; commercial refrigerator, freezer, and refrigerator-freezer with a remote condensing unit; and commercial ice-cream freezer manufactured on or after March 27, 2017, shall have a daily energy consumption (in kilowatt-hours per day) that does not exceed the levels specified:

** Ice-cream freezer is defined in 10 CFR 431.62 as a commercial freezer that is designed to operate at or below −5 °F *(−21 °C) and that the manufacturer designs, markets, or intends for the storing, displaying, or dispensing of ice cream.
(2) For commercial refrigeration equipment with two or more compartments (
i.e.,
hybrid refrigerators, hybrid freezers, hybrid refrigerator-freezers, and non-hybrid refrigerator-freezers), the maximum daily energy consumption for each model shall be the sum of the MDEC values for all of its compartments. For each compartment, measure the TDA or volume of that compartment, and determine the appropriate equipment class based on that compartment's equipment family, condensing unit configuration, and designed operating temperature. The MDEC limit for each compartment shall be the calculated value obtained by entering that compartment's TDA or volume into the standard equation in paragraph (e)(1) of this section for that compartment's equipment class. Measure the CDEC or TDEC for the entire case as described in § 431.66(d)(2)(i) through (iii), except that where measurements and calculations reference ARI Standard 1200-2006 (incorporated by reference, see § 431.63), AHRI Standard 1200 (I-P)-2010 (incorporated by reference, see § 431.63) shall be used.
(3) For remote condensing and self-contained wedge cases, measure the CDEC or TDEC according to the AHRI Standard 1200 (I-P)-2010 test procedure (incorporated by reference, see § 431.63). For wedge cases in equipment classes for which a volume metric is used, the
MDEC shall be the amount derived from the appropriate standards equation in paragraph (e)(1) of this section. For wedge cases of equipment classes for which a TDA metric is used, the MDEC for each model shall be the amount derived by incorporating into the standards equation in paragraph (e)(1) of this section for the equipment class a value for the TDA that is the product of:
(i) The vertical height of the air curtain (or glass in a transparent door) and
(ii) The largest overall width of the case, when viewed from the front.
(f)
Exclusions.
The energy conservation standards in paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section do not apply to salad bars, buffet tables, and chef bases or griddle stands.

# 1. Test Procedure
1.1. Determination of Daily Energy Consumption. Determine the daily energy consumption of each covered commercial refrigerator, freezer, or refrigerator-freezer by conducting the test procedure set forth in AHRI 1200-2023, section 3, “Definitions,” section 4, “Test Requirements,” and section 9, “Symbols and Subscripts.”
1.1.1. For each commercial refrigerator, freezer, or refrigerator-freezer with a self-contained condensing unit, also use AHRI 1200-2023, section 5.2, “Rating Requirements for Self-Contained Commercial Refrigerated Display Merchandisers and Storage Cabinets.”
1.1.2. For each commercial refrigerator, freezer, or refrigerator-freezer with a remote condensing unit, also use AHRI 1200-2023, section 5.1, “Rating Requirements for Remote Commercial Refrigerated Display Merchandisers and Storage Cabinets.”
1.1.3. For each commercial refrigerator, freezer, or refrigerator-freezer used with a secondary coolant, test according to section 1.1.2 of this appendix, except in place of the equations for CDEC and CEC in sections 5.1.2 and 5.1.2.1 of AHRI 1200-2023, respectively, apply the following equations:
CDEC = CEC + [FEC + LEC + AEC + DEC + PEC]* + CPEC
CEC = [(Q
rt
+ Q
CP
) · (t − t
dt
)]/(EER · 1000)
Where CPEC and Q
CP
are as specified in sections 5.2.7 and 5.2.8 of AHRI 1320-2011 and EER is determined based on a temperature that is 6.0 °F lower than the secondary coolant cabinet inlet temperature.
1.2. Methodology for Determining Applicability of Transparent Door Equipment Families. To determine if a door for a given model of commercial refrigeration equipment is transparent:
(a) Calculate the outer door surface area including frames and mullions;
(b) calculate the transparent surface area within the outer door surface area excluding frames and mullions;
(c) calculate the ratio of (2) to (1) for each of the outer doors; and
(d) the ratio for the transparent surface area of all outer doors must be greater than 0.25 to qualify as a transparent equipment family.
1.3. Drawers. Drawers shall be treated as identical to doors when conducting the DOE test procedure. Commercial refrigeration equipment with drawers intended for use with pans shall be configured with stainless steel food service pans, installed in a configuration per the manufacturer's instructions utilizing the maximum pan sizes specified. If the manufacturer does not specify the pan sizes, the maximum pan depth and pan volume allowed shall be used. For commercial refrigeration equipment with drawers intended for use with pans, the net usable volume includes only the interior volume of the pan(s) in the drawer. The net usable volume shall be measured by the amount of water needed to fill all the pan(s) to within 0.5 inches of the top rim, or determined by calculating the total volume of all pan(s) using the pan manufacturers' published pan volume. For commercial refrigeration equipment with drawers not intended for pans, the net usable volume shall be equal to the total volume of the drawer to the top edge of the drawer. Test simulators shall be placed in commercial refrigeration equipment with drawers as follows: For each drawer, there shall be two test simulators placed at each of the following locations: at the left end, at the right end, and at consistent 24 inch to 48 inch intervals across the width of the drawer (for drawers wider than 48 inches). For drawers with overall internal width of 48 inches or less, only the left and right ends shall have test simulators. If test simulators are to be placed at a pan edge or divider, the test simulator shall be placed at the nearest adjacent location. For each drawer, one test simulator shall be placed on the bottom of the pan or drawer at each of the front and rear test simulator locations of the drawer. Test simulators shall be placed in contact with the drawer or pan end or ends unless load limiting stops are provided as part of the case. Test simulators shall be secured such that the test simulators do not move during the test. The net usable volume where test simulators are not required shall be filled with filler material so that between 60 percent and 80 percent of the net usable volume is occupied by test simulators and uniformly occupied by filler material.
1.4. Long-time Automatic Defrost. For commercial refrigeration equipment not capable of operating with defrost intervals of 24 hours or less, testing may be conducted using a two-part test method.
1.4.1. First Part of Test. The first part of the test shall be a 24-hour test starting in steady-state conditions and including eight hours of door opening (according to ASHRAE 72-2022 with Errata). The energy consumed in this test, ET1, shall be recorded.
1.4.2. Second Part of Test. The second part of the test shall be a defrost cycle, including any operation associated with a defrost. The
start and end of the test period be determined as the last time before and first time after a defrost occurrence when the measured average simulator temperature (
i.e.,
the instantaneous average of all test simulator temperature measurements) is within 0.5 °F of the IAT as measured during the first part of the test. The energy consumed in this test, ET2, and duration, t
DI
, shall be recorded.
1.4.3. Daily Energy Consumption. Based on the measured energy consumption in these two tests, the daily energy consumption (DEC) in kWh shall be calculated as:
ER26SE23.007
Where:
DEC
= daily energy consumption, in kWh;
ET
1 = energy consumed during the first part of the test, in kWh;
ET
2 = energy consumed during the second part of the test, in kWh;
t
NDI
= normalized length of defrosting time per day, in minutes;
t
DI
= length of time of defrosting test period, in minutes;
t
DC
= minimum time between defrost occurrences, in days; and
1440 = conversion factor, minutes per day.
1.5. Customer Order Storage Cabinets. Customer order storage cabinets shall conduct door openings according to ASHRAE 72-2022 with Errata, except that each door shall be opened to the fully open position for 8 seconds, once every 2 hours, for 6 door-opening cycles.
1.5.1. Ambient Compartments. For customer order storage cabinets that have at least one individual-secured compartment that is not capable of maintaining an integrated average temperature below the ambient dry-bulb temperature, the individual-secured compartment(s) at ambient dry-bulb temperature shall be categorized as a high-temperature refrigerator compartment for the purpose of testing and rating. All volume, total display area, and energy consumption calculations shall be included within the high-temperature refrigerator category and summed with other high-temperature refrigerator category compartment(s) calculations.
1.5.2. Convertible Compartments. For customer order storage cabinets that have individual-secured compartments that are convertible between the ambient dry-bulb temperature and the ≥32 °F operating temperature, the convertible compartment shall be tested as a medium-temperature refrigerator compartment or at the lowest application product temperature as specified in section 2.2 of this appendix.
1.5.3. Inverse Refrigeration Load Test. For customer order storage cabinets that supply refrigerant to multiple individual-secured compartments and that allow the suction pressure from the evaporator in each individual-secured compartment to float based on the temperature required to store the customer order in that individual-secured compartment, test according to section 1.1.2 of this appendix, except that energy (heat) loss shall be allowed at a rate and ΔT equivalent to the energy gains of a standard refrigerated cabinet as specified in sections 1.5.3.1-1.5.3.3 of this appendix.
1.5.3.1. Anti-sweat door heaters. Anti-sweat door heaters shall be de-energized for the inverse refrigeration load test specified in section 1.5.3. of this appendix.
1.5.3.2. Integrated Average Temperature. For medium-temperature refrigerator compartments, the integrated average temperature shall be 112.4 °F ±2.0 °F. For low-temperature freezer compartments, the integrated average temperature shall be 150.4 °F ±2.0 °F. For ambient compartments, the integrated average temperature shall be 75.4 °F ±2.0 °F.

# 2. Test Conditions
2.1. Integrated Average Temperatures. Conduct the testing required in section 1 of this appendix, and determine the daily energy consumption at the applicable integrated average temperature as follows:
2.1.1. Ice-Cream Freezers. Test ice-cream freezers and ice-cream freezer compartments to the integrated average temperature specified in section 4.1.1.2, “Ice Cream Applications,” of AHRI 1200-2023.
2.1.2. Low-Temperature Freezers. Test low-temperature freezers and low-temperature freezer compartments to the integrated average temperature specified in section 4.1.1.3, “Low Temperature Applications,” of AHRI 1200-2023.
2.1.3. Medium-Temperature Refrigerators. Test medium-temperature refrigerators and medium-temperature refrigerator compartments to the integrated average temperature specified in section 4.1.1.4, “Medium Temperature Applications,” of AHRI 1200-2023.
2.1.4. High-Temperature Refrigerators. Test high-temperature refrigerators and high-temperature refrigerator compartments to the integrated average temperature specified in section 4.1.1.1, “High Temperature Applications,” of AHRI 1200-2023.
2.2. Lowest Application Product Temperature. If a unit of commercial refrigeration equipment is not able to be operated at the integrated average temperature specified in section 2.1 of this appendix, test the unit at the lowest application product temperature (LAPT), as defined in § 431.62. For units equipped with a thermostat, LAPT is the measured temperature at the lowest thermostat setting of the unit (for units that are only able to operate at temperatures above the specified test temperature) or the highest thermostat setting of the unit (for units that are only able to operate at temperatures below the specified test temperature). For remote condensing equipment without a thermostat or other means of controlling temperature at the case, the lowest application product temperature is measured at the temperature achieved with the dew point temperature (as defined in section 3.2.8, “Dew Point,” of AHRI 1200-2023) or mid-point evaporator temperature (as defined in section 9, “Symbols and Subscripts,” of AHRI 1200-2023) set to 5 degrees colder than that required to maintain the manufacturer's
specified application temperature that is closest to the specified integrated average temperature.
2.3. Testing at NSF Test Conditions. For commercial refrigeration equipment that is also tested in accordance with NSF test procedures (Type I and Type II), integrated average temperatures and ambient conditions used for NSF testing may be used in place of the DOE-prescribed integrated average temperatures and ambient conditions provided they result in a more stringent test. That is, the measured daily energy consumption of the same unit, when tested at the rating temperatures and/or ambient conditions specified in the DOE test procedure, must be lower than or equal to the measured daily energy consumption of the unit when tested with the rating temperatures or ambient conditions used for NSF testing. The integrated average temperature measured during the test may be lower than the range specified by the DOE applicable temperature specification provided in section 2.1 of this appendix, but may not exceed the upper value of the specified range. Ambient temperatures and/or humidity values may be higher than those specified in the DOE test procedure.
2.4. Liquid Refrigerant Pressure Required Accuracy. The liquid refrigerant pressure required accuracy is ±35 kPa (±5.1 psi).
2.5 Commercial Refrigerator, Freezer, and Refrigerator-Freezer connected to a Direct Expansion Remote Condensing Unit with R-744. For commercial refrigerators, freezers, and refrigerator-freezers connected to a direct expansion remote condensing unit with R-744, instead of the liquid refrigerant measurements for direct-expansion remote units specified in appendix A to ASHRAE 72-2022 with Errata, the liquid refrigerant measurements for direct-expansion remote units shall be: liquid refrigerant temperature shall be 30.0 °F with a tolerance for the average over test period of ±3.0 °F and a tolerance for the individual measurements of ±5.0 °F; liquid refrigerant pressure shall be the saturated liquid pressure corresponding to a condensing temperature in the range of 32.0 °F to 44.0 °F for the average over test period; and liquid refrigerant subcooling shall be greater than 2.0 °R for the average over test period.
2.6 Chef Base or Griddle Stand Test Conditions. For chef bases or griddle stands, instead of the dry-bulb temperature, wet-bulb temperature, and radiant heat temperature specified in appendix A to ASHRAE 72-2022 with Errata: dry-bulb temperature shall be 86.0 °F with a tolerance for the average over test period of ±1.8 °F and a tolerance for the individual measurements of ±3.6 °F; wet-bulb temperature shall be 73.7 °F with a tolerance for the average over test period of ±1.8 °F and a tolerance for the individual measurements of ±3.6 °F; and radiant heat temperature shall be greater than or equal to 81.0 °F.

# 3. Volume and Total Display Area
3.1. Determination of Volume. Determine the volume of a commercial refrigerator, freezer, and refrigerator-freezer using the method set forth in AHRI 1200-2023, appendix C, “Commercial Refrigerated Display Merchandiser and Storage Cabinet Refrigerated Volume Calculation—Normative.”
3.2. Determination of Total Display Area. Determine the total display area of a commercial refrigerator, freezer, and refrigerator-freezer using the method set forth in AHRI 1200-2023, section 3.2.20, “Total Display Area (TDA),” and appendix D, “Commercial Refrigerated Display Merchandiser and Storage Cabinet Total Display Area (TDA) Calculation—Normative.”

Prepare the unit for testing and conduct two test periods to determine stability according to sections 7.1 through 7.5 of ASHRAE 72-2022 with Errata, excluding sections 7.2.1, 7.2.2, 7.3.1, 7.3.2, 7.3.3, and 7.3.4. The preparation period under section 7.2 of ASHRAE 72-2022 with Errata includes loading the test unit pans with distilled water and adjusting the controls to maintain the desired performance.
1.5.1. Test Periods A and B. Conduct two test periods, A and B, as specified in section 7.3 of ASHRAE 72-2022 with Errata (excluding sections 7.3.1, 7.3.2, 7.3.3, and 7.3.4). The 24-hour test periods shall begin with an 8-hour active period as specified in section 10.5.5 of ASTM F2143-16. Following the active period, the remaining 16 hours of the test period shall be a standby period with the pans remaining in place, any pan covers in the closed position, and with no additional door openings.
1.5.2. Stability. Average pan temperatures shall be used to determine stability, as specified in section 7.5 of ASHRAE 72-2022 with Errata, rather than average test simulator temperatures.
1.5.3. Data Recording. For each test period, record data as specified in section 10.1.1 of ASTM F2143-16, except record wet-bulb temperature rather than relative humidity. Rather than voltage, current, and power as specified in section 10.1.1 of ASTM F2143-16, record the electrical supply potential and frequency and energy consumption as specified in appendix A of ASHRAE 72-2022 with Errata.
1.6. Target Temperatures.
1.6.1. Average Pan Temperature. The average of all pan temperature measurements during the test period shall be 38 °F ±2 °F. If the unit under test is not able to be operated at this average temperature range, test the unit at the lowest application product temperature (LAPT), as defined in § 431.62. For units equipped with a thermostat, LAPT is measured at the lowest thermostat setting of the unit (for units that are only able to operate at temperatures above the specified test temperature) or the highest thermostat setting of the unit (for units that are only able to operate at temperatures below the specified test temperature).
1.6.2. Average Compartment Temperature. The average of all compartment temperature measurements during the test period shall be 38 °F ±2 °F. If the unit under test is not capable of maintaining both average pan temperature and average compartment temperature within the specified range, the average compartment temperature shall be the average temperature necessary to maintain average pan temperature within the specified range. If the unit is tested at the LAPT for the average pan temperature, as described in section 1.6.1 of this appendix, the average compartment temperature is the average of all compartment temperature measurements at that control setting.

# 1. Test Procedures
1.1. Scope. This section provides the test procedures for measuring the energy consumption in kilowatt-hours per pound (kWh/lb) for self-contained commercial blast chillers and blast freezers that have a refrigerated volume of up to 500 ft
3
.
1.1.1. Determination of Refrigerated Volume. Determine the refrigerated volume of a self-contained commercial blast chiller or blast freezer using the method set forth in AHRI 1200-2023, appendix C, “Commercial Refrigerated Display Merchandiser and Storage Cabinet Refrigerated Volume Calculation—Normative.”
1.2. Determination of Energy Consumption. Determine the energy consumption of each covered blast chiller or blast freezer by conducting the test procedure set forth in ASHRAE 72-2022 with Errata section 4, “Instruments,” section 5, “Preparation of Unit Under Test” (except section 5.4, “Loading of Test Simulators and Filler Material”), section 6.1, “Ambient Temperature and Humidity,” Figure 6, “Location of Ambient Temperature Indicators,” and normative appendix A, “Measurement Locations, Tolerances, Accuracies, and Other Characteristics” (only the measured quantities specified in section 1.2.1 of this appendix), as well as the requirements of this appendix.
1.2.1. Measured Quantities in Normative Appendix A of ASHRAE 72-2022 with Errata. The following measured quantities shall be in accordance with the specifications of normative appendix A of ASHRAE 72-2022 with Errata: dry bulb temperature (except for deviations specified in sections 1.3 and 1.4 of this appendix), electrical supply frequency, electrical supply potential, energy consumed (except for deviations specified in section 1.3 of this appendix), extent of non-perforated surface beyond edges of unit under test, front clearance, rear or side clearance, and time measurements.
1.2.2. Additional Specifications for ASHRAE 72-2022 with Errata. The term “refrigerator” used in ASHRAE 72-2022 with Errata shall instead refer to “blast chiller” or “blast freezer,” as applicable. In section 5.3 of ASHRAE 72-2022 with Errata, the phrase “all necessary components and accessories shall be installed prior to loading the storage and display areas with test simulators and filler material” shall be replaced with “all necessary components and accessories shall be installed prior to precooling the unit under test.” Section 5.3.5 shall also require that, prior to precooling the unit under test, the condensate pan shall be dry.
1.3. Data Recording Measurement Intervals. Measurements shall be continuously recorded during the test in intervals no greater than 10 seconds.
1.4. Test Conditions. The required test conditions shall have dry bulb temperature values according to Table D.1 when measured at point A in figure 6 of ASHRAE 72-2022 with Errata and according to section 6.1 of ASHRAE 72-2022 with Errata.
Table D.1—Test Condition Values and Tolerances
Test condition
Value
Tolerance
Dry Bulb
86.0 °F
Average over test period: ±1.8 °F.
Individual measurements: ±3.6 °F.
1.5. Product Pan. The product pan shall be a 12 in. by 20 in. by 2.5 in., 22 gauge or heavier, and 300 series stainless steel pan. If the blast chiller or blast freezer is not capable of holding the 12 in. by 20 in. by 2.5 in. product pan dimensions, the manufacturer's recommended pan size shall be used, conforming as closely as possible to the 12 in. by 20 in. by 2.5 in. pan dimensions.
1.6. Product Temperature Measurement. The product temperature shall be measured in the geometric center of the measured product pans using an unweighted thermocouple placed
5/8
of an in. above the bottom of the measured product pan. The thermocouple leads shall be secured to the bottom of the measured product pan while also allowing for the transfer of the measured product pan from the heating source into the blast chiller's or blast freezer's cabinet.
1.7. Product Preparation. The product shall be made for each product pan and shall be loaded to 2 in. of product thickness (
i.e.,
depth) within the product pan unless an additional product pan with a product thickness of less than 2 in. is needed to meet the product capacity determined in section 2.1 of this appendix. A 20-percent-by-volume propylene glycol (1,2-Propanediol) mixture in water shall be prepared. In each product pan, pour the propylene glycol mixture over #20 mesh southern yellow pine sawdust to create a 22 percent to 78 percent by mass slurry. An example of an acceptable sawdust specification is the American Wood Fibers brand, #20 Mesh Pine Sawdust. Mix until the sawdust becomes completely saturated and leave uncovered in the product pan. Verify that the product pan thermocouple is fully submerged in the product mixture and reposition the product pan thermocouple to the requirements of section 1.6. of this appendix if the product pan thermocouple is incorrectly positioned after mixing. Each product pan shall be weighed before and after the food product simulator is added and prior to heating the product. The weight of the product shall not include the weight of the pans, thermocouples, or wires. A cumulative total of the product weight shall be calculated and the product pans shall continue to be loaded with the product mixture until the cumulative total reaches, but not exceeds, the product capacity determined in section 2.1 of this appendix with a tolerance of ±5 percent or ±2 pounds, whichever is less. The cumulative total weight of product, the weight of product in each individual pan, and the number of pans shall be recorded.
1.8. Product Pan Heating. Measured product pans shall be maintained at an average temperature of 160.0 °F ±1.8 °F and individual pan temperatures shall be maintained at 160 °F ±10 °F for a minimum of 8 hours prior to being loaded into the blast chiller or blast freezer. Non-measured product pans shall also be heated for a minimum of 8 hours prior to being loaded into the blast chiller or blast freezer and the non-measured product pans shall be placed in alternating positions with the measured product pans in the heating device. Data acquisition for the temperature of the measured product pans and time measurements shall begin to be recorded prior to the minimum of 8 hours heating period.
1.9. Product Pan Distribution. The product pans shall be spaced evenly throughout each vertical column of rack positions in the blast chiller or blast freezer without the product pans touching any other product pans and without the product pans touching the top and the bottom of the blast chiller or blast freezer cabinet. For blast chillers or blast freezers that have an additional product pan with a product thickness of less than 2 in., the additional product pan shall be placed as close to the middle rack position as possible while maintaining an even distribution of all product pans. If not all rack positions are occupied by product pans, the product pan locations shall be recorded.
1.10. Measured Product Pans. If multiple product pans are required per level of the blast chiller or blast freezer (
i.e.,
product pans can be loaded side-by-side at the same level), only the product temperature of one product pan per level shall be measured and the product pans measured should alternate vertical columns of the blast chiller or blast freezer cabinet so that each vertical column does not have two measured product pans on sequential levels. If a blast chiller or blast freezer requires an additional product pan with a thickness less than 2 in., the additional product pan shall not be measured for product temperature.
1.11. Stabilization. The blast chiller or blast freezer shall stabilize at the test conditions specified in section 1.4 of this appendix for at least 24 hours without operating.
1.12. Pre-cool Cycle. Data acquisition for the test condition temperatures specified in section 1.4 of this appendix and time measurements shall begin to be recorded prior to the pre-cool cycle. The pre-cool cycle shall be initiated on a blast chiller or blast freezer once the stabilization specified in section 1.11 of this appendix is complete. The fastest pre-cool cycle shall be selected. The pre-cool cycle shall be complete when the blast chiller or blast freezer notifies the user that the pre-cool is complete. If the blast chiller or blast freezer does not notify the user that the pre-cool cycle is complete, the pre-cool cycle shall be deemed complete when the blast chiller or blast freezer reaches 40 °F or 2 °F based on the blast chiller's or blast freezer's sensing probe for blast chillers and blast freezers, respectively. For blast chillers or blast freezers without any defined pre-cool cycles, the fastest blast chilling or blast freezing cycle shall be run with an empty cabinet until the blast chiller or blast freezer reaches 40 °F or 2 °F based on the blast chiller's or blast freezer's sensing probe. During the pre-cool cycle, the blast chiller's or blast freezer's sensing probe shall remain in its default or holstered position. The pre-cool test data to be recorded are the test condition temperatures specified in section 1.4 of this appendix, pre-cool cycle selected, pre-cool duration, and final pre-cool cabinet temperature based on the blast chiller's or blast freezer's sensing probe.
1.13. Loading. The blast chiller or blast freezer door shall be fully open to an angle of not less than 75 °F for loading at 4.0 ±1.0 minutes after the blast chiller or blast freezer completes the pre-cool cycle as specified in section 1.12 of this appendix. The door shall remain open to load all of the product pans for the entirety of the loading procedure. The door shall remain open for 20 seconds per roll-in rack and 15 seconds per product pan for roll-in and standard blast chillers or blast freezers, respectively. The total door open period shall have a tolerance of ±5 seconds. The blast chiller's or blast freezer's sensing probe shall be inserted into the geometric center of a product pan approximately 1 in. deep in the product mixture at the median pan level in the blast chiller or blast freezer. If the product pan at the median level is the additional product pan with less than 2 in. of product thickness, the closest product pan or product pan level that is farthest away from the evaporator fan shall be used to insert the blast chiller's or blast freezer's sensing probe. If the median pan level has capacity for multiple product pans, the probed product pan shall be the furthest away from the evaporator. The sensing probe shall not touch the bottom of the product pan or be exposed to the air. The location of the product pan with the sensing probe shall be recorded. The sensing probe shall be placed so that there is no interference with the product pan thermocouple. The product pan thermocouple wiring shall not affect the energy performance of the blast chiller or blast freezer. The door shall remain closed for the remainder of the test.
1.14. Blast Chilling or Blast Freezing Cycle. Determine the blast chilling or blast freezing cycle that will conduct the most rapid product temperature pulldown that is designed for the densest food product, as stated in the blast chiller's or blast freezer's manufacturer literature. A blast chilling cycle shall have a target temperature of 38.0 °F and a blast
freezing cycle shall have a target temperature of 0.0 °F. The test condition temperatures specified in section 1.4 of this appendix and the time measurements shall continue to be recorded from the pre-cool cycle. Measured product pan temperatures shall continue to be recorded from the minimum of 8-hour period of heating prior to the loading of the product pans into the blast chiller or blast freezer. Electrical supply frequency, electrical supply potential, and energy consumed shall start to be recorded as soon as the blast chiller or blast freezer door is opened to load the product pans. Once the blast chiller or blast freezer door is closed, the blast chilling cycle or blast freezing cycle shall be selected and initiated as soon as is practicable. The blast chilling cycle or blast freezing cycle selected shall be recorded. The blast chilling or blast freezing test period shall continue from the door opening until all individual measured pan temperatures are at or below 40.0 °F or 2.0 °F for blast chiller and blast freezer tests, respectively, regardless of whether the selected cycle program has terminated. If all individual measured pan temperatures do not reach 40.0 °F or 2.0 °F for blast chiller and blast freezer tests, respectively, two hours after the selected cycle program has terminated, the test shall be repeated with the target temperature lowered by 1.0 °F until all individual measured pan temperatures are at or below 40.0 °F or 2.0 °F for blast chiller and blast freezer tests, respectively, at the conclusion of the test. The duration of the blast chiller or blast freezer test shall be recorded.
1.15. Calculations. The measured energy consumption determined in section 1.14 of this appendix shall be reported in kilowatt-hours and shall be divided by the cumulative total weight of product determined in section 1.7 of this appendix in pounds.

# 2. Capacity Metric
2.1. Product Capacity. Determine the product capacity by reviewing all manufacturer literature that is included with the blast chiller or blast freezer. The largest product capacity by weight that is stated in the manufacturer literature shall be the product capacity. If the blast chiller or blast freezer is able to operate as both a blast chiller and a blast freezer when set to different operating modes by the user and the manufacturer literature specifies different product capacities for blast chilling and blast freezing, the largest capacity by weight stated for the respective operating mode shall be the product capacity. If no product capacity is stated in the manufacturer literature, the product capacity shall be the product capacity that fills the maximum number of 12 in. by 20 in. by 2.5 in. pans that can be loaded into the blast chiller or blast freezer according to section 1.7 of this appendix. If the blast chiller or blast freezer with no product capacity stated in the manufacturer literature is not capable of meeting the definition of a blast chiller or blast freezer according to § 431.62 upon testing according to section 1 of this appendix, one 12 in. by 20 in. by 2.5 in. pan shall be removed from the blast chiller or blast freezer until the definition of a blast chiller or blast freezer is met according to § 431.62 when testing according to section 1 of this appendix.

1. Test setup and Testing.
Where this section prescribes use of ANSI Z21.47-2021 or UL 727-2018, perform only the procedures pertinent to the measurement of the steady-state efficiency, as specified in this section.
1.1
Gas-fired commercial warm air furnaces.
The test setup, including flue requirement, instrumentation, test conditions, and measurements for determining thermal efficiency are as specified in section 1.3 of this appendix, and the following sections of ANSI Z21.47-2021: 5.1 (General, including ASME PTC 19.3-1974 (R2004) as referenced in Section 5.1.4), 5.2 (Basic test arrangements), 5.3 (Test ducts and plenums), 5.4 (Test gases), 5.5 (Test pressures and burner adjustments), 5.6 (Static pressure and air flow adjustments), 5.40 (Thermal efficiency), and 7.2.1 (Basic test arrangements for direct vent central furnaces). If section 1.3 of this appendix and ANSI Z21.47-2021 have conflicting provisions (
e.g.,
the number of thermocouples that should be used when testing units with flue outlets that have a cross-sectional area of 3.14 square inches or less), follow the provisions in section 1.3 of this appendix. The thermal efficiency test must be conducted only at the normal inlet test pressure, as specified in section 5.5.1 of ANSI Z21.47-2021, and at the maximum hourly Btu input rating specified by the manufacturer for the product being tested.
1.2
Oil-fired commercial warm air furnaces.
The test setup, including flue requirement, instrumentation, test conditions, and measurement for measuring thermal efficiency is as specified in section 1.3 of this appendix and the following sections of UL 727-2018: 2 (Units of Measurement), 3 (Glossary, except that the definitions for “combustible” and “non-combustible” in sections 3.11 and 3.27 shall be as referenced in NFPA 97-2003), 37 (General), 38 and 39 (Test Installation), 40 (Instrumentation, except 40.4 and 40.6.2 through 40.6.7 which are not required for the thermal efficiency test, and including ASTM E230/E230M-17 as referenced in Sections 40.6), 41 (Initial Test Conditions), 42 (Combustion Test—Burner and Furnace), 43.2 (Operation Tests), 44 (Limit Control Cutout Test), 45 (Continuity of Operation Test), and 46 (Air Flow, Downflow or Horizontal Furnace Test). If section 1.3 of this appendix and UL 727-2018 have conflicting provisions (
e.g.,
the number of thermocouples that should be used when testing units with flue outlets that have a cross-sectional area of 3.14 inches or less), follow the provisions in section 1.3 of this appendix. Conduct a fuel oil analysis for heating value, hydrogen content, carbon content, pounds per gallon, and American Petroleum Institute (API) gravity as specified in section C3.2.1.1 of AHRI 1500-2015, including the applicable provisions of ASTM D240-09, ASTM D4809-09a, ASTM D5291-10, and ASTM D396-14a, as referenced. The steady-state combustion conditions, specified in section 42.1 of UL 727-2018, are attained when variations of not more than 5 °F in the measured flue gas temperature occur for three consecutive readings taken 15 minutes apart.
1.3
Additional test setup requirements for gas-fired and oil-fired commercial warm air furnaces
1.3.1
Thermocouple setup for gas-fired and oil-fired commercial warm air furnaces with flue outlets that have a cross-sectional area of 3.14 square inches or less.
For units with flue outlets having a cross-sectional area of 3.14 square inches or less, the flue gas temperatures may optionally be measured using five individual thermocouples, instead of nine thermocouples.
1.3.2
Procedure for flue gas measurements when testing units with multiple flue outlets.
For units that have multiple flue outlets, record flue gas measurements (
e.g.,
flue gas temperature, CO
2
in the flue gasses) separately for each individual flue outlet and calculate a weighted-average value based on the readings of all flue outlets. To determine the weighted average for each measurement, first determine the input rating of the furnace module associated with each flue outlet. Then multiply the ratio of the input rating for the furnace module associated with each individual flue outlet to the total
nameplate input rating of the furnace (
i.e.,
the input rating associated with each individual flue outlet divided by the total nameplate input rating) by that flue outlet's respective component measurement and the sum of all of the products of the calculations for all of the flue outlets to determine the weighted-average values. Use the weighted-average values to determine flue loss, and whether equilibrium conditions are met before the official test period.
2. Additional test measurements
2.1
Determination of flue CO
2
(carbon dioxide) or O
2
(oxygen) for oil-fired commercial warm air furnaces.
In addition to the flue temperature measurement specified in section 40.6.8 of UL 727-2018, locate one or two sampling tubes within six inches downstream from the flue temperature probe (as indicated on Figure 40.3 of UL 727-2018). If an open end tube is used, it must project into the flue one-third of the chimney connector diameter. If other methods of sampling the flue gas are used, place the sampling tube so as to obtain an average sample. There must be no air leak between the temperature probe and the sampling tube location. Collect the flue gas sample at the same time the flue gas temperature is recorded. The CO
2
or O
2
concentration of the flue gas must be as specified by the manufacturer for the product being tested, with a tolerance of ±0.1 percent. Determine the flue CO
2
or O
2
using an instrument with a reading error no greater than ±0.1 percent.
2.2
Procedure for the measurement of condensate for a gas-fired condensing commercial warm air furnace.
The test procedure for the measurement of the condensate from the flue gas under steady-state operation must be conducted as specified in sections 7.2.2.4, 7.8, and 9.2 of ASHRAE 103-2022 under the maximum rated input conditions. This condensate measurement must be conducted for an additional 30 minutes of steady-state operation after completion of the steady-state thermal efficiency test specified in section 1.1 of this appendix.
3. Calculation of thermal efficiency
3.1
Gas-fired commercial warm air furnaces.
Use the calculation procedure specified in Section 5.40, Thermal efficiency, of ANSI Z21.47-2021. When determining the flue loss that is used in the calculation of thermal efficiency, the calculation method specified in Annex I of ANSI Z21.47-2021 shall be used.
3.2
Oil-fired commercial warm air furnaces.
Calculate the percent flue loss (in percent of heat input rate) by following the procedure specified in sections C7.2.4, C7.2.5, and C7.2.6.2 of the AHRI 1500-2015. The thermal efficiency must be calculated as: Thermal Efficiency (percent) = 100 percent − flue loss (in percent).
4. Procedure for the calculation of the additional heat gain and heat loss, and adjustment to the thermal efficiency, for a condensing commercial warm air furnace.
4.1 Calculate the latent heat gain from the condensation of the water vapor in the flue gas, and calculate heat loss due to the flue condensate down the drain, as specified in sections 11.3.7.1 and 11.3.7.2 of ASHRAE 103-2022, with the exception that in the equation for the heat loss due to hot condensate flowing down the drain in section 11.3.7.2, the assumed indoor temperature of 70 °F and the temperature term T
OA
must be replaced by the measured room temperature as specified in section 5.2.8 of ANSI Z21.47.
4.2
Adjustment to the thermal efficiency for condensing commercial warm air furnaces.
Adjust the thermal efficiency as calculated in section 3.1 of this appendix by adding the latent gain, expressed in percent, from the condensation of the water vapor in the flue gas, and subtracting the heat loss (due to the flue condensate down the drain), also expressed in percent, both as calculated in section 4.1 of this appendix, to obtain the thermal efficiency of a condensing furnace.

# Appendix B to Subpart D of Part 431-Uniform Test Method for Measurement of the Energy Efficiency of Commercial Warm Air Furnaces (Thermal Efficiency Two)

# Note:
Manufacturers must use the results of testing under this appendix B to determine compliance with any standards for commercial warm air furnaces that use the thermal efficiency 2 (TE2) metric. In addition, manufacturers may optionally make representations of energy use or efficiency of this equipment using TE2 as determined using this appendix starting on July 3, 2023.
0. Incorporation by Reference.
In § 431.75, DOE incorporates by reference the entire standard ANSI Z21.47-2021. However, only section 5.40 and Appendix J of ANSI Z21.47-2021 apply, as specified in sections 1.2 and 1.6 of this appendix.
1. Testing
1.1 Set up and test the unit according to sections 0 through 4 of appendix A to this subpart, while operating the unit at the maximum nameplate input rate (
i.e.,
full load). Calculate thermal efficiency (TE) using the procedure specified in sections 3 and 4 of appendix A to this subpart.
1.2 For commercial warm air furnaces that are designed for outdoor installation (including but not limited to CWAFs that are weatherized, or approved for resistance to wind, rain, or snow), or indoor installation within an unheated space (
i.e.,
isolated combustion systems), determine the jacket loss using Section 5.40 and Annex J of ANSI Z21.47-2021 while the unit is operating at the
maximum nameplate input. The jacket shall consist of the surfaces surrounding the heating section of the furnace. The jacket includes all surfaces separating the heating section from the supply air, outside air, or condenser section, including the bottom surface separating the heating section from the basepan.
1.3 For commercial warm air furnaces that are designed only for indoor installation within a heated space, jacket loss shall be zero. For commercial warm air furnaces that are designed for indoor installation within a heated or unheated space, multiply the jacket loss determined in section 1.2 of this appendix by 1.7. For all other commercial warm air furnaces, including commercial warm air furnaces that are designed for outdoor installation (including but not limited to CWAFs that are weatherized, or approved for resistance to wind, rain, or snow), multiply the jacket loss determined in section 1.2 of this appendix by 3.3.
1.4 Subtract the jacket loss determined in section 1.3 of this appendix from the TE determined in section 1.1 of this appendix to determine the full-load efficiency.
1.5 Set up and test the unit according to sections 0 through 4 of appendix A to this subpart, while operating the unit at the nameplate minimum input rate (
i.e.,
part load). Calculate TE using the procedure specified in sections 3 and 4 of appendix A to this subpart.
1.6 For commercial warm air furnaces that are designed for outdoor installation (including but not limited to CWAFs that are weatherized, or approved for resistance to wind, rain, or snow), or indoor installation within an unheated space (
i.e.,
isolated combustion systems), determine the jacket loss using Section 5.40 and Annex J of ANSI Z21.47-2021 while the unit is operating at the minimum nameplate input. Alternatively, the jacket loss determined in section 1.2 of this appendix at the maximum nameplate input may be used.
1.7 For commercial warm air furnaces that are designed only for indoor installation within a heated space, jacket loss shall be zero. For commercial warm air furnaces that are designed for indoor installation within a heated or unheated space, multiply the jacket loss determined in section 1.6 of this appendix by 1.7. For all other commercial warm air furnaces, including commercial warm air furnaces that are designed for outdoor installation (including but not limited to CWAFs that are weatherized, or approved for resistance to wind, rain, or snow), multiply the jacket loss determined in section 1.6 of this appendix by 3.3.
1.8 Subtract the jacket loss determined in section 1.7 of this appendix from the TE determined in section 1.5 of this appendix to determine the part-load efficiency.
1.9 Calculate TE2 by taking the average of the full-load and part-load efficiencies as determined in sections 1.4 and 1.8 of this appendix, respectively.

Additional provisions for equipment set-up.
The only additional specifications that may be used in setting up the basic model for test are those set forth in the installation and operation manual shipped with the unit. Each unit should be set up for test in accordance with the manufacturer installation and operation manuals. Paragraphs (e)(1) through (3) of this section provide specifications for addressing key information typically found in the installation and operation manuals.
(1) If a manufacturer specifies a range of superheat, sub-cooling, and/or refrigerant pressure in its installation and operation manual for a given basic model, any value(s) within that range may be used to determine refrigerant charge or mass of refrigerant, unless the manufacturer clearly specifies a rating value in its installation and operation manual, in which case the specified rating value shall be used.
(2) The air flow rate used for testing must be that set forth in the installation and operation manuals being shipped to the commercial customer with the basic model and clearly identified as that used to generate the DOE performance ratings. If a rated air flow value for testing is not clearly identified, a value of 400 standard cubic feet per minute (scfm) per ton shall be used.
(3) For VRF systems, the test set-up and the fixed compressor speeds (
i.e.,
the maximum, minimum, and any intermediate speeds used for testing) should be recorded and maintained as part of the test data underlying the certified ratings that is required to be maintained under 10 CFR 429.71.
(f)
Manufacturer involvement in assessment or enforcement testing for variable refrigerant flow systems.
A manufacturer's representative will be allowed to witness assessment and/or enforcement testing for VRF systems. The manufacturer's representative will be allowed to inspect and discuss set-up only with a DOE representative and adjust only the modulating components during testing in the presence of a DOE representative that are necessary to achieve steady-state operation. Only previously documented specifications for set-up as specified under paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section will be used.
(g)
Test Procedures for Packaged Terminal Air Conditioners and Packaged Terminal Heat Pumps

For packaged terminal air conditioners and packaged terminal heat pumps, the unit must be installed in a wall sleeve with a 14 inch depth if available. If a 14 inch deep wall sleeve is not available, use the available wall sleeve option closest to 14 inches in depth. The area(s) between the wall sleeve and the insulated partition between the indoor and outdoor rooms must be sealed to eliminate all air leakage through this area.
(4)
Optional pre-filling of the condensate drain pan.
For packaged terminal air conditioners and packaged terminal heat pumps, test facilities may add water to the condensate drain pan of the equipment under test (until the water drains out due to overflow devices or until the pan is full) prior to conducting the test method specified by AHRI 310/380-2014 (incorporated by reference, see § 431.95). No specific level of water mineral content or water temperature is required for the water added to the condensate drain pan.
(5)
Filter selection.
For packaged terminal air conditioners and packaged terminal heat pumps, the indoor filter used during testing shall be the standard or default filter option shipped with the model. If a particular model is shipped without a filter, the unit must be tested with a MERV-1 filter sized appropriately for the filter slot.

# 5. Test Procedure
5.1
Control Settings.
Control settings must be set in accordance with Sections 5.1.3, 5.1.4, 5.1.5, and 5.2 of AHRI 1230-2021. For systems equipped with head pressure controls, the head pressure controls must be set per manufacturer installation instructions or per factory settings if no instructions are provided. Indoor airflow-control settings must be set in accordance with Section 6.3.1 of AHRI 1230-2021. At each load point, critical parameters must be set to the values certified in the supplemental testing instructions (STI) provided by the manufacturer pursuant to § 429.43(b)(4) of this chapter. In cases in which a certified critical parameter value is not in the STI, the system must operate per commands from the system controls for that parameter. Once set, control settings must remain unchanged for the remainder of the test (except for allowable adjustment of critical parameters as described in section 5.2 of this appendix).
5.2
Allowable Critical Parameter Adjustments for IEER Cooling Tests.
The following sections describe allowable adjustments to critical parameters after the initial system set-up (during which all control settings, including certified critical parameters, are set). Adjust critical parameters in order to achieve full- and part-load cooling capacity targets and sensible heat ratio (SHR) limits.
5.2.1
Critical Parameter Adjustments for Meeting Cooling Capacity Targets.
Once critical parameters have been set to the values certified in the STI, if the unit cannot operate within 3% of the target cooling capacity (
i.e.,
within 3% of the load fraction for a given part-load cooling test (75%, 50%, or 25% load) or within 3% of the certified cooling capacity for a 100% full-load cooling test), manually-controlled critical parameters must be adjusted according to the following provisions:
5.2.1.1.
Cooling Capacity is Below Lower Tolerance.
If, for any test, the cooling capacity operates below the lower tolerance for the target cooling capacity, increase the compressor speed(s) beyond the STI-certified value(s) until the cooling capacity operates within 3% of the target cooling capacity. If multiple compressors are present in the system, increase compressor speed by the same absolute increment in RPM or Hz for each compressor for which the following conditions apply:
(a) The STI specifies a non-zero compressor speed for the compressor for that test and
(b) The compressor has not yet reached its maximum capable operating speed. The compressor speed(s) must not be less than the STI-certified value(s) at any point during the test. Upward adjustments to compressor speed are not constrained by a budget on RSS Points Total (See section 5.2.1.2.1 of this appendix).
5.2.1.2
Cooling Capacity is Above Upper Tolerance.
If, for any test, the cooling capacity operates above the upper tolerance for the target cooling capacity, adjust any manually-controlled critical parameters per the STI. If the STI does not include a hierarchy of instructions for adjustment of critical parameters to reduce cooling capacity during IEER cooling tests, then reduce only the compressor speed(s) to reduce cooling capacity. If multiple compressors are present in the system, decrease compressor speed by the same absolute increment for each compressor for which the following conditions apply:
(a) The STI specifies a non-zero compressor speed for the compressor for that test and
(b) The compressor has not yet reached minimum speed. Continue reducing cooling capacity in this manner until one of the following occurs:
(1) The unit operates within 3% of the target cooling capacity; or
(2) The RSS point total reaches a budget of 70 points (see section 5.2.1.2.1 of this appendix). For the 75%, 50%, and 25% part-load cooling test points, if the RSS point total reaches 70 during critical parameter adjustments before the capacity operates within 3% of the target cooling capacity, stop adjustment and follow cyclic degradation procedures in accordance with Section 11.2.2.1 of AHRI 1230-2021.
5.2.1.2.1
Measuring Critical Parameter Variation During Adjustment Period.
When adjusting critical parameters to reduce cooling capacity, critical parameter variation must be calculated each time the critical parameters are adjusted, using the following equations:
(a) First, use equation 5.2-1 to calculate the absolute parameter percent difference () between each adjusted critical parameter and the value for that parameter certified in the STI.

Where:
“i” identifies the critical parameter—either compressors speed(s), outdoor fan speed(s), or outdoor variable valve position(s)
CP
i

Adj
= The adjusted position of critical parameter “i” recorded at each measurement interval. If multiple components corresponding to a single parameter are present (e.g., multiple compressors), calculate the average position across all components corresponding to that parameter at each measurement interval when determining
CP

,

CP
Max
= The maximum operating position for Critical Parameter “i” as certified in the STI for the 100% load condition. If multiple components corresponding to a single parameter are present, calculate as the average value across all components corresponding to that critical parameter certified in the STI for the 100% load condition.
(b) Next, use equation 5.2-2 to this section to determine the accrued points for each critical parameter:
ER20OC22.003
Where:
“i” identifies the critical parameter—either compressors speed(s), outdoor fan speed(s), or outdoor variable valve position(s)
NPV
i
= the nominal point value for critical parameter “i” as follows:
Table 5.1—Critical Parameter Nominal Point Values
Critical parameter

(c) Finally, use equation 5.2-3 to this section to calculate the root-sum-squared (RSS) Points Total across all critical parameters.
ER20OC22.004
5.2.2
Critical Parameter Adjustments for Meeting SHR Limits.
The SHR for the 100% load test point and the 75% part-load test point must not be higher than 0.82 and 0.85, respectively (measured to the nearest hundredth). If the SHR is above the allowable limit, increase the compressor speed(s) until either the SHR is less than or equal to the allowable limit or the cooling capacity reaches 3% greater than the target cooling capacity for that test, whichever happens first. If multiple compressors are present in the system, increase compressor speed by the same absolute increment for each compressor for which the following conditions apply:
(a) The STI specifies a non-zero compressor speed for the compressor for that test and
(b) The compressor has not yet reached maximum speed. Upwards adjustments to compressor speed are not constrained by a budget on RSS Points Total. Should the SHR remain above the maximum limit when the cooling capacity reaches its upper 3% tolerance, no further compressor adjustments shall be made, and the calculation procedures specified in Section 11.2.2.2 of AHRI 1230-2021 must be applied using the adjusted SHR value obtained after increasing the compressor speed(s).

The difference between the outlet pressure of the gas appliance pressure regulator and the value specified by the manufacturer on the nameplate of the unit being tested must not exceed the greater of: ± 10 percent of the nameplate value or ± 0.2 inches water column (in. w.c.). Obtain the higher heating value of the gas burned.
3.3.
Ambient Room Temperature.
During the soak-in period (as applicable), the steady-state verification period, the thermal efficiency test, and the standby loss test, maintain the ambient room temperature at 75 °F ± 10 °F at all times. Measure the ambient room temperature at 1-minute intervals during these periods, except for the soak-in period. Measure the ambient room temperature
once before beginning the soak-in period, and ensure no actions are taken during the soak-in period that would cause the ambient room temperature to deviate from the allowable range. Measure the ambient room temperature at the vertical mid-point of the water heater and approximately 2 feet from the water heater jacket. Shield the sensor against radiation. Calculate the average ambient room temperature separately for the thermal efficiency test and standby loss test. During the thermal efficiency and standby loss tests, the ambient room temperature must not vary by more than ± 5.0 °F at any reading from the average ambient room temperature.
3.4.
Test Air Temperature.
During the steady-state verification period, the thermal efficiency test, and the standby loss test, the test air temperature must not vary by more than ± 5 °F from the ambient room temperature at any reading. Measure the test air temperature at 1-minute intervals during these periods and at a location within two feet of the air inlet of the water heater or the combustion air intake vent, as applicable. Shield the sensor against radiation. For units with multiple air inlets, measure the test air temperature at each air inlet, and maintain the specified tolerance on deviation from the ambient room temperature at each air inlet. For units without a dedicated air inlet, measure the test air temperature within two feet of any location on the water heater where combustion air is drawn.
3.5.
Maximum Air Draft.
During the steady-state verification period, the thermal efficiency test, and the standby loss test, the water heater must be located in an area protected from drafts of more than 50 ft/min. Prior to beginning the steady-state verification period and the standby loss test, measure the air draft within three feet of the jacket or enclosure of the water heater to ensure this condition is met. Ensure that no other changes that would increase the air draft are made to the test set-up or conditions during the conduct of the tests.
3.6.
Setting the Tank Thermostat.
Before starting the steady-state verification period (as applicable) or before the soak-in period (as applicable), the thermostat setting must first be obtained by starting with the water in the system at 70 °F ± 2 °F. Set the thermostat to ensure:
3.6.1. With the supply water temperature set as per section 3.1.2 of this appendix (
i.e.,
70 °F ± 2 °F), the water flow rate can be varied so that the outlet water temperature is constant at 70 °F ± 2 °F above the supply water temperature while the burner is firing at full firing rate; and
3.6.2. After the water supply is turned off and the thermostat reduces the fuel supply to a minimum, the maximum water temperature measured by the topmost tank temperature sensor (
i.e.,
the highest of the 6 temperature sensors used for calculating mean tank temperature, as required by section 2.3 of this appendix) is 140 °F ± 5 °F.

2
reading is within the range specified by the manufacturer;
3.7.2.2. The fuel pump pressure is within ± 10 percent of manufacturer's specifications;
3.7.2.3. If either the fuel pump pressure or range for CO
2
reading are not specified by the manufacturer on the nameplate of the unit, in literature shipped with the unit, or in supplemental test report instructions included with a certification report, then a default value of 100 psig is to be used for fuel pump pressure, and a default range of 9-12 percent is to be used for CO
2
reading; and
3.7.2.4. Smoke in the flue does not exceed No. 1 smoke as measured by the procedure in ASTM D2156-09 (Reapproved 2013) (incorporated by reference, see § 431.105). To determine the smoke spot number, connect the smoke measuring device to an open-ended tube. This tube must project into the flue
1/4
to
1/2
of the pipe diameter.
3.7.2.5. If no settings on the water heater have been changed and the water heater has not been turned off since the end of a previously run thermal efficiency or standby loss test, measurement of the CO
2
reading and conduct of the smoke spot test are not required prior to beginning a test. Otherwise, measure the CO
2

4. Determination of Storage Volume.
Determine the storage volume by subtracting the tare weight, measured while the system is dry and empty, from the weight of the system when filled with water and dividing the resulting net weight of water by the density of water at the measured water temperature. The volume of the water contained in the water heater must be computed in gallons.
5.
Thermal Efficiency Test.
Before beginning the steady-state verification period, record the applicable parameters as specified in section 3.8.2 of this appendix. Begin drawing water from the unit by opening the main supply, and adjust the water flow rate to achieve an outlet water temperature of 70 °F ± 2 °F above supply water temperature. The thermal efficiency test shall be deemed complete when there is a continuous, one-hour-long period where the steady-state conditions specified in section 5.1 of this appendix have been met, as confirmed by consecutive readings of the relevant parameters recorded at 1-minute intervals (except for fuel input rate, which is determined at 10-minute intervals, as specified in section 5.4 of this appendix). During the one-hour-long period, the water heater must fire continuously at its full firing rate (
i.e.,
no modulations or cut-outs) and no settings can be changed on the unit being tested at any time. The first 30
minutes of the one-hour-period where the steady-state conditions in section 5.1 of this appendix are met is the steady-state verification period. The final 30 minutes of the one-hour-period where the steady-state conditions in section 5.1 of this appendix are met is the thermal efficiency test. The last reading of the steady-state verification period must be the first reading of the thermal efficiency test (
i.e.,
the thermal efficiency test starts immediately once the steady-state verification period ends).
5.
1.
Steady-State Conditions.
The following conditions must be met at consecutive readings taken at 1-minute intervals (except for fuel input rate, for which measurements are taken at 10-minute intervals) to verify the water heater has achieved steady-state operation during the steady-state verification period and thermal efficiency test.
5.1.1. The water flow rate must be maintained within ± 0.25 gallons per minute (gpm) of the initial reading at the start of the steady-state verification period;
5.1.2. Outlet water temperature must be maintained at 70 °F ± 2 °F above supply water temperature;
5.1.3. Fuel input rate must be maintained within ± 2 percent of the rated input certified by the manufacturer;
5.1.4. The supply water temperature must be maintained within ± 0.50 °F of the initial reading at the start of the steady-state verification period; and
5.1.5. The rise between the supply and outlet water temperatures must be maintained within ± 0.50 °F of its initial value taken at the start of the steady-state verification period for units with rated input less than 500,000 Btu/h, and maintained within ± 1.00 °F of its initial value for units with rated input greater than or equal to 500,000 Btu/h.
5.2.
Water Flow Measurement.
Measure the total weight of water heated during the 30-minute thermal efficiency test with either a scale or a water flow meter. With either method, the error of measurement of weight of water heated must not exceed 1 percent of the weight of the total draw.
5.
3.
Determination of Fuel Input Rate.
During the steady-state verification period and the thermal efficiency test, record the fuel consumed at 10-minute intervals. Calculate the fuel input rate over each 10-minute period using the equations in section 5.4 of this appendix. The measured fuel input rates for these 10-minute periods must not vary by more than ± 2 percent between any two readings. Determine the overall fuel input rate using the fuel consumption for the entire duration of the thermal efficiency test.

5.
1. If no settings on the water heater have changed and the water heater has not been turned off since a previously run standby loss test, skip to section 5.3 of this appendix. Otherwise, conduct the soak-in period according to section 5.2 of this appendix.
5.2.
Soak-In Period.
Conduct a soak-in period, in which the water heater must sit without any draws taking place for at least 12 hours. Begin the soak-in period after setting the tank thermostat(s) as specified in section 3.5 of this appendix, and maintain these settings throughout the soak-in period.
5.3. Begin the standby loss test at the first cut-out following the end of the soak-in period (if applicable), or at a cut-out following the previous standby loss test (if applicable). Allow the water heater to remain in standby mode. At this point, do not change any settings on the water heater until measurements for the standby loss test are finished. Begin recording applicable parameters as specified in section 3.6.2 of this appendix.
5.4. At the second cut-out, record the time and ambient room temperature, and begin measuring the electric consumption. Record the initial mean tank temperature and initial ambient room temperature. For the remainder of the test, continue recording the applicable parameters specified in section 3.6.2 of this appendix.
5.5. Stop the test after the first cut-out that occurs after 24 hours, or at 48 hours, whichever comes first.
5.
6. Immediately after conclusion of the standby loss test, record the total electrical energy consumption, the final ambient room temperature, the duration of the standby
loss test, and if the test ends at 48 hours without a cut-out, the final mean tank temperature, or if the test ends after a cut-out, the maximum mean tank temperature that occurs after the cut-out. Calculate the average of the recorded values of the mean tank temperature and of the ambient air temperatures taken at each measurement interval, including the initial and final values.

Install equipment that determines, within ± 1 percent:
2.
7.1. The quantity and rate of fuel consumed.
2.7.2. The quantity of electricity consumed by factory-supplied water heater components, and of the test loop recirculating pump, if used.

# 3. Test Conditions

# 3.1. Water Supply
3.1.1.
Water Supply Pressure.
The pressure of the water supply must be maintained between 40 psi and the maximum pressure specified by the manufacturer of the unit being tested. The accuracy of the pressure-measuring devices must be within ± 1.0 psi.
3.
1.2.
Water Supply Temperature.
During the thermal efficiency test and steady-state verification period (as applicable), the temperature of the supply water (T
SWT
) must be maintained at 70 °F ± 2 °F.
3.
2.
Gas Pressure for Gas-Fired Equipment.
The supply gas pressure must be within the range specified by the manufacturer on the nameplate of the unit being tested. The difference between the outlet pressure of the gas appliance pressure regulator and the value specified by the manufacturer on the nameplate of the unit being tested must not exceed the greater of: ± 10 percent of the nameplate value or ± 0.2 inches water column (in. w.c.). Obtain the higher heating value of the gas burned.
3.3.
Ambient Room Temperature.
Maintain the ambient room temperature at 75 °F ± 10 °F at all times during the steady-state verification period, the thermal efficiency test, and the standby loss test (as applicable). Measure the ambient room temperature at 1-minute intervals during these periods. Measure the ambient room temperature at the vertical mid-point of the water heater and approximately 2 feet from the water heater jacket or enclosure. Shield the sensor against radiation. Calculate the average ambient room temperature separately for the thermal efficiency test and the standby loss test. During the thermal efficiency and standby loss tests, the ambient room temperature must not vary by more than ± 5.0 °F at any reading from the average ambient room temperature.
3.4.
Test Air Temperature.
During the steady-state verification period, the thermal efficiency test, and the standby loss test (as applicable), the test air temperature must not vary by more than ± 5 °F from the ambient room temperature at any reading. Measure the test air temperature at 1-minute intervals during these periods and at a location within two feet of the air inlet of the water heater or the combustion air intake vent, as applicable. Shield the sensor against radiation. For units with multiple air inlets, measure the test air temperature at each air inlet, and maintain the specified tolerance on deviation from the ambient room temperature at each air inlet. For units without a dedicated air inlet, measure the test air
temperature within two feet of any location on the water heater where combustion air is drawn.
3.
5.
Maximum Air Draft.
During the steady-state verification period, the thermal efficiency test, and the standby loss test (as applicable), the water heater must be located in an area protected from drafts of more than 50 ft/min. Prior to beginning the steady-state verification period and the standby loss test, measure the air draft within three feet of the jacket or enclosure of the water heater to ensure this condition is met. Ensure that no other changes that would increase the air draft are made to the test set-up or conditions during the conduct of the tests.

# 3.6. Primary Control
3.6.1.
Thermostatically-Activated Water Heaters With an Internal Thermostat.
Before starting the thermal efficiency test and the standby loss test (unless the thermostat is already set before the thermal efficiency test), the thermostat setting must be obtained. Set the thermostat to ensure:
3.6.1.1. With supply water temperature set as per section 3.1.2 of this appendix (
i.e.,
70 °F ± 2 °F) the water flow rate can be varied so that the outlet water temperature is constant at 70 °F ± 2 °F above the supply water temperature, while the burner is firing at full firing rate; and
3.6.1.2. After the water supply is turned off and the thermostat reduces the fuel supply to a minimum, the maximum heat exchanger outlet water temperature (T
OHX
) is 140 °F ± 5 °F.
3.6.1.3. If the water heater includes a built-in safety mechanism that prevents it from achieving a heat exchanger outlet water temperature of 140 °F ± 5 °F, adjust the thermostat to its maximum setting.
3.6.2.
Flow-Activated Instantaneous Water Heaters and Thermostatically-Activated Instantaneous Water Heaters With an External Thermostat.
Energize the primary control such that it is always calling for heating and the burner is firing at the full firing rate. Maintain the supply water temperature as per section 3.1.2 of this appendix (
i.e.,
70 °F ± 2 °F). Set the control so that the outlet water temperature (T
OWT
) is 140 °F ± 5 °F. If the water heater includes a built-in safety mechanism that prevents it from achieving a heat exchanger outlet water temperature of 140 °F ± 5 °F, adjust the control to its maximum setting.

# 3.7. Units With Multiple Outlet Water Connections
3.7.1. For each connection leaving the water heater that is required for the unit to achieve the rated input, the outlet water temperature must not differ from that of any other outlet water connection by more than 2 °F during the steady-state verification period and thermal efficiency test.
3.7.2. Determine the outlet water temperature representative for the entire unit at every required measurement interval by calculating the average of the outlet water temperatures measured at each connection leaving the water heater jacket or enclosure that is used during testing. Use the outlet water temperature representative for the entire unit in all calculations for the thermal efficiency and standby loss tests, as applicable.
3.8.
Additional Requirements for Oil-Fired Equipment.
3.
8.1.
Venting Requirements.
Connect a vertical length of flue pipe to the flue gas outlet of sufficient height so as to meet the minimum draft specified by the manufacturer.
3.8.2.
Oil Supply.
Adjust the burner rate so that the following conditions are met:
3.8.2.1. The CO
2
reading is within the range specified by the manufacturer;
3.8.2.2. The fuel pump pressure is within ± 10 percent of manufacturer's specifications;
3.8.2.3. If either the fuel pump pressure or range for CO
2
reading are not specified by the manufacturer on the nameplate of the unit, in literature shipped with the unit, or in supplemental test report instructions included with a certification report, then a default value of 100 psig is to be used for fuel pump pressure, and a default range of 9-12 percent is to be used for CO
2
reading; and
3.8.2.4. Smoke in the flue does not exceed No. 1 smoke as measured by the procedure in ASTM D2156-09 (Reapproved 2013) (incorporated by reference, see § 431.105). To determine the smoke spot number, the smoke measuring device shall be connected to an open-ended tube. This tube must project into the flue
1/4
to
1/2
of the pipe diameter.
3.8.2.5. If no settings on the water heater have been changed and the water heater has not been turned off since the end of a previously run thermal efficiency (or standby loss test for thermostatically-activated instantaneous water heaters with an internal thermostat), measurement of the CO
2
reading and conduct of the smoke spot test are not required prior to beginning a test. Otherwise, measure the CO
2
reading and determine the smoke spot number, with the burner firing, before beginning measurements for the steady-state verification period (prior to beginning the thermal efficiency test or standby loss test, as applicable). However, measurement of the CO
2
reading and conduct of the smoke spot test are not required for the standby loss test for thermostatically-activated instantaneous water heaters with an external thermostat and flow-activated instantaneous water heaters.

The water flow rate and supply water temperature and inlet water temperature (if a recirculating loop is used) must be measured during the steady-state verification period at 1-minute intervals. After the steady-state verification period ends, flow rate, supply water temperature, and inlet water temperature (if measured) are not required to be measured during the standby loss test, as there is no flow occurring during the standby loss test.
4. Determination of Storage Volume.
Determine the storage volume by subtracting the tare weight, measured while the system is dry and empty, from the weight of the system when filled with water and dividing the resulting net weight of water by the density
of water at the measured water temperature. The volume of water contained in the water heater must be computed in gallons.

# 5. Fuel Input Rate
5.1. Determination of Fuel Input Rate.
During the steady-state verification period and thermal efficiency test, as applicable, record the fuel consumption at 10-minute intervals. Calculate the fuel input rate for each 10-minute period using the equations in section 5.2 of this appendix. The measured fuel input rates for these 10-minute periods must not vary by more than ± 2 percent between any two readings. Determine the overall fuel input rate using the fuel consumption for the entire duration of the thermal efficiency test.
5.2. Fuel Input Rate Calculation.
To calculate the fuel input rate, use the following equation:
ER10NO16.022
Where:
Q = Fuel input rate, expressed in Btu/h
Q
s
= Total fuel flow as metered, expressed in ft

for gas-fired equipment and Btu/lb for oil-fired equipment.
t = Duration of measurement of fuel consumption
6.
Thermal Efficiency Test.
Before beginning the steady-state verification period, record the applicable parameters as specified in section 3.9.1 of this appendix. Begin drawing water from the unit by opening the main supply and outlet water valve, and adjust the water flow rate to achieve an outlet water temperature of 70 °F ± 2 °F above supply water temperature. The thermal efficiency test shall be deemed complete when there is a continuous, one-hour-long period where the steady-state conditions specified in section 6.1 of this appendix have been met, as confirmed by consecutive readings of the relevant parameters at 1-minute intervals (except for fuel input rate, which is determined at 10-minute intervals, as specified in section 5.1 of this appendix). During the one-hour-long period, the water heater must fire continuously at its full firing rate (
i.e.,
no modulation or cut-outs) and no settings can be changed on the unit being tested at any time. The first 30 minutes of the one-hour-period where the steady-state conditions in section 6.1 of this appendix are met is the steady-state verification period. The final 30 minutes of the one-hour-period where the steady-state conditions in section 6.1 of this appendix are met is the thermal efficiency test. The last reading of the steady-state verification period must be the first reading of the thermal efficiency test (
i.e.,
the thermal efficiency test starts immediately once the steady-state verification period ends).
6.1.
Steady-State Conditions.
The following conditions must be met at consecutive readings taken at 1-minute intervals (except for fuel input rate, for which measurements are taken at 10-minute intervals) to verify the water heater has achieved steady-state operation during the steady-state verification period and the thermal efficiency test.
6.1.1. The water flow rate must be maintained within ± 0.25 gallons per minute (gpm) of the initial reading at the start of the steady-state verification period.
6.1.2. Outlet water temperature must be maintained at 70 °F ± 2 °F above supply water temperature.
6.1.3. Fuel input rate must be maintained within ± 2 percent of the rated input certified by the manufacturer.
6.1.4. The supply water temperature (T
SWT
) (or inlet water temperature (T
IWT
) if a recirculating loop is used) must be maintained within ± 0.50 °F of the initial reading at the start of the steady-state verification period.
6.1.5. The rise between supply (or inlet if a recirculating loop is used) and outlet water temperatures must be maintained within ± 0.50 °F of its initial value taken at the start of the steady-state verification period for units with rated input less than 500,000 Btu/h, and maintained within ± 1.00 °F of its initial value for units with rated input greater than or equal to 500,000 Btu/h.
6.2.
Water Flow Measurement.
Measure the total weight of water heated during the 30-minute thermal efficiency test with either a scale or a water flow meter. With either method, the error of measurement of weight of water heated must not exceed 1 percent of the weight of the total draw.
6.3.
Thermal Efficiency Calculation.
Thermal efficiency must be calculated using data from the 30-minute thermal efficiency test.
Calculate thermal efficiency, E

7.
Standby Loss Test.
If the standby loss test is conducted immediately after a thermal efficiency test and no settings or conditions have been changed since the completion of the thermal efficiency test, then skip to section 7.2 or 7.3 of this appendix (as applicable). Otherwise, perform the steady-state verification in section 7.1 of this appendix. For thermostatically-activated instantaneous water heaters with an internal thermostat, use section 7.2 of this appendix to conduct the standby loss test, and for flow-activated and/or thermostatically-activated instantaneous water heaters with an external thermostat use section 7.3 of this appendix to conduct the standby loss test.
7.1.
Steady-State Verification Period.
For water heaters where the standby loss test is not conducted immediately following the thermal efficiency test, the steady-state verification period must be conducted before starting the standby loss test. Set the primary control in accordance with section 3.6 of this appendix, such that the primary control is always calling for heat and the water heater is firing continuously at the full firing rate (
i.e.,
no modulation or cut-outs). Begin drawing water from the unit by opening the main supply and the outlet water valve, and adjust the water flow rate to achieve an outlet water temperature of 70 °F ± 2 °F above supply water temperature. The steady-state verification period is complete when there is a continuous 30-minute period where the steady-state conditions specified in section 7.1.1 of this appendix are met, as confirmed by consecutive readings of the relevant parameters recorded at 1-minute intervals (except for fuel input rate, which is determined at 10-minute intervals, as specified in section 5.1 of this appendix).
7.1.1.
Steady-State Conditions.
The following conditions must be met at consecutive readings taken at 1-minute intervals (except for fuel input rate, for which measurements are taken at 10-minute intervals) to verify the water heater has achieved steady-state operation during the steady-state verification period prior to conducting the standby loss test.
7.1.1.1. The water flow rate must be maintained within ± 0.25 gallons per minute (gpm) of the initial reading at the start of the steady-state verification period;
7.1.1.2. Fuel input rate must be maintained within ± 2 percent of the rated input certified by the manufacturer;
7.1.1.3. The supply water temperature (T
SWT
) (or inlet water temperature (T
IWT
) if a recirculating loop is used) must be maintained within ± 0.50 °F of the initial reading at the start of the steady-state verification period; and
7.1.1.4. The rise between the supply (or inlet if a recirculating loop is used) and outlet water temperatures must be maintained within ± 0.50 °F of its initial value taken at the start of the steady-state verification period for units with rated input less than 500,000 Btu/h, and maintained within ± 1.00 °F of its initial value for units with rated input greater than or equal to 500,000 Btu/h.
7.2.
Thermostatically-Activated Instantaneous Water Heaters with an Internal Thermostat.
For water heaters that will experience cut-in based on a temperature-activated control that is internal to the water heater, use the following steps to conduct the standby loss test.
7.2.1. Immediately after the thermal efficiency test or the steady-state verification period (as applicable), turn off the outlet water valve(s) (installed as per the provisions in section 2.2 of this appendix), and the water pump (if applicable) simultaneously and ensure that there is no flow of water through the water heater.
7
.2.2. After the first cut-out following the end of the thermal efficiency test or steady-state verification period (as applicable),
allow the water heater to remain in standby mode. Do not change any settings on the water heater at any point until measurements for the standby loss test are finished. Begin recording the applicable parameters specified in section 3.9.2 of this appendix.
7
.2.3. At the second cut-out, record the time and ambient room temperature, and begin measuring the fuel and electricity consumption. Record the initial heat exchanger outlet water temperature (T
OHX
) and initial ambient room temperature. For the remainder of the test, continue recording the applicable parameters specified in section 3.9.2 of this appendix.
7
.2.4. Stop the test after the first cut-out that occurs after 24 hours, or at 48 hours, whichever comes first.
7
.2.5. Immediately after conclusion of the standby loss test, record the total fuel flow and electrical energy consumption, the final ambient room temperature, the duration of the standby loss test, and if the test ends at 48 hours without a cut-out, the final heat exchanger outlet temperature, or if the test ends after a cut-out, the maximum heat exchanger outlet temperature that occurs after the cut-out. Calculate the average of the recorded values of the heat exchanger outlet water temperature and the ambient room temperature taken at each measurement interval, including the initial and final values.
7
.2.6.

3.5.1.1. With supply water temperature as per section 3.1.2 of this appendix (
i.e.,
70 °F ± 2 °F) the water flow rate can be varied so that the outlet water temperature is constant at 70 °F ± 2 °F above the supply water temperature, while the heating element is operating at the rated input.
3.5.1.2. After the water supply is turned off and the thermostat reduces the electricity supply to the heating element to a minimum, the maximum heat exchanger outlet water temperature (T
OHX
) is 140 °F ± 5 °F.
3.5.1.3. If the water heater includes a built-in safety mechanism that prevents it from achieving a heat exchanger outlet water temperature of 140 °F ± 5 °F, adjust the thermostat to its maximum setting.
3.5.2.
Flow-Activated Instantaneous Water Heaters and Thermostatically-Activated Instantaneous Water Heaters with an External Thermostat.
Before starting the steady-state verification prior to the standby loss test energize the primary control such that it is always calling for heating and the heating element is operating at the rated input. Maintain the supply water temperature as per section 3.1.2 of this appendix (
i.e.,
70 °F ± 2 °F). Set the control so that the outlet water temperature (T
OWT
) is 140 °F ± 5 °F. If the water heater includes a built-in safety mechanism that prevents it from achieving a heat exchanger outlet water temperature of 140 °F ± 5 °F, adjust the control to its maximum setting.

# 3.6. For Units With Multiple Outlet Water Connections
3.6.1. For each connection leaving the water heater that is required for the unit to achieve the rated input, the outlet water temperature must not differ from that of any other outlet water connection by more than 2 °F during the steady-state verification period prior to the standby loss test.

Determination of Storage Volume.
Determine the storage volume by subtracting the tare weight—measured while the system is dry and empty—from the weight of the system when filled with water and dividing the resulting net weight of water by the density of water at the measured water temperature. The volume of water contained in the water heater must be computed in gallons.
5.
Standby Loss Test.
Perform the steady-state verification period in accordance with section 5.1 of this appendix. For thermostatically-activated instantaneous water heaters with an internal thermostat, use section 5.2 of this appendix to conduct the standby loss test, and for flow-activated and/or thermostatically-activated instantaneous water heaters with an external thermostat (including remote thermostatically activated and/or flow-activated instantaneous water heaters), use section 5.3 of this appendix to conduct the standby loss test.
Set the primary control in accordance with section 3.5 of this appendix, such that the
primary control is always calling for heat and the water heater is operating at its full rated input. Begin drawing water from the unit by opening the main supply and the outlet water valve, and adjust the water flow rate to achieve an outlet water temperature of 70 °F ± 2 °F above supply water temperature. At this time, begin recording the parameters specified in section 3.7.1 of this appendix. The steady-state verification period is complete when there is a continuous 30-minute period where the steady-state conditions specified in section 5.1 of this appendix are met, as confirmed by consecutive readings of the relevant parameters recorded at 1-minute intervals (except for electric power input rate, which is determined at 10-minute intervals, as specified in section 3.7.1 of this appendix).
5.1.
Steady-State Conditions.
The following conditions must be met at consecutive readings taken at 1-minute intervals (except for electricity input rate, for which measurements are taken at 10-minute intervals) to verify the water heater has achieved steady-state operation prior to conducting the standby loss test.
5.1.1. The water flow rate must be maintained within ± 0.25 gallons per minute (gpm) of the initial reading at the start of the steady-state verification period;
5.1.2. Electric power input rate must be maintained within 2 percent of the rated input certified by the manufacturer.
5.1.3. The supply water temperature (or inlet water temperature if a recirculating loop is used) must be maintained within ± 0.50 °F of the initial reading at the start of the steady-state verification period; and
5.1.4. The rise between the supply (or inlet if a recirculating loop is used) and outlet water temperatures is maintained within ± 0.50 °F of its initial value taken at the start of the steady-state verification period for units with rated input less than 500,000 Btu/h, and maintained within ± 1.00 °F of its initial value for units with rated input greater than or equal to 500,000 Btu/h.
5.2.
Thermostatically-Activated Instantaneous Water Heaters with an Internal Thermostat.
For water heaters that will experience cut-in based on a temperature-activated control that is internal to the water heater, use the following steps to conduct the standby loss test.
5.2.1. Immediately after the steady-state verification period, turn off the outlet water valve(s) (installed as per the provisions in section 2.2 of this appendix), and the water pump (if applicable) simultaneously and ensure that there is no flow of water through the water heater.
5.
2.2. After the first cut-out following the steady-state verification period, allow the water heater to remain in standby mode. Do not change any settings on the water heater at any point until measurements for the standby loss test are finished. Begin recording the applicable parameters specified in section 3.7.2 of this appendix.
5.
2.3. At the second cut-out, record the time and ambient room temperature, and begin measuring the electricity consumption. Record the initial heat exchanger outlet water temperature (T
OHX
) and initial ambient room temperature. For the remainder of the test, continue recording the applicable parameters specified in section 3.7.2 of this appendix.
5.
2.4. Stop the test after the first cut-out that occurs after 24 hours, or at 48 hours, whichever comes first.
5.
2.5. Immediately after conclusion of the standby loss test, record the total electrical energy consumption, the final ambient room temperature, the duration of the standby loss test, and if the test ends at 48 hours without a cut-out, the final heat exchanger outlet temperature, or if the test ends after a cut-out, the maximum heat exchanger outlet temperature that occurs after the cut-out. Calculate the average of the recorded values of the heat exchanger outlet water temperature and of the ambient air temperatures taken at each measurement interval, including the initial and final values.
5.
2.6.

see
§ 431.133), and according to the provisions of this section. Use ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 29-2015 (incorporated by reference, see § 431.133) referenced by AHRI Standard 810 (I-P)-2016 with Addendum 1 for all automatic commercial ice makers, except as noted in paragraphs (c) through (k) of this section. If any provision of the referenced test procedures conflicts with the requirements in this section or the definitions in § 431.132, the requirements in this section and the definitions in § 431.132 control.
(c)
Test setup and equipment configurations
—(1)
Baffles.
Conduct testing without baffles unless the baffle either is a part of the automatic commercial ice maker or shipped with the automatic commercial ice maker to be installed according to the manufacturer's installation instructions.
(2)
Clearances.
Install all automatic commercial ice makers for testing according to the manufacturer's specified minimum rear clearance requirements, or with 3 feet of clearance from the rear of the automatic commercial ice maker, whichever is less, from the chamber wall. All other sides of the automatic commercial ice maker and all sides of the remote condenser, if applicable, shall have clearances according to section 6.5 of ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 29-2015.
(3)
Purge settings.
Test automatic commercial ice makers equipped with automatic purge water control using a fixed purge water setting that is described in the manufacturer's written instructions shipped with the unit as being appropriate for water of normal, typical, or average hardness. Purge water settings described in the instructions as suitable for use only with water that has higher or lower than normal hardness (such as distilled water or reverse osmosis water) must not be used for testing.
(4)
Ambient conditions measurement
—(i)
Ambient temperature sensors.
Measure all ambient temperatures according to section 6.4 of ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 29-2015, except as provided in paragraph (c)(4)(iv) of this section, with unweighted temperature sensors.
(ii)
Ambient relative humidity measurement.
Except as provided in paragraph (c)(4)(iv) of this section, ambient relative humidity shall be measured at the same location(s) used to confirm ambient dry bulb temperature, or as close as the test setup permits. Ambient relative humidity shall be measured with an instrument accuracy of ±2.0 percent.
(iii)
Ambient conditions sensors shielding.
Ambient temperature and relative humidity sensors may be shielded if the ambient test conditions cannot be
maintained within the specified tolerances because of warm discharge air from the condenser exhaust affecting the ambient measurements. If shields are used, the shields must not inhibit recirculation of the warm discharge air into the condenser or automatic commercial ice maker inlet.
(iv)
Alternate ambient conditions measurement location.
For automatic commercial ice makers in which warm air discharge from the condenser exhaust affects the ambient conditions as measured 1 foot in front of the air inlet, or automatic commercial ice makers in which the air inlet is located in the rear of the automatic commercial ice maker and the manufacturer's specified minimum rear clearance is less than or equal to 1 foot, the ambient temperature and relative humidity may instead be measured 1 foot from the cabinet, centered with respect to the sides of the cabinet, for any side of the automatic commercial ice maker cabinet with no warm air discharge or air inlet.
(5)
Collection container for batch type automatic commercial ice makers with harvest rates less than or equal to 50 lb/24 h.
Use an ice collection container as specified in section 5.5.2(a) of ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 29-2015, except that the water retention weight of the container is no more than 4.0 percent of that of the smallest batch of ice for which the container is used.
(d)
Test conditions
—(1)
Relative humidity.
Maintain an average minimum ambient relative humidity of 30.0 percent throughout testing.
(2)
Inlet water pressure.
Except for portable automatic commercial ice makers, the inlet water pressure when water is flowing into the automatic commercial ice maker shall be within the allowable range within 5 seconds of opening the water supply valve.
(e)
Stabilization
—(1)
Percent difference calculation.
Calculate the percent difference in the ice production rate between two cycles or samples using the following equation, where A and B are the harvest rates, in lb/24 h (for batch type ice makers) or lb/15 mins (for continuous type ice makers), of any cycles or samples used to determine stability:
ER01NO22.003
(2)
Automatic commercial ice makers with harvest rates greater than 50lb/24 h.
The three or more consecutive cycles or samples used to calculate harvest rate, energy use, condenser water use, and potable water use, must meet the stability criteria in section 7.1.1 of ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 29-2015.
(3)
Automatic commercial ice makers with harvest rates less than or equal to 50 lb/24 h.
The three or more consecutive cycles or samples used to calculate harvest rate, energy use, condenser water use, and potable water use, must meet the stability criteria in section 7.1.1 of ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 29-2015, except that the weights of the samples (for continuous type automatic commercial ice makers (ACIMs)) or 24-hour calculated ice production (for batch type ACIMs) must not vary by more than ±4 percent, and the 25 g (for continuous type ACIMs) and 1 kg (for batch type ACIMs) criteria do not apply.
(f)
Calculations.
The harvest rate, energy use, condenser water use, and potable water use must be calculated by averaging the values for the three calculated samples for each respective reported metric as specified in section 9 of ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 29-2015. All intermediate calculations prior to the reported value, as applicable, must be performed with unrounded values.
(g)
Rounding.

use to the nearest 0.01 kWh/100 lb. Round final potable water use value to the nearest 0.1 gal/100 lb.
(h)
Continuous type automatic commercial ice makers
—(1)
Ice hardness adjustment
—(i)
Calorimeter constant.
Determine the calorimeter constant according to the requirements in section A1 and A2 of Normative Annex A Method of Calorimetry in ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 29-2015, except that the trials shall be conducted at an ambient air temperature (room temperature) of 70 °F ± 1 °F, with an initial water temperature of 90 °F ± 1 °F. To verify the temperature of the block of pure ice as provided in section A2.e in ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 29-2015, a thermocouple shall be embedded at approximately the geometric center of the interior of the block. Any water that remains on the block of ice shall be wiped off the surface of the block before being placed into the calorimeter.
(ii)
Ice hardness factor.
Determine the ice hardness factor according to the requirements in section A1 and A3 of Normative Annex A Method of Calorimetry in ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 29-2015, except that the trials shall be conducted at an ambient air temperature (room temperature) of 70 °F ± 1 °F, with an initial water temperature of 90 °F ± 1 °F. The harvested ice used to determine the ice hardness factor shall be produced according to the test methods specified at § 431.134. The ice hardness factor shall be calculated using the equation for ice hardness factor in section 5.2.2 of AHRI Standard 810 (I-P)-2016 with Addendum 1.
(iii)
Ice hardness adjustment calculation.
Determine the reported energy use and reported condenser water use by multiplying the measured energy use or measured condenser water use by the ice hardness adjustment factor, determined using the ice hardness adjustment factor equation in section 5.2.2 of AHRI Standard 810 (I-P)-2016 with Addendum 1.
(2) [Reserved]
(i)
Automatic commercial ice makers with automatic dispensers.
Allow for the continuous production and dispensing of ice throughout testing. If an automatic commercial ice maker with an automatic dispenser is not able to continuously produce and dispense ice because of certain mechanisms within the automatic commercial ice maker that prohibit the continuous production and dispensing of ice throughout testing, those mechanisms must be overridden to the minimum extent which allows for the continuous production and dispensing of ice. The automatic commercial ice maker shall have an empty internal storage bin at the beginning of the test period. Collect capacity samples according to the requirements of ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 29-2015, except that the samples shall be collected through continuous use of the dispenser rather than in the internal storage bin. The intercepted ice samples shall be obtained from a container in an external ice bin that is filled one-half full of ice and is connected to the outlet of the ice dispenser through the minimal length of conduit that can be used.
(j)
Portable automatic commercial ice makers.
Sections 5.4, 5.6, 6.2, and 6.3 of ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 29-2015 do not apply. Ensure that the ice storage bin is empty prior to the initial potable water reservoir fill. Fill an external container with water to be supplied to the portable automatic commercial ice maker water reservoir. Establish an initial water temperature of 70 °F ± 1.0 °F. Verify the initial water temperature by inserting a temperature sensor into approximately the geometric center of the water in the external container. Immediately after establishing the initial water temperature, fill the ice maker water reservoir to the maximum level of potable water as specified by the manufacturer. After the potable water reservoir is filled, operate the portable automatic commercial ice maker to produce ice into the ice storage bin until the bin is one-half full. One-half full for the purposes of testing portable automatic commercial ice makers means that half of the vertical dimension of the ice storage bin, based on the maximum ice fill level within the ice storage bin, is filled with ice. Once the ice storage bin is one-half full, conduct testing according to section 7 of ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 29-2015. The potable water use is equal to the sum of the weight of ice and any corresponding melt water collected for
the capacity test as specified in section 7.2 of ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 29-2015.
(k)
Self-contained refrigerated storage automatic commercial ice makers.
For door openings, the door shall be in the fully open position, which means opening the ice storage compartment door to an angle of not less than 75 degrees from the closed position (or the maximum extent possible, if that is less than 75 degrees), for 10.0 ± 1.0 seconds to collect the sample. Conduct door openings only for ice sample collection and returning the empty ice collection container to the ice storage compartment (
i.e.,
conduct two separate door openings, one for removing the collection container to collect the ice and one for replacing the collection container after collecting the ice).

(b) Only instrument transformers meeting the 0.3 metering accuracy class, or better, may be used under this test method.

# 3.0 Resistance Measurements
3.1
General Considerations
(a) Measure or establish the winding temperature at the time of the winding resistance measurement.
(b) Measure the direct current resistance (R
dc
) of transformer windings by one of the methods outlined in section 3.3. The methods of section 3.5 must be used to correct load losses to the applicable reference temperature from the temperature at which they are measured. Observe precautions while taking measurements, such as those in section 3.4, in order to maintain measurement uncertainty limits specified in Table 2.1.
(c) Measure the direct current resistance (R
dc
) of transformer windings by one of the methods outlined in section 3.3. The methods of section 3.5 must be used to correct load losses to the applicable reference temperature from the temperature at which they are measured. Observe precautions while taking measurements, such as those in section 3.4, in order to maintain measurement uncertainty limits specified in Table 2.3 of this appendix.
3.2
Temperature Determination of Windings and Pre-conditions for Resistance Measurement.
Make temperature measurements in protected areas where the air temperature is stable and there are no drafts. Determine the winding temperature (T
dc
) for liquid-immersed and dry-type distribution transformers by the methods described in sections 3.2.1 and 3.2.2, respectively.
3.2.1
Liquid-Immersed Distribution Transformers.

# 3.2.1.1
Methods
Record the winding temperature (T
dc
) of liquid-immersed transformers as the average of either of the following:
(a) The measurements from two temperature sensing devices (for example, thermocouples) applied to the outside of the transformer tank and thermally insulated from the surrounding environment, with one located at the level of the insulating liquid and the other located near the tank bottom or at the lower radiator header if applicable; or
(b) The measurements from two temperature sensing devices immersed in the insulating liquid, with one located directly above the winding and other located directly below the winding.

# 3.2.1.2
Conditions
Make this determination under either of the following conditions:
(a) The windings have been under insulating liquid with no excitation and no current in the windings for four hours before the dc resistance is measured; or
(b) The temperature of the insulating liquid has stabilized, and the difference between the top and bottom temperature does not exceed 5 °C. The temperature of the insulating liquid is considered stable if the top liquid temperature does not vary more than 2 °C in a 1-h period.
3.2.2
Dry-Type Distribution Transformers.
Record the winding temperature (T
dc
) of dry-type transformers as one of the following:
(a) For ventilated dry-type units, use the average of readings of four or more thermometers, thermocouples, or other suitable temperature sensors inserted within the coils. Place the sensing points of the measuring devices as close as possible to the winding conductors; or
(b) For sealed units, such as epoxy-coated or epoxy-encapsulated units, use the average of four or more temperature sensors located on the enclosure and/or cover, as close to different parts of the winding assemblies as possible; or
(c) For ventilated units or sealed units, use the ambient temperature of the test area, only if the following conditions are met:
(1) All internal temperatures measured by the internal temperature sensors must not differ from the test area ambient temperature by more than 2 °C. Enclosure surface temperatures for sealed units must not differ from the test area ambient temperature by more than 2 °C.
(2) Test area ambient temperature must not have changed by more than 3 °C for 3 hours before the test.
(3) Neither voltage nor current has been applied to the unit under test for 24 hours. In addition, increase this initial 24-hour period by any added amount of time necessary for the temperature of the transformer windings to stabilize at the level of the ambient temperature. However, this additional amount of time need not exceed 24 hours (
i.e.,
after 48 hours, the transformer windings can be assumed to have stabilized at the level of the ambient temperature. Any stabilization time beyond 48 hours is optional).
3.3
Resistance Measurement Methods.
Make resistance measurements using either the resistance bridge method (section 3.3.1), the voltmeter-ammeter method (section 3.3.2) or resistance meters (section 3.3.3). In each instance when this appendix is used to test more than one unit of a basic model to determine the efficiency of that basic model, the resistance of the units being tested may be determined from making resistance measurements on only one of the units.
3.3.1
Resistance Bridge Methods.
If the resistance bridge method is selected, use either the Wheatstone or Kelvin bridge circuit (or the equivalent of either).

# 3.3.1.1
Wheatstone Bridge
(a) This bridge is best suited for measuring resistances larger than ten ohms. A schematic diagram of a Wheatstone bridge with a representative transformer under test is shown in Figure 3.1.
ER27AP06.002
Where:
R
dc
is the resistance of the transformer winding being measured,
R
s
is a standard resistor having the resistance R
s
,
R
a
, R
b
are two precision resistors with resistance values R
a
and R
b
, respectively; at least one resistor must have a provision for resistance adjustment,
R
t
is a resistor for reducing the time constant of the circuit,
D is a null detector, which may be either a micro ammeter or microvoltmeter or equivalent instrument for observing that no signal is present when the bridge is balanced, and
V
dc
is a source of dc voltage for supplying the power to the Wheatstone Bridge.
(b) In the measurement process, turn on the source (V
dc
), and adjust the resistance ratio (R
a
/R
b
) to produce zero signal at the detector (D). Determine the winding resistance by using equation 3-1 as follows:
ER27AP06.003

# 3.3.1.2
Kelvin Bridge
(a) This bridge separates the resistance of the connecting conductors to the transformer winding being measured from the resistance of the winding, and therefore is best suited for measuring resistances of ten ohms and smaller. A schematic diagram of a Kelvin bridge with a representative transformer under test is shown in Figure 3.2.
ER27AP06.004
(b) The Kelvin Bridge has seven of the same type of components as in the Wheatstone Bridge. It has two more resistors than the Wheatstone bridge, R
a1
and R
b1
. At least one of these resistors must have adjustable resistance. In the measurement process, the source is turned on, two resistance ratios (R
a
/R
b
) and (R
a1
/R
b1
) are adjusted to be equal, and then the two ratios are adjusted together to balance the bridge producing zero signal at the detector. Determine the winding resistance by using equation 3-2 as follows:
ER27AP06.005
as with the Wheatstone bridge, with an additional condition that:
ER27AP06.006
(c) The Kelvin bridge provides two sets of leads, current-carrying and voltage-sensing, to the transformer terminals and the standard resistor, thus eliminating voltage drops from the measurement in the current-carrying leads as represented by R
d
.
3.3.2
Voltmeter-Ammeter Method.
(a) Employ the voltmeter-ammeter method only if the test current is limited to 15 percent of the winding current. Connect the transformer winding under test to the circuit shown in Figure 3.3 of this appendix.
ER27AP06.007
Where:
A is an ammeter or a voltmeter-shunt combination for measuring the current (I
mdc
) in the transformer winding,
V is a voltmeter with sensitivity in the millivolt range for measuring the voltage (V
mdc
) applied to the transformer winding,
R
dc
is the resistance of the transformer winding being measured,
R
t
is a resistor for reducing the time constant of the circuit, and
V
dc
is a source of dc voltage for supplying power to the measuring circuit.
(b) To perform the measurement, turn on the source to produce current no larger than 15 percent of the rated current for the winding. Wait until the current and voltage readings have stabilized and then take a minimum of four readings of voltage and current. Voltage and current readings must be taken simultaneously for each of the readings. Calculate the average voltage and average current using the readings. Determine the winding resistance R
dc
by using equation 3-4 as follows:
ER14SE21.014
Where:
V
mdc
is the average voltage measured by the voltmeter V; and
I
mdc
is the average current measured by the ammeter (A).
(c) As shown in Figure 3.3, separate current and voltage leads must be brought to the transformer terminals. (This eliminates the errors due to lead and contact resistance.)
3.3.3
Resistance Meters.
Resistance meters may be based on voltmeter-ammeter, or resistance bridge, or some other operating principle. Any meter used to measure a transformer's winding resistance must have specifications for resistance range, current range, and ability to measure highly inductive resistors that cover the characteristics of the transformer being tested. Also, the meter's specifications for accuracy must meet the applicable criteria of Table 2.3 in section 2.3 of this appendix.
3.4
Precautions in Measuring Winding Resistance.
3.4.1
Required actions.
The following requirements must be observed when making resistance measurements:
(a) Use separate current and voltage leads when measuring small (
10 ohms) resistance.
(b) Use null detectors in bridge circuits, and measuring instruments in voltmeter-ammeter circuits, that have sensitivity and resolution sufficient to enable observation of at least 0.1 percent change in the measured resistance.
(c) Maintain the dc test current at or below 15 percent of the rated winding current.
(d) Inclusion of a stabilizing resistor R
t
(see section 3.4.2) will require higher source voltage.
(e) Disconnect the null detector (if a bridge circuit is used) and voltmeter from the circuit before the current is switched off, and switch off current by a suitable insulated switch.
(f) Keep the polarity of the core magnetization constant during all resistance measurements.
(g) For single-phase windings, measure the resistance from terminal to terminal. The total winding resistance is the terminal-to-terminal measurement. For series-parallel windings, the total winding resistance is the sum of the series terminal-to-terminal section measurements.
(h) For wye windings, measure the resistance from terminal to terminal or from terminal to neutral. For the total winding resistance, the resistance of the lead from the neutral connection to the neutral bushing may be excluded. For terminal-to-terminal measurements, the total resistance reported is the sum of the three measurements divided by two.
(i) For delta windings, measure resistance from terminal to terminal with the delta closed or from terminal to terminal with the delta open to obtain the individual phase readings. The total winding resistance is the sum of the three-phase readings if the delta is open. If the delta is closed, the total winding resistance is the sum of the three phase-to-phase readings times 1.5.
3.4.2
Guideline for Time Constant.
(a) The following guideline is suggested for the tester as a means to facilitate the measurement of resistance in accordance with the accuracy requirements of section 2.3:
(b) The accurate reading of resistance R
dc
may be facilitated by shortening the time constant. This is done by introducing a resistor R
t
in series with the winding under test in both the bridge and voltmeter-ammeter circuits as shown in Figures 3.1 to 3.3. The relationship for the time constant is:
ER27AP06.009
Where:
T
c
is the time constant in seconds,
L
tc
is the total magnetizing and leakage inductance of the winding under test, in henries, and
R
tc
is the total resistance in ohms, consisting of R
t
in series with the winding resistance R
dc
and the resistance R
s
of the standard resistor in the bridge circuit.
(c) Because R
tc
is in the denominator of the expression for the time constant, increasing the resistance R
tc
will decrease the time constant. If the time constant in a given test circuit is too long for the resistance readings to be stable, then a higher resistance can be substituted for the existing R
tc
, and successive replacements can be made until adequate stability is reached.
3.5
Conversion of Resistance Measurements.
(a) Resistance measurements must be corrected from the temperature at which the winding resistance measurements were made, to the reference temperature.
(b) Correct the measured resistance to the resistance at the reference temperature using equation 3-6 as follows:
ER27AP06.010
Where:
R
ts
is the resistance at the reference temperature, T
s
,
R
dc
is the measured resistance at temperature, T
dc
,
T
s
is the reference temperature in °C,
T
dc
is the temperature at which resistance was measured in °C, and
T
k
is 234.5 °C for copper or 225 °C for aluminum.

# 4.0 Loss Measurement
4.1
General Considerations.
The efficiency of a transformer is computed from the total transformer losses, which are determined from the measured value of the no-load loss and load loss power components. Each of these two power loss components is measured separately using test sets that are identical, except that shorting straps are added for the load-loss test. The measured quantities need correction for instrumentation losses and may need corrections for known phase angle errors in measuring equipment and for the waveform distortion in the test voltage. Any power loss not measured at the applicable reference temperature must be adjusted to that reference temperature. The measured load loss must also be adjusted to a specified output loading level if not measured at the specified output loading level. Test all distribution transformers using a sinusoidal waveform (k = 1). Measure losses with the transformer energized by a 60 Hz supply.
4.2
Measurement of Power Losses.
4.2.1
No-Load Loss.
Measure the no-load loss and apply corrections as described in section 4.4, using the appropriate test set as described in section 4.3.
4.2.2
Load Loss.
Measure the load loss and apply corrections as described in section 4.5, using the appropriate test set as described in section 4.3.
4.3
Test Sets.
(a) The same test set may be used for both the no-load loss and load loss measurements provided the range of the test set encompasses the test requirements of both tests. Calibrate the test set to national standards to meet the tolerances in Table 2.3 in section 2.3 of this appendix. In addition, the wattmeter, current measuring system and
voltage measuring system must be calibrated separately if the overall test set calibration is outside the tolerance as specified in section 2.3 or the individual phase angle error exceeds the values specified in section 4.5.3.
(b) A test set based on the wattmeter-voltmeter-ammeter principle may be used to measure the power loss and the applied voltage and current of a transformer where the transformer's test current and voltage are within the measurement capability of the measuring instruments. Current and voltage transformers, known collectively as instrument transformers, or other scaling devices such as resistive or capacitive dividers for voltage, may be used in the above circumstance, and must be used together with instruments to measure current, voltage, or power where the current or voltage of the transformer under test exceeds the measurement capability of such instruments. Thus, a test set may include a combination of measuring instruments and instrument transformers (or other scaling devices), so long as the current or voltage of the transformer under test does not exceed the measurement capability of any of the instruments.
(c) Both load loss and no-load loss measurements must be made from terminal to terminal.
4.3.1
Single-Phase Test Sets.
Use these for testing single-phase distribution transformers.

# 4.3.1.1
Without Instrument Transformers.
(a) A single-phase test set without an instrument transformer is shown in Figure 4.1.
ER27AP06.011
Where:
W is a wattmeter used to measure P
nm
and P
lm
, the no-load and load loss power, respectively,
V
rms
is a true root-mean-square (rms) voltmeter used to measure V
r(nm)
and V
lm
, the rms test voltages in no-load and load loss measurements, respectively,
V
av
is an average sensing voltmeter, calibrated to indicate rms voltage for sinusoidal waveforms and used to measure V
a(nm)
, the average voltage in no-load loss measurements,
A is an rms ammeter used to measure test current, especially I
lm
, the load loss current, and
(SC) is a conductor for providing a short-circuit across the output windings for the load loss measurements.
(b) Either the primary or the secondary winding can be connected to the test set. However, more compatible voltage and current levels for the measuring instruments are available if for no-load loss measurements the secondary (low voltage) winding is connected to the test set, and for load loss measurements the primary winding is connected to the test set. Use the average-sensing voltmeter, V
av
, only in no-load loss measurements.

# 4.3.1.2
With Instrument Transformers.
A single-phase test set with instrument transformers is shown in Figure 4.2. This circuit has the same four measuring instruments as that in Figure 4.1. The current and voltage transformers, designated as (CT) and (VT), respectively, are added.
ER27AP06.012
4.3.2
Three-Phase Test Sets.
Use these for testing three-phase distribution transformers. Use in a four-wire, three-wattmeter test circuit.

# 4.3.2.1
Without Instrument Transformers.
(a) A three-phase test set without instrument transformers is shown in Figure 4.3. This test set is essentially the same circuit shown in Figure 4.1 repeated three times, and the instruments are individual devices as shown. As an alternative, the entire instrumentation system of a three-phase test set without transformers may consist of a multi-function analyzer.
ER27AP06.013
(b) Either group of windings, the primary or the secondary, can be connected in wye or delta configuration. If both groups of windings are connected in the wye configuration for the no-load test, the neutral of the winding connected to the test set must be connected to the neutral of the source to provide a return path for the neutral current.
(c) In the no-load loss measurement, the voltage on the winding must be measured. Therefore a provision must be made to switch the voltmeters for line-to-neutral measurements for wye-connected windings
and for line-to-line measurements for delta-connected windings.

# 4.3.2.2
With Instrument Transformers.
A three-phase test set with instrument transformers is shown in Figure 4.4. This test set is essentially the same circuit shown in Figure 4.2 repeated three times. Provision must be made to switch the voltmeters for line-to-neutral and line-to-line measurements as in section 4.3.2.1. The voltage sensors (“coils”) of the wattmeters must always be connected in the line-to-neutral configuration.
ER27AP06.014

# 4.3.2.3
Test Set Neutrals.
If the power source in the test circuit is wye-connected, ground the neutral. If the power source in the test circuit is delta-connected, use a grounding transformer to obtain neutral and ground for the test.
4.4
No-Load Losses: Measurement and Calculations.
4.4.1
General Considerations.
Measurement corrections are permitted but not required for instrumentation losses and for losses from auxiliary devices. Measurement corrections are required:
(a) When the waveform of the applied voltage is non-sinusoidal; and
(b) When the core temperature or liquid temperature is outside the 20 °C ±10 °C range.
4.4.2
No-Load Loss Test.
(a) The purpose of the no-load loss test is to measure no-load losses at a specified excitation voltage and a specified frequency. The no-load loss determination must be based on a sine-wave voltage corrected to the reference temperature. Connect either of the transformer windings, primary or secondary, to the appropriate test set of Figures 4.1 to 4.4, giving consideration to section 4.4.2(a)(2). Leave the unconnected winding(s) open circuited. Apply the rated voltage at rated frequency, as measured by the average-sensing voltmeter, to the transformer. Take the readings of the wattmeter(s) and the average-sensing and true rms voltmeters. Observe the following precautions:
(1) Voltmeter connections. When correcting to a sine-wave basis using the average-voltmeter method, the voltmeter connections must be such that the waveform applied to the voltmeters is the same as the waveform across the energized windings.
(2) Energized windings. Energize either the high voltage or the low voltage winding of the transformer under test.
(3) Voltage and frequency. The no-load loss test must be conducted with rated voltage impressed across the transformer terminals using a voltage source at a frequency equal to the rated frequency of the transformer under test.
(b) Adjust the voltage to the specified value as indicated by the average-sensing voltmeter. Record the values of rms voltage, rms current, electrical power, and average voltage as close to simultaneously as possible. For a three-phase transformer, take all of the readings on one phase before proceeding to the next, and record the average of the three rms voltmeter readings as the rms voltage value.

# Note:
When the tester uses a power supply that is not synchronized with an electric utility grid, such as a dc/ac motor-generator set, check the frequency and maintain it within ±0.5 percent of the rated frequency of the transformer under test. A power source that is directly connected to, or synchronized with, an electric utility grid need not be monitored for frequency.
4.4.3
Corrections.

# 4.4.3.1
Correction for Instrumentation Losses.
Measured losses attributable to the voltmeters and wattmeter voltage circuit, and to voltage transformers if they are used, may be deducted from the total no-load losses measured during testing.

# 4.4.3.2
Correction for Non-Sinusoidal Applied Voltage.
(a) The measured value of no-load loss must be corrected to a sinusoidal voltage, except when waveform distortion in the test voltage causes the magnitude of the correction to be less than 1 percent. In such a case, no correction is required.
(b) To make a correction where the distortion requires a correction of 5 percent or less, use equation 4-1. If the distortion requires a correction to be greater than 5 percent, improve the test voltage and re-test. Repeat until the distortion requires a correction of 5 percent or less.
(c) Determine the no-load losses of the transformer corrected for sine-wave basis from the measured value by using equation 4-1 as follows:
ER27AP06.015
Where:
P
ncl
is the no-load loss corrected to a sine-wave basis at the temperature (T
nm
) at which no-load loss is measured,
P
nm
is the measured no-load loss at temperature T
nm
,
P
1
is the per unit hysteresis loss,
P
2
is the per unit eddy-current loss,
P
1
+ P
2
= 1,
ER27AP06.016
V
r(nm)
is the test voltage measured by rms voltmeter, and
V
a(nm)
is the test voltage measured by average-voltage voltmeter.
(d) The two loss components (P
1
and P
2
) are assumed equal in value, each assigned a value of 0.5 per unit, unless the actual measurement-based values of hysteresis and eddy-current losses are available (in per unit form), in which case the actual measurements apply.

# 4.4.3.3
Correction of No-Load Loss to Reference Temperature.
After correcting the measured no-load loss for waveform distortion, correct the loss to the reference temperature. For both certification to energy conservation standards and voluntary representations, if the correction to reference temperature is applied, then the core temperature of the transformer during no-load loss measurement (T
nm
) must be determined within ±10 °C of the true average core temperature. For certification to energy conservation standards only, if the no-load loss measurements were made between 10 °C and 30 °C, this correction is not required. Correct the no-load loss to the reference temperature by using equation 4-2 as follows:
ER14SE21.015
Where:
P
nc
is the no-load losses corrected for waveform distortion and then to the reference temperature;
P
nc1
is the no-load losses, corrected for waveform distortion, at temperature T
nm
;
T
nm
is the core temperature during the measurement of no-load losses; and
T
nr
is the reference temperature.
4.5
Load Losses: Measurement and Calculations.
4.5.1
General Considerations.
(a) The load losses of a transformer are those losses incident to a specified load carried by the transformer. Load losses consist of ohmic loss in the windings due to the load current and stray losses due to the eddy currents induced by the leakage flux in the windings, core clamps, magnetic shields, tank walls, and other conducting parts. The ohmic loss of a transformer varies directly with temperature, whereas the stray losses vary inversely with temperature.
(b) For a transformer with a tap changer, conduct the test at the rated current and rated-voltage tap position. For a transformer that has a configuration of windings which allows for more than one nominal rated voltage, determine its load losses either in the winding configuration in which the highest losses occur or in each winding configuration in which the transformer can operate.
4.5.2
Tests for Measuring Load Losses.
(a) Connect the transformer with either the high-voltage or low-voltage windings to the appropriate test set. Then short-circuit the winding that was not connected to the test set. Apply a voltage at the rated frequency (of the transformer under test) to the connected windings to produce the rated current in the transformer. Take the readings of the wattmeter(s), the ammeters(s), and rms voltmeter(s).
(b) Regardless of the test set selected, the following preparatory requirements must be satisfied for accurate test results:
(1) Determine the temperature of the windings using the applicable method in section 3.2.1 or section 3.2.2.
(2) The conductors used to short-circuit the windings must have a cross-sectional area equal to, or greater than, the corresponding transformer leads, or, if the tester uses a different method to short-circuit the windings, the losses in the short-circuiting conductor assembly must be less than 10 percent of the transformer's load losses.
(3) When the tester uses a power supply that is not synchronized with an electric utility grid, such as a dc/ac motor-generator set, follow the provisions of the “Note” in section 4.4.2.
4.5.3
Corrections.

# 4.5.3.1
Correction for Losses from Instrumentation and Auxiliary Devices.
4.5.3.1.1
Instrumentation Losses.
Measured losses attributable to the voltmeters, wattmeter voltage circuit and short-circuiting conductor (SC), and to the voltage transformers if they are used, may be deducted from the total load losses measured during testing.
4.5.3.1.2
Losses from Auxiliary Devices.
Measured losses attributable to auxiliary devices (e.g., circuit breakers, fuses, switches) installed in the transformer, if any, that are not part of the winding and core assembly, may be excluded from load losses measured during testing. To exclude these losses, either (1) measure transformer losses without the auxiliary devices by removing or by-passing them, or (2) measure transformer losses with the auxiliary devices connected, determine the losses associated with the auxiliary devices, and deduct these losses from the load losses measured during testing.

# 4.5.3.2
Correction for Phase Angle Errors.
(a) Corrections for phase angle errors are not required if the instrumentation is calibrated over the entire range of power factors and phase angle errors. Otherwise, determine whether to correct for phase angle errors from the magnitude of the normalized per unit correction, β
n
, obtained by using equation 4-3 as follows:
ER27AP06.018
(b) The correction must be applied if β
n
is outside the limits of ±0.01. If β
n
is within the limits of ±0.01, the correction is permitted but not required.
(c) If the correction for phase angle errors is to be applied, first examine the total system phase angle (β
w
−β
v
+ β
c
). Where the total system phase angle is equal to or less than ±12 milliradians (±41 minutes), use either equation 4-4 or 4-5 to correct the measured load loss power for phase angle errors, and where the total system phase angle exceeds ±12 milliradians (±41 minutes) use equation 4-5, as follows:
ER14SE21.016
(d) The symbols in this section (4.5.3.2) have the following meanings:

β
v
is the phase angle error (in radians) of the voltage transformer; the error is positive if the secondary voltage leads the primary voltage, and
β
c
is the phase angle error (in radians) of the current transformer; the error is positive if the secondary current leads the primary current.
(e) The instrumentation phase angle errors used in the correction equations must be specific for the test conditions involved.

# 5.0 Determining the Efficiency Value of the Transformer
This section presents the equations to use in determining the efficiency value of the transformer at the required reference conditions and at the specified loading level. The details of measurements are described in sections 3.0 and 4.0. For a transformer that has a configuration of windings which allows for more than one nominal rated voltage, determine its efficiency either at the voltage at which the highest losses occur or at each voltage at which the transformer is rated to operate.
5.1
Output Loading Level Adjustment.
If the per-unit load selected in section 2.1 is different from the per-unit load at which the load loss power measurements were made, then adjust the corrected load loss power, P

# 6.0
Test Equipment Calibration and Certification.
Maintain and calibrate test equipment and measuring instruments, maintain calibration records, and perform other test and measurement quality assurance procedures according to the following sections. The calibration of the test set must confirm the accuracy of the test set to that specified in section 2.3, Table 2.3 of this appendix.
6.1
Test Equipment.
The party performing the tests must control, calibrate, and maintain measuring and test equipment, whether or not it owns the equipment, has the equipment on loan, or the equipment is provided by another party.

# Test Procedures
§ 431.264
Uniform test method to measure flow rate and spray force of commercial prerinse spray valves.
(a)
Scope.
This section provides the test procedure to measure the flow rate and spray force of a commercial prerinse spray valve.
(b)
Testing and calculations for a unit with a single spray setting
—(1)
Flow rate.
(i) Test each unit in accordance with the requirements of Sections 6.1 through 6.9 (Apparatus) (except 6.4 and 6.7), 9.1 through 9.4 (Preparation of Apparatus), and 10.1 through 10.2.5 (Procedure) of ASTM F2324, (incorporated by reference, see § 431.263). Precatory language in ASTM F2324 is to be treated as mandatory for the purpose of testing. In Section 9.1 of ASTM F2324, the second instance of “prerinse spray valve” refers to the spring-style deck-mounted prerinse unit defined in Section 6.8. In lieu of using manufacturer installation instructions or packaging, always connect the commercial prerinse spray valve to the flex tubing for testing. Normalize the weight of the water to calculate flow rate using Equation 1 to this paragraph, where W
water
is the weight normalized to a 1 minute time period, W
1
is the weight of the water in the carboy at the conclusion of the flow rate test, and t
1
is the total recorded time of the flow rate test.
ER11MR22.000
(ii) Perform calculations in accordance with Section 11.3.1 (Calculation and Report) of ASTM F2324. Record the water temperature ( °F) and dynamic water pressure (psi) once at the start for each run of the test. Record the time (min), the normalized weight of water in the carboy (lb) and the resulting flow rate (gpm) once at the end of each run of the test. Record flow rate measurements of time (min) and weight (lb) at the resolutions of the test instrumentation. Perform three runs on each unit, as specified in Section 10.2.5 of ASTM F2324, but disregard any references to Annex A1. Then, for each unit, calculate the mean of the three flow rate values determined from each run. Round the final value for flow rate to two decimal places and record that value.
(2)
Spray force.
Test each unit in accordance with the test requirements specified in Sections 6.2 and 6.4 through 6.9 (Apparatus), 9.1 through 9.5.3.2 (Preparation of Apparatus), and 10.3.1 through 10.3.8 (Procedure) of ASTM F2324. In Section 9.1 of ASTM F2324, the second instance of “prerinse spray valve” refers to the spring-style deck-mounted prerinse unit defined in Section 6.8. In lieu of using manufacturer installation instructions or packaging, always connect the commercial prerinse spray valve to the flex tubing for testing. Record the water temperature ( °F) and dynamic water pressure (psi) once at the start for each run of the test. In order to calculate the mean spray force value for the unit under test, there are two measurements per run and there are three runs per test. For each run of the test, record a minimum of two spray force measurements and calculate the mean of the measurements over the 15-second time period of stabilized flow during spray force testing. Record the time (min) once at the end of each run of the test. Record spray force measurements at the resolution of the test instrumentation. Conduct three runs on each unit, as specified in Section 10.3.8 of ASTM F2324, but disregard any references to Annex A1. Ensure the unit has been stabilized separately during each run. Then for each unit, calculate and record the mean of the spray force values determined from each run. Round the final value for spray force to one decimal place.
(c)
Testing and calculations for a unit with multiple spray settings.
If a unit has multiple user-selectable spray settings, or includes multiple spray faces that can be installed, for each possible spray setting or spray face:
(1) Measure both the flow rate and spray force according to paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section (including calculating the mean flow rate and mean spray force) for each spray setting; and
(2) Record the mean flow rate for each spray setting, rounded to two decimal places. Record the mean spray force for each spray setting, rounded to one decimal place.
(d)
Test procedure for voluntary representations.
Follow paragraph (b)(1) or (2) or (c) of this section, as applicable, using test water pressure(s) of interest for voluntary representations of flow rate. Representations made at a water pressure other than the required test water pressure cannot replace a representation at the required test water pressure specified in Section 9.1 of ASTM F2324. Any voluntary representation of flow rate made pursuant to this paragraph shall specify the water pressure associated with the represented flow rate.

5.2.5.
Cutting, measuring, and determining parallelism and flatness of a 1-inch-thick specimen for test from the center of the cut envelope component sample
.
5.2.5.1. Cut a 1 ± 0.1-inch-thick specimen from the center of the cut envelope sample. The 1-inch-thick test specimen shall be cut from the point that is equidistant from both edges of the sample (
i.e.,
shall be cut from the center point that would be directly between the interior and exterior space of the walk-in).
5.2.5.2. Document through measurement or photographs with measurement indicators that the specimen was taken from the center of the sample.
5.2.5.3 After the 1-inch specimen has been cut, and prior to testing, place the specimen on a flat surface and allow gravity to determine the specimen's position on the surface. This will be side 1.
5.2.5.4 To determine the flatness of side 1, take at least nine height measurements at equidistant positions on the specimen (
i.e.,
the specimen would be divided into 9 regions and height measurements taken at the center of each of these nine regions). Contact with the measurement indicator shall not indent the foam surface. From the height measurements taken, determine the least squares plane for side 1. For each measurement location, calculate the theoretical height from the least squares plane for side 1. Then, calculate the difference between the measured height and the theoretical least squares plane height at each location. The maximum difference minus the minimum difference out of the nine measurement locations is the flatness of side 1. For side 1 of the specimen to be considered flat, this shall be less than or equal to 0.03 inches.
5.2.5.5 To determine the flatness of side 2, turn the specimen over and allow gravity to determine the specimen's position on the surface. Repeat section 5.2.5.4 to determine the flatness of side 2.
5.2.5.6 To determine the parallelism of the specimen for side 1, calculate the theoretical height of the least squares plane at the furthest corners (
i.e.,
at points (0,0), (0,12), (12,0), and (12,12)) of the 12-inch by 12-inch test specimen. The difference between the maximum theoretical height and the minimum theoretical height shall be less than or equal to 0.03 inches for each side in order for side 1 to be considered parallel.
5.2.5.7 To determine the parallelism of the specimen for side 2, repeat section 5.2.5.6 of this appendix.
5.2.5.8 The average thickness of the test specimen,
L,
shall be 1 ± 0.1-inches determined using a minimum of 18 thickness measurements (
i.e.,
a minimum of 9 measurements on side 1 of the specimen and a minimum of 9 on side 2 of the specimen). This average thickness shall be used to determine the thermal conductivity, or K-factor.
5.3
K-factor Test.
Determine the thermal conductivity, or K-factor, of the 1-inch-thick specimen in accordance with the specified sections of ASTM C518-17. Testing must be completed within 24 hours of the specimen being cut for testing per section 5.2.5 of this appendix.
5.3.1
Test Conditions.
5.3.1.1 For freezer envelope components, the K-factor of the specimen shall be determined at an average specimen temperature of 20 ± 1 degrees Fahrenheit.
5.3.1.2 For cooler envelope components, the K-factor of the specimen shall be determined at an average specimen temperature of 55 ± 1 degrees Fahrenheit.
5.4 R-value Calculation.
5.4.1 For envelope components consisting of one homogeneous layer of insulation, calculate the R-value, h-ft
2
- °F/Btu, as follows:
ER04MY23.028
Where:
t
foam
= the total thickness of the foam, in., as determined in section 5.2.4 of this appendix; and
λ = K-factor, Btu-in/(h-ft
2
- °F), as determined in section 5.3 of this appendix.
5.4.2 For envelope components consisting of two or more layers of dissimilar insulating materials (excluding facers or protective skins), determine the K-factor of each
material as described in sections 5.1 through 5.3 of this appendix. For an envelope component with N layers of insulating material, the overall R-value shall be calculated as follows:
ER04MY23.029
Where:
t
i
is the thickness of the ith material that appears in the envelope component, inches, as determined in section 5.2.4 of this appendix;
λ
i
is the k-factor of the ith material, Btu-in/(h-ft
2
- °F), as determined in section 5.3 of this appendix; and
N is the total number of material layers that appears in the envelope component.
5.4.3 K-factor test results from a test sample 1 ± 0.1-inches in thickness may be used to determine the R-value of envelope components with various foam thicknesses as long as the foam throughout the panel depth is of the same final chemical form and the test was completed at the same test conditions that the other envelope components would be used at. For example, a K-factor test result conducted at cooler conditions cannot be used to determine R-value of a freezer envelope component.

# 3.2. General Modifications: Methods of Testing
When conducting testing in accordance with appendix C of AHRI 1250-2009 (incorporated by reference; see § 431.303), the following modifications must be made.
3.2.1. Refrigerant Temperature Measurements
In AHRI 1250-2009 appendix C, section C3.1.6, any refrigerant temperature measurements entering and leaving the unit cooler may use sheathed sensors immersed in the flowing refrigerant instead of thermometer wells. When testing a condensing unit alone, measure refrigerant liquid temperature leaving the condensing unit using thermometer wells as described in AHRI 1250-2009 appendix C, section C3.1.6 or sheathed sensors immersed in the flowing refrigerant. For all of these cases, if the refrigerant tube outer diameter is less than
1/2
inch, the refrigerant temperature may be measured using the average of two temperature measuring instruments with a minimum accuracy of ±0.5 °F placed on opposite sides of the refrigerant tube surface—resulting in a total of up to 8 temperature measurement devices used for the DX Dual Instrumentation method. In this case, the refrigerant tube shall be insulated with 1-inch thick insulation from a point 6 inches upstream of the measurement location to a point 6 inches downstream of the measurement location. Also, to comply with this requirement, the unit cooler entering measurement location may be moved to a location 6 inches upstream of the expansion device and, when testing a condensing unit alone, the entering and leaving measurement locations may be moved to locations 6 inches from the respective service valves.
3.2.2. It is not necessary to perform composition analysis of refrigerant (appendix C, section C3.3.6) or refrigerant oil concentration testing (appendix C, section C3.4.6).
3.2.3. Subcooling at Refrigerant Mass Flow Meter
In appendix C, section C3.4.5 of AHRI 1250-2009 (incorporated by reference; see § 431.303), and in section 7.1.2 of ASHRAE 23.1-2010 (incorporated by reference; see § 431.303) when verifying subcooling at the mass flow meters, only the sight glass and a temperature sensor located on the tube surface under the insulation are required. Subcooling shall be verified to be within the 3 °F requirement downstream of flow meters located in the same chamber as a condensing unit under test and upstream of flow meters located in the same chamber as a unit cooler under test, rather than always downstream as indicated in AHRI 1250-2009, section C3.4.5 or always upstream as indicated in section 7.1.2 of ASHRAE 23.1-2010. If the subcooling is less than 3 °F, cool the line between the condensing unit outlet and this location to achieve the required subcooling. When providing such cooling while testing a matched pair, (a) set up the line-cooling system and also set up apparatus to heat the liquid line between the mass flow meters and the unit cooler, (b) when the system has achieved steady state without activation of the heating and cooling systems, measure the liquid temperature entering the expansion valve for a period of at least 30 minutes, (c) activate the cooling system to provide the required subcooling at the mass flow meters, (d) if necessary, apply heat such that the temperature entering the expansion valve is within 0.5
0
F of the temperature measured during step (b), and (e) proceed with measurements once condition (d) has been verified.
3.2.4. In appendix C, section C3.5, regarding unit cooler fan power measurements, for a given motor winding configuration, the total power input shall be measured at the highest nameplate voltage. For three-phase power, voltage imbalances shall be no more than 2 percent from phase to phase.
3.2.5. In the test setup (appendix C, section C8.3), the liquid line and suction line shall be constructed of pipes of the manufacturer-specified size. The pipe lines shall be insulated with a minimum total thermal resistance equivalent to
1/2
-inch thick insulation having a flat-surface R-Value of 3.7 ft
2
- °F-hr/Btu per inch or greater. Flow meters need not be insulated but must not be in contact with the floor. The lengths of the connected liquid line and suction line shall be 25 feet ± 3 inches, not including the requisite flow meters, each. Of this length, no more than 15 feet shall be in the conditioned space. Where there are multiple branches of piping, the maximum length of piping applies to each branch individually as opposed to the total length of the piping.
3.2.6. Installation Instructions
Manufacturer installation instructions refer to the instructions that are applied to the unit (
i.e.,
as a label) or that come packaged with the unit. Online installation instructions are acceptable only if the version number or date of publication is referenced on the unit label or in the documents that are packaged with the unit.
3.2.6.1
Installation Instruction Hierarchy when available installation instructions are in conflict
3.2.6.1.1 If a manufacturer installation instruction provided on the label(s) applied to the unit conflicts with the manufacturer installation instructions that are shipped with the unit, the instructions on the unit's label take precedence.
3.2.6.1.2 Manufacturer installation instructions provided in any documents that are packaged with the unit take precedence over any manufacturer installation instructions provided online.
3.2.6.2 For testing of attached split systems, the manufacturer installation instructions for the dedicated condensing unit shall take precedence over the manufacturer installation instructions for the unit cooler.
3.2.6.3 Unit setup shall be in accordance with the manufacturer installation instructions (laboratory installation instructions shall not be used).
3.2.6.4 Achieving test conditions shall always take precedence over installation instructions.
3.2.7.
Refrigerant Charging and Adjustment of Superheat and Subcooling.
All dedicated condensing systems (dedicated condensing units tested alone, matched pairs, and single packaged dedicated systems) that use flooding of the condenser for head pressure control during low-ambient-temperature conditions shall be charged, and superheat and/or subcooling shall be set, at Refrigeration C test conditions unless otherwise specified in the installation instructions.
If after being charged at Refrigeration C condition the unit under test does not operate at the Refrigeration A condition due to high pressure cut out, refrigerant shall be removed in increments of 4 ounces or 5 percent of the test unit's receiver capacity, whichever quantity is larger, until the unit operates at the Refrigeration A condition. All tests shall be run at this final refrigerant charge. If less than 0 °F of subcooling is measured for the refrigerant leaving the condensing unit when testing at B or C condition, calculate the refrigerant-enthalpy-based capacity (
i.e.,
when using the DX dual instrumentation, the DX calibrated box, or single-packaged unit refrigerant enthalpy method) assuming that the refrigerant is at saturated liquid conditions at the condensing unit exit.
All dedicated condensing systems that do not use a flooded condenser design shall be charged at Refrigeration A test conditions unless otherwise specified in the installation instructions.
If the installation instructions give a specified range for superheat, sub-cooling, or refrigerant pressure, the average of the range shall be used as the refrigerant charging parameter target and the test condition tolerance shall be ±50 percent of the range. Perform charging of near-azeotropic and zeotropic refrigerants only with refrigerant in the liquid state. Once the correct refrigerant charge is determined, all tests shall run until completion without further modification.
3.2.7.1. When charging or adjusting superheat/subcooling, use all pertinent instructions contained in the installation instructions to achieve charging parameters within the tolerances. However, in the event of conflicting charging information between installation instructions, follow the installation instruction hierarchy listed in section 3.2.6. of this appendix. Conflicting information is defined as multiple conditions given for charge adjustment where all conditions specified cannot be met. In the event of conflicting information within the same set of charging instructions (e.g., the installation instructions shipped with the dedicated condensing unit), follow the hierarchy in table C.4 of this section for priority. Unless the installation instructions specify a different charging tolerance, the tolerances identified in table C.4 of this section shall be used.

Dedicated Condensing Unit.
If the Dedicated Condensing Unit includes a receiver and the subcooling target leaving the condensing unit provided in installation instructions cannot be met without fully filling the receiver, the subcooling target shall be ignored. Likewise, if the Dedicated Condensing unit does not include a receiver and the subcooling target leaving the condensing unit cannot be met without the unit cycling
off on high pressure, the subcooling target can be ignored. Also, if no instructions for charging or for setting subcooling leaving the condensing unit are provided in the installation instructions, the refrigeration system shall be set up with a charge quantity and/or exit subcooling such that the unit operates during testing without shutdown (e.g., on a high-pressure switch) and operation of the unit is otherwise consistent with the requirements of the test procedure of this appendix and the installation instructions.
3.2.8.
Chamber Conditioning using the Unit Under Test.
In appendix C, section C6.2 of AHRI 1250-2009, for applicable system configurations (matched pairs, single-packaged refrigeration systems, and standalone unit coolers), the unit under test may be used to aid in achieving the required test chamber conditions prior to beginning any steady state test. However, the unit under test must be inspected and confirmed to be free from frost before initiating steady state testing.
3.3.
Matched systems, single-package dedicated systems, and unit coolers tested alone:
Use the test method in AHRI 1250-2009 (incorporated by reference; see § 431.303), appendix C as the method of test for matched refrigeration systems, single-package dedicated systems, or unit coolers tested alone, with the following modifications:
3.3.1. For unit coolers tested alone, use test procedures described in AHRI 1250-2009 for testing unit coolers for use in mix-match system ratings, except that for the test conditions in tables 15 and 16 of this appendix, use the Suction A saturation condition test points only. Also, for unit coolers tested alone, other than high-temperature unit coolers, use the calculations in section 7.9 of AHRI 1250-2009 to determine AWEF and net capacity described in AHRI 1250-2009 for unit coolers matched to parallel rack systems.
3.3.2. In appendix C, section C.13, the version of AHRI Standard 420 used for test methods, requirements, and procedures shall be AHRI 420-2008 (incorporated by reference; see § 431.303).
3.3.3.
Evaporator Fan Power.
3.3.3.1.
Ducted Evaporator Air.
For ducted fan coil units with ducted evaporator air, or that can be installed with or without ducted evaporator air: Connect ductwork on both the inlet and outlet connections and determine external static pressure as described in ASHRAE 37 (incorporated by reference; see § 431.303), sections 6.4 and 6.5. Use pressure measurement instrumentation as described in ASHRAE 37, section 5.3.2. Test at the fan speed specified in manufacturer installation instructions—if there is more than one fan speed setting and the installation instructions do not specify which speed to use, test at the highest speed. Conduct tests with the external static pressure equal to 50 percent of the maximum external static pressure allowed by the manufacturer for system installation within a tolerance of −0.00/+0.05 in. wc. Set the external static pressure by symmetrically restricting the outlet of the test duct. Alternatively, if using the indoor air enthalpy method to measure capacity, set external static pressure by adjusting the fan of the airflow measurement apparatus. In case of conflict, these requirements for setting evaporator airflow take precedence over airflow values specified in manufacturer installation instructions or product literature.
3.3.3.2.
Unit Coolers or Single-Packaged Systems that are not High-Temperature Refrigeration Systems.
Use appendix C, section C10 of AHRI 1250-2009 for off-cycle evaporator fan testing, with the exception that evaporator fan controls using periodic stir cycles shall be adjusted so that the greater of a 50 percent duty cycle (rather than a 25 percent duty cycle) or the manufacturer default is used for measuring off-cycle fan energy. For adjustable-speed controls, the greater of 50 percent fan speed (rather than 25 percent fan speed) or the manufacturer's default fan speed shall be used for measuring off-cycle fan energy. Also, a two-speed or multi-speed fan control may be used as the qualifying evaporator fan control. For such a control, a fan speed no less than 50 percent of the speed used in the maximum capacity tests shall be used for measuring off-cycle fan energy.
3.3.3.3.
High-Temperature Refrigeration Systems.
3.3.3.3.1. The evaporator fan power consumption shall be measured in accordance with the requirements in section C3.5 of AHRI 1250-2009. This measurement shall be made with the fan operating at full speed, either measuring unit cooler or total system power input upon the completion of the steady state test when the compressor and the condenser fan of the walk-in system are turned off, or by submetered measurement of the evaporator fan power during the steady state test.
Section C3.5 of AHRI 1250-2009 is revised to read:

3.3.4.1.3 The number of defrosts per day, N
DF
, shall be calculated from the time interval between successive defrosts from the start of one defrost to the start of the next defrost at the frost load conditions.
3.3.4.1.4 Use appendix C, equations C13 and C14 in section C11.3 to calculate, respectively, the daily average defrost energy, DF, in W-h and the daily contribution of the load attributed to defrost Q
DF
in Btu.
3.3.4.1.5 The defrost adequacy requirements in appendix C, section C11.3 shall apply.
3.3.4.2 If the frost load test is not performed:
3.3.4.2.1 Operate the unit cooler at the dry coil conditions as specified in appendix C, section C11.1 to obtain dry coil defrost energy, DF
d
, in W-h.
3.3.4.2.2 The frost load defrost energy, DF
f
, in W-h shall be equal to 1.05 multiplied by the dry coil energy consumption, DF
d
, measured using the dry coil condition test in appendix C, section C11.1.
3.3.4.2.3 The number of defrosts per day N
DF
used in subsequent calculations shall be 4.
3.3.4.2.4 Use appendix C, equation C13 in section C11.3 to calculate the daily average defrost energy, DF, in W-h.
3.3.4.2.5 The daily contribution of the load attributed to defrost Q
DF
in Btu shall be calculated as follows:
ER28DE16.008
Where:
DF
d
= the defrost energy, in W-h, measured at the dry coil condition
3.3.5. If a unit has adaptive defrost, use appendix C, section C11.2 of AHRI 1250-2009 as follows:
3.3.5.1. When testing to certify to the energy conservation standards in § 431.306, do not perform the optional test for adaptive or demand defrost in appendix C, section C11.2.
3.3.5.2. When determining the represented value of the calculated benefit for the inclusion of adaptive defrost, conduct the optional test for adaptive or demand defrost in appendix C, section C11.2 to establish the maximum time interval allowed between dry coil defrosts. If this time is greater than 24 hours, set its value to 24 hours. Then, calculate N
DF
(the number of defrosts per day) by averaging the time in hours between successive defrosts for the dry coil condition with the time in hours between successive defrosts for the frosted coil condition, and dividing 24 by this average time. (The time between successive defrosts for the frosted coil condition is found as specified in section 3.3.4 of this appendix C of AHRI 1250-2009: That is, if the optional frosted coil test was performed, the time between successive defrosts for the frosted coil condition is found by performing the frosted coil test as specified in section 3.3.4.1 of this appendix; and if the optional frosted coil test was not performed, the time between successive defrosts for the frosted coil condition shall be set to 4 as specified in section 3.3.4.2. of this appendix) Use this new value of N
DF
in subsequent calculations.
3.3.6. For matched refrigeration systems and single-package dedicated systems, calculate the AWEF using the calculations in AHRI 1250-2009 (incorporated by reference; see § 431.303), section 7.4, 7.5, 7.6, or 7.7, as applicable.

Calculate the AWEF and net capacity using the calculations in AHRI 1250-2009, section 7.9.
3.3.7.2
High-Temperature Unit Coolers.
Calculate AWEF on the basis that walk-in box load is equal to half of the system net capacity, without variation according to high and low load periods, and with EER set according to tested evaporator capacity, as follows:
The net capacity,
q
mix,evap
, is determined from the test data for the unit cooler at the 38 °F suction dewpoint.
ER04MY23.030
Where:
ER04MY23.031
Where:
B
L
is the non-equipment-related box load;
LF is the load factor; and
Other symbols are as defined in section 8 of AHRI 1250-2009.
3.3.7.3. If the unit cooler has variable-speed evaporator fans that vary fan speed in response to load, then:
3.3.7.3.1. When testing to certify compliance with the energy conservation standards in § 431.306, fans shall operate at full speed during on-cycle operation. Do not conduct the calculations in AHRI 1250-2009, section 7.9.3. Instead, use AHRI 1250-2009, section 7.9.2 to determine the system's AWEF.
3.3.7.3.2. When calculating the benefit for the inclusion of variable-speed evaporator fans that modulate fan speed in response to load for the purpose of making representations of efficiency, use AHRI 1250-2009, section 7.9.3 to determine the system AWEF.

In Appendix C, section C5.2.2 of AHRI 1250-2020, for applicable system configurations (matched pairs, single-packaged refrigeration systems, and standalone unit coolers), the unit under test may be used to aid in achieving the required test chamber conditions prior to beginning any steady state test. However, the unit under test must be inspected and confirmed to be free from frost before initiating steady state testing.

# 3.5.2 General Modification: Methods of Testing
3.5.2.1 Refrigerant Temperature Measurements
When testing a condensing unit alone, measure refrigerant liquid temperature leaving the condensing unit, and the refrigerant vapor temperature entering the condensing unit as required in section C7.5.1.1.2 of Appendix C of AHRI 1250-2020 using the same measurement approach specified for the unit cooler in section C3.1.3 of Appendix C of AHRI 1250-2020. In all cases in which thermometer wells or immersed sheathed sensors are prescribed, if the refrigerant tube outer diameter is less than
1/2
inch, the refrigerant temperature may be measured using the average of two temperature measuring instruments with a minimum accuracy of ±0.5 °F placed on opposite sides of the refrigerant tube surface—resulting in a total of up to 8 temperature measurement devices used for the DX Dual Instrumentation method. In this case, the refrigerant tube shall be insulated with 1-inch thick insulation from a point 6 inches upstream of the measurement location to a point 6 inches downstream of the measurement location. Also, to comply with this requirement, the unit cooler/evaporator entering measurement location may be moved to a location 6 inches upstream of the expansion device and, when testing a condensing unit alone, the entering and leaving measurement locations may be moved to locations 6 inches from the respective service valves.
3.5.2.2 Mass Flow Meter Location
When using the DX Dual Instrumentation test method of AHRI 1250-2020, applicable for unit coolers, dedicated condensing units, and matched pairs, the second mass flow meter may be installed in the suction line as shown in Figure C1 of AHRI 1250-2020.
3.5.2.3 Subcooling at Refrigerant Mass Flow Meter
In section C3.4.5 of Appendix C of AHRI 1250-2020, when verifying subcooling at the mass flow meters, only the sight glass and a temperature sensor located on the tube surface under the insulation are required. Subcooling shall be verified to be within the 3 °F requirement downstream of flow meters located in the same chamber as a condensing unit under test and upstream of flow meters located in the same chamber as a unit cooler under test, rather than always downstream as indicated in AHRI 1250-2009, section C3.4.5. If the subcooling is less than 3 °F when testing a unit cooler, dedicated condensing unit, or matched pair (not a single-packaged system), cool the line between the condensing unit outlet and this location to achieve the required subcooling. When providing such cooling while testing a matched pair (a) set up the line-cooling system and also set up apparatus to heat the liquid line between the mass flow meters and the unit cooler, (b) when the system has achieved steady state without activation of the heating and cooling systems, measure the liquid temperature entering the expansion valve for a period of at least 30 minutes, (c) activate the cooling system to provide the required subcooling at the mass flow meters, (d) if necessary, apply heat such that the temperature entering the expansion valve is within 0.5 °F of the temperature measured during step (b), and (e) proceed with measurements once condition (d) has been verified.
3.5.2.4 Installation Instructions
Manufacturer installation instructions or installation instructions described in this section refer to the instructions that come packaged with or appear on the labels applied to the unit. This does not include online manuals.
Installation Instruction Hierarchy:
If a given installation instruction provided on the label(s) applied to the unit conflicts with the installation instructions that are shipped with the unit, the label takes precedence. For testing of matched pairs, the installation instructions for the dedicated condensing unit shall take precedence. Setup shall be in accordance with the field installation instructions (laboratory installation instructions shall not be used). Achieving test conditions shall always take precedence over installation instructions.
3.5.2.5. Refrigerant Charging and Adjustment of Superheat and Subcooling.
All dedicated condensing systems (dedicated condensing units tested alone, matched pairs, and single packaged dedicated systems) that use flooding of the condenser for head pressure control during low-ambient-temperature conditions shall be charged, and superheat and/or subcooling shall be set, at Refrigeration C test conditions unless otherwise specified in the installation instructions.
If after being charged at Refrigeration C condition the unit under test does not operate at the Refrigeration A condition due to high pressure cut out, refrigerant shall be removed in increments of 4 ounces or 5 percent of the test unit's receiver capacity, whichever quantity is larger, until the unit operates at the Refrigeration A condition. All tests shall be run at this final refrigerant charge. If less than 0 °F of subcooling is measured for the refrigerant leaving the condensing unit when testing at B or C condition, calculate the refrigerant-enthalpy-based capacity (
i.e.
, when using the DX dual instrumentation, the DX calibrated box, or single-packaged unit refrigerant enthalpy method) assuming that the refrigerant is at saturated liquid conditions at the condensing unit exit.
All dedicated condensing systems that do not use a flooded condenser design shall be charged at Refrigeration A test conditions unless otherwise specified in the installation instructions.
If the installation instructions give a specified range for superheat, sub-cooling, or refrigerant pressure, the average of the range shall be used as the refrigerant charging parameter target and the test condition tolerance shall be ±50 percent of the range. Perform charging of near-azeotropic and zeotropic refrigerants only with refrigerant in the liquid state. Once the correct refrigerant charge is determined, all tests shall run until completion without further modification.
3.5.2.5.1. When charging or adjusting superheat/subcooling, use all pertinent instructions contained in the installation instructions to achieve charging parameters within the tolerances. However, in the event of conflicting charging information between installation instructions, follow the installation instruction hierarchy listed in section 3.5.2.4. Conflicting information is defined as multiple conditions given for charge adjustment where all conditions specified cannot be met. In the event of conflicting information within the same set of charging instructions (e.g., the installation instructions shipped with the dedicated condensing unit), follow the hierarchy in Table 19 for priority. Unless the installation instructions specify a different charging tolerance, the tolerances identified in table 19 of this appendix shall be used.

3.5.2.5.2.
Dedicated Condensing Unit.
If the Dedicated Condensing Unit includes a receiver and the subcooling target leaving the condensing unit provided in installation instructions cannot be met without fully filling the receiver, the subcooling target shall be ignored. Likewise, if the Dedicated Condensing unit does not include a receiver and the subcooling target leaving the condensing unit cannot be met without the unit cycling off on high pressure, the subcooling target can be ignored. Also, if no instructions for charging or for setting subcooling leaving the condensing unit are provided in the installation instructions, the refrigeration system shall be set up with a charge quantity and/or exit subcooling such that the unit operates during testing without shutdown (e.g., on a high-pressure switch) and operation of the unit is otherwise consistent with the requirements of the test procedure of this appendix and the installation instructions.
3.5.2.5.3.
Unit Cooler.
Use the shipped expansion device for testing. Otherwise, use the expansion device specified in the installation instructions. If the installation instructions specify multiple options for the expansion device, any specified expansion device may be used. The supplied expansion device shall be adjusted until either the superheat target is met, or the device reaches the end of its adjustable range. In the event the device reaches the end of its adjustable range and the super heat target is not met, test with the adjustment at the end of its range providing the closest match to the superheat target, and the test condition tolerance for super heat target shall be ignored. The measured superheat is not subject to a test operating tolerance. However, if the evaporator exit condition is used to determine capacity using the DX dual instrumentation method or the refrigerant enthalpy method, individual superheat value measurements may not be equal to or less than zero. If this occurs, or if the operating tolerances of measurements affected by expansion device fluctuation are exceeded, the expansion device shall be replaced, operated at an average superheat value higher than the target, or both, in order to avoid individual superheat value measurements less than zero and/or to meet the required operating tolerances.
3.5.2.5.4.
Single-Packaged Unit.
Unless otherwise directed by the installation instructions, install one or more refrigerant line pressure gauges during the setup of the unit, located depending on the parameters used to verify or set charge, as described in this section:
3.5.2.5.4.1. Install a pressure gauge in the liquid line if charging is on the basis of subcooling, or high side pressure or corresponding saturation or dew point temperature.
3.5.2.5.4.2. Install a pressure gauge in the suction line if charging is on the basis of superheat, or low side pressure or corresponding saturation or dew point temperature. Install this gauge as close to the evaporator as allowable by the installation instructions and the physical constraints of the unit. Use methods for installing pressure gauge(s) at the required location(s) as indicated in the installation instructions if specified.
3.5.2.5.4.3. If the installation instructions indicate that refrigerant line pressure gauges should not be installed and the unit fails to operate due to high-pressure or low-pressure compressor cut off, then a charging port shall be installed, and the unit shall be evacuated of refrigerant and charged to the nameplate charge.
3.5.2.6 Ducted Units
For systems with ducted evaporator air, or that can be installed with or without ducted evaporator air: Connect ductwork on both
the inlet and outlet connections and determine external static pressure (ESP) as described in sections 6.4 and 6.5 of ANSI/ASHRAE 37. Use pressure measurement instrumentation as described in section 5.3.2 of ANSI/ASHRAE 37. Test at the fan speed specified in the installation instructions—if there is more than one fan speed setting and the installation instructions do not specify which speed to use, test at the highest speed. Conduct tests with the ESP equal to 50% of the maximum ESP allowed in the installation instructions, within a tolerance of −0.00/+0.05 inches of water column. If the installation instructions do not provide the maximum ESP, the ESP shall be set for testing such that the air volume rate is
2/3
of the air volume rate measured when the ESP is 0.00 inches of water column within a tolerance of −0.00/+0.05 inches of water column.
If testing using either the indoor or outdoor air enthalpy method to measure the air volume rate, adjust the airflow measurement apparatus fan to set the external static pressure—otherwise, set the external static pressure by symmetrically restricting the outlet of the test duct. In case of conflict, these requirements for setting airflow take precedence over airflow values specified in manufacturer installation instructions or product literature.
3.5.2.7. Two-Speed or Multiple-Speed Evaporator Fans. Two-Speed or Multiple-Speed evaporator fans shall be considered to meet the qualifying control requirements of section C4.2 of Appendix C of AHRI 1250-2020 for measuring off-cycle fan energy if they use a fan speed no less than 50% of the speed used in the maximum capacity tests.
3.5.2.8. Defrost
Use section C10.2.1 of Appendix C of AHRI 1250-2020 for defrost testing. The Test Room Conditioning Equipment requirement of section C10.2.1.1 of Appendix C of AHRI 1250-2020 does not apply.
3.5.2.8.1 Adaptive Defrost
When testing to certify compliance to the energy conservation standards, use N
DF
= 4, as instructed in section C10.2.1.7 or C10.2.2.1 of AHRI 1250-2020. When determining the represented value of the calculated benefit for the inclusion of adaptive defrost, use N
DF
= 2.5, as instructed in section C10.2.1.7 or C10.2.2.1 of AHRI 1250-2020.
3.5.2.8.2 Hot Gas Defrost
When testing to certify compliance to the energy conservation standards, remove the hot gas defrost mechanical components and disconnect all such components from electrical power. Test the units as if they are electric defrost units, but do not conduct the defrost tests described in section C10.2.1 of AHRI 1250-2020. Use the defrost heat and power consumption values as described in section C10.2.2 of AHRI 1250-2020 for the AWEF2 calculations.
3.5.2.9 Dedicated condensing units that are not matched for testing and are not single-packaged dedicated systems.
The temperature measurement requirements of sections C3.1.3 and C4.1.3.1 appendix C of AHRI 1250-2020 shall apply only to the condensing unit exit rather than to the unit cooler inlet and outlet, and they shall be applied for two measurements when using the DX Dual Instrumentation test method.
3.5.2.10. Single-packaged dedicated systems
Use the test method in section C9 of appendix C of AHRI 1250-2020 (including the applicable provisions of ASHRAE 16-2016, ASHRAE 23.1-2010, ASHRAE 37-2009, and ASHRAE 41.6-2014, as referenced in section C9.1 of AHRI 1250-2020) as the method of test for single-packaged dedicated systems, with modifications as described in this section. Use two test methods listed in table 20 of this appendix to calculate the net capacity and power consumption. The test method listed with a lower “Hierarchy Number” and that has “Primary” as an allowable use in table 20 of this appendix shall be considered the primary measurement and used as the net capacity.

3.5.2.10.1 Single-Packaged Refrigerant Enthalpy Method
The single-packaged refrigerant enthalpy method shall follow the test procedure of the
DX Calibrated Box method in AHRI 1250-2020, appendix C, section C8 for refrigerant-side measurements with the following modifications:
3.5.2.10.1.1 Air-side measurements shall follow the requirements of the primary single-packaged method listed in table 20 of this appendix. The air-side measurements and refrigerant-side measurements shall be collected over the same intervals.
3.5.2.10.1.2 A preliminary test at Test Rating Condition A is required using the primary method prior to any modification necessary to install the refrigerant-side measuring instruments. Install surface mount temperature sensors on the evaporator and condenser coils at locations not affected by liquid subcooling or vapor superheat (i.e., near the midpoint of the coil at a return bend), entering and leaving the compressor, and entering the expansion device. These temperature sensors shall be included in the regularly recorded data.
3.5.2.10.1.3 After the preliminary test is completed, the refrigerant shall be removed from the equipment and the refrigerant-side measuring instruments shall be installed. The equipment shall then be evacuated and recharged with refrigerant. Once the equipment is operating at Test Condition A, the refrigerant charge shall be adjusted until, as compared to the average values from the preliminary test, the following conditions are achieved:
(a) Each on-coil temperature sensor indicates a reading that is within ±1.0 °F of the measurement in the initial test,
(b) The temperatures of the refrigerant entering and leaving the compressor are within ±4 °F, and
(c) The refrigerant temperature entering the expansion device is within ±1 °F.
3.5.2.10.1.4 Once these conditions have been achieved over an interval of at least 10 minutes, refrigerant charging equipment shall be removed and the official tests shall be conducted.
3.5.2.10.1.5 The lengths of liquid line to be added shall be 5 feet maximum, not including the requisite flow meter. This maximum length applies to each circuit separately.
3.5.2.10.1.6 Use section C9.2 of appendix C of AHRI 1250-2020 for allowable refrigeration capacity heat balance. Calculate the single-packaged refrigerant enthalpy (secondary) method test net capacity

3.5.2.10.1.7 For multi-circuit single-packaged systems utilizing the single-packaged refrigerant enthalpy method, apply the test method separately for each circuit and sum the separately-calculated refrigerant-side gross refrigeration capacities.
3.5.2.10.2 Calibrated Box Test Procedure
3.5.2.10.2.1 Measurements. Refer to section C3 of AHRI 1250-2020 (including the applicable provisions of ASHRAE 41.1-2013, ASHRAE 41.3-2014, and ASHRAE 41.10-2013, as referenced in section C3 of AHRI 1250-2020) for requirements of air-side and refrigerant-side measurements.
3.5.2.10.2.2 Apparatus setup for Calibrated Box Calibration and Test. Refer to section C5 of AHRI 1250-2020 and section C8 of AHRI 1250-2020 for specific test setup.
3.5.2.10.2.3 The calibrated box shall be installed in a temperature-controlled enclosure in which the temperature can be maintained at a constant level. When using the calibrated box method for Single-Packaged Dedicated Systems, the enclosure air temperature shall be maintained such that the condenser air entering conditions are as specified for the test.
3.5.2.10.2. The temperature-controlled enclosure shall be of a size that will provide clearances of not less than 18 in at all sides, top and bottom, except that clearance of any one surface may be reduced to not less than 5.5 inches.
3.5.2.10.2.5 The heat leakage of the calibrated box shall be noted in the test report.
3.5.2.10.2.6 Refrigerant lines within the calibrated box shall be well insulated to avoid appreciable heat loss or gain.
3.5.2.10.2.7 Instruments for measuring the temperature around the outside of the calibrated box to represent the enclosure temperature T
en
shall be located at the center of each wall, ceiling, and floor. Exception: in the case where a clearance around the outside of the calibrated box, as indicated in section 3.5.2.10.2.4 of this appendix, is reduced to less than 18 inches, the number of temperature measuring devices on the outside of that surface shall be increased to six, which shall be treated as a single temperature to be averaged with the temperature of each of the other five surfaces. The six temperature measuring instruments shall be located at the center of six rectangular sections of equal area. If the refrigeration system is mounted at the location that would cover the center of the face on which it is mounted, up to four temperature measurements shall be used on that face to represent its temperature. Each sensor shall be aligned with the center of the face's nearest outer edge and centered on the distance between that edge and the single-packaged unit (this is illustrated in figure C5 of this section when using surface temperature sensors), and they shall be treated as a single temperature to be averaged with the temperature of each of the other five surfaces. However, any of these sensors shall be omitted if either (a) the distance between the outer edge and the single-packaged unit is less than one foot or (b) if the sensor location would be within two feet of any of the foot square surfaces discussed in section 3.5.2.10.2.8 of this appendix representing a warm discharge air impingement area. In this case, the remaining sensors shall be used to represent the average temperature for the surface.
3.5.2.10.2.8 One of the following two approaches shall be used for the box external temperature measurement. Box calibration and system capacity measurement shall both be done using the same one of these approaches. 1: Air temperature sensors. Each temperature sensor shall be at a distance of 6 inches from the calibrated box. If the clearance from a surface of the box (allowed for one surface only) is less than 12 inches, the temperature measuring instruments shall be located midway between the outer wall of the calibrated box and the adjacent surface. 2: Surface temperature sensors. Surface temperature sensors shall be mounted on the calibrated box surfaces to represent the enclosure temperature, T
en
.
3.5.2.10.2.9 Additional surface temperature sensors may be used to measure external hot spots during refrigeration system testing. If this is done, two temperature sensors shall be used to measure the average temperature of the calibrated box surface covered by the condensing section—they shall be located centered on equal-area rectangles comprising the covered calibrated box surface whose common sides span the short dimension of this surface. Additional surface temperature sensors may be used to measure box surfaces on which warm condenser discharge air impinges. A pattern of square surfaces measuring one foot square shall be mapped out to represent the hot spot upon which the warm condenser air impinges. One temperature sensor shall be used to measure surface temperature at the center of each square (see figure C5 of this section). A drawing showing this pattern and identifying the surface temperature sensors shall be provided in the test report. The average surface temperature of the overall calibrated box outer surface during testing shall be calculated as follows.

The heating means shall be constructed to avoid stratification of temperature, and suitable means shall be provided for distributing the temperature uniformly.
3.5.2.10.2.11 The average air dry-bulb temperature in the calibrated box during Single-Packaged Dedicated System tests and calibrated box heat leakage tests shall be the average of eight temperatures measured at the corners of the box at a distance of 2 inches to 4 inches from the walls. The instruments shall be shielded from any cold or warm surfaces except that they shall not be shielded from the adjacent walls of the box. The Single-Packaged Dedicated System under test shall be mounted such that the temperature instruments are not in the direct air stream from the discharge of the Single-Packaged Dedicated System.
3.5.2.10.2.12 Calibration of the Calibrated Box. Calibration of the Calibrated Box shall occur prior to installation of the Single-Packaged Dedicated System. This shall be done either (a) prior to cutting the opening needed to install the Single-Packaged Dedicated System, or (b) with an insulating panel with the same thickness and thermal resistance as the box wall installed in the opening intended for the Single-Packaged Dedicated System installation. Care shall be taken to avoid thermal shorts in the location of the opening either during calibration or during subsequent installation of the Single-Packaged Dedicated System. A calibration test shall be made for air movements comparable to those expected for Single-Packaged Dedicated System capacity measurement,
i.e.,
with air volume flow rate within 10 percent of the air volume flow rate of the Single-Packaged Dedicated System evaporator.
3.5.2.10.2.13 The heat input shall be adjusted to maintain an average box temperature not less than 25.0 °F above the test enclosure temperature.
3.5.2.10.2.14 The average dry-bulb temperature inside the calibrated box shall not vary more than 1.0 °F over the course of the calibration test.
3.5.2.10.2.15 A calibration test shall be the average of 11 consecutive hourly readings when the box has reached a steady-state temperature condition.
3.5.2.10.2.16 The box temperature shall be the average of all readings after a steady-state temperature condition has been reached.
3.5.2.10.2.17 The calibrated box has reached a steady-state temperature condition when: The average box temperature is not less than 25 °F above the test enclosure temperature. Temperature variations do not exceed 5.0 °F between temperature measuring stations. Temperatures do not vary by more than 2 °F at any one temperature- measuring station.
3.5.2.10.2.18 Data to be Measured and Recorded. Refer to Table C5 in section C6.2 of AHRI 1250-2020 for the required data that need to measured and recorded.

Variable-Capacity and Multiple-Capacity Dedicated Condensing Refrigeration Systems
3.5.2.11.1 Manufacturer-Provided Equipment Overrides
Where needed, the manufacturer must provide a means for overriding the controls of the test unit so that the compressor(s) operates at the specified speed or capacity and the indoor blower operates at the speed consistent with the compressor operating level as would occur without override.
3.5.2.11.2 Compressor Operating Levels
For variable-capacity and multiple-capacity compressor systems, the minimum capacity for testing shall be the minimum capacity that the system control would operate the compressor in normal operation. Likewise, the maximum capacity for testing shall be the maximum capacity that the system control would operate the compressor in normal operation. For variable-speed compressor systems, the intermediate speed for testing shall be the average of the minimum and maximum speeds. For digital compressor systems, the intermediate duty cycle shall be the average of the minimum and maximum duty cycles. For multiple-capacity compressor systems with three capacity levels, the intermediate operating level for testing shall be the middle capacity level. For multiple-capacity compressor systems with more than three capacity levels, the intermediate operating level for testing shall be the level whose displacement ratio is closest to the average of the maximum and minimum displacement ratios.
3.5.2.11.3 Refrigeration Systems with Digital Compressor(s)
Use the test methods described in section 3.5.2.10.1 of this appendix as the secondary method of test for refrigeration systems with digital compressor(s) with modifications as described in this section. The Test Operating tolerance for refrigerant mass flow rate and suction pressure in Table 2 of AHRI 1250-2020 shall be ignored. Temperature and pressure measurements used to calculate shall be recorded at a frequency of once per second or faster and based on average values measured over the 30-minute test period.
3.5.2.11.3.1 For Matched pair (not including single-packaged systems) and Dedicated Condensing Unit refrigeration systems, the preliminary test in sections 3.5.2.10.1.2 and 3.5.2.10.1.3 of this appendix is not required. The liquid line and suction line shall be 25 feet ± 3 inches, not including the requisite flow meters. Also, the term in the equation to calculate net capacity shall be set equal to zero.
3.5.2.11.3.2 For Dedicated Condensing Unit refrigeration systems, the primary capacity measurement method shall be balanced ambient outdoor calorimeter, outdoor air enthalpy, or outdoor room calorimeter.

Basic stabilization method.
Lamps using the basic stabilization method must be stabilized in accordance with Section 4.4.2 of ANSI C82.6-2015 (R2020). Stabilization is reached when the lamp's electrical characteristics vary by no more than 3-percent in three consecutive 10- to 15-minute intervals measured after the minimum burning time of 30 minutes.
(C)
Alternative stabilization method.
In cases where switching from the reference ballast to test ballast without extinguishing the lamp is impossible, such as for low-frequency electronic ballasts, the alternative stabilization method must be used. Lamps using the alternative stabilization method must be stabilized in accordance with Section 4.4.3 of ANSI C82.6-2015 (R2020).
(ii)
Test measurements.
(A) The ballast input power during operating conditions must be measured in accordance with the methods specified in Sections 6.1 and 6.8 of ANSI C82.6-2015 (R2020).

# II. Determination of Package Isentropic Efficiency, Package Specific Power, and Pressure Ratio at Full-Load Operating Pressure

# A. Data Collection and Analysis
A.1. Stabilization. Record data at each load point under steady-state conditions. Steady-state conditions are achieved when a set of two consecutive readings taken at least 10 seconds apart and no more than 60 seconds apart are within the maximum permissible fluctuation from the average (of the two consecutive readings), as specified in Table 1 of ISO 1217:2009(E) (incorporated by reference, see § 431.343) for—
(1) Discharge pressure;
(2) Temperature at the nozzle or orifice plate, measured per section 5.3 of ISO 1217:2009(E) (incorporated by reference, see § 431.343); and
(3) Differential pressure over the nozzle or orifice plate, measured per section 5.2 of ISO 1217:2009(E) (incorporated by reference, see § 431.343).
A.2. Data Sampling and Frequency. At each load point, record a minimum set of 16 unique readings, collected over a minimum time of 15 minutes. Each consecutive reading must be no more than 60 seconds apart, and not less than 10 seconds apart. All readings at each load point must be within the maximum permissible fluctuation from average specified in Table 1 of ISO 1217:2009(E) (incorporated by reference, see § 431.343) for—
(1) Discharge pressure;
(2) Temperature at the nozzle or orifice plate, measured per section 5.3 of ISO 1217:2009(E) (incorporated by reference, see § 431.343); and
(3) Differential pressure over the nozzle or orifice plate, measured per section 5.2 of ISO 1217:2009(E) (incorporated by reference, see § 431.343).
If one or more readings do not meet the requirements, then all previous readings must be disregarded and a new set of at least 16 new unique readings must be collected over a minimum time of 15 minutes. Average the readings to determine the value of each parameter to be used in subsequent calculations.
A.3. Calculations and Rounding. Perform all calculations using raw measured values. Round the final result for package isentropic efficiency to the thousandth (
i.e.,
0.001), for package specific power in kilowatts per 100 cubic feet per minute to the nearest hundredth (
i.e.,
0.01), for pressure ratio at full-load operating pressure to the nearest tenth (
i.e.,
0.1), for full-load actual volume flow rate in cubic feet per minute to the nearest tenth (
i.e.,

# III. Method to Determine Maximum Full-Flow Operating Pressure, Full-Load Operating Pressure, and Full-Load Actual Volume Flow Rate

# A. Principal Strategy
The principal strategy of this method is to incrementally increase discharge pressure by 2 psig relative to a starting point, and identify the maximum full-flow operating pressure at which the compressor is capable of operating. The maximum discharge pressure achieved is the maximum full-flow operating pressure. The full-load operating pressure and full-load actual volume flow rate are determined based on the maximum full-flow operating pressure.

# B. Pre-test Instructions

# B.1. Safety
For the method presented in section III.C.1 of this appendix, only test discharge pressure within the safe operating range of the compressor, as specified by the manufacturer in the installation and operation manual shipped with the unit. Make no changes to safety limits or equipment. Do not violate any manufacturer-provided motor operational guidelines for normal use, including any restriction on instantaneous and continuous input power draw and output shaft power (
e.g.,
electrical rating and service factor limits).

# B.2. Adjustment of Discharge Pressure
B.2.1. If the air compressor is not equipped, as distributed in commerce by the manufacturer, with any mechanism to adjust the maximum discharge pressure output limit, proceed to section III.B.3 of this appendix.
B.2.2. If the air compressor is equipped, as distributed in commerce by the manufacturer, with any mechanism to adjust the maximum discharge pressure output limit, then adjust this mechanism to the maximum pressure allowed, according to the manufacturer's operating instructions for these mechanisms. Mechanisms to adjust discharge pressure may include, but are not limited to, onboard digital or analog controls, and user-adjustable inlet valves.

# B.3. Driver speed
If the unit under test is a variable-speed compressor, maintain maximum driver speed throughout the test. If the unit under test is a fixed-speed compressor with a multi-speed driver, maintain driver speed at the maximum speed throughout the test.

# B.4. Measurements and Tolerances

# B.4.1. Recording
Record data by electronic means such that the requirements of section B.4.5 of section III of this appendix are met.

# B.4.2. Discharge Pressure
Measure discharge pressure in accordance with section 5.2 of ISO 1217:2009(E) (incorporated by reference, see § 431.343). Express compressor discharge pressure in psig in reference to ambient conditions, and record it to the nearest integer. Specify targeted discharge pressure points in integer values only. The maximum allowable measured deviation from the targeted discharge pressure at each tested point is ±1 psig.

# B.4.3. Actual Volume Flow Rate
Measure actual volume flow rate in accordance with section C.4.2.1 of Annex C of ISO 1217:2009(E) (incorporated by reference, see § 431.343) (where it is called “corrected volume flow rate”) with no corrections made for shaft speed. Express compressor actual volume flow rate in cubic feet per minute at inlet conditions (cfm).

# B.4.4. Stabilization
Record data at each tested load point under steady-state conditions, as determined in section II.A.1 of this appendix.

# B.4.5. Data Sampling and Frequency
At each load point, record a set of at least of two readings, collected at a minimum of 10 seconds apart. All readings at each load point must be within the maximum permissible fluctuation from the average (of the two consecutive readings), as specified in II.A.2 of this appendix. Average the measurements to determine the value of each parameter to be used in subsequent calculations.

# B.5. Adjusting System Backpressure
Set up the unit under test so that backpressure on the unit can be adjusted (
e.g.,
by valves) incrementally, causing the measured discharge pressure to change, until the compressor is in an unloaded condition.

# B.6. Unloaded Condition
A unit is considered to be in an unloaded condition if capacity controls on the unit automatically reduce the actual volume flow rate from the compressor (
e.g.,
shutting the motor off, or unloading by adjusting valves).

# C. Test Instructions
C.1. Adjust the backpressure of the system so the measured discharge pressure is 90 percent of the expected maximum full-flow operating pressure, rounded to the nearest integer, in psig. If the expected maximum full-flow operating pressure is not known, then adjust the backpressure of the system so that the measured discharge pressure is 65 psig. Allow the unit to remain at this setting for 15 minutes to allow the unit to thermally stabilize. Then measure and record discharge pressure and actual volume flow rate at the starting pressure.
C.2. Adjust the backpressure of the system to increase the discharge pressure by 2 psig from the previous value, allow the unit to remain at this setting for a minimum of 2 minutes, and proceed to section III.C.3 of this appendix.
C.3. If the unit is now in an unloaded condition, end the test and proceed to section III.C.4 of this appendix. If the unit is not in an unloaded condition, measure discharge pressure and actual volume flow rate, and repeat section III.C.2 of this appendix.
C.4. Of the discharge pressures recorded under stabilized conditions in sections III.C.1 through III.C.3 of this appendix, identify the largest. This is the maximum full-flow operating pressure. Determine the full-load operating pressure as a self-declared value greater than or equal to the lesser of (A) 90 percent of the maximum full-flow operating pressure, or (B) 10 psig less than the maximum full-flow operating pressure.
C.5. The full-load actual volume flow rate is the actual volume flow rate measured at the full-load operating pressure. If the self-declared full-load operating pressure falls on a previously tested value of discharge pressure, then use the previously measured actual volume flow rate as the full-load actual volume flow rate. If the self-declared full-load operating pressure does not fall on a previously tested value of discharge pressure, then adjust the backpressure of the system to the self-declared full-load operating pressure and allow the unit to remain at this setting for a minimum of 2 minutes. The measured actual volume flow rate at this setting is the full-load actual volume flow rate.

§ 431.383
Enforcement process for electric motors.
(a)
Test notice.
Upon receiving information in writing, concerning the energy performance of a particular electric motor sold by a particular manufacturer or private labeler, which indicates that the electric motor may not be in compliance with the applicable energy efficiency standard, or upon undertaking to ascertain the accuracy of the efficiency rating on the nameplate or in marketing materials for an electric motor, disclosed pursuant to subpart B of this part, the Secretary may conduct testing of that electric motor under this subpart by means of a test notice addressed to the manufacturer in accordance with the following requirements:
(1) The test notice procedure will only be followed after the Secretary or his/her designated representative has examined the underlying test data (or, where appropriate, data as to use of an alternative efficiency determination method) provided by the manufacturer and after the manufacturer has been offered the opportunity to meet with the Department to verify, as applicable, compliance with the applicable efficiency standard, or the accuracy of labeling information, or both. In addition, where compliance of a basic model was certified based on an AEDM, the Department shall have the discretion to pursue the provisions of § 431.17(a)(4)(iii) prior to invoking the test notice procedure. A representative designated by the Secretary shall be permitted to observe any re-verification procedures undertaken pursuant to this subpart, and to inspect the results of such reverification.
(2) The test notice will be signed by the Secretary or his/her designee. The test notice will be mailed or delivered by the Department to the plant manager or other responsible official, as designated by the manufacturer.
(3) The test notice will specify the model or basic model to be selected for testing, the method of selecting the test sample, the date and time at which testing shall be initiated, the date by which testing is scheduled to be completed and the facility at which testing will be conducted. The test notice may also provide for situations in
which the specified basic model is unavailable for testing, and may include alternative basic models.
(4) The Secretary may require in the test notice that the manufacturer of an electric motor shall ship at his expense a reasonable number of units of a basic model specified in such test notice to a testing laboratory designated by the Secretary. The number of units of a basic model specified in a test notice shall not exceed 20.
(5) Within five working days of the time the units are selected, the manufacturer shall ship the specified test units of a basic model to the testing laboratory.
(b)
Testing laboratory.
Whenever the Department conducts enforcement testing at a designated laboratory in accordance with a test notice under this section, the resulting test data shall constitute official test data for that basic model. Such test data will be used by the Department to make a determination of compliance or noncompliance if a sufficient number of tests have been conducted to satisfy the requirements of appendix A of this subpart.
(c)
Sampling.
The determination that a manufacturer's basic model complies with its labeled efficiency, or the applicable energy efficiency standard, shall be based on the testing conducted in accordance with the statistical sampling procedures set forth in appendix A of this subpart and the test procedures set forth in appendix B to subpart B of this part.
(d)
Test unit selection.
A Department inspector shall select a batch, a batch sample, and test units from the batch sample in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph and the conditions specified in the test notice.
(1) The batch may be subdivided by the Department utilizing criteria specified in the test notice.
(2) A batch sample of up to 20 units will then be randomly selected from one or more subdivided groups within the batch. The manufacturer shall keep on hand all units in the batch sample until such time as the basic model is determined to be in compliance or non-compliance.
(3) Individual test units comprising the test sample shall be randomly selected from the batch sample.
(4) All random selection shall be achieved by sequentially numbering all of the units in a batch sample and then using a table of random numbers to select the units to be tested.
(e)
Test unit preparation.
(1) Prior to and during the testing, a test unit selected in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section shall not be prepared, modified, or adjusted in any manner unless such preparation, modification, or adjustment is allowed by the applicable Department of Energy test procedure. One test shall be conducted for each test unit in accordance with the applicable test procedures prescribed in appendix B to subpart B of this part.
(2) No quality control, testing, or assembly procedures shall be performed on a test unit, or any parts and sub-assemblies thereof, that is not performed during the production and assembly of all other units included in the basic model.
(3) A test unit shall be considered defective if such unit is inoperative or is found to be in noncompliance due to failure of the unit to operate according to the manufacturer's design and operating instructions. Defective units, including those damaged due to shipping or handling, shall be reported immediately to the Department. The Department shall authorize testing of an additional unit on a case-by-case basis.
(4)(i)
Non-standard endshields or flanges.
For purposes of DOE-initiated testing of electric motors with non-standard endshields or flanges, the Department will have the discretion to determine whether the lab should test a general purpose electric motor of equivalent electrical design and enclosure rather than replacing the nonstandard flange or endshield.
(ii)
Partial electric motors.
For purposes of DOE-initiated testing, the Department has the discretion to determine whether the lab should test a general purpose electric motor of equivalent electrical design and enclosure rather than machining and attaching an endshield.
(f)
Testing at manufacturer's option.
(1) If a manufacturer's basic model is determined to be in noncompliance with
the applicable energy performance standard at the conclusion of Department testing in accordance with the sampling plan specified in appendix A of this subpart, the manufacturer may request that the Department conduct additional testing of the basic model according to procedures set forth in appendix A of this subpart.
(2) All units tested under this paragraph shall be selected and tested in accordance with the provisions given in paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section.
(3) The manufacturer shall bear the cost of all testing conducted under this paragraph.
(4) The manufacturer shall cease distribution of the basic model tested under the provisions of this paragraph from the time the manufacturer elects to exercise the option provided in this paragraph until the basic model is determined to be in compliance. The Department may seek civil penalties for all units distributed during such period.
(5) If the additional testing results in a determination of compliance, a notice of allowance to resume distribution shall be issued by the Department.
[69 FR 61941, Oct. 21, 2004. Redesignated at 70 FR 60416, Oct. 18, 2005, as amended at 78 FR 75995, Dec. 13, 2013]
§ 431.384
[Reserved]
§ 431.385
Cessation of distribution of a basic model of an electric motor.
(a) In the event that a model of an electric motor is determined non-compliant by the Department in accordance with § 431.192 or if a manufacturer or private labeler determines a model of an electric motor to be in noncompliance, then the manufacturer or private labeler shall:
(1) Immediately cease distribution in commerce of the basic model.
(2) Give immediate written notification of the determination of noncompliance, to all persons to whom the manufacturer has distributed units of the basic model manufactured since the date of the last determination of compliance.
(3) Pursuant to a request made by the Secretary, provide the Department within 30 days of the request, records, reports, and other documentation pertaining to the acquisition, ordering, storage, shipment, or sale of a basic model determined to be in noncompliance.
(4) The manufacturer may modify the non-compliant basic model in such manner as to make it comply with the applicable performance standard. Such modified basic model shall then be treated as a new basic model and must be certified in accordance with the provisions of this subpart; except that in addition to satisfying all requirements of this subpart, the manufacturer shall also maintain records that demonstrate that modifications have been made to all units of the new basic model prior to distribution in commerce.
(b) If a basic model is not properly certified in accordance with the requirements of this subpart, the Secretary may seek, among other remedies, injunctive action to prohibit distribution in commerce of such basic model.
§ 431.386

Pt. 431, Subpt. U, App. A

# Appendix A to Subpart U of Part 431—Sampling Plan for Enforcement Testing of Electric Motors
Step 1. The first sample size (n
1
) must be five or more units.
Step 2. Compute the mean (X
1
of the measured energy performance of the n
1
units in the first sample as follows:
ER83AD04.005
where X
i
is the measured full-load efficiency of unit i.
Step 3. Compute the sample standard deviation (S
1
) of the measured full-load efficiency of the n
1
units in the first sample as follows:
ER83AD04.006
Step 4. Compute the standard error (SE(X
1
)) of the mean full-load efficiency of the first sample as follows:
ER83AD04.007
Step 5. Compute the lower control limit (LCL
1
) for the mean of the first sample using RE as the desired mean as follows:
ER83AD04.008
where: RE is the applicable EPCA nominal full-load efficiency when the test is to determine compliance with the applicable statutory standard, or is the labeled nominal full-load efficiency when the test is to determine compliance with the labeled efficiency value, and t is the 2.5th percentile of a t-distribution for a sample size of n
1
, which yields a 97.5 percent confidence level for a one-tailed t-test.
Step 6. Compare the mean of the first sample (X
1
) with the lower control limit (LCL
1
) to determine one of the following:
(i) If the mean of the first sample is below the lower control limit, then the basic model is in non-compliance and testing is at an end.
(ii) If the mean is equal to or greater than the lower control limit, no final determination of compliance or non-compliance can be made; proceed to Step 7.
Step 7. Determine the recommended sample size (n) as follows:
ER83AD04.009
where S
1
, RE and t have the values used in Steps 3 and 5, respectively. The factor
ER83AD04.010
is based on a 20 percent tolerance in the total power loss at full-load and fixed output power.
Given the value of n, determine one of the following:
(i) If the value of n is less than or equal to n
1
and if the mean energy efficiency of the first sample (X
1
) is equal to or greater than the lower control limit (LCL
1
), the basic model is in compliance and testing is at an end.
(ii) If the value of n is greater than n1, the basic model is in non-compliance. The size of a second sample n
2
is determined to be the smallest integer equal to or greater than the difference n−n
1
. If the value of n
2
so calculated is greater than 20−n1, set n
2
equal to 20−n
1
.
Step 8. Compute the combined (X
2
) mean of the measured energy performance of the n
1
and n
2
units of the combined first and second samples as follows:
ER83AD04.011
Step 9. Compute the standard error (SE(X
2
)) of the mean full-load efficiency of the n
1
and n
2
units in the combined first and second samples as follows:
ER83AD04.012
(Note that S
1
is the value obtained above in Step 3.)
Step 10. Set the lower control limit (LCL
2
) to,
ER83AD04.013
where t has the value obtained in Step 5, and compare the combined sample mean (X
2
) to the lower control limit (LCL
2
) to find one of the following:
(i) If the mean of the combined sample (X
2
) is less than the lower control limit (LCL
2
),
the basic model is in non-compliance and testing is at an end.
(ii) If the mean of the combined sample (X
2
) is equal to or greater than the lower control limit (LCL
2
), the basic model is in compliance and testing is at an end.

# Manufacturer-Option Testing
If a determination of non-compliance is made in Steps 6, 7 or 10, of this appendix A, the manufacturer may request that additional testing be conducted, in accordance with the following procedures.
Step A. The manufacturer requests that an additional number, n
3
, of units be tested, with n
3
chosen such that n
1
+ n
2
+ n
3
does not exceed 20.
Step B. Compute the mean full-load efficiency, standard error, and lower control limit of the new combined sample in accordance with the procedures prescribed in Steps 8, 9, and 10, of this appendix A.
Step C. Compare the mean performance of the new combined sample to the lower control limit (LCL
2
) to determine one of the following:
(a) If the new combined sample mean is equal to or greater than the lower control limit, the basic model is in compliance and testing is at an end.
(b) If the new combined sample mean is less than the lower control limit and the value of n
1
+ n
2
+ n
3
is less than 20, the manufacturer may request that additional units be tested. The total of all units tested may not exceed 20. Steps A, B, and C are then repeated.
(c) Otherwise, the basic model is determined to be in non-compliance.

§ 431.401
Petitions for waiver and interim waiver.
(a)
General information.
This section provides a means for seeking waivers of the test procedure requirements of this part for basic models that meet the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this section. In granting a waiver or interim waiver, DOE will not change the energy use or efficiency metric that the manufacturer must use to certify compliance with the applicable energy conservation standard and to make representations about the energy use or efficiency of the covered equipment. The granting of a waiver or interim waiver by DOE does not exempt such basic models from any other regulatory requirement contained in this part or the certification and compliance requirements of 10 CFR part 429 and specifies an alternative method for testing the basic model(s) addressed in the waiver.
(1) Any interested person may submit a petition to waive for a particular basic model the requirements of any uniform test method contained in this part, upon the grounds that either the basic model contains one or more design characteristics that prevent testing of the basic model according to the prescribed test procedures or cause the prescribed test procedures to evaluate the basic model in a manner so unrepresentative of its true energy or water consumption characteristics as to provide materially inaccurate comparative data.
(2) Manufacturers of basic model(s) subject to a waiver or interim waiver are responsible for complying with the other requirements of this part and with the requirements of 10 CFR part 429 regardless of the person that originally submitted the petition for waiver and/or interim waiver. The filing of a petition for waiver and/or interim waiver shall not constitute grounds for noncompliance with any requirements of this part.
(3) All correspondence regarding waivers and interim waivers must be submitted to DOE either electronically to
AS_Waiver_Requests@ee.doe.gov
(preferred method of transmittal) or by mail to U.S. Department of Energy, Building Technologies Program, Test Procedure Waiver, 1000 Independence Avenue SW., Mailstop EE-5B, Washington, DC 20585-0121.
(b)
Petition content and publication.
(1) Each petition for interim waiver and waiver must:
(i) Identify the particular basic model(s) for which a waiver is requested, each brand name under which the identified basic model(s) will be distributed in commerce, the design characteristic(s) constituting the grounds for the petition, and the specific requirements sought to be waived, and must discuss in detail the need for the requested waiver;
(ii) Identify manufacturers of all other basic models distributed in commerce in the United States and known to the petitioner to incorporate design characteristic(s) similar to those found in the basic model that is the subject of the petition;
(iii) Include any alternate test procedures known to the petitioner to evaluate the performance of the equipment type in a manner representative of the energy and/or water consumption characteristics of the basic model; and
(iv) Be signed by the petitioner or an authorized representative. In accordance with the provisions set forth in 10 CFR 1004.11, any request for confidential treatment of any information contained in a petition or in supporting documentation must be accompanied by a copy of the petition, application or supporting documentation from which the information claimed to be confidential has been deleted. DOE will publish in the
Federal Register
the petition and supporting documents from which confidential information, as determined by DOE, has been deleted in accordance with 10 CFR 1004.11 and will solicit comments, data and information with respect to the determination of the petition.
(2) In addition to the requirements in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, each petition for interim waiver must reference the related petition for waiver, demonstrate likely success of the petition for waiver, and address what economic hardship and/or competitive disadvantage is likely to result absent a favorable determination on the petition for interim waiver.
(c)
Notification to other manufacturers.
(1) Each petitioner for interim waiver must, upon publication of a grant of an interim waiver in the
Federal Register,
notify in writing all known manufacturers of domestically marketed basic models of the same equipment class (as specified in the relevant subpart of 10 CFR part 431), and of other equipment classes known to the petitioner to use the technology or have the characteristic at issue in the waiver. The notice must include a statement that DOE has published the interim waiver and petition for waiver in the
Federal Register
and the date the petition for waiver was published. The notice must also include a statement that DOE will receive and consider timely written comments on the petition for waiver. Within five working days, each petitioner must file with DOE a statement certifying the names and addresses of each person to whom a notice of the petition for waiver has been sent.
(2) If a petitioner does not request an interim waiver and notification has not been provided pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section, each petitioner, after filing a petition for waiver with DOE, and after the petition for waiver has been published in the
Federal Register,
must, within five working days of such publication, notify in writing all known manufacturers of domestically marketed basic models of the same equipment class (as listed in the relevant subpart of 10 CFR part 431), and of other equipment classes known to the petitioner to use the technology or have the characteristic at issue in the waiver. The notice must include a statement that DOE has published the petition in the
Federal Register
and the date the petition for waiver was published. Within five working days of the publication of the petition in the
Federal Register,
each petitioner must file with DOE a statement certifying the names and addresses of each person to whom a notice of the petition for waiver has been sent.
(d)
Public comment and rebuttal.
(1) Any person submitting written comments to DOE with respect to an interim waiver must also send a copy of the comments to the petitioner by the deadline specified in the notice.
(2) Any person submitting written comments to DOE with respect to a petition for waiver must also send a copy of such comments to the petitioner.
(3) A petitioner may, within 10 working days of the close of the comment period specified in the
Federal Register,
submit a rebuttal statement to DOE. A petitioner may rebut more than one comment in a single rebuttal statement.
(e)
Provisions specific to interim waivers.
(1) DOE will post a petition for interim waiver on its website within 5 business days of receipt of a complete petition. DOE will make best efforts to
review a petition for interim waiver within 90 business days of receipt of a complete petition.
(2) A petition for interim waiver that does not meet the content requirements of paragraph (b) of this section will be considered incomplete. DOE will notify the petitioner of an incomplete petition via email.
(3) DOE will grant an interim waiver from the test procedure requirements if it appears likely that the petition for waiver will be granted and/or if DOE determines that it would be desirable for public policy reasons to grant immediate relief pending a determination on the petition for waiver. Notice of DOE's determination on the petition for interim waiver will be published in the
Federal Register
.
