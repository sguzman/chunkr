(3) For new enrollments beginning on or after July 1, 1993, when a course is offered in residence on a standard quarter- or semester-hour basis by an educational institution which is not an institution of higher learning, VA also will measure on a credit-hour basis as provided in § 21.7670 a reservist's enrollment in a course not leading to a standard college degree, provided that the educational institution requires at least the same number of clock-hours of attendance as required in paragraph (c) of this section. If the educational institution does not require at least the same number of clock-hours of attendance as required in paragraph (c) of this section, VA will not apply the provisions of § 21.7670, but will measure the course according to paragraph (c) of this section.
(4) VA will apply the provisions of § 21.4272(g) to new enrollments beginning on or after July 1, 1993, if one or more of the reservist's courses are offered during a nonstandard term.
(Authority: 10 U.S.C. 16136(b); 38 U.S.C. 3688(a)(7))
(c)
Clock-hour measurement.
The provisions of this paragraph apply to all enrollments in courses not leading to a standard college degree. If VA concludes that the courses in which a reservist is enrolled do not qualify for credit-hour measurement, VA shall measure those courses as follows. (Supervised study shall be excluded from measurement of all courses to which this paragraph applies).
(1) If shop practice is an integral part of the course—
(i) Full-time training shall be 22 clock hours attendance with not more than 2
1/2
hours rest period allowance;
(ii) Three-quarter-time training shall be 16 through 21 clock hours attendance with not more than 2 hours rest period allowance;
(iii) Half-time training shall be 11 through 15 clock hours attendance with
not more than 1
1/4
hours rest period allowance; and
(iv) One-quarter-time training shall be 1 through 10 clock hours attendance. For attendance of 6 through 10 clock hours, there shall be not more than one quarter hour rest period allowance. For attendance of 1 through 5 clock hours, there shall be no rest period allowance.
(2) If theory and class instruction predominates—
(i) Full-time training is 18 clock hours net instruction;
(ii) Three-quarter-time training is 13 through 17 clock hours net instruction;
(iii) Half-time training is 9 through 12 clock hours net instruction; and
(iv) Less than half-time training is 1 through 8 clock hours net instruction. In measuring net instruction for this paragraph there will be included customary intervals not to exceed 10 minutes between classes: however, supervised study must be excluded.

§ 21.7673
Measurement of concurrent enrollments.
(a)
Conversion of units of measurement required.
Where a reservist enrolls concurrently in courses offered by two schools and the standards for measurement of the courses pursued concurrently in the two schools are different, the Department of Veterans Affairs will measure the reservist's enrollment by converting the units of measurement for courses in the second school to their equivalent in units of measurement required for the courses in the program of education which the reservist is pursuing at the primary institution. This conversion will be accomplished as follows:
(1) If VA measures the course at the primary institution on a credit-hour basis (including a course which does not lead to a standard college degree, which is being measured on a credit-hour basis as provided in § 21.7672(b)), and VA measures the courses at the second school on a clock-hour basis, the clock hours will be converted to credit hours.
(2) If VA measures the courses pursued at the primary institution on a clock-hour basis, and VA measures the courses pursued at the second school on a credit-hour basis, including courses which qualify for credit-hour measurement on the basis of § 21.7672(b), VA will convert the credit hours to clock hours to determine the reservist's training time.
(Authority: 10 U.S.C. 16136(b); 38 U.S.C. 3688)
(b)
Conversion of clock hours to credit hours.
If the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section require the Department of Veteran Affairs to convert clock hours, it will do so by—
(1) Dividing the number of credit hours which the Department of Veterans Affairs considers to be full-time at the educational institution whose courses are measured on a credit-hour basis by the number of clock hours which are full-time at the educational institution whose courses are measured on a clock-hour basis; and
(2) Multiplying each clock hour of attendance by the decimal determined in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. The Department of Veterans Affairs will drop all fractional hours.
(Authority: 10 U.S.C. 16136(b), 38 U.S.C. 3688)
(c)
Conversion of credit hours to clock hours.
If the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section require the Department of Veterans Affairs to convert credit hours to clock hours, it will do so by—
(1) Dividing the number of clock hours which the Department of Veterans Affairs considers to be full-time at the educational institution whose courses are measured on a clock-hour basis by the number of credit hours which are full-time at the educational institution whose courses are measured on a credit-hour basis; and
(2) Multiplying each credit hour by the number determined in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. The Department of Veterans Affairs will drop all fractional hours.
(Authority: 10 U.S.C. 16136(b), 38 U.S.C. 3688)
(d)
Standards for measurement the same.
If VA measures the courses pursued at both institutions on either a clock-hour basis or a credit-hour basis,
VA will measure the reservist's enrollment by adding together the units of measurement for the courses in the second school and the units of measurement for courses in the primary institution. The standard for full time will be the full-time standard for the courses at the primary institution.
(Authority: 10 U.S.C. 16136(b); 38 U.S.C. 3688)

§ 21.7674
Measurement of practical training courses.
(a)
Nursing courses.
(1) Courses for the objective of registered nurse or registered professional nurse will be measured on the basis of credit hours or clock hours of attendance, whichever is appropriate. The clock hours of attendance may include academic class time, clinical training, and supervised study periods.
(2) Courses offered by institutions of higher learning which lead to the objective of practical nurse, practical trained nurse, or licensed practical nurse will be measured on credit hours or clock hours of attendance per week whichever is appropriate.
(Authority: 10 U.S.C. 16136(b), 38 U.S.C. 3688; Pub. L. 98-525)
(b)
Medical and dental assistants courses for VA.
Programs approved in accordance with the provisions of § 21.7720(b)(9) will be measured on a clock-hour basis as provided in § 21.7672. However, the program will be regarded as full-time institutional training, provided the combined total of the classroom and other formal instruction portion of the program and the on-the-job portion of the program requires 30 or more clock hours of attendance per week.
(Authority: 10 U.S.C. 16136(b), 38 U.S.C. 3688; Pub. L. 98-525)
(c)
Other practical training courses.
These courses will be measured in semester hours of credit or clock hours of attendance per week, whichever is appropriate.

(2) For purposes of this subpart, the requirements for application of § 21.257(e)(1) and (2) are deemed met for an individual in a self-employment program regardless of whether the individual is described in § 21.257(b), if the individual has been determined by VA to have limitations affecting employability arising from the effects of the individual's spina bifida and/or other covered birth defect(s) which are so severe as to necessitate selection of self-employment as the only reasonably feasible vocational goal for the individual.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1804, 1814)
(c)
Requirements to receive employment services and assistance.
VA will provide employment services and assistance under paragraph (b) of this section only if the eligible child:
(1) Has achieved a vocational objective;
(2) Has voluntarily ceased vocational training under this subpart, but the case manager finds the child has attained sufficient skills to be employable; or
(3) VA determines during evaluation that the child already has the skills necessary for suitable employment and does not need additional training, but to secure suitable employment the child does need the employment assistance that paragraph (b) of this section describes.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1804, 1814)
(d)
Additional employment services and assistance.
If an eligible child has received employment assistance and becomes suitably employed, but VA later finds the child needs additional employment services and assistance, VA may provide the child with these services and assistance if, and to the extent, the child has remaining program entitlement.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1804, 1814)
(e)
Program entitlement usage
—(1)
Basic entitlement period.
An eligible child will be entitled to receive 24 months of full-time training, services, and assistance (including employment assistance) or the part-time equivalent, as part of a vocational training program.
(2)
Extension of basic entitlement period.
VA may extend the basic 24-month entitlement period, not to exceed another 24 months of full-time program participation, or the part-time equivalent, if VA determines that:
(i) The extension is necessary for the child to achieve a vocational goal identified before the end of the basic 24-month entitlement period; and
(ii) The child can achieve the vocational goal within the extended period.
(3)
Principles for charging entitlement.
VA will charge entitlement usage for training, services, or assistance (but not the initial evaluation, as described in § 21.8032) furnished to an eligible child under this subpart on the same basis as VA would charge for similar training, services, or assistance furnished a veteran in a vocational rehabilitation program under 38 U.S.C. chapter 31. VA may charge entitlement at a half-time, three-quarter-time, or full-time rate based upon the child's training time using the rate-of-pursuit criteria in § 21.8310. The provisions concerning reduced work tolerance under § 21.312, and those relating to less-than-half-time training under § 21.314, do not apply under this subpart.

§ 21.8022
Entry and reentry.
(a)
Date of program entry.
VA may not enter a child into a vocational training program or provide an evaluation or any training, services, or assistance under this subpart before the date VA
first receives an application for a vocational training program filed in accordance with § 21.8014.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1151 note, 1804, 1811, 1811 note, 1812, 1814)
(b)
Reentry.
If an eligible child interrupts or ends pursuit of a vocational training program and VA subsequently allows the child to reenter the program, the date of reentrance will accord with the facts, but may not precede the date VA receives an application for the reentrance.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1804, 1814, 1832)

Basic duration of a vocational training program.
The duration of a vocational training program, as paragraphs (e)(1) and (e)(2) of § 21.8020 provide, may not exceed 24 months of full-time training, services, and assistance or the part-time equivalent, except as § 21.8072 allows.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1804(d), 1814)
(b)
Responsibility for estimating the duration of a vocational training program.
While preparing the individualized written plan of vocational rehabilitation, the CP or VRC will estimate the time the child needs to complete a vocational training program.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1804(c), 1814)
(c)
Duration and scope of training must meet general requirements for entry into the selected occupation.
The child will receive training, services, and assistance, as § 21.8120 describes, for a period that VA determines the child needs to reach the level employers generally recognize as necessary for entry into employment in a suitable occupational objective.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1804(c), 1814)
(d)
Approval of training beyond the entry level.
To qualify for employment in a particular occupation, the child may need training that exceeds the amount a person generally needs for employment in that occupation. VA will provide the necessary additional training under one or more of the following conditions:
(1) Training requirements for employment in the child's vocational goal in the area where the child lives or will seek employment exceed those job seekers generally need for that type of employment;
(2) The child is preparing for a type of employment in which he or she will be at a definite disadvantage in competing with nondisabled persons and the additional training will offset the competitive disadvantage;
(3) The choice of a feasible occupation is limited, and additional training will enhance the child's employability in one of the feasible occupations; or
(4) The number of employment opportunities within a feasible occupation is restricted.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1804(c), 1814)
(e)
Estimating the duration of the training period.
In estimating the length of the training period the eligible child
needs, the CP or VRC must determine that:
(1) The proposed vocational training would not normally require a person without a disability more than 24 months of full-time pursuit, or the part-time equivalent, for successful completion; and
(2) The program of training and other services the child needs, based upon VA's evaluation, will not exceed 24 months or the part-time equivalent. In calculating the proposed program's length, the CP or VRC will follow the procedures in § 21.8074(a).
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1804(d), 1814)
(f)
Required selection of an appropriate vocational goal.
If the total period the child would require for completion of an initial vocational training program in paragraph (e) of this section is more than 24 months, or the part-time equivalent, the CP or VRC must work with the child to select another suitable initial vocational goal.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1804(d)(2), 1814)
§ 21.8072
Authorizing training, services, and assistance beyond the initial individualized written plan of vocational rehabilitation.
(a)
Extension of the duration of a vocational training program.
VA may authorize an extension of a vocational training program when necessary to provide additional training, services, and assistance to enable the child to achieve the vocational or employment goal identified before the end of the child's basic entitlement period, as stated in the individualized written plan of vocational rehabilitation under § 21.8080. A change from one occupational objective to another in the same field or occupational family meets the criterion for prior identification in the individualized written plan of vocational rehabilitation.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1804(d)(2), (e)(2), 1814)
(b)
Extensions for prior participants in the program.
(1) Except as paragraph (b)(2) of this section provides, VA may authorize additional training, limited to the use of remaining program entitlement including any allowable extension, for an eligible child who previously participated in vocational training under this subpart. The additional training must:
(i) Be designed to enable the child to complete the prior vocational goal or a different vocational goal; and
(ii) Meet the same provisions as apply to training for new participants.
(2) An eligible child who has previously achieved a vocational goal in a vocational training program under this subpart may not receive additional training under paragraph (b)(1) of this section unless a CP or VRC sets aside the child's achievement of that vocational goal under § 21.8284.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1804(b) through (e), 1814)
(c)
Responsibility for authorizing a program extension.
A CP or VRC may approve extensions of the vocational training program the child is pursuing up to the maximum program limit of 48 months if the CP or VRC determines that the child needs the additional time to successfully complete training and obtain employment, and the following conditions are met:
(1) The child has completed more than half of the planned training; and
(2) The child is making satisfactory progress.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1804(d)(2), 1814)
§ 21.8074
Computing the period for vocational training program participation.
(a)
Computing the participation period.
To compute the number of months and days of an eligible child's participation in a vocational training program:
(1) Count the number of actual months and days of the child's:
(i) Pursuit of vocational education or training;
(ii) Receipt of extended evaluation-type services and training, or services and training to enable the child to prepare for vocational training or employment, if a veteran in a 38 U.S.C. chapter 31 program would have received a subsistence allowance while receiving the same type of services and training; and
(iii) Receipt of employment and post-employment services (any period of employment or post-employment services is considered full-time program pursuit).
(2) Do not count:
(i) The initial evaluation period;
(ii) Any period before the child enters a vocational training program under this subpart;
(iii) Days of authorized leave; and
(iv) Other periods during which the child does not pursue training, such as periods between terms.
(3) Convert part-time training periods to full-time equivalents.
(4) Total the months and days under paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(3) of this section. This sum is the period of the child's participation in the program.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1804(d), 1814)
(b)
Consistency with principles for charging entitlement.
Computation of the program participation period under this section will be consistent with the principles for charging entitlement under § 21.8020.

# Individualized Written Plan of Vocational Rehabilitation
§ 21.8080
Requirement for an individualized written plan of vocational rehabilitation.
(a)
General.
A CP or VRC will work in consultation with each child for whom a vocational goal is feasible to develop an individualized written plan of vocational rehabilitation services and assistance to meet the child's vocational training needs. The CP or VRC will develop this individualized written plan of vocational rehabilitation in a manner comparable to the rules governing the development of an individualized written rehabilitation plan (IWRP) for a veteran for 38 U.S.C. chapter 31 purposes, as §§ 21.80, 21.84, 21.88, 21.90, 21.92, 21.94 (a) through (d), and 21.96 provide.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1804(b), 1814)
(b)
Selecting the type of training to include in the individualized written plan of vocational rehabilitation.
If training is necessary, the CP or VRC will explore a range of possibilities, to include paid and unpaid on-job training, institutional training, and a combination of on-job and institutional training to accomplish the goals of the program. Generally, an eligible child's program should include on-job training, or a combination of on-job and institutional training, when this training:
(1) Is available;
(2) Is as suitable as using only institutional training for accomplishing the goals of the program; and
(3) Will meet the child's vocational training program needs.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1804(b), (c), 1814)
§ 21.8082
Inability of child to complete individualized written plan of vocational rehabilitation or achieve vocational goal.
(a)
Inability to timely complete an individualized written plan of vocational rehabilitation or achieve identified goal.
After a vocational training program has begun, the VR
E case manager may determine that the eligible child cannot complete the vocational training program described in the child's individualized written plan of vocational rehabilitation within the time limits of the individualized written plan of vocational rehabilitation or cannot achieve the child's identified vocational goal. Subject to paragraph (b) of this section, VR
E may assist the child in revising or selecting a new individualized written plan of vocational rehabilitation or goal.
(b)
Allowable changes in the individualized written plan of vocational rehabilitation or goal.
Any change in the eligible child's individualized written plan of vocational rehabilitation or vocational goal is subject to the child's continuing eligibility under the vocational training program and the provisions governing duration of a vocational training program in §§ 21.8020(e) and 21.8070 through 21.8074.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1804(d), 1804(e), 1814)
(c)
Change in the individualized written plan of vocational rehabilitation or vocational goal.
(1) The individualized written plan of vocational rehabilitation or vocational goal may be changed under the same conditions as provided for a veteran under § 21.94 (a) through (d), and subject to § 21.8070 (d) through (f), if:
(i) The CP or VRC determines that achievement of a vocational goal is still reasonably feasible and that the
new individualized written plan of vocational rehabilitation or goal is necessary to enable the eligible child to prepare for and participate in vocational training or employment; and
(ii) Reentrance is authorized under § 21.8284 in a case when the child has completed a vocational training program under this subpart.
(2) A CP or VRC may approve a change of vocational goal from one field or occupational family to another field or occupational family if the child can achieve the new goal:
(i) Before the end of the basic 24-month entitlement period that § 21.8020(e)(1) describes; or
(ii) Before the end of any allowable extension under §§ 21.8020(e)(2) and 21.8072 if the new vocational goal in another field or occupational family was identified during the basic 24-month entitlement period.
(3) A change from one occupational objective to another in the same field or occupational family does not change the planned vocational goal.
(4) The child must have sufficient remaining entitlement to pursue the new individualized written plan of vocational rehabilitation or goal, as § 21.8020 provides.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1804(d), 1814)
(d)
Assistance if child terminates planned program before completion.
If the eligible child elects to terminate the planned vocational training program, he or she will receive the assistance that § 21.80(d) provides in identifying other resources through which to secure the desired training or employment.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1804(c), 1814)

# Counseling
§ 21.8100
Counseling.
An eligible child requesting or receiving services and assistance under this subpart will receive professional counseling by VR
E and other qualified VA staff members, and by contract counseling providers, as necessary, in a manner comparable to VA's provision of these services to veterans under the 38 U.S.C. chapter 31 program, as §§ 21.100 and 21.380 provide.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1803(c)(8), 1804(c), 1814)

# Vocational Training, Services, and Assistance
§ 21.8120
Vocational training, services, and assistance.
(a)
Purposes.
An eligible child may receive training, services, and assistance to enable the child to prepare for and participate in vocational training or employment.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1804(b), (c), 1814)
(b)
Training permitted.
VA and the child will select vocationally oriented courses of study and training, completion of which usually results in a diploma, certificate, degree, qualification for licensure, or direct placement in employment. The educational and training services to be provided include:
(1) Remedial, deficiency, and refresher training; and
(2) Training that leads to an identifiable vocational goal. Under this program, VA may authorize all forms of programs that §§ 21.122 through 21.132 describe. This includes education and training programs in institutions of higher education. VA may authorize the education and training at an undergraduate or graduate degree level, only if the degree program is predominantly vocational in nature. For an eligible child to participate in a graduate degree program, the graduate degree must be a requirement for entry into the child's vocational goal. For example, a master's degree is required to engage in social work. The program of training is predominantly vocational in content if the majority of the instruction provides the technical skills and knowledge employers generally regard as specific to, and required for, entry into the child's vocational goal.
(c)
Cost of education and training services.
The CP or VRC will consider the cost of training in selecting a facility when:
(1) There is more than one facility in the area in which the child resides that:
(i) Meets the requirements for approval under §§ 21.290 through 21.298 (except as provided by § 21.8286(b)),
(ii) Can provide the training, services and other supportive assistance the
child's individualized written plan of vocational rehabilitation specifies, and
(iii) Is within reasonable commuting distance; or
(2) The child wishes to train at a suitable facility in another area, even though a suitable facility in the area where the child lives can provide the training. In considering the costs of providing training in this case, VA will use the provisions of § 21.120 (except 21.120(a)(3)), § 21.370 (however, the words “under § 21.282” in § 21.370(b)(2)(iii)(B) do not apply), and § 21.372 in a manner comparable to that for veterans under the 38 U.S.C. chapter 31 program.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1804(b), (c), 1814)
(d)
Accessible courses not locally available.
If suitable vocational training courses are not available in the area in which the child lives, or if they are available but not accessible to the child, VA may make other arrangements. These arrangements may include, but are not limited to:
(1) Transportation of the child, but not the child's family, personal effects, or household belongings, to another area where necessary services are available; or
(2) Use of an individual instructor to provide necessary training in a manner comparable to that for veterans under the 38 U.S.C. chapter 31 program, as § 21.146 describes.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1804(b), (c), 1814)

§ 21.8282
Termination of a vocational training program.
A case manager may terminate a vocational training program under this subpart for cause, including lack of cooperation, failure to pursue the individualized written plan of vocational rehabilitation, fraud, administrative error, or finding that the child no longer has a covered birth defect. An eligible child for whom a vocational goal is reasonably feasible remains eligible for the program subject to the rules of this subpart unless the child's eligibility for or entitlement to a vocational training program under this subpart resulted from fraud or administrative error or unless VA finds the child no longer has a covered birth defect. The effective date of termination will be the earliest of the following applicable dates:
(a)
Fraud.
If an eligible child establishes eligibility for or entitlement to benefits under this subpart through fraud, VA will terminate the award of vocational training and rehabilitation as of the date VA first began to pay benefits.
(b)

(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3023, 3316)
§ 21.9560
Entitlement charges—for provisions effective before August 1, 2011.
For training that occurs before August 1, 2011—
(a)
Overview.
Except as provided in paragraphs (c) through (f) of this section, VA will base entitlement charges on the principle that an eligible individual who is paid educational assistance for one day of full-time pursuit
should be charged one day of entitlement.
(b)
Determining entitlement charge.
(1) VA will make a charge against entitlement as follows:
(i)
Full-time pursuit.
If the individual is pursuing a program of education on a full-time basis, the entitlement charge will be one of the following—
(A) During any period for which VA pays established charges to the institution of higher learning on the individual's behalf, the entitlement charge will be one day for each day of the certified enrollment period;
(B) During any period for which VA does not pay established charges to the institution of higher learning on the individual's behalf but pays a monthly housing allowance to the individual, the entitlement charge will be one day for each day of the certified enrollment period and/or interval period for which the individual receives the monthly housing allowance; or
(C) During any period for which VA does not pay established charges to the institution of higher learning on the individual's behalf or a monthly housing allowance to the individual but makes a lump sum payment to the individual for books, supplies, equipment, and other educational costs, VA will make an entitlement charge of 1 day for every $41.67 paid, with any remaining amount rounded to the nearest amount evenly divisible by $41.67.
(ii)
Less than full-time pursuit.
If the individual is pursuing a program of education on a less than a full-time basis, the entitlement charge will be one of the following—
(A) During any period for which VA pays established charges to the institution of higher learning on the individual's behalf, the individual will be charged a percentage of a day for each day of the certified enrollment period determined by dividing the number of course hours the individual is pursuing by the number of course hours required for full-time pursuit (rounded to the nearest hundredth);
(B) During any period for which VA does not pay established charges to the institution of higher learning on the individual's behalf but pays a monthly housing allowance to the individual, the individual will be charged a percentage of a day for each day of the certified enrollment period and/or interval period for which the individual receives the monthly housing allowance determined by dividing the number of course hours the individual is pursuing by the number of course hours required for full-time pursuit (rounded to the nearest hundredth); or
(C) During any period for which VA does not pay established charges to the institution of higher learning on the individual's behalf or a monthly housing allowance to the individual but makes a lump sum payment to the individual for books, supplies, equipment, and other educational costs, VA will make an entitlement charge of 1 day for every $41.67 paid, with any remaining amount rounded to the nearest amount evenly divisible by $41.67.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3313)
(2) If the individual changes his or her rate of pursuit after the beginning date of the award, VA will—
(i) Divide the certified enrollment period into separate periods of time so that the individual's rate of pursuit is constant within each period; and
(ii) Compute the rate of pursuit separately for each time period.
(c)
Individuals eligible for, or in receipt of, educational assistance other than that authorized under chapter 33.
If an individual elected 38 U.S.C. chapter 33 by relinquishing educational assistance under another program but receives educational assistance for a program of education that is approved under the relinquished chapter but not approved under 38 U.S.C. chapter 33, VA will make a charge against entitlement equivalent to the entitlement charge—
(1) That would be made under the provisions of § 21.7076, if the individual relinquished eligibility under 38 U.S.C. chapter 30;
(2) That would be made under the provisions of § 21.7576 if the individual relinquished eligibility under 10 U.S.C. chapter 1606; or
(3) That would be made under 10 U.S.C. chapter 1607 if the individual relinquished eligibility under 10 U.S.C. chapter 1607.

(ii) Did not receive credit or lost training time for any portion of the period of enrollment in the course or courses for which the eligible individual was pursuing to complete his or her approved educational, professional, or vocational objective as a result of having to discontinue pursuit.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3312(c))
(e)
Interruption to conserve entitlement.
An individual may not interrupt a certified period of enrollment for the purpose of conserving entitlement. An institution of higher learning may not certify a period of enrollment for a fractional part of the normal term, quarter, or semester if the individual is enrolled for the entire term, quarter, or semester. VA will make a charge against entitlement for the entire period of certified enrollment, if the individual is otherwise eligible for educational assistance, except when educational assistance is interrupted for any of the following conditions:
(1) Enrollment is terminated;
(2) The individual cancels his or her enrollment and does not negotiate a check or receive a direct deposit for educational assistance provided under this chapter for any part of the certified period of enrollment;
(3) The individual interrupts his or her enrollment at the end of any term, quarter, or semester within a certified period of enrollment and does not negotiate a check or receive a direct deposit for educational assistance provided under this chapter for the succeeding term, quarter, or semester; or
(4) The individual requests interruption or cancellation for any break when a school was closed during a certified period of enrollment, and VA continued payments under an established policy based upon an Executive Order of the President or an emergency situation regardless of whether or not the individual negotiated a check or received a direct deposit for educational assistance provided under this chapter for any part of the certified enrollment period.

(f)
Overpayment cases.
VA will make a charge against entitlement for an overpayment only if the overpayment is discharged in bankruptcy, is waived and not recovered, or is compromised.
(1) If the overpayment is discharged in bankruptcy or is waived and not recovered, the charge against entitlement will be the appropriate rate for the elapsed period covered by the overpayment (exclusive of interest, administrative costs of collection, court costs and marshal fees).
(2) If the overpayment is compromised and the compromise offer is less than the amount of interest, administrative costs of collection, court costs and marshal fees, the charge against entitlement will be at the appropriate rate for the elapsed period covered by the overpayment (exclusive of interest, administrative costs of collection, court costs and marshal fees).
(3) If the overpayment is compromised and the compromise offer is equal to or greater than the amount of interest, administrative costs of collection, court costs and marshal fees, the charge against entitlement will be determined by—
(i) Subtracting from the sum paid in the compromise offer the amount attributable to interest, administrative costs of collection, court costs and marshal fees;
(ii) Subtracting the remaining amount of the overpayment balances as determined in paragraph (f)(3)(i) of this section from the amount of the original overpayment (exclusive of interest, administrative costs of collection, course costs and marshal fees);

(6)
Payment for intervals and temporary school closings.
VA may authorize payment of the monthly housing allowance (as increased under §§ 21.9650(a) and 21.9655(a), if applicable) for an interval or for a temporary school closing that occurs within a certified enrollment period. If a school closing that is or may be temporary occurs during an interval, VA will apply any applicable provisions in paragraphs (b)(5)(i) through (b)(5)(v) of this section concerning intervals and in paragraph (5)(vi) of this section concerning temporary school closings. For the purposes of this paragraph, interval means a period without instruction between consecutive school terms, quarters, or semesters or a period without instruction between a summer term and a term, quarter, or semester. (See definitions of divisions of the school year in § 21.4200(b).)
(i)
Payment for intervals.
In determining whether a student will be paid for an interval, VA will first review the provisions of paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section. If none of the provisions apply, VA will review the provisions of paragraphs (b)(5)(iii), (iv), and (v) of this section to determine if payments may be made for the interval. In determining the length of a summer term, VA will disregard a fraction of a week consisting of 3 days or less, and will consider 4 days or more to be a full week.
(ii)
Restrictions on payment for intervals.
VA will make no payment for an interval if—
(A) The individual's rate of pursuit is one-half time or less on the last day of the certified enrollment period preceding the interval;
(B) The individual is on active duty;
(C) The individual requests, prior to authorization of an award or prior to negotiating a check or receiving a direct deposit for educational assistance, that no benefits be paid for the interval period;
(D) The individual's entitlement applicable to such payment will be exhausted by receipt of such payment, and it is to the advantage of the individual not to receive payment;
(E) The interval occurs between school years at a school that is not organized on a term, quarter, or semester basis; or
(F) The individual withdraws from all courses in the term, quarter, semester, or summer session preceding the interval, or discontinues training before the scheduled start of an interval in an institution of higher learning not organized on a term, quarter, or semester basis.
(iii)
Payment for intervals between periods of enrollment at different schools.
If the individual transfers from one approved school for the purpose of enrolling in and pursuing a similar program of education at the second school, VA may make payments for an interval that does not exceed 30 days. If the student does not enroll in a similar program of education at the second school, VA may not make payments for the interval.
(iv)
Payment for intervals that occur at the same school.
(A) If the individual remains enrolled at the same school, VA may make payment for an interval which does not exceed 8 weeks and which occurs between:
(
1
) Semesters or quarters,
(
2
) A semester or quarter and a term that is at least as long as the interval,
(
3
) A semester or quarter and a summer term that is at least as long as the interval,
(
4
) Consecutive terms (other than semesters or quarters) provided that both terms are at least as long as the interval, or
(
5
) A term and summer term provided that both the term and the summer term are at least as long as the interval.
(B) If the individual remains enrolled at the same school, VA may make payment for an interval that does not exceed 30 days and that occurs between summer sessions within a summer term.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3034(a), 3323(a), 3680)
(v)
Payment for intervals that occur between overlapping enrollments.
(A) If a student is enrolled in overlapping enrollment periods whether before or after an interval (either at the same or different schools), VA will determine whether the student is entitled to payment for the interval between the overlapping enrollment periods, and which dates the interval and enrollment periods will be considered to begin and end, as follows:
(
1
) By treating the ending date of each enrollment period as though it were the individual's last date of training before the interval,
(
2
) By treating the beginning date of each enrollment period as though it were the individual's first date of training after the interval,
(
3
) By examining the interval payment that would be made to the individual on the basis of the various combinations of beginning and ending dates, and
(
4
) By choosing the ending date and beginning date that result in the highest payment rate as the start and finish of the interval for VA measurement purposes.
(B) VA will not reduce the interval rate of payment as a result of training the individual may take during the interval, but VA will increase the interval rate of payment if warranted by such training.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3034(a), 3323(a), 3680(a))
(vi)
Payment for temporary school closings.
VA may authorize payment for temporary school closings that are due to emergencies (including strikes) or established policy based upon an Executive Order of the President. If a school closing that is or may be temporary occurs in whole or in part during an interval, VA will first review the provisions of paragraph (b)(5)(ii) through (v) of this section to determine if payment may be continued during the interval.
(A) If payment would not be inconsistent with the provisions of paragraph (b)(5)(ii) through (v) of this section, a determination to authorize payment for a period of a temporary school closing, or to not authorize payment if it appears that either the school closing will not be temporary or payment would not otherwise be in accord with this section, or both, will be made by:
(
1
) The Director of the VA Regional Processing Office of jurisdiction if:
(
i
) The reason for the school closing does not result in the closing of a school or schools in the jurisdiction of the Director of another VA Regional Processing Office, and
(
ii
) If the reason for the closing is a strike, and the strike lasts, or is anticipated to last, 30 days or less.
(
2
) The Director of Education Service if:
(
i
) The reason for the school closing results in the closing of schools in the jurisdiction of more than one Director of a VA Regional Processing Office, or
(
ii
) The reason for the closing is a strike, and the strike lasts, or is anticipated to last, more than 30 days.
(B) A school that disagrees with a decision made under paragraph (b)(5)(vi) of this section may request an administrative review. The review request must be submitted in writing and received by the Director of the VA Regional Processing Office of jurisdiction within one year of the date of VA's letter notifying the school of the decision. A review of the decision will include the evidence of record and any other pertinent evidence the school may wish to submit. The affirmation or reversal
of the initial decision based on an administrative review is final. The review will be conducted by the—
(
1
) Director, Education Service, if the Director of the VA Regional Processing Office of jurisdiction made the initial decision to continue or discontinue payments; or
(
2
) Under Secretary for Benefits, if the Director, Education Service, made the initial decision to continue or discontinue payments.

§ 21.9695
Overpayments.
(a)
Prevention of overpayments.
In administering educational assistance payable under 38 U.S.C. chapter 33, VA will apply the provisions of §§ 21.4008 and 21.4009 to eligible individuals and, when appropriate, to educational institutions.
(b)
Liability for overpayments.
(1) An overpayment of educational assistance paid to an eligible individual constitutes a liability of that individual unless—
(i) The overpayment was waived as provided in §§ 1.957 and 1.962 of this chapter, or
(ii) The overpayment results from an administrative error or an error in judgment. See § 21.9635(r).
(2) An overpayment of educational assistance paid to the educational institution on behalf of an eligible individual constitutes a liability of the individual unless the individual never attended the term, quarter, or semester certified by the educational institution. If the individual never attended the term, quarter, or semester certified by the educational institution, the institution must return to VA all educational assistance received under the provisions of 38 U.S.C. chapter 33 on behalf of the individual for such term, quarter, or semester.
(3)(i) The amount of the overpayment of educational assistance paid to the eligible individual, or paid to the educational institution on behalf of the individual, constitutes a liability of the educational institution if:
(A) VA determines that the overpayment is the result of willful or negligent false certification by the educational institution, or willful or negligent failure to certify excessive absences from a course, discontinuance of a course, or interruption of a course by the eligible individual.
(B) The student never attends classes for which he or she was certified (regardless of the reason for non-attendance);
(C) The student completely withdraws from all courses on or before the first day of the certified period of enrollment;
(D) The student dies during the term (see §§ 21.9635(a)(2) and 21.9636(a)(2));
(E) The educational institution receives a payment for the wrong student;
(F) The educational institution receives a duplicate payment for a student;
(G) The educational institution receives a payment in excess of the amount certified to VA on the enrollment certification; or
(H) The educational institution submits an amended enrollment certification to correctly report a reduced amount of tuition and fee charges, reduced Yellow Ribbon Program contributions, or reduced amounts for both tuition and fees and Yellow Ribbon Program contributions.
(ii) In determining whether an overpayment resulting from the actions listed in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section should be recovered from an educational institution, VA will apply the provisions of § 21.4009 (except paragraph (a)(1)) to overpayments of educational assistance under 38 U.S.C. chapter 33.
(4) VA will determine the amount of an overpayment as follows—
(i) For an individual who does not complete one or more courses in the certified period of enrollment for which he or she received payment, and who does not substantiate mitigating circumstances for not completing such course or courses, VA will establish an overpayment equal to the amount of educational assistance paid for the course or courses not completed during that certified period of enrollment.
(ii) For an individual who does not complete one or more courses in the
certified period of enrollment, but who substantiates mitigating circumstances for not completing such course or courses, VA will prorate the amount of educational assistance to which he or she is entitled.
(A) VA will determine the prorated amount of the tuition and fees by dividing the amount the individual was paid for the course or courses not completed by the number of days in the certified enrollment period, and multiplying the result by the number of days from the beginning date of the enrollment period through the last date of attendance. The result of this calculation will equal the amount the individual is due. The difference between the amount of educational assistance paid and the amount of educational assistance the individual is due for the course or courses not completed will be established as an overpayment.
(B) VA will determine the prorated amount of the monthly housing allowance by determining the amount the individual was entitled to while enrolled and subtracting that amount from the total amount paid. The difference between the amount of the monthly housing allowance paid and the amount of the monthly housing allowance the individual is due will be established as an overpayment.
(C) Individuals who have substantiated mitigating circumstances will not be charged an overpayment for the lump sum payment for books, supplies, equipment, and other educational costs (“book stipend”).
(c)
Authority.

(7) Provide the maximum amount of contributions payable toward the unmet tuition and fees to all participating individuals during each term, quarter, or semester the individual is enrolled if the IHL's total contribution toward the individual's unmet tuition and fees for the term, quarter, or semester, do not exceed the maximum dollar amount payable during the academic year as specified in paragraph (d)(6) of this section.
(e)
Centralized Agreements.
IHLs with multiple campuses may enter into a single Yellow Ribbon Program Agreement if all participating branches and extensions—
(1) Are listed in the agreement;
(2) Are subject to the authority of the authorizing official signing the Yellow Ribbon Program Agreement; and
(3) Have a certifying official or other employee who meets the requirements of § 21.4266(f)(3)(ii) and who has access to the terms of the Yellow Ribbon Program Agreement.
(f)
Matching Contributions.
VA will match each dollar provided by the IHL on behalf of an individual; however, the combined amount of contributions under the Yellow Ribbon Program may not exceed the remaining amount of tuition and fees not covered under paragraphs (b) and (c) of § 21.9640 and paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of § 21.9641.
(g)

In determining the amount of the reporting fee payable to institutions of higher learning for furnishing required reports, VA will apply the provisions of § 21.4206 in the same manner as they are applied in the administration of 38 U.S.C. chapter 36.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3034(a), 3323(a), 3684)

# Course Assessment
§ 21.9750
Course measurement.
VA will calculate an individual's rate of pursuit of an approved program of education during the individual's period of enrollment in accordance with this section. For the purpose of this chapter, VA will consider any rate of pursuit higher than 50 percent to be more than one-half time training.
(a)
Measurement of courses reported in credit hours.
If the courses are measured in credit hours, then the number of credit hours the individual is taking in a term, quarter, or semester will be divided by the minimum number of credit hours considered to be full-time pursuit in a term, quarter, or semester at the educational institution as provided in paragraph (c) of this section. The resulting percentage will be the individual's rate of pursuit.
(b)
Measurement of courses reported in clock hours at IHLs.
(1) If the courses pursued at an IHL are measured in clock hours, VA will convert the clock hours to equivalent credit hours by—
(i) Adding the total number of clock hours pursued during the term, quarter or semester;
(ii) Dividing the sum of paragraph (b)(1) of this section by the total number of weeks in the term; and
(iii) Multiplying the result of paragraph (b)(2) of this section rounded to the nearest 100th by—
(A) If the educational institution measures courses using both credit and clock hours, the decimal determined by dividing the number of credit hours considered full-time at the educational institution by the number of clock hours considered full-time at the educational institution.
(B) If the educational institution only measures courses using clock hours, the decimal determined by dividing 14 credit hours by the number of clock hours considered full-time at the educational institution.
(2) Divide the result of paragraph (b)(1) rounded to the nearest hundredth by the minimum number of credit hours considered to be full-time pursuit in a term, quarter, or semester as provided in paragraph (c) of this section. The resulting percentage will be the individual's rate of pursuit.
(c) Fourteen credit hours are full-time unless the institution of higher learning certifies that all undergraduate students enrolled for 13 credit hours, or for 12 credit hours, are charged full-time tuition or are considered full-time for other administrative purposes.
(d)
High school courses.
If an individual using transferred entitlement is eligible for pursuit of a secondary school diploma or equivalency certificate, VA will determine the rate of pursuit in accordance with this paragraph. For individuals pursuing high school courses measured in—
(1) Credit hours, VA will use the formula in paragraph (a) of this section.
(2) Clock hours, VA will use the formula in paragraph (b) of this section.
(3) Units, VA will convert the units to credit hours as follows—
(i) Divide the total number of units required for the program of education by 4 (the number of ordinary school years generally required for completion);
(ii) Round the result of paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section to the nearest whole number.
(iii) Multiply the result of paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section by:
(A) 1.0 to determine the number of units required for a rate of pursuit equal to 100 percent. This number is equivalent to 14 credit hours;
(B) .75 to determine the number of units required for a rate of pursuit equal to 75 percent. An individual will be considered to be enrolled in 10.5 credit hours for any number of units equal to or greater than the number determined in this paragraph but less than the number determined in paragraph (d)(3)(iii)(A) of this section;
(C) .50 to determine the number of units required for a rate of pursuit equal to 50 percent. An individual will be considered to be enrolled in 7 credit hours for any number of units equal to or greater than the number determined in this paragraph but less than the number determined in paragraph (d)(3)(iii)(B) of this section;
(D) .25 to determine the number of units required for a rate of pursuit equal to 25 percent. An individual will be considered to be enrolled in 3.5 credit hours for any number of units up to the number determined in paragraph (d)(3)(iii)(C) of this section.

# Approval of Programs of Education
§ 21.9765
Program of education approval.
VA may provide educational assistance for pursuit of a program of education offered by an educational institution if that program of education is approved under 38 U.S.C. chapter 30 in accordance with §§ 21.7220 and 21.7222.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3034(a), 3313(b), 3323(a))

An assurance of compliance with these Title IX regulations shall not be satisfactory to the designated agency official if the applicant or recipient to whom such assurance applies fails to commit itself to take whatever remedial action is necessary in accordance with § 23.110(a) to eliminate existing discrimination on the basis of sex or to eliminate the effects of past discrimination whether occurring prior to or subsequent to the submission to the designated agency official of such assurance.

Form.

(2) The designated agency official will specify the extent to which such assurances will be required of the applicant's or recipient's subgrantees, contractors, subcontractors, transferees, or successors in interest.
§ 23.120
Transfers of property.
If a recipient sells or otherwise transfers property financed in whole or in part with Federal financial assistance to a transferee that operates any education program or activity, and the Federal share of the fair market value of the property is not upon such sale or transfer properly accounted for to the Federal Government, both the transferor and the transferee shall be deemed to be recipients, subject to the provisions of §§ 23.205 through 23.235(a).
§ 23.125
Effect of other requirements.
(a)
Effect of other Federal provisions.
The obligations imposed by these Title IX regulations are independent of, and do not alter, obligations not to discriminate on the basis of sex imposed by Executive Order 11246, 3 CFR, 1964-1965 Comp., p. 339; as amended by Executive Order 11375, 3 CFR, 1966-1970 Comp., p. 684; as amended by Executive Order 11478, 3 CFR, 1966-1970 Comp., p. 803; as amended by Executive Order 12087, 3 CFR, 1978 Comp., p. 230; as amended by Executive Order 12107, 3 CFR, 1978 Comp., p. 264; sections 704 and 855 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 295m, 298b-2); Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000e
et seq.
); the Equal Pay Act of 1963 (29 U.S.C. 206); and any other Act of Congress or Federal regulation.
(b)
Effect of State or local law or other requirements.
The obligation to comply with these Title IX regulations is not obviated or alleviated by any State or local law or other requirement that would render any applicant or student ineligible, or limit the eligibility of any applicant or student, on the basis of sex, to practice any occupation or profession.
(c)
Effect of rules or regulations of private organizations.
The obligation to comply with these Title IX regulations is not obviated or alleviated by any rule or regulation of any organization, club, athletic or other league, or association that would render any applicant or student ineligible to participate or limit the eligibility or participation of any applicant or student, on the basis of sex, in any education program or activity operated by a recipient and that receives Federal financial assistance.
§ 23.130
Effect of employment opportunities.
The obligation to comply with these Title IX regulations is not obviated or alleviated because employment opportunities in any occupation or profession are or may be more limited for members of one sex than for members of the other sex.

(a)
Designation of responsible employee.
Each recipient shall designate at least one employee to coordinate its efforts to comply with and carry out its responsibilities under these Title IX regulations, including any investigation of any complaint communicated to such recipient alleging its noncompliance with these Title IX regulations or alleging any actions that would be prohibited by these Title IX regulations.

Such notification shall contain such information, and be made in such manner, as the designated agency official finds necessary to apprise such persons of the protections against discrimination assured them by Title IX and these Title IX regulations, but shall state at least that the requirement not to discriminate in education programs or activities extends to employment therein, and to admission thereto unless §§ 23.300 through 23.310 do not apply to the recipient, and that inquiries concerning the application of Title IX and these Title IX regulations to such recipient may be referred to the employee designated pursuant to § 23.135, or to the designated agency official.
(2) Each recipient shall make the initial notification required by paragraph (a)(1) of this section within 90 days of September 29, 2000 or of the date these Title IX regulations first apply to such recipient, whichever comes later, which notification shall include publication in:

(d)
Adjustment period.
A recipient that operates or sponsors interscholastic, intercollegiate, club, or intramural athletics at the elementary school level shall comply fully with this section as expeditiously as possible but in no event later than one year from September 29, 2000.

In the case of a recipient that does not maintain a leave policy for its employees, or in the case of an employee with insufficient leave or accrued employment time to qualify for leave under such a policy, a recipient shall treat pregnancy, childbirth, false pregnancy, termination of pregnancy, and recovery therefrom as a justification for a leave of absence without pay for a reasonable period of time, at the conclusion of which the employee shall be reinstated to the status that she held when the leave began or to a comparable position, without decrease in rate of compensation or loss of promotional opportunities, or any other right or privilege of employment.
§ 23.535
Effect of state or local law or other requirements.
(a)
Prohibitory requirements.
The obligation to comply with §§ 23.500 through 23.550 is not obviated or alleviated by the existence of any State or local law or other requirement that imposes prohibitions or limits upon employment of members of one sex that are not imposed upon members of the other sex.
(b)
Benefits.
A recipient that provides any compensation, service, or benefit to members of one sex pursuant to a State or local law or other requirement shall provide the same compensation,
service, or benefit to members of the other sex.
§ 23.540
Advertising.
A recipient shall not in any advertising related to employment indicate preference, limitation, specification, or discrimination based on sex unless sex is a bona fide occupational qualification for the particular job in question.
§ 23.545
Pre-employment inquiries.
(a)
Marital status.
A recipient shall not make pre-employment inquiry as to the marital status of an applicant for employment, including whether such applicant is “Miss” or “Mrs.”
(b)
Sex.
A recipient may make pre-employment inquiry as to the sex of an applicant for employment, but only if such inquiry is made equally of such applicants of both sexes and if the results of such inquiry are not used in connection with discrimination prohibited by these Title IX regulations.
§ 23.550
Sex as a bona fide occupational qualification.
A recipient may take action otherwise prohibited by §§ 23.500 through 23.550 provided it is shown that sex is a bona fide occupational qualification for that action, such that consideration of sex with regard to such action is essential to successful operation of the employment function concerned. A recipient shall not take action pursuant to this section that is based upon alleged comparative employment characteristics or stereotyped characterizations of one or the other sex, or upon preference based on sex of the recipient, employees, students, or other persons, but nothing contained in this section shall prevent a recipient from considering an employee's sex in relation to employment in a locker room or toilet facility used only by members of one sex.

(6)
Land acquisition for development.
Prior to the Secretary's acceptance of custody and accountability (for Federal lands), or acceptance of offer to donate or contract for purchase (for private lands).
(c) Where emergency circumstances make it necessary to take an action with significant environmental impact without observing the provisions of these regulations, VA must act in accordance with CEQ Regulations, 40 CFR 1506.11.
(Authority: 42 U.S.C. 4321-4370a)
[51 FR 37182, Oct. 20, 1986, as amended at 54 FR 34987, Aug. 23, 1989]
§ 26.8
Assistance to applicants.
(a) The CEQ Regulations (40 CFR 1501.2(d)) provide for advising of private applicants or other non-Federal groups when VA involvement in a particular action is reasonably foreseeable. Such foreseeable actions involve application to a VA element by private persons, States, and local agencies and pertain primarily to permits, leases, requests for financial assistance, grants, and related actions involving the use of VA real property.

(d) When VA owned land is leased or otherwise provided to non-VA groups, VA element affected will initiate the NEPA process pursuant to these regulations.
(e) When VA grant funds are requested by a State agency, VA element affected will initiate the NEPA process and ensure compliance with VA environmental program. The environmental documents prepared by the grant applicant shall assure full compliance with State and local regulations as well as NEPA before the proposed action is approved.
(Authority: 42 U.S.C. 4321-4370a)
§ 26.9
Information on and public participation in VA environmental process.
(a) During the preparation of environmental documents, the responsible VA element shall include the participation of environmental agencies, applicants, State and local governments and the public to the extent practicable and in conformance with CEQ Regulations.

# general provisions
§ 36.4203
Eligibility of the veteran for the manufactured home loan benefit under 38 U.S.C. 3712.
(a) To be eligible for the manufactured home loan benefit a veteran must have loan guaranty entitlement for manufactured home purposes available for use. Notwithstanding the provisions of § 36.4205(e), the Secretary may exclude the amount of guaranty entitlement used for any guaranteed manufactured home loan provided:
(1) The property which served as security for the loan has been disposed of by the veteran, or has been destroyed by fire or other natural hazard; and
(2)(i) The loan has been repaid in full or the Secretary has been released from liability as to the loan, or if the Secretary has suffered a loss on said loan, such loss has been paid in full; or
(ii) A veteran-transferee has agreed to assume the outstanding balance on the loan and consented to the use of his or her entitlement to the extent the entitlement of the veteran-transferor had been used originally, and the veteran-transferee otherwise meets the requirements of 38 U.S.C. chapter 37.
(3) In a case in which the veteran still owns a property purchased with a VA-guaranteed loan, the Secretary may, one time only, restore entitlement if:
(i) The loan has been repaid in full, or, if the Secretary has suffered a loss on the loan, the loss has been paid in full; or
(ii) The Secretary has been released from liability as to the loan and, if the Secretary has suffered a loss on the loan, the loss has been paid in full.
(4) The Secretary may, in any case involving circumstances deemed appropriate, waive either or both of the requirements set forth in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2)(i) of this section.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3702, 3712)
The Secretary may, in any case involving circumstances deemed appropriate, waive either or both of the requirements set forth in paragraph (a)(1) or (2) of this section.
(b) A veteran may use his or her remaining home loan guaranty entitlement for any purpose authorized by 38 U.S.C. 3710, 3711, or 3712 except that a veteran who has purchased a manufactured home unit may not purchase a second manufactured home unit until the unit which secured the first loan has been disposed of by the veteran or has been destroyed by fire or other natural hazard.
(c) The available entitlement of a veteran will be determined by the Secretary as of the date of receipt of an application for guaranty of a manufactured home loan or loan report. Such date of receipt shall be the date the application or loan report is date stamped into the Department of Veterans Affairs. Eligibility derived from the most recent period of service (1) shall cancel any unused entitlement derived from any earlier period of service, and (2) shall be reduced by the amount by which entitlement from service during any earlier period has been used to obtain a direct, guaranteed, or insured loan:
(i) On property which the veteran owns at the time of application; or
(ii) As to which the Secretary has incurred actual liability or loss, unless in the event of loss or the incurrence and payment of such liability by the Secretary the resulting indebtedness of the veteran to the United States has been paid in full.
Provided,
That if the Secretary issues or has issued a certificate of commitment covering the loan described in the application for guaranty or in the loan report, the amount and percentage of guaranty contemplated by the certificate of commitment shall not be subject to reduction if the loan has been or is closed on a date which is not later than the expiration date of the certificate of commitment, notwithstanding that the Secretary in the meantime and prior to the issuance of the evidence of guaranty shall have incurred actual liability or loss on a direct, guaranteed, or insured loan previously obtained by the borrower. For the purposes of this paragraph, the Secretary will be deemed to have incurred actual loss on a guaranteed or insured loan if the Secretary has paid a guaranty or insurance claim thereon and the veteran's resultant indebtedness to the Government has not been paid in full, and to have incurred actual liability on
a guaranteed or insured loan if the Secretary is in receipt of a claim on the guaranty or insurance or is in receipt of a notice of default. In the case of a direct loan, the Secretary will be deemed to have incurred an actual loss if the loan is in default.

(b) Subject to the provisions of paragraph (c) of § 36.4203, the following formulas will determine the amount of guaranty entitlement which remains available to an eligible veteran after prior use of entitlement:
(1) If a veteran previously secured a nonrealty (business) loan, the amount of nonrealty entitlement used is doubled and subtracted from $36,000. The sum remaining is the amount of available entitlement for use not to exceed $20,000 for manufactured home purposes.
(2) If a veteran previously secured a realty (home) loan, the amount of realty (home) loan entitlement used is subtracted from $36,000. The sum remaining is the amount of available entitlement for use not to exceed $20,000 for manufactured home purposes.
(3) If a veteran previously secured a manufactured home loan, the amount of entitlement used for manufactured home purposes is subtracted from $36,000. The sum remaining is the amount of available entitlement for use for home loan purposes only. To determine the amount of additional entitlement available for manufactured home purposes, the amount of entitlement previously used for manufactured home purposes is subtracted from $20,000. Except for manufactured home loans to be obtained pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 3712(a)(1)(F) or (G), the sum remaining is the amount of available entitlement for use for manufactured home purposes.
(c) For the purpose of computing the remaining guaranty benefit to which a veteran is entitled, manufactured home and manufactured home lot loans guaranteed prior to October 1, 1978, shall be taken into consideration as if made subsequent thereto, and the veteran's entitlement will be reduced by the amount of the Secretary's guaranty issued in the particular loan transaction.
(d) A guaranty is reduced or increased pro rata with any deduction or increase in the amount of the guaranteed indebtedness, but in no event will the amount payable on a guaranty exceed the amount of the original guaranty or the percentage of the indebtedness corresponding to that of the original guaranty.
(e) The amount of any guaranty for a manufactured home or manufactured home lot loan shall be charged against the original or remainder of the borrower's guaranty benefit available for manufactured home purposes. Complete or partial liquidation, by payment or otherwise, of the veteran's guaranteed indebtedness does not increase the remainder of the guaranty benefit, if any, otherwise available to the veteran. When the maximum guaranty available legally to a veteran for manufactured home purposes shall have been granted, no further guaranty for manufactured home purposes shall be available to the veteran.
(f)(1) The amount of guaranty entitlement, available and unused, of an eligible unremarried surviving spouse (whose eligibility does not result from his or her own service) is determinable in the same manner as in the case of any veteran, and any entitlement which the decedent (who was his or her spouse) used shall be disregarded. A certificate as to the eligibility of such surviving spouse, issued by the Secretary, shall be a condition precedent to the guaranty or insurance of any loan made to a surviving spouse in such capacity.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3701(a)(2), 3712(c)(4))
(2) For the purpose of obtaining an interest rate reduction refinancing loan pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 3712(a)(1)(F), an unmarried surviving spouse who was a co-obligor under an existing Department of Veterans Affairs guaranteed loan shall be considered to be eligible for the 38 U.S.C. 3712(a)(1)(F) benefit.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3712(a)(4)(C))
(g) Any evidence of guaranty issued by the Secretary in respect to such loan shall be conclusive evidence of the eligibility of the loan for guaranty and of the amount of such guaranty,
Provided, however,
That the Secretary may establish against the original lender, defenses based on fraud or material misrepresentation and that the Secretary may by regulations in force at the date of such issuance establish partial defenses to the amount payable on the guaranty.

§ 36.4206
Underwriting standards, occupancy, and non-discrimination requirements.
(a) Except for refinancing loans pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 3712(a)(1)(F), no loan shall be guaranteed unless the terms of repayment bear a proper relationship to the veteran's present and anticipated income and expenses, and the veteran is a satisfactory credit risk, as
determined by use of the standards in § 36.4337 of this part.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3712)
(b) Use of the standards in § 36.4337 of this part for underwriting manufactured home loans will be waived only in extraordinary circumstances.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3712)
(c) The lender responsibilities contained in § 36.4337 of this part and the certification required and penalties to be assessed under § 36.4337A of this part against lenders making false certifications also apply to lenders originating VA guaranteed manufactured home loans under the authority of 38 U.S.C. 3712.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3712)
(d) No loan shall be guaranteed pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 3712(a)(1) unless:
(1) The veteran certifies, in such form as the Secretary shall prescribe, that he or she will personally occupy the property as his or her home or, if the veteran is on active duty status as a member of the Armed Forces and is for that reason unable to occupy the property, the veteran's spouse must certify that he or she will personally occupy the property as his or her home. For the purposes of this section, the words
personally occupy the property as his or her home
mean that the veteran as of the date of his or her certification actually lives in the property personally as his or her residence or actually intends upon completion of the loan and acquisition of the manufactured home to move into the home personally within a reasonable time and to utilize the home as his or her residence.
(2) The veteran certifies, in such form as the Secretary shall prescribe that:
(i) Neither the veteran, nor anyone authorized to act for the veteran, will refuse to sell or rent, after the making of a bona fide offer, or refuse to negotiate for the sale or rental of, or otherwise make unavailable or deny the dwelling or property covered by this loan to any person because of race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status, or national origin;
(ii) The veteran recognizes that any restrictive covenant on the property relating to race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status, or national origin is illegal and void and any such covenant is specifically disclaimed; and
(iii) The veteran understands that civil action for preventive relief may be brought by the Attorney General of the United States in any appropriate U.S. district court against any person responsible for a violation of the applicable law.

§ 36.4208
Manufactured home location standards.
(a) Any rental site on which a manufactured home to be purchased with a guaranteed loan will be placed must qualify as an acceptable rental site as follows:
(1) Be located within a manufactured home park or subdivision which is acceptable to the Department of Veterans Affairs; or
(2) Be a site which is not within a manufactured home park or subdivision provided that (i) the site is determined by the Department of Veterans Affairs to be an acceptable rental site, or (ii) in the absence of a determination by the Department of Veterans Affairs in respect to such site the manufactured home purchaser and the dealer certify to the Secretary as follows:
(A) Placement of the manufactured home on the site or lot is not a violation of zoning laws or other local requirements applicable to manufactured homes;
(B) The site or lot is served by water and sanitary facilities which are approved by the local public authority and which are acceptable to the Department of Veterans Affairs;
(C) The site or lot is served by an all-weather street or road;

(b) No manufactured home purchased with a guaranteed loan may be placed on a lot owned by an eligible veteran or on a lot to be purchased or improved with the proceeds of a guaranteed manufactured home loan unless the lot owned or to be so purchased or improved is determined by the Department of Veterans Affairs to be an acceptable manufactured home site.
(c) A manufactured home park or subdivision which is not approved by the Federal Housing Administration will be acceptable to the Department of Veterans Affairs for the purpose of 38 U.S.C. 3712 if the Secretary determines that the park or subdivision, whether existing or proposed, (1) is designed to encourage the maintenance and development of manufactured home sites which will be free from, and not substantially contribute to, adverse scenic and environmental conditions, and (2) complies otherwise with the applicable standards for planning, construction, and general acceptability prescribed by the Secretary.
[36 FR 1253, Jan. 27, 1971, as amended at 55 FR 37472, Sept. 12, 1990; 56 FR 9855, Mar. 8, 1991]
§ 36.4209
Reporting requirements.
(a) Each loan proposed for guaranty under 38 U.S.C. 3712 shall, unless otherwise provided in the § 36.4200 series, be submitted to the Secretary for approval prior to closing. The Secretary upon determining any such proposed loan to be eligible for guaranty will issue a certificate of commitment.
(b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, a certificate of commitment shall entitle the holder to the issuance of the evidence of guaranty upon the ultimate actual payment of the full proceeds of the loan for the purposes described in the original report and upon the submission within 60 days thereafter of a supplemental report showing such fact and:
(1) That the loan conforms to the terms of the certificate of commitment;
(2) The identity of all property purchased therewith, including the itemized list required by § 36.4204(f);
(3) That all property purchased with the proceeds of the loan has been encumbered as required by the § 36.4200 series;
(4) In respect to any property purchased with the loan proceeds as to which the Secretary issued a certificate of reasonable value which was conditioned upon completion of any construction, repairs, alterations or improvements not inspected and approved subsequent to completion by a compliance inspector designated by the Secretary that such construction, repairs, alterations or improvements have been completed according to the plans and specifications upon which such reasonable value was based; and
(5) That the loan conforms otherwise to the applicable provisions of 38 U.S.C. chapter 37 and § 36.4200 series.
(c) A deviation of more than five (5) percent between the estimates upon which the certificate of commitment was issued and the report of final payment of the proceeds of the loan, or a change in the identity of the property acquired by the veteran with the loan
proceeds will invalidate the certificate of commitment, unless such deviation or change is approved by the Secretary.
(d) Upon the failure of the lender to report in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, the certificate of commitment shall have no further effect;
Provided, nevertheless,
That if the loan otherwise meets the requirements of this section, said certificate of commitment may be given effect by the Secretary, notwithstanding the report is received after the date otherwise required.
(e) Subject to compliance with the regulations concerning guaranty of manufactured home loans to veterans, the Certificate of Guaranty will be issuable within the available entitlement of the veteran on the basis of the loan reported, except for refinancing loans for interest rate reductions. No certificate of commitment shall be issued, and no loan shall be guaranteed, unless the lender, the veteran, and the loan are shown to be eligible; nor shall guaranty be issued on any manufactured home loan unless the Secretary determines that there has been compliance by the veteran with the certification requirements of 38 U.S.C. 3712(e)(5).
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3712(a)(4), (c)(2), (e)(5))
(f) Any amount of the loan that is disbursed for an ineligible purpose shall be excluded in computing the amount of guaranty.
(g) Approval by the Secretary pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 3712(c)(1) is required before a lender may close manufactured home loans or manufactured home lot loans on the automatic basis. Evidence of guaranty will be issuable if the loan closed on the automatic basis is reported to the Secretary within 60 days of full disbursement, and upon certification of the lender that no default exists thereunder which has continued for more than 30 days and that the loan complies with paragraphs (b)(2), (3), (4), and (5), (e), and (f) of this section. Upon the failure of the lender to report in accordance with this paragraph the loan will not be eligible for guaranty unless the lender submits with the report a certification that the loan is not in default and an explanation as to why the loan was not timely reported.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3712 (c)(1) and (g))
(h) With respect to any loan for which a commitment was made on or after March 1, 1988, the Secretary must be notified whenever the holder receives knowledge of disposition of a manufactured home and/or lot securing a Department of Veterans Affairs guaranteed loan.
(1) If the seller applies for prior approval of the assumption of the loan, then:
(i) A holder (or its authorized servicing agent) who is an automatic lender must examine the creditworthiness of the purchaser and determine compliance with the provisions of 38 U.S.C. 3714. The creditworthiness review must be performed by the party that has automatic authority. If both the holder and its servicing agent are automatic lenders, then they must decide between themselves which one will make the determination of creditworthiness, whether the loan is current and whether there is a contractual obligation to assume the loan, as required by 38 U.S.C. 3714. If the actual loan holder does not have automatic authority and its servicing agent is an automatic lender, then the servicing agent must make the determinations required by 38 U.S.C. 3714 on behalf of the holder. The actual holder will remain ultimately responsible for any failure of its servicing agent to comply with the applicable law and Department of Veterans Affairs regulations.
(A) If the assumption is approved and the transfer of the security is completed, then the notice required by this paragraph shall consist of the credit package (unless previously provided in accordance with paragraph (h)(1)(i)(B) of this section) and a copy of the executed deed, bill of sale, transfer of equity agreement, and/or assumption agreement as required by the VA office of jurisdiction. The notice shall be submitted to the Department of Veterans Affairs with the Department of Veterans Affairs receipt for the funding fee provided for in § 36.4232(e)(3) or § 36.4254(d)(3) of this part.
(B) If the application for assumption is disapproved, the holder shall notify
the seller and the purchaser that the decision may be appealed to the Department of Veterans Affairs office of jurisdiction within 30 days. The holder shall make available to that Department of Veterans Affairs office all items used by the holder in making the holder's decision in case the decision is appealed to the Department of Veterans Affairs. If the application remains disapproved after 60 days (to allow time for appeal to and review by the Department of Veterans Affairs) then the holder must refund $50 of any fee previously collected under the provisions of § 36.4275(a)(3)(iii) of this part. If the application is subsequently approved and the sale is completed, then the holder (or its authorized servicing agent) shall provide the notice described in paragraph (h)(1)(i)(A) of this section.
(C) In performing the requirements of paragraphs (h)(1)(i)(A) or (h)(1)(i)(B) of this section the holder must complete its examination of the creditworthiness of the prospective purchaser and advise the seller of its decision no later than 45 days after the date of receipt by the holder of a complete application package for the approval of the assumption. The 45-day period may be extended by an interval not to exceed the time caused by delays in processing of the application which are documented as beyond the control of the holder, such as employers or depositories not responding to requests for verifications, which were timely forwarded, or followups on those requests.
(ii) If neither the holder nor its authorized servicing agent is an automatic lender, the notice to the Department of Veterans Affairs shall include:
(A) Advice regarding whether the loan is current or in default;
(B) A copy of the purchase contract; and
(C) A complete credit package developed by the holder which the Secretary may use for determining the creditworthiness of the purchaser.
(D) The notice and documents required by this section must be submitted to the Department of Veterans Affairs office of jurisdiction no later than 35 days after the date of receipt by the holder of a complete application package for the approval of the assumption, subject to the same extensions as provided in paragraph (h)(1)(i) of this section. If the assumption is not automatically approved by the holder or its authorized agent pursuant to the automatic authority provisions, $50 of any fee collected in accordance with § 36.4275(a)(3)(iii) of this part must be refunded. If the Department of Veterans Affairs does not approve the assumption, the holder will be notified and an additional $50 of any fee collected under § 36.4275(a)(3)(iii) of this part must be refunded following expiration of the 30-day appeal period set out in paragraph (h)(1)(i)(B) of this section. If such an appeal is made to the Department of Veterans Affairs, then the review will be conducted at the Department of Veterans Affairs office of jurisdiction by an individual who was not involved in the original disapproval decision. If the application for assumption is approved and the transfer of the security is completed, then the holder (or its authorized servicing agent) shall provide the notice required in paragraph (h)(1)(i)(A) of this section.
(2) If the seller fails to notify the holder before disposing of property securing the loan, the holder shall notify the Secretary within 60 days after learning of the transfer. Such notice shall advise whether or not the holder intends to exercise its option to immediately accelerate the loan or whether an opportunity will be extended to the transferor and transferee to apply for retroactive approval of the assumption under the terms of this paragraph

§ 36.4210
Joint loans.
(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the prior approval of the Secretary is required in respect to any manufactured home loan to be made to two or more borrowers who become jointly and severally liable, or
jointly liable therefor, and who will acquire an undivided interest in the property to be purchased or who will otherwise share in the proceeds of the loan, or in respect to any loan to be made to an eligible veteran whose interest in the property owned, or to be acquired with the loan proceeds, is an undivided interest only. The amount of the guaranty shall be computed in such cases only on that portion of the loan allocable to the eligible veteran which, taking into consideration all relevant factors, represents the proper contribution of the veteran to the transaction. Such loans shall be secured to the extent required by 38 U.S.C. chapter 37 and the regulations concerning guaranty of manufactured home loans to veterans.
(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section, the joinder of the spouse of a veteran-borrower in the ownership of property shall not require prior approval or preclude the issuance of a guaranty based upon the entire amount of the loan. If both spouses be eligible veterans, either or both, within permissible maxima, may utilize available guaranty entitlement.
(c) For the purpose of determining the rights and the liabilities of the Secretary with respect to a loan subject to paragraph (a) of this section, credits legally applicable to the entire loan shall be applied as follows:
(1) Prepayments made expressly for credit to that portion of the indebtedness allocable to the veteran shall be applied to such portion of the indebtedness. All other payments shall be applied ratably to those portions of the loan allocable respectively to the veteran and to the other debtors.
(2) Proceeds of the sale or other liquidation of the security shall be applied ratably to the respective portions of the loan, such portion of the proceeds as represents the interest of the veteran being applied to that portion of the loan allocable to such veteran.

[44 FR 22725, Apr. 17, 1979, as amended at 55 FR 37473, Sept. 12, 1990]
§ 36.4211
Amortization—prepayment.
(a) To be eligible for guaranty under 38 U.S.C. 3712 a loan shall be amortized fully within the term of the loan in accordance with any generally recognized plan of amortization requiring approximately equal monthly payments. The loan shall not be payable on demand or at sight or presentation, or at a time not specified or computable from the language in the evidence of indebtedness, or on a renewal basis at the option of the holder. The first payment may be deferred not longer than 2 months from the date the loan is closed.
(b) No guaranteed loan security instrument shall contain any provision giving the holder a right to declare the loan due or otherwise to declare a default if the holder “shall feel insecure” or upon the occurrence of any similar condition at the holder's option, without regard to any act or omission by the debtor.
(c) The debtor shall have the right, without penalty or fee, to prepay all or not less than one installment of the indebtedness at any time. Credit for any partial prepayment made on other than an installment due date may be postponed to the next installment due date. The holder and the debtor may agree at any time that any prepayment not previously applied in satisfaction of matured installments shall be reapplied for the purpose of curing or preventing any subsequent default. Any prepayment in full of the indebtedness (unpaid principal balance plus earned interest) shall be credited on the date received. In determining the amount required to prepay the indebtedness in full the holder of the loan shall exclude all unearned interest or discount.
(d) Subject to paragraph (a) of this section any amounts which under the terms of a loan do not become due and payable on or before the last maturity date permissible for loans of its class under the limitations contained in § 36.4204 shall automatically fall due on such date.
§ 36.4212
Interest rates and late charges.
(a) In guaranteeing or insuring loans under 38 U.S.C. chapter 37, the Secretary may elect to require that such loans either bear interest at a rate that is agreed upon by the veteran and the lender, or bear interest at a rate not in
excess of a rate established by the Secretary. The Secretary may, from time to time, change that election by publishing a notice in the
Federal Register.
Provided, however, that the interest rate of a loan for the purpose of an interest rate reduction under 38 U.S.C. 3712(a)(1)(F) must be less than the interest rate of the VA loan being refinanced. This paragraph (a) does not apply in the case of an adjustable rate mortgage being refinanced with a fixed rate loan.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3703, 3712)
(b) For loans bearing an interest rate agreed upon by the veteran and the lender, the veteran may pay reasonable discount points in connection with the loan. The discount points may not be included in the loan amount, except for interest rate reduction refinancing loans under 38 U.S.C. 3712(a)(1)(F).
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3703, 3712)
(c) The rate of interest in instruments securing the indebtedness for all loans may be expressed in terms of add-on or discount.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3710, 3712)
(d) Interest in excess of the rate reported by the lender when requesting evidence of guaranty or insurance shall not be payable on any advance, or in the event of any delinquency or default;
Provided,
that a late charge not in excess of an amount equal to 4 percent of any installment paid more than 15 days after due date shall not be considered a violation of this limitation.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3712)
(e) Adjustable rate mortgage loans which comply with the requirements of this paragraph are eligible for guaranty.
(1)
Interest rate index.
Changes in the interest rate charged on an adjustable rate mortgage must correspond to changes in the weekly average yield on one year (52 week) Treasury bills adjusted to a constant maturity. Yields on one year Treasury bills at “constant maturity” are interpolated by the United States Treasury from the daily yield curve. This curve, which relates the yield on the security to its time to maturity, is based on the closing market bid yields on actively traded one year Treasury bills in the over-the-counter market. The weekly average one year constant maturity Treasury bill yields are published by the Federal Reserve Board of the Federal Reserve System. The Federal Reserve Statistical Release Report H.15 (519) is released each Monday. These one year constant maturity Treasury bill yields are also published monthly in the Federal Reserve Bulletin, published by the Federal Reserve Board of the Federal Reserve System, as well as quarterly in the Treasury Bulletin, published by the Department of the Treasury.
(2)
Frequency of interest rate changes.
Interest rate adjustments must occur on an annual basis, except that the first adjustment may occur not sooner than 12 months nor later than 18 months from the date of the borrower's first mortgage payment. The adjusted rate will become effective the first day of the month following the adjustment date; the first monthly payment at the new rate will be due on the first day of the following month. To set the new interest rate, the lender will determine the change between the initial (
i.e.
, base) index figure and the current index figure. The initial index figure shall be the most recent figure available before the date of mortgage loan origination. The current index figure shall be the most recent index figure available 30 days before the date of each interest rate adjustment.
(3)
Method of rate changes.
Interest rate changes may only be implemented through adjustments to the borrower's monthly payments.
(4)
Initial rate and magnitude of changes.
The initial contract interest rate of an adjustable rate mortgage shall be agreed upon by the lender and the veteran. The rate must be reflective of adjustable rate lending. Annual adjustments in the interest rate shall be set at a certain spread or margin over the interest rate index prescribed in paragraph (e)(1) of this section. Except for the initial rate, this margin shall remain constant over the life of the loan. Annual adjustments to the contract interest rate shall correspond to annual changes in the interest rate
index, subject to the following conditions and limitations:
(i) No single adjustment to the interest rate may result in a change in either direction of more than one percentage point from the interest rate in effect for the period immediately preceding that adjustment. Index changes in excess of one percentage point may not be carried over for inclusion in an adjustment in a subsequent year. Adjustments in the effective rate of interest over the entire term of the mortgage may not result in a change in either direction of more than five percentage points from the initial contract interest rate.
(ii) At each adjustment date, changes in the index interest rate, whether increases or decreases, must be translated into the adjusted mortgage interest rate, rounded to the nearest one-eighth of one percent, up or down. For example, if the margin is 2 percent and the new index figure is 6.06 percent, the adjusted mortgage interest rate will be 8 percent. If the margin is 2 percent and the new index figure is 6.07 percent, the adjusted mortgage interest rate will be 8
1/8
percent.
(5)
Pre-loan disclosure.
The lender shall explain fully and in writing to the borrower, no later than on the date upon which the lender provides the prospective borrower with a loan application, the nature of the obligation taken. The borrower shall certify in writing that he or she fully understands the obligation and a copy of the signed certification shall be placed in the loan folder and included in the loan submission to VA. Such lender disclosure must include the following items:
(i) The fact that the mortgage interest rate may change, and an explanation of how changes correspond to changes in the interest rate index;
(ii) Identification of the interest rate index, its source of publication and availability;
(iii) The frequency (
i.e.
, annually) with which interest rate levels and monthly payments will be adjusted, and the length of the interval that will precede the initial adjustment; and
(iv) A hypothetical monthly payment schedule that displays the maximum potential increases in monthly payments to the borrower over the first five years of the mortgage, subject to the provisions of the mortgage instrument.
(6)
Annual disclosure.
At least 25 days before any adjustment to a borrower's monthly payment may occur, the lender must provide a notice to the borrower which sets forth the date of the notice, the effective date of the change, the old interest rate, the new interest rate, the new monthly payment amount, the current index and the date it was published, and a description of how the payment adjustment was calculated. A copy of the annual disclosure shall be made a part of the lender's permanent record on the loan.

§ 36.4213
Capacity of parties.
Nothing in the § 36.4200 series shall be construed to relieve any lender of responsibility for any loss caused by lack of legal capacity of any person to contract, sell, convey or encumber, or by the existence of other legal disability or defects invalidating or rendering unenforceable in whole or in part either the loan obligation or the security therefor.
§ 36.4214
Geographical limits.
The site for any manufactured home purchased with a guaranteed loan must be located within the United States of America, which for the purposes of 38 U.S.C. 3712 comprises the several States, the Territories and possessions of the United States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.

§ 36.4215
Maintenance of records.
(a) The holder shall maintain a record of the amounts of payments received on the obligation and disbursements chargeable thereto and the dates thereof. This record shall be maintained until the Secretary ceases to be liable as guarantor of the loan. For the purpose of any accounting with the Secretary or computation of claim against the Secretary, any holder who
fails to maintain such record shall be presumed to have received on the dates due all sums which by the terms of the contract are payable prior to date of claim, and the burden of going forward with evidence and of ultimate proof of the contrary shall be on such holder.
(b) The lender shall retain copies of all loan origination records on VA guaranteed loan for at least one year from the date of loan closing. Loan origination records include the loan application, including any preliminary application, verifications of employment and deposit, all credit reports, including preliminary credit reports, copies of each sales contract and addendums, letters of explanation for adverse credit items, discrepancies and the like, direct references from creditors, correspondence with employers, appraisal reports, reports on other inspections of the property, and all closing papers and documents.

Incorporation by reference.
Department of Veterans Affairs regulations issued under 38 U.S.C. 3712, and in effect on the date of any loan which is submitted and accepted or approved for a guaranty thereunder, shall govern the rights, duties, and liabilities of the parties to such loan and any provisions of the loan instruments inconsistent with such regulations are hereby amended and supplemented to conform thereto.

(a) Notwithstanding any requirement, condition, or limitation stated in or imposed by the regulations concerning the guaranty of manufactured home loans to veterans, the Under Secretary for Benefits, or the Executive Director, Loan Guaranty Service, within the limitations and conditions prescribed by the Secretary, is hereby authorized, if the Under Secretary for Benefits or Executive Director, Loan Guaranty Service finds the interests of the Government are not adversely affected, to relieve undue prejudice to a debtor, holder, or other person, which might otherwise result, provided no such action may be taken which would impair the vested rights of any person affected thereby. If such requirement, condition, or limitation is of an administrative or procedural (not substantive) nature, any employee designated in § 36.4221 is hereby authorized to grant similar relief if the designated employee finds the failure or error of

(7) The requirement in § 36.4210(a) that a lender obtain the prior approval of the Secretary before closing a joint loan if the lender or class of lenders is approved by the Secretary to close loans on the automatic basis pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 3712(c)(1).
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3712(c)(1))

(1) Flood insurance will be required on any manufactured home, building or personal property securing a loan at any time during the term of the loan that such security is located in an area identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency as having special flood hazards and in which flood insurance has been made available under the National Flood Insurance Act, as amended. The amount of flood insurance must be at least equal to the lesser of the outstanding principal balance of the loan or the maximum limit of coverage available for the particular type of property under the National Flood Insurance Act, as amended. The Secretary cannot guarantee a loan for the acquisition or construction of property located in an area identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency as having special flood hazards unless the community in which such area is situated is then participating in the National Flood Insurance Program.
(Authority: 42 U.S.C. 4012a, 4106(a))
(2) Broad Lender's Protection Insurance or its equivalent is required to protect against loss for any items missing from the manufactured home at time of repossession and to cover repossession expenses including, but not limited to, breakdown and transport charges, permit and export fees, and an amount, limited by the Secretary, of unpaid park rent.

§ 36.4223
Interest rate reduction refinancing loan.
(a) A veteran may refinance [38 U.S.C. 3712(a)(1)(F)] an existing Department of Veterans Affairs guaranteed loan to reduce the interest rate payable on the Department of Veterans Affairs loan provided the following requirements are met:
(1) The loan application must be submitted to the Secretary for prior approval unless the veteran is not charged a discount, in which case the loan application may be processed on the automatic basis;
(2) The loan must be secured by the same real property and/or personal property as the loan being refinanced and the veteran must own the manufactured home and/or manufactured home lot securing the loan; and
(i) Presently occupy or have previously occupied the manufactured home, a manufactured home on the lot securing the loan, or the manufactured home and the lot securing the loan as his or her home and must certify in such form as the Secretary shall prescribe that the veteran presently or has previously so occupied the manufactured home or a manufactured home on the lot; or
(ii) When a veteran is on Active Duty status as a member of the Armed Forces and is unable to occupy the manufactured home or a manufactured home on the lot securing the loan as a home because of such status, the veteran's spouse must occupy or must have previously occupied the manufactured home or a manufactured home on the lot as the spouse's home and must certify such occupancy in such form as the Secretary shall prescribe.
(3) The amount of the refinancing loan may not exceed an amount equal to the sum of the balance of the loan being refinanced and such closing costs as authorized in § 36.4232 or § 36.4254, as appropriate, and a discount not to exceed 2 percent of the loan amount;
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3703, 3712)

(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3703, 3712)
(5) The term of the refinancing loan 38 U.S.C. 3712(a)(1)(F) may not exceed the original term of the loan being refinanced.
(b) Notwithstanding any other regulatory provision, the interest rate reduction refinancing loan may be guaranteed without regard to the amount of guaranty entitlement for manufactured home purposes available for use by the veteran, and the amount of the veteran's remaining guaranty entitlement for manufactured home purposes shall not be charged for an interest rate reduction refinancing loan. The interest rate reduction refinancing loan will be guaranteed with the entitlement used by the veteran to obtain the loan being refinanced. The veteran's loan guaranty entitlement used originally for a purpose as enumerated in 38 U.S.C. 3712(a)(1)(A) through (E) or (G) and subsequently transferred for use on an interest rate reduction refinancing loan (38 U.S.C. 3712(a)(1)(F)) shall be eligible for restoration when the interest rate reduction refinancing loan or subsequent interest rate reduction refinancing loan on the same property meets the requirements of § 36.4203(a).
(c) Title to the security which is refinanced for the purpose of an interest rate reduction must be in conformity with § 36.4234, and/or § 36.4253, as appropriate.

§ 36.4224
Refinancing existing manufactured home loan including purchase of lot.
(a) A veteran may refinance (38 U.S.C. 3712(a)(1)(G)) an existing purchase money lien on a manufactured home owned and occupied by the veteran as his or her home in conjunction with a loan to acquire a suitable lot on which that manufactured home is or will be located provided the following requirements are met.

For the purposes enumerated in 38 U.S.C. 3702(b) the refinancing portion of the loan shall be considered to have been obtained with the guaranty entitlement used to obtain the VA-guaranteed loan being refinanced. Guaranty for the refinancing loan shall be computed by first applying to the loan a combined total of the guaranty entitlement used to obtain the VA-guaranteed loan being refinanced and second any additional guaranty entitlement available to the veteran for manufactured home purposes, up to a maximum of $20,000 or forty (40) percent of the original principal amount of the loan, whichever is less.

§ 36.4225
Authority to close manufactured home loans on the automatic basis.
(a) Supervised lenders of the classes described in 38 U.S.C. 3702(d) (1) and (2) are authorized by statute to process VA guaranteed manufactured home loans on the automatic basis. This category of lenders includes any Federal land bank, national bank, State bank, private bank, building and loan association, insurance company, credit union or mortgage and loan company that is subject to examination and supervision by an agency of the United States or of any State or by any State.
(b) Nonsupervised lenders of the class described in 38 U.S.C. 3702(d)(3) must apply to the Secretary for authority to process manufactured home loans on the automatic basis. The following minimum requirements must be met:
(1)
Minimum assets.
A minimum of $50,000 of working capital must be maintained. Working capital is defined as the excess of current assets over current liabilities. Current assets are defined as cash or other assets that could readily be converted into cash within 1 year on the normal accounting or business cycle. Current liabilities are defined as obligations that would be paid within a year on a normal accounting or business cycle. The lender's latest financial statements (profit and loss statements and balance sheets), audited and certified by a CPA (certified public accountant), must accompany the application. If the date of the financial statement precedes that of the application by more than 6 months, the lender-applicant must also attach a copy of its latest internal quarterly report. In addition, the lender-applicant must agree that if the application is approved, the applicant will provide within 120 days following the end of each of its fiscal years an audited financial statement to the Executive Director, Loan Guaranty Service for review.
(2)
Experience.
The firm must have been actively engaged in originating manufactured home loans for at least the last 2 years. Alternately, each principal officer of the firm who is actively involved in managing origination functions must have a minimum of 2 recent years' total experience in the field of VA manufactured home mortgages in managerial functions in either the present company of employment or in companies other than that of his or her present employment. In either case, every principal officer (president and vice presidents) must submit a resume of his or her experience in the mortgage lending field. Should the secretary and/or treasurer participate in the management of origination functions, they too must submit a resume
and meet the minimum experience requirement if the company does not meet the experience requirement. Should the lender or any of its directors or officers ever have been debarred or suspended by any Federal agency or department or any of its directors or officers have been a director or officer of any other lender or corporation that was so suspended, or if the lender-applicant ever had a servicing contract with an investor terminated for cause, a statement of the facts must also be submitted. Lender-applicants will submit individual requests for each branch office they wish to have approved. The parent organization must agree to accept full responsibility for the actions of branch offices.
(3)
Underwriter.
If it is proposed that all loans to be made by the lender will be submitted to its home office for approval or rejection, the lender must have at least one full-time designated underwriter in its home office. If the loans will be approved or rejected by branch managers, the lender must have at least one full-time designated underwriter in each branch. In either event, the designated underwriters must be identified and a resume on each submitted to VA. The underwriters should have at least three years of experience in consumer installment finance. If changes in underwriting personnel occur, the lender must notify VA.
(4)
Lines of credit.
The identity of the source(s) of warehouse lines of credit must be revealed to VA and the applicant must agree that VA may contact the named source(s) for the purpose of verifying the information.
(5)
Secondary market.
If the lender-applicant customarily sells the manufactured home loans it originates, it must provide a listing of all permanent investors to whom the loans are sold, including the investor's address, telephone number and names of persons to contact.
(6)
Liaison.
The lender-applicant must designate one employee to act as liaison on its behalf with the VA. If possible, the lender-applicant should select employees other than VA approved underwriters to act as liaison. Officers from branch or regional offices should also be appointed to act as liaison with local VA offices. The lender must notify VA of any changes in liaison personnel.
(7)
Courtesy closing.
The lender-applicant must certify to VA that it will not close loans on an automatic basis as a courtesy or accommodation for other mortgage lenders whether or not such lenders are themselves approved to close on an automatic basis. The lender must agree that the processing of forms other than the initial credit application will not be delegated to the dealer or developer.
(8)
Subsidiaries/affiliates.
A lender approved for automatic processing may not close manufactured home loans on the automatic basis involving any dealership or manufacturer in which it has a financial interest or which it owns, is owned by, or with which it is affiliated. This restriction may be eliminated for lenders that can provide documentation which demonstrates to VA's satisfaction that (i) the lender and the manufacturer and/or dealer are separate entities that operate independently for each other, and (ii) the percentage of all VA manufactured home loans originated by the lender during at least a one-year period on which payments are past due 90 days or more is no higher than the national average for the same period for all mortgage loans.
(9)
Lender agents.
A lender using an agent to perform a portion of the work involved in originating and closing a VA guaranteed loan on an automatic basis must take full responsibility by certification or corporate resolution for all acts, errors and omissions of the agent and its employees. Any such acts, errors or omissions will be treated as those of the lender and appropriate sanctions may be imposed against the lender and its agent.
(10)
Minimum use of automatic authority.
If approved, lenders must use their automatic authority to the maximum extent possible. Any lender with automatic authority who submits a loan on the prior approval basis will be required to submit an explanation from the designated underwriter as to why the loan was not closed automatically. Such a statement will not be needed for loans that must be processed on the prior approval basis, e.g., joint loans.
(11)
Probation.
Lender-applicants meeting the requirements of this section will be approved to close loans on an automatic basis for a 1-year probationary period. Poor underwriting and/or consistently careless processing by the lender during the probationary period will be a basis for withdrawal of automatic authority.
(12)
Quality control system.
In order to be approved as a nonsupervised lender for automatic processing authority, the lender must implement a written quality control system which ensures compliance with VA requirements. The lender must agree to furnish findings under its system to VA on demand. The elements of the quality control system must include the following:
(i)
Underwriting policies.
Each office of the lender shall maintain copies of VA credit standards and all available VA underwriting guidelines.
(ii)
Corrective measures.
The system should ensure the effective corrective measures are taken promptly when deficiencies in loan originations are identified by either the lender or VA. Any cases involving major discrepancies which are discovered under the system must be reported to VA.
(iii)
System integrity.
The quality control system should be independent of the loan production function.
(iv)
Scope.
The review of understanding decisions and certifications must include compliance with VA underwriting requirements, sufficiency of documentation and soundness of underwriting judgments.
(c) A lender approved to close loans on the automatic basis who subsequently fails to meet the requirements of this section must report the circumstances surrounding the deficiency and the remedial action to be taken to cure it to VA.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 501, 1803(c)(1), and 1812(g))
(d) To participate in VA's automatic program nonsupervised lenders of the class described in paragraph 3702(d)(3) of title 38 U.S. Code shall pay fees as follows:
(1) $500 for new applications;
(2) $200 for reinstatement of lapsed or terminated automatic authority;
(3) $100 for each underwriter approval;

§ 36.4226
Withdrawal of authority to close manufactured home loans on the automatic basis.
(a)(1) As provided in 38 U.S.C. 3702(e), the authority of any lender to close manufactured home loans on the automatic basis may be withdrawn by the Secretary at any time upon 30 days notice. The automatic processing authority of both supervised and nonsupervised lenders may be withdrawn for engaging in practices which are imprudent from a lending standpoint or which are prejudicial to the interests of veterans or the Government but are of a lesser degree than would warrant complete debarment or suspension of the lender from participation in the program.
(2) Automatic processing authority may be withdrawn for failure to meet basic qualifying criteria. For non-supervised lenders, this includes lack of a designated underwriter, failure to maintain $50,000 working capital and/or
failure to file required financial statements. For supervised lenders this includes loss of status as an entity subject to examination and supervision by a Federal or State supervisory agency as required by 38 U.S.C. 3702(d). During the 1 year probationary period for newly approved automatic lenders, automatic authority may be withdrawn based upon poor underwriting or consistently careless processing by the lender, as determined by VA.
(3) Automatic processing authority may also be withdrawn based on any of the causes for debarment set forth in 2 CFR parts 180 and 801.
(b) Authority to close manufactured home loans on the automatic basis may also be temporarily withdrawn for a period of time under the following schedule.
(1) Withdrawal for 60 days:
(i) Automatic loan submissions show deficiencies in credit underwriting, such as use of unstable sources of income to qualify the borrower, ignoring significant adverse credit items affecting the applicant's creditworthiness, etc., after such deficiencies have been repeatedly called to the lender's attention;
(ii) Employment or deposit verifications are handcarried by applicants or otherwise improperly permitted to pass through the hands of a third party;
(iii) Automatic loan submissions are consistently incomplete after such deficiencies have been repeatedly called to the lender's attention by VA; or
(iv) There are continued instances of disregard of VA requirements after they have been called to the lender's attention.
(2) Withdrawal for 180 days:
(i) Loans are closed automatically which conflict with VA credit standards and which would not have been made by a lender acting prudently;
(ii) The lender fails to disclose to VA significant obligations or other information so material to the veteran's ability to repay the loan that undue risk to the Government results;
(iii) Employment or deposit verifications are allowed to be handcarried by applicant or otherwise mishandled, resulting in the submission of significant misinformation to VA;
(iv) Substantiated complaints are received that the lender misrepresented VA requirements to veterans to the detriment of their interests (e.g., veteran was dissuaded from seeking a lower interest rate based on lender's incorrect advice that such options were precluded by VA requirements);
(v) Closing documentation shows instances of improper charges to the veteran after the impropriety of such charges has been called to the lender's attention by VA, or refusal to refund such charges after notification by VA; or
(vi) There are other instances of lender actions which are prejudicial to the interests of veterans, such as deliberate delays in scheduling loan closings.
(3) Withdrawal for a period from one year to three years:
(i) The lender fails to properly disburse loans (e.g., loan disbursement checks returned due to insufficient funds); or
(ii) There is involvement by the lender in the improper use of a veteran's entitlement (e.g., knowingly permitting the veteran to violate occupancy requirements, lender involvement in sale of veteran's entitlement).
(4) A continuation of actions that have led to previous withdrawal of automatic authority justifies withdrawal of automatic authority for the next longer period of time.
(5) Withdrawal of automatic processing authority does not prevent a lender from processing VA guaranteed manufactured home loans on the prior approval basis.
(6) Action by VA to remove a lender's automatic authority does not prevent VA from also taking debarment or suspension action based on the same conduct by the lender.
(7) VA field facilities are authorized to withdraw automatic privileges for 60 days, based on any of the violations set forth in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(3) of this section, for nonsupervised lenders without operations in other stations' jurisdictions. All determinations regarding withdrawal of automatic authority for longer periods of time or
multi-jurisdictional lenders must be made in Central Office.
(c) VA will provide 30 days notice of withdrawal of automatic authority in order to enable the lender to either close or obtain prior approval for a loan on which processing has begun. There is no right to a formal hearing to contest the withdrawal of automatic processing privileges. However, if within 15 days after receiving notice the lender requests an opportunity to contest the withdrawal, the lender may submit in person, in writing, or through a representative, information and argument in opposition to the withdrawal.
(d) If the lender's submission in opposition raises a dispute over facts material to the withdrawal of automatic authority, the lender will be afforded an opportunity to appear with a representative, submit documentary evidence, present witnesses, and confront any witnesses VA presents. The Under Secretary for Benefits will appoint a hearing officer or panel to conduct the hearing.
(e) A transcribed record of the proceedings shall be made available at cost to the lender, upon request, unless the requirement for a transcript is waived by mutual agreement.
(f) In actions based upon a conviction or civil judgment, or in which there is no genuine dispute over material facts, the Under Secretary for Benefits shall make a decision on the basis of all the information in the administrative record, including any submissions made by the lender.

(e) Tax liens special assessment liens, and ground rents shall be disregarded with respect to any requirement that loans shall be secured by a lien of specified dignity. With the prior approval of the Secretary, Under Secretary for Benefits, or Executive Director, Loan Guaranty Service, liens retained by nongovernmental entities to secure assessments or charges for municipal type services and facilities clearly within the public purpose doctrine may be disregarded. In determining whether a loan for the purchase or improvement of a manufactured home lot is secured by a first lien the Secretary may also disregard a superior lien created by a duly recorded covenant running with the realty in favor of a private entity to secure an obligation to such entity for the homeowner's share of the costs of the management, operation, or maintenance of property, services or programs within and for the benefit of the development or community in which the veteran's realty is located, if the Secretary determines that the interests of the veteran-borrower and of the Government will not be prejudiced by the operation of such covenant.

(f) In the case of a combination loan or a loan to purchase a lot upon which a manufactured home owned by the veteran will be placed it shall be the responsibility of the lender that the veteran initially obtains or has an estate in the land constituting the manufactured home lot meeting the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section and to obtain and retain a security interest thereon meeting the requirements of paragraph (d) of this section.

The lender must also obtain and retain a first lien or the equivalent thereof on the estate of the veteran in both the manufactured home and in the lot on which the manufactured home is located.

Provided, however, that the fee shall be 0.50 percent of the total loan amount for interest rate reduction refinancing loans guaranteed under 38 U.S.C. 3712(a)(1)(F). All or part of such fee may be paid in cash at loan closing or all or part of the fee may be included in the loan without regard to the reasonable value of the property or the computed maximum loan amount, as appropriate. In computing the fee, the lender will disregard any amount included in the loan to enable the borrower to pay such fee.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3729(a))
(2) Subject to the limitations set out in paragraphs (d)(3) and (d)(4) of this section, a fee of one-half of one percent of the loan balance must be paid to the Secretary in a manner prescribed by the Secretary by a person assuming a loan to which section 3714 of chapter 37 of 38 U.S.C. applies. The instrument securing such a loan shall contain a provision describing the right of the holder to collect this fee as trustee for the Department of Veterans Affairs. The loan holder shall list the amount of this fee in every assumption statement provided and include a notice that the fee must be paid to the holder immediately following loan settlement. The fee must be transmitted to the Secretary within 15 days of receipt by the holder of notice of the transfer.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3714, 3729)
(3) The lender is required to pay to the Secretary the fee described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section within 15 days after loan closing. Any lender closing a loan, subject to the limitations set out in paragraphs (d)(4) and (d)(5) of this section, who fails to submit timely payment of this fee will be subject to a late charge equal to 4 percent of the total fee due. If payment of the 1 percent fee is made more than 30 days after loan closing, interest will be assessed at a rate set in conformity with the Department of Treasury's Fiscal Requirements Manual. This interest charge is in addition to the 4 percent late charge, but the late charge is not included in the amount on which interest is computed. This interest charge is to be calculated on a daily basis beginning on the date of closing, although the interest will be assessed only on funding fee payments received more than 30 days after closing.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 501)
(4) The lender is required to pay to the Secretary electronically through the Automated Clearing House (ACH) system the fees described in paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of this section and any late fees and interest due on them. This shall be paid to a collection agent by operator-assisted telephone, terminal entry, or CPU-to-CPU transmission. The collection agent will be identified by the Secretary. The lender
shall provide the collection agent with the following: authorization for payment of the funding fee (including late fees and interest) along with the following information: VA lender ID number; four-digit personal identification number; dollar amount of debit; VA loan number; OJ (office of jurisdiction) code; closing date; loan amount; information about whether the payment includes a shortage, late charge, or interest; veteran name; loan type; sale amount; downpayment; whether the veteran is a reservist; and whether this is a subsequent use of entitlement. For all transactions received prior to 8:15 p.m. on a workday, VA will be credited with the amount paid to the collection agent at the opening of business the next banking day.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3729(a))
(5) The fee described in paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of this section shall not be collected from a veteran who is receiving compensation or who but for the receipt of retirement pay would be entitled to receive compensation) or from a surviving spouse described in section 3701(b)(2) of title 38 U.S.C.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3729(b))
(6) Collection of the loan fee in this paragraph does not apply to loans closed prior to August 17, 1984, between October 1, and October 15, 1987, inclusive, between November 16 and December 20, 1987, inclusive, nor to loans closed after September 30, 1989.

§ 36.4275
Events constituting default and acceptability of partial payments.
(a) Except as provided in paragraphs (a)(1), (a)(2) and (a)(3) of this section, the conveyance of or other transfer of title to property by operation of law or otherwise, after the creation of a lien thereon to secure a loan which is guaranteed in whole or in part by the Secretary, shall not constitute an event of default, or acceleration of maturity, elective or otherwise, and shall not of itself terminate or otherwise affect the guaranty.
(1) The Secretary may issue guaranty on loans in which a State, Territorial, or local governmental agency provides assistance to a veteran for the acquisition of a mobile home or lot. Such loans will not be considered ineligible
for guaranty if the State, Territorial, or local authority, by virtue of its laws or regulations or by virtue of Federal law, requires the acceleration of maturity of the loan upon the sale or conveyance of the security property to a person ineligible for assistance from such authority.
(2) At the time of application for a loan assisted by a State, Territorial, or local governmental agency, the veteran-applicant must be fully informed and consent in writing to the housing authority restrictions. A copy of the veteran's consent statement must be forwarded with the loan application or the report of a loan processed on the automatic basis.
(3) Any housing loan which is financed under 38 U.S.C. chapter 37 and to which section 3714 of that chapter applies, shall include a provision in the security instrument that the holder may declare the loan immediately due and payable upon transfer of the property securing such loan to any transferee unless the acceptability of the assumption of the loan is established pursuant to section 3714.
(i) A holder may not exercise its option to accelerate a loan upon:
(A) The creation of a lien or other encumbrance subordinate to the lender's security instrument which does not relate to a transfer of rights of occupancy in the property;
(B) The creation of a purchase money security interest for household appliances;
(C) A transfer by devise, descent, or operation of law on the death of a joint tenant or tenant by the entirety;
(D) The granting of a leasehold interest of three years or less not containing an option to purchase;
(E) A transfer to a relative resulting from the death of a borrower;
(F) A transfer where the spouse or children of the borrower become joint owners of the property with the borrower;
(G) A transfer resulting from a decree of a dissolution of marriage, legal separation agreement, or from an incidental property settlement agreement by which the spouse of the borrower becomes the sole owner of the property. In such a case the borrower shall have the option of applying directly to the Department of Veterans Affairs regional office of jurisdiction for a release of liability in accordance with § 36.4285 of this part; or
(H) A transfer into an inter vivos trust in which the borrower is and remains a beneficiary and which does not relate to a transfer of rights of occupancy in the property.
(ii) Any instrument evidencing the loan (
i.e.
, the retail installment contract, promissory note and/or mortgage or deed of trust) shall bear in a conspicuous position in capital letters on the first page of the document in type at least 2
1/2
times larger in height than the regular type on such page the following warning: “THIS LOAN IS NOT ASSUMABLE WITHOUT THE APPROVAL OF THE DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS OR ITS AUTHORIZED AGENT.” Due to the difficulty in obtaining some commercial type sizes which are exactly 2
1/2
times larger in height than other sizes, minor deviations will be permitted based on commercially available type sizes nearest to 2
1/2
times the size of the print on the document. A similar warning in regular size type must appear on every assumption statement provided on a loan to which this paragraph applies.
(iii) On any loan to which 38 U.S.C. 3714 applies, the holder may charge a reasonable fee, not to exceed the lesser of (A) $300 and the actual cost of any credit report required, or (B) any maximum prescribed by applicable state law, for processing an application for assumption and changing its records. A provision authorizing the collection by the holder of this fee shall be contained in the instrument securing the loan.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3704 and 3714)
(b) The inclusion in the guaranteed obligation of a provision contrary to the provisions of this section or § 36.4211 shall not impair the right of the holder to payment of the guaranty provided that:
(1) Default was declared or maturity was accelerated under some other provision of the note, mortgage, or other loan instrument, or
(2) Activation or enforcement of such provision is warranted under § 36.4280, or
(3) The prior approval of the Secretary was obtained.
(c) If the title to real property or a leasehold interest therein which secures a manufactured home loan guaranteed after December 22, 1970, is restricted against sale or occupancy on the ground of race, color, religion, or national origin, by restrictions created and filed of record by the borrower subsequent to that date, such action, at the election of the holder, shall constitute an event of default entitling the holder to declare the unpaid balance of the loan immediately due and payable.
(d) The holder of any guaranteed obligation shall have the right, notwithstanding the absence of express provision therefor in the instruments evidencing the indebtedness, to accelerate the maturity of such obligation at any time after the continuance of any default for the period specified in § 36.4280.
(e) If sufficient funds are tendered to bring a delinquency current at any time prior to repossession or foreclosure of the manufactured home the holder shall be obligated to accept the funds in payment of the delinquency, unless the prior approval of the Secretary is obtained to do otherwise.
(f) A partial payment is a remittance on a loan in default (as defined in § 36.4202(c)) of any amount less than the full amount due under the terms of the loan and security instruments at the time the remittance is tendered.
(1) Except as provided in paragraph (f)(2) of this section, or upon the express waiver of the Secretary, the holder shall accept any partial payment and either apply it to the obligor's account or identify it with the obligor's account and hold it in a special account pending disposition. When partial payments held for disposition aggregate a full monthly installment, including escrow, they shall be applied to the obligor's account.
(2) A partial payment may be returned to the obligor within 10 calendar days from date of receipt of such payment, with a letter of explanation only if one or more of the following conditions exist:
(i) The property is wholly or partially tenant-occupied and rental payments are not being remitted to the holder for application to the loan account;
(ii) The payment is less than one full monthly installment, including escrows and late charge, if applicable, unless the lesser payment amount has been agreed to under a written repayment plan;
(iii) The payment is less than 50 percent of the total amount then due, unless the lesser payment amount has been agreed to under a written repayment plan;
(iv) The payment is less than the amount agreed to in a written repayment plan;
(v) The amount tendered is in the form of a personal check and the holder has previously notified the obligor in writing that only cash or certified remittances are acceptable;
(vi) A delinquency of any amount has continued for at least 6 months since the account first became delinquent and no written repayment plan has been arranged;
(vii) Foreclosure and/or repossession has been commenced by the taking of the first action required for foreclosure/repossession under local law;
(viii) The holder's lien position would be jeopardized by acceptance of the partial payment.
(3) A failure by the holder to comply with the provisions of this paragraph may result in a partial or total loss of guaranty or insurance pursuant to § 36.4286(b), but such failure shall not constitute a defense to any legal action to terminate the loan.

§ 36.4276
Advances and other charges.
(a) A holder may advance any reasonable amount necessary and proper for the maintenance or repair of the security, or for the payment of accrued taxes, special assessments or other charges which constitute prior liens, or premiums on fire or other hazard insurance against loss of or damage to such property and any such advance so made
may be added to the guaranteed indebtedness. A holder may also advance the one-half of one percent funding fee due on a transfer under 38 U.S.C. 3714 when this is not paid at the time of transfer. All security instruments for loans to which 38 U.S.C. 3714 applies must include a clause authorizing an advance for this purpose if it is not paid at the time of transfer.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3714)
(b) In addition to advances allowable under paragraph (a) of this section, the holder may charge against the proceeds of the sale of the security; against gross amounts collected; or, in the computation of a claim under the guaranty, if lawfully authorized by the loan agreement and subject to § 36.4284, any of the following items actually paid:
(1) Any expense which is reasonably necessary for preservation of the security,
(2) Court costs in a foreclosure or other proper judicial proceeding involving the security,
(3) Other expenses reasonably necessary for collecting the debt, or repossession or liquidation of the security, including a reasonable sales commission to the dealer or sales broker for resale of the security,
(4) Reasonable trustee's fees or commissions paid incident to the sale of real property,
(5) Reasonable amount for legal services actually performed not to exceed 10 percent of the unpaid indebtedness as of the date of the first uncured default, or $850 whichever is less. In no event may the combined total of the amounts claimed for trustee's fees and legal services (paragraphs (b)(4) and (5) of this section) exceed $850.
(6) The cost of a credit report(s) on the debtor(s), which is (are) to be forwarded to the Secretary in connection with the claim,
(7) Reasonable and customary costs of property inspections,
(8) Any other expense or fee that is approved in advance by the Secretary.

(1) Property preservation or repair costs incurred prior to the date of the liquidation appraisal, to the extent that they contributed to the minimum selling price of the property as determined by the Secretary, and subject to the limitation that they do not exceed the actual cost incurred by the holder, and,
(2) Costs of loan termination, including, but not limited to:
(i) The reasonable and customary expense of transporting the home to the site where it will be repaired and/or resold;
(ii) The cost of the liquidation appraisal;

§ 36.4277
Release of security.
(a) Except upon full payment of the indebtedness the holder shall not release a lien or other right in or to property held as security for a guaranteed loan, or grant a fee or other interest in such property, without the prior approval of the Secretary, unless in the opinion of the holder such release does not involve a decrease in the value of the security in excess of $500:
Provided,
That the aggregate of the reduction in the original value of the security resultant from such releases without the Secretary's prior approval does not exceed $500.
(b) Except upon full payment of the indebtedness or upon the prior approval of the Secretary, the holder shall not release a lien under paragraph (a) of this section unless the consideration received for the release is
commensurate with the fair market value of the property released and the entire consideration is applied to the indebtedness, or if encumbrance on other property is accepted in lieu of that released it shall be the holder's duty to acquire such lien on property of substantially equal value which is reasonably capable of serving the purpose for which the property released was utilized.
(c) Failure of the holder to comply with the provisions of this section shall not in itself affect the validity of the title of a purchaser to the property released.
(d) The holder shall notify the Secretary of any such release or substitution of security within 30 days after completion of such transaction.
(e) The release of the personal liability of any obligor on a guaranteed obligation resultant from the act or omission of any holder without the prior approval of the Secretary shall release the obligation of the Secretary as guarantor, except when such act or omission consists of
(1) Failure to establish the debt as a valid claim against the assets of the estate of any deceased obligor, provided no lien for the guaranteed debt is thereby impaired or destroyed; or
(2) An election and appropriate prosecution of legally available effective remedies with respect to the repossession or the liquidation of the security in any case, irrespective of the identity or the survival of the original or of any subsequent debtor, if holder shall have given such notice as required by § 36.4280 and if, after receiving such notice, the Secretary shall have failed to notify the holder within 15 days to proceed in such manner as to effectively preserve the personal liability of the parties liable, or such of them as the Secretary indicates is such notice to the holder; or
(3) The release of an obligor, or obligors, from liability on an obligation secured by a lien on property, which release is an incident of and contemporaneous with the sale of such property to an eligible veteran who assumed such obligation, which assumed obligation is guaranteed on his or her account pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 3712; or
(4) The release of an obligor or obligors as provided in § 36.4279.

§ 36.4278
Servicing procedures for holders.
(a)
Establishment of loan servicing program.
The holder of a loan guaranteed or insured by the Secretary shall develop and maintain a loan servicing program which follows accepted industry standards for servicing of similar type conventional loans. The loan servicing program established pursuant to this section may employ different servicing approaches to fit individual borrower circumstances and avoid establishing a fixed routine. However, it must incorporate each of the provisions specified in paragraphs (b) through (l) of this section.
(b)
Procedures for providing information.
(1) Loan holders shall establish procedures to provide loan information to borrowers, arrange for individual loan consultations upon request and maintain controls to assure prompt responses to inquiries. One or more of the following means of making information readily available to borrowers is required:
(i) An office staffed with trained servicing personnel with access to loan account information located within 200 miles of the property.
(ii) Toll-free telephone service or acceptance of collect telephone calls at an office capable of providing needed information.
(2) All borrowers must be informed of the system available for obtaining answers to loan inquiries, the office from which the needed information may be obtained, and reminded of the system at least annually.
(c)
Statement for income tax purposes.
Within 60 days after the end of each calendar year, the holder shall furnish
to the borrower a statement of the interest paid and, if applicable, a statement of the taxes disbursed from the escrow account during the preceding year. At the borrower's request, the holder shall furnish a statement of the escrow account sufficient to enable the borrower to reconcile the account.
(d)
Change of servicing.
Whenever servicing of a loan guaranteed or insured by the Secretary is transferred from one holder to another, notice of such transfer by both the transferor and transferee, the form and content of such notice, the timing of such notice, the treatment of payments during the period of such transfer, and damages and costs for failure to comply with these requirements shall be governed by the pertinent provisions of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act as administered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development.
(e)
Escrow accounts.
A holder of a loan guaranteed or insured by the Secretary may collect periodic deposits from the borrower for taxes and/or insurance on the security and maintain a tax and insurance escrow account provided such a requirement is authorized under the terms of the security instruments. In maintaining such accounts, the holder shall comply with the pertinent provisions of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act.
(f)
System for servicing delinquent loans.
In addition to the requirements of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act concerning the duties of the loan servicer to respond to borrower inquiries, to protect the borrower's credit rating during a payment dispute period, and to pay damages and costs for noncompliance, holders shall establish a system for servicing delinquent loans which ensures that prompt action is taken to collect amounts due from borrowers and minimize the number of loans in a default status. The holder's servicing system must include the following:
(1) An accounting system which promptly alerts servicing personnel when a loan becomes delinquent;
(2) A collection staff which is trained in techniques of loan servicing and counseling delinquent borrowers to advise borrowers how to cure delinquencies, protect their equity and credit rating and, if the default is insoluble, pursue alternatives to foreclosure;
(3) Procedural guidelines for individual analysis of each delinquency;
(4) Instructions and appropriate controls for sending delinquent notices, assessing late charges, handling partial payments, maintaining servicing histories and evaluating repayment proposals;
(5) Management review procedures for evaluating efforts made to collect the delinquency and the response from the borrower before a decision is made to initiate action to liquidate a loan;
(6) Procedures for reporting delinquencies of 90 days or more and loan terminations to major consumer credit bureaus as specified by the Secretary and for informing borrowers that such action will be taken; and,
(7) Controls to ensure that all notices required to be given to the Secretary on delinquent loans are provided timely and in such form as the Secretary shall require.
(g)
Collection actions.
(1) Holders should employ collection techniques which provide flexibility to adapt to the individual needs and circumstances of each borrower. A variety of collection techniques may be used based on the holder's determination of the most effective means of contact with borrowers during various stages of delinquency. However, at a minimum, the holder's collection procedures must include the following actions:
(i) A written delinquency notice to the borrower(s) requesting immediate payment if a loan installment has not been received within 17 days after the due date. This notice must be mailed no later than the 20th day of the delinquency and state the amount of the payment and of any late charges that are due.
(ii) An effort, concurrent with the written delinquency notice, to establish contact with the borrower(s) by telephone. When talking with the borrower(s), the holder should attempt to determine why payment was not made and emphasize the importance of remitting loan installments as they come due.
(iii) A letter to the borrower(s) if payment has not been received within
30 days after it is due and telephone contact could not be made. This letter should emphasize the seriousness of the delinquency and the importance of taking prompt action to resolve the default. It should also notify the borrower(s) that the loan is in default, state the total amount due and advise the borrower(s) how to contact the holder to make arrangements for curing the default.
(iv) In the event the holder has not established contact with the borrower(s) and has not determined the financial circumstances of the borrower(s) or established a reason for the default or obtained agreement to a repayment plan from the borrower(s), then a face-to-face interview with the borrower(s) or a reasonable effort to arrange such a meeting is required.
(2) The holder must provide a valid explanation of any failure to perform these collection actions when reporting loan defaults to the Secretary. A pattern of such failure may be a basis for sanctions under 38 CFR 36.4216.
(h)
Conducting interviews with delinquent borrowers.
When personal contact with the borrower(s) is established, the holder shall solicit sufficient information to properly evaluate the prospects for curing the default and whether the granting of forbearance or other relief assistance would be appropriate. At a minimum, the holder must make a reasonable effort to establish the following facts:
(1) The reason for the default and whether the reason is a temporary or permanent condition;
(2) The present income and employment of the borrower(s);
(3) The current monthly expenses of the borrower(s) including household and debt obligations;
(4) The current mailing address and telephone number of the borrower(s); and,
(5) A realistic and mutually satisfactory arrangement for curing the default.
(i)
Property inspection.
(1) The holder shall make an inspection of the property securing the loan whenever it becomes aware that the physical condition of the security may be in jeopardy. Unless a repayment agreement is in effect, a property inspection shall also be made:
(i) Before the 60th day of delinquency or before initiating action to liquidate a loan, whichever is earlier; and
(ii) At least once each month after liquidation proceedings have been started unless servicing information shows the property remains owner-occupied.
(2) Whenever a holder obtains information which indicates that a property securing a loan is abandoned, it shall make appropriate arrangements to protect the property from vandalism and the elements. Thereafter, the holder shall schedule inspections at least monthly to prevent unnecessary deterioration due to vandalism, or neglect. With respect to any loan more than 30 days delinquent, a property abandonment must be reported to the Secretary and appropriate action initiated under 36.4280(e) within 15 days after the holder confirms the property is abandoned.
(j)
Collection records.
The holder shall maintain individual file records of collection action on delinquent loans and make such records available to the Secretary for inspection on request. Such collection records shall show:
(1) The dates and content of letters and notices which were mailed to the borrower(s);
(2) Dated summaries of each personal servicing contact and the result of same;
(3) The indicated reason(s) for default; and
(4) The date and result of each property inspection.
(k)
Reporting to the Secretary.
A summary of collection efforts, the information obtained through such efforts and the holder's evaluation of the reason for the default and prospects for resolution of the default must be included in any notice provided to the Secretary pursuant to § 36.4280.
(l)
Quality control procedures.
No later than 180 days after the effective date of this regulation, each loan holder shall establish internal controls to periodically assess the quality of the servicing performed on loans guaranteed by the Secretary and assure that all requirements of this section are being met.
Those procedures must provide for a review of the holder's servicing activities at least annually and include an evaluation of delinquency and foreclosure rates on loans in its portfolio which are guaranteed by the Secretary. As part of its evaluation of delinquency and foreclosure rates, the holder shall:
(1) Collect and maintain appropriate data on delinquency and foreclosure rates to enable the holder to evaluate the effectiveness of its collection efforts;
(2) Determine how its VA delinquency and foreclosure rates compare with rates in various reports published by the industry, investors and others; and
(3) Analyze significant variances between its foreclosure and delinquency rates and those found in available reports and publications and take appropriate corrective action.
(m) Holders shall provide available statistical data on delinquency and foreclosure rates and their analysis of such data to the Secretary upon request.

§ 36.4279
Extensions and reamortizations.
(a) Provided the debtor(s) is (are) a reasonable credit risk(s), as determined by the holder based upon review of the debtor's (s') creditworthiness, including a review of a current credit report(s) on the debtor(s), the terms of repayment of any loan may, by written agreement between the holder and debtor(s), be extended in the event of default, to avoid imminent default, or in any other case where the prior approval of the Secretary is obtained. Except with the prior approval of the Secretary, no such extension shall set a rate of amortization less than that sufficient to fully amortize at least 80 percent of the loan balance so extended within the maximum maturity prescribed for loans of its class.
(b) In the event of a partial prepayment pursuant to § 36.4211, the balance of the indebtedness may, by written agreement between the holder and the debtor(s), be reamortized, provided the reamortization schedule will result in full repayment of the loan within the original maturity, and provided the debtor(s) is (are) a reasonable credit risk(s), as determined by the holder based upon review of the debtor's (s') creditworthiness, including a review of a current credit report(s) on the debtor(s).
(c) Unless the prior approval of the Secretary has been obtained, any extension or reamortization agreed to by a holder which relieves any obligor from liability will release the liability of the Secretary under the guaranty on the entire loan. However, if such release of liability of an obligor results through operation of law by reason of an extension or other act of forbearance, the liability of the Secretary as guarantor will not be affected thereby,
Provided,
The required lien is maintained and the title holder is and will remain liable for the payment of the indebtedness:
And further provided,
That if such extension or act of forbearance will result in the release of the veteran, all delinquent installments, plus any foreclosure expenses which may have been incurred, shall have been fully paid.
(d) The holder shall promptly forward to the Secretary an advice of the terms of any agreement effecting a reamortization or extension of a guaranteed loan, together with cop(y)(ies) of the credit report(s) obtained on the debtor(s).

§ 36.4280
Reporting of defaults.
The holder of any guaranteed loan shall give notice to the Secretary within 15 days after any debtor:
(a) Is in default by reason of nonpayment of two full installments; or
(b) Is in default by failing to comply with any other covenant or obligation of such guaranteed loan which failure persists for a continuing period of 60 days after demand for compliance therewith has been made, except that if the default is due to nonpayment of real estate taxes, the notice shall not be required until the failure to pay when due has persisted for a continuing period of 120 days.
(c) In the event any failure of the months or for more than 1 month on an extended loan, the holder may then or thereafter give the notice in the manner described in paragraph (e) of this section.
(d) The notice prescribed in paragraph (e) of this section may be submitted prior to the time prescribed in paragraph (c) of this section in any case where any material prejudice to the rights of the holder or to the Secretary or hazard to the security warrants more prompt action.
(e) Except upon the express waiver of the Secretary, a holder shall not begin proceedings in court or give notice of sale under power of sale, repossess the security, or accelerate the loan, or otherwise take steps to terminate the debtor's rights in the security until the expiration of 30 days after delivery by certified mail to the Secretary of a notice of intention to take such action; provided, that immediate action as required under 38 CFR 36.4278(i) may be taken if the property to be affected thereby has been abandoned by the debtor, or has been or may be otherwise subjected to extraordinary waste or hazard.
(f) The notice required under subparagraph (e) of this paragraph shall also be provided to the original veteran-borrower and any other liable obligors by certified mail within 30 days after such notice is provided to the Secretary in all cases in which the current owner of the property is not the original veteran-borrower. A failure by the holder to make a good faith effort to comply with the provisions of this subparagraph may result in a partial or total loss of guaranty pursuant to VA Regulation 36.4286(b), but such failure shall not constitute a defense to any legal action to terminate the loan. A good faith effort will include:
(1) A search of the holder's automated and physical loan record systems to identify the name and current or last address of the original veteran and any other liable obligors;
(2) A search of the holder's automated and physical loan record systems to identify sufficient information (e.g., Social Security Number) to perform a routine trace inquiry through a major consumer credit bureau;
(3) Conducting the trace inquiry using an in-house credit reporting terminal;
(4) Obtaining the results of the inquiry;
(5) Mailing the required notices and concurrently providing the Secretary with the names and addresses of all obligors identified and sent notice; and
(6) Documentation of the holder's records.

§ 36.4281
Refunding of loans in default.
Upon receiving a notice of default the Secretary may at any time prior to the termination of the borrower's interest in the property require the holder upon penalty of otherwise losing the guaranty to transfer and assign the loan and the security therefor to the Secretary or to another designated by him or her upon receipt of payment of the balance of the indebtedness remaining unpaid to the date of such assignment. Such assignment may be made without recourse but the transferor shall not thereby be relieved from the provisions of § 36.4286.

§ 36.4282
Legal proceedings (notice of repossession).
(a) When the holder institutes suit or otherwise becomes a party in any legal or equitable proceeding brought on or in connection with the guaranteed indebtedness, or involving title to, or other lien on, the security, such holder, within the time that would be required if the Secretary were a party to the proceeding, shall deliver to the Secretary, by mail or otherwise, by making such delivery to the loan guaranty officer at the office which granted the guaranty, or other office to which the holder has been notified the file is transferred, a copy of every procedural paper filed on behalf of holder, and shall also so deliver, as promptly as possible, a copy of each similar pleading served on holder or filed in the cause by any other party thereto. Notice of, or motion for, continuance and orders thereon are excepted from the foregoing.
(b) A copy of a notice of sale under power by a holder or one acting at his or her behest (e.g., trustee or public official) shall be similarly delivered to the Secretary at or before the date of first publication, posting, or other notice, but in any event, except in emergency or when waived by the Secretary, not less than 10 days prior to date of sale. Copy of any other notice of sale served on the holder or of which he or she has knowledge shall be similarly delivered to the Secretary, including any such notice of sale under tax or other superior lien or any judicial sale.
(c) The procedure prescribed in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section shall not be applicable in any proceeding to which the Secretary is a party, after the Secretary's appearance shall have been entered therein by a duly authorized attorney.
(d) In any legal or equitable proceeding (including probate and bankruptcy proceedings) to which the Secretary is a party, original process and any other process prior to appearance, proper to be served on the Secretary, shall be delivered to the loan guaranty officer of the office of the Department of Veterans Affairs having jurisdiction of the area in which the court is situated. Within the time required by applicable law, or rule of court, the Secretary will cause appropriate special or general appearance to be entered in the cause by the Secretary's authorized attorney.
(e) After appearance of the Secretary by attorney, all process and notice otherwise proper to serve on the Secretary before or after judgment, if served on the Secretary's attorney of record shall have the same effect as if the Secretary were personally served within the jurisdiction of the court.
(f) If following a default the holder does not begin appropriate action within 30 days after requested in writing by the Secretary to do so, or does not prosecute such action with reasonable diligence, the Secretary shall have the option to intervene in, or begin and prosecute to completion any action or proceeding, in the Secretary's name or in the name of the holder, which the Secretary deems necessary or appropriate, and may fix a date beyond which no further charges may be included in the computation of the guaranty claim. The Secretary shall pay, in advance if necessary, any court costs or other expenses incurred by the Secretary, or properly taxed against the Secretary, in any such action to which the Secretary is a party, but may charge the same, and also a reasonable amount for legal services, against the guaranteed indebtedness, or the proceeds of the sale of the security to the same extent as the holder (see § 36.4276), or otherwise collect from the holder any such expenses incurred by the Secretary because of the neglect or failure of the holder to take or complete proper action. The rights and remedies herein reserved are without prejudice to any other rights, remedies, or defenses, in law or in equity, available to the Secretary.
(g) The holder, no later than 10 days after it has repossessed a property, must advise the Secretary of such repossession. The holder shall proceed thereafter, within a reasonable time after repossession, to terminate the debtors' rights in the property. If it is a legal requirement or if the Secretary requires that the debtors' rights be terminated by public sale, the holder shall follow the procedures set forth in paragraph (b) of this section. Otherwise, the holder shall proceed in the manner set forth in § 36.4283(f).
[36 FR 1253, Jan. 27, 1971, as amended at 47 FR 12965, Mar. 26, 1982; 53 FR 34296, Sept. 6, 1988]
§ 36.4283
Foreclosure or repossession.
(a) Upon receipt by the Secretary of notice of a judicial or statutory sale, or other public sale under power of sale contained in the loan instruments, to liquidate any security for a guaranteed loan, the Secretary may specify in advance of such sale the minimum amount which shall be credited to the indebtedness of the borrower on account of the value of the security to be sold, subject to the provisions of paragraphs (a)(1), (2), (3), and (4) of this section:
(1) If a minimum amount has been specified in relation to a sale of the property and the holder is the successful bidder at the sale for an amount not in excess of such specified amount the
holder shall dispose of the property in the manner set forth in paragraph (f) and the amount realized from the resale of the property shall govern in the final accounting for determining the rights and liabilities of the holder and the Secretary.
(2) If a minimum amount has been specified by the Secretary and:
(i) A third party is the successful bidder at the sale for an amount equal to or in excess of that specified, the holder shall credit to the indebtedness the net proceeds of the sale.
(ii) A third party is the successful bidder at the sale for an amount less than that specified, the holder shall credit to the indebtedness the amount specified less expenses allowable under § 36.4276.
(iii) The holder is the successful bidder at the sale for an amount in excess of the specified amount the indebtedness shall be credited with the net proceeds of the sale or an amount established in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section, whichever is the greater, unless the bid in excess of the specified amount was made pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section.
(3) If a minimum amount has not been specified by the Secretary under paragraph (a)(1) or (2) of this section, and the Secretary advised the holder that it did not intend to specify an amount, and the property is purchased at the sale by a third party, the holder shall credit against the indebtedness the net proceeds of the sale except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section. However, if the property is purchased at the sale by the holder, the indebtedness will be credited with the net proceeds of the sale or an amount established in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section, whichever is greater.
(4) The holder shall notify the Secretary of the results of the sale within 10 days after the sale is completed.
(b) In the event that any real property which is security for a guaranteed loan is to be acquired by a holder in a manner other than as provided in paragraph (a) or (c) of this section (e.g., by strict foreclosure or by the termination without a public sale of the purchaser's interest in a land sale contract), the holder shall notify the Secretary of the acquisition within 15 days thereafter and account to the Secretary for the proceeds of the liquidation of the security in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section.
(c) When a debtor proposes to convey or transfer any property to a holder to avoid foreclosure or other judicial, contractual, or statutory disposition of the obligation or of the security, the consent of the Secretary to the terms of such proposal shall be obtained in advance of such conveyance or transfer. If the Secretary consents thereto, the holder may acquire the property and account to the Secretary for the proceeds of the liquidation of the security in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section.
(d) If a minimum bid is required under applicable State law, or decree of foreclosure or order of sale, or other lawful order or decree, the holder may bid an amount not exceeding such amount legally required. If an amount has been specified by the Secretary and the holder is the successful bidder for an amount not exceeding the amount legally required, such specified amount shall govern for the purpose of this section.
(e) If the Secretary has specified an amount as provided in this section, and the holder learns of any material damage to the property occurring prior to the foreclosure sale or to the acceptance of a deed in lieu of foreclosure or prior to any other event to which such specified amount is applicable, the holder shall promptly advise the Secretary of such damage. Also, if the holder acquires or repossesses the property and the holder learns of any material damage to it, the holder shall promptly advise the Secretary of such damage.
(f) When the security for a guaranteed loan is acquired by the holder through foreclosure or otherwise, the holder shall resell the property within a reasonable time and may thereafter submit its claim under the guaranty. The Secretary, upon receipt of a notice of acquisition, shall determine the current reasonable value of the property and advise the holder of the minimum selling price that will be acceptable in any accounting with the Secretary upon liquidation of the security.
(1) If the holder resells the property for an amount at least equal to the minimum selling price, it shall credit the indebtedness with the proceeds of the sale.
(2) If the holder is unable to resell the property for an amount at least equal to the minimum selling price after exposure to the market for a reasonable period of time, the holder may submit to the Secretary a written advice setting forth the price, terms, conditions and expenses of any offer received. The Secretary shall thereupon:
(i) Assent to the resale of the property upon the terms of such offer, in which event the holder will credit the indebtedness with the proceeds of the sale, or
(ii) Review the minimum selling price previously established and, if appropriate, provide the holder with a reduced minimum selling price at which the property shall be further exposed to the market.
(3) If the holder resells the property and finances the sale under the terms of a new security agreement and note, the Secretary may, pursuant to paragraph (f)(3)(iv) of this section, agree to indemnify the holder against loss on the new loan.
(i) The Secretary's maximum liability under the indemnity agreement shall be the percentage of the loan originally guaranteed applied to the indebtedness as of the date of claim computation as set forth in § 36.4284(a), or the amount originally guaranteed, or the amount of the Secretary's liability under a preexisting indemnity agreement, whichever is less.
(ii) In the event the proceeds of sale are less than the total indebtedness, the Secretary may pay a partial claim for the difference between the indebtedness and the proceeds of sale and thereafter agree to indemnify the holder for the amount of the maximum liability as of the date of claim computation, less the amount of claim paid.
(iii) Subject to the limitation that the total amount payable under an indemnity agreement shall in no event exceed the Secretary's maximum liability, the remaining liability will be continued as a percentage of the new loan amount increasing or decreasing pro rata with any increase or decrease in the balance of the loan obligation.
(iv) The Secretary shall execute an indemnity agreement evidencing the amount and terms of the indemnity liability, provided:
(A) The Secretary has determined that resale of the security under an indemnity agreement is in the best interest of the Government, and the holder has obtained the prior approval of the Secretary;
(B) The terms of repayment of the proposed loan bear a proper relationship to the borrower's present and anticipated income and expenses, and the borrower is a satisfactory credit risk;
(C) The borrower executes an agreement establishing liability to the Secretary for the amount of any claim paid under the indemnity agreement;
(D) The term of the proposed loan does not exceed the maximum term allowable under § 36.4204(c)(4);
(E) The interest rate charged the borrower does not exceed the maximum rate allowable under § 36.4212 as of the date of closing pursuant to the indemnity agreement;
(F) The holder agrees to comply with VA manufactured home regulations as if the original loan had not been terminated.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3712(g))
(4) If the holder has not resold the property, it may elect to submit its claim under Loan Guaranty within 60 days of the date of the Secretary's written advice of the minimum selling price.
(i) For purposes of computation of a claim submitted pursuant to this paragraph, and subject to the limitation that the maximum amount of claim payable shall in no event exceed the amount originally guaranteed, the amount payable on a claim for the guaranty shall be the percentage of the loan originally guaranteed applied to the indebtedness computed as of the date the holder acquired the security. Further:
(A) The minimum selling price determined by the Secretary and provided to the holder shall be credited to the indebtedness as proceeds of sale; or
(B) If no minimum selling price is provided then the current reasonable
value of the property as determined by the Secretary and provided to the holder shall be credited to the indebtedness as proceeds of sale; and
The amount payable on the claim shall in no event exceed the remaining balance of the indebtedness.
(ii) Allowable post-acquisition expenditures or costs paid by the holder which may be included in the accounting with the Secretary are limited to those specified in § 36.4276(c).
(g) If at the end of 6 months from the date of acquisition the holder has been unable to resell the property and no claim has been filed pursuant to paragraph (f)(4) of this section, a claim may be submitted under the guaranty and the Secretary will pay to the holder upon submission of such claim:
(1) The difference between the appraised value of the property as determined by the Secretary and the indebtedness including those costs allowable under § 36.4276 and the costs of repossessing the manufactured home not to exceed $100, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to the applicable cutoff date as set forth in § 36.4284(a) at the maximum rate allowable. For loans guaranteed prior to May 8, 1984, the Secretary will also pay accrued interest at a rate of 6 percent from such cutoff date to the date of claim but not to exceed 60 days. For loans guaranteed on or after May 8, 1984, the Secretary will pay accrued interest at a rate 4.75 percent below the contract interest rate from such cutoff date to the date of claim but not to exceed 90 days.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3712(g))
(2) The amount of the guaranty payable on the total outstanding indebtedness as of the applicable cutoff date set forth in § 36.4284(a), whichever is less.
(h) If the property securing the guaranteed loan is acquired by a holder pursuant to paragraph (a), (b) or (c) of this section, or § 36.4282(g), the following provisions shall apply:
(1) The holder's notice to the Secretary after acquisition shall state the amount of the successful bid at public sale, or in the event of a repossession or a voluntary conveyance, the date of acquisition.
(2) The holder's notice after acquisition shall also provide complete occupancy data. Except with the prior approval of the Secretary the holder shall not rent the property to a new tenant nor extend the terms of an existing tenancy on other than a month-to-month basis.
(3) Except with the prior approval of the Secretary, any taxes or special assessments which constitute prior liens due and payable after acquisition of the property by the holder shall be paid by the holder sufficiently in advance of the payment due dates to avoid penalties and to take advantage of any discounts. The holder also may include in its accounting with the Secretary any expenditures for repairs made that were reasonably necessary to properly maintain or refurbish the security property, not to exceed $400. Expenditures in excess of $400 shall not be made without the prior approval of the Secretary.
(4) As between the holder and the Secretary, the holder shall be responsible for any loss due to damage to or destruction of the property, ordinary wear and tear excepted, from the date of repossession or acquisition by the holder to the date the property has been liquidated.
(5) The holder shall include as credits in its accounting with the Secretary all rentals and other income collected from the property and insurance proceeds or refunds subsequent to the date of acquisition by the holder.
(i) Definitions: (1) The terms
date of sale
or
date of acquisition
as used in this section are defined as the date of the event (e.g., date of repossession, date of sale confirmation when required under local practice, date of acceptance of deed in case of voluntary conveyance, etc.) which fixes the rights of the parties in the property.
(2) The term
property
or
real property
as used in this section shall include:
(i) A leasehold estate therein which at the time of closing the loan was of not less duration than that prescribed by § 36.4253, and
(ii) The rights derived by the holder through a foreclosure sale of real estate whether or not such rights constitute an estate in real property under local law.
(j) A claim for the guaranty must include a cop(y)(ies) of a current credit report(s) on the debtor(s).
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3712)
(k) The provisions of this section shall not be in derogation of any rights which the Secretary may have under § 36.4286. The Under Secretary for Benefits, or the Executive Director, Loan Guaranty Service, may authorize any deviation from the provisions of this section, within the limitations prescribed in 38 U.S.C. chapter 37, which may be necessary or desirable to accomplish the objectives of this section if such deviation is made necessary by reason of any laws or practice in any State, Territory, or the District of Columbia:
Provided,
That no such deviation shall impair the rights of any holder not consenting thereto with respect to loans made or approved prior to the date the holder is notified of such action.

§ 36.4284
Computation of guaranty claims.
(a) Subject to the limitation that the maximum amount payable shall in no event exceed the amount originally guaranteed, the amount payable on a claim for the guaranty shall be the percentage of the loan originally guaranteed applied to the indebtedness computed as of the date of claim but not later than (1) the date of judgment or of decree of foreclosure; or (2) in nonjudicial foreclosures, the date of publication of the first notice of sale; or (3) in cases in which the security is repossessed without a judgment, decree, or foreclosure, the date the holder repossesses the security; or (4) if no security is available, the date of claim but not more than 6 months after the first uncured default. Deposits or other credits or setoffs including any escrowed or earmarked funds legally applicable to the indebtedness on the date of the claim computation shall be applied in reduction of the indebtedness upon which the claim is based.
(b) Credits accruing from the proceeds of a sale or other disposition of the security shall be reported to the Secretary incident to such submission, and the amount payable on the claim shall in no event exceed the remaining balance of the indebtedness.
(c) Any allowable expenditures or costs, paid by the holder, and any accrued and unpaid interest to the applicable cutoff date as set forth in paragraph (a) of this section at the maximum rate allowable, may be deducted from the proceeds of the sale of the property, or may be included in the accounting to the Secretary on such loan. For loans guaranteed prior to May 8, 1984, the holder may also either deduct from sales proceeds, or include in the accounting, accrued interest at a rate of 6 percent from such cutoff date to the date of resale or other liquidation but not to exceed 60 days. For loans guaranteed on or after May 8, 1984, the holder may also either deduct from sales proceeds, or include in the accounting, accrued interest at a rate 4.75 percent below the contract interest rate from such cutoff date to the date of resale or other liquidation but not to exceed 90 days.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3712(g))
(d) In computing the indebtedness for the purpose of filing a claim for payment of a guaranty, or in the event of a transfer of the loan under § 36.4281, or other accounting to the Secretary, the holder shall not be entitled to treat repayments theretofore made, as liquidated damages, or rentals, or otherwise than as payments on the indebtedness, notwithstanding any provision in the note, or mortgage, or otherwise, to the contrary.
(e) Appropriate computation of the guaranty, proceeds of liquidation, and allowable costs for claims filed under § 36.4283(f)(4) are specified in § 36.4276(c).
[36 FR 1253, Jan. 27, 1971, as amended at 49 FR 22082, May 25, 1984; 58 FR 37861, July 14, 1993]
§ 36.4285
Subrogation and indemnity.
(a) The Secretary shall be subrogated to the contract and the lien or other
rights of the holder to the extent of any sum paid on a guaranty, which right shall be junior to the holder's rights as against the debtor or the encumbered property until the holder shall have received the full amount payable under the contract with the debtor except that where the holder has entered into a recourse and/or repurchase or indemnity agreement with a dealer or servicer or other entity and the Department of Veterans Affairs pays a claim under guaranty to the holder the Department of Veterans Affairs will not be subrogated to any rights the holder may have under the recourse and/or repurchase or indemnity agreement. No partial or complete release by a creditor shall impair the rights of the Secretary with respect to the debtor's obligation.
(b) The holder, upon request, shall execute, acknowledge, and deliver an appropriate instrument tendered the holder for that purpose, evidencing any payment received from the Secretary and the Secretary's resulting right of subrogation.
(c) The Secretary may cause the instrument required by paragraph (b) of this section to be filed for record in the Office of the Recorder of Deeds, or other appropriate office of the proper county, town, or State, in accordance with the applicable State law.
(d) Any amounts paid by the Secretary on account of the liabilities of any veteran guaranteed under the provisions of 38 U.S.C. 3712 shall constitute a debt owing to the United States by such veteran.
(e) Whenever any veteran disposes of residential property securing a guaranteed loan obtained under 38 U.S.C. 3712, and for which the commitment to make the loan was made prior to March 1, 1988, the Secretary, upon application made by such veteran, shall issue to the veteran a release relieving him or her of all further liability to the Secretary on account of such loan (including liability for any loss resulting from any default of the transferee or any subsequent purchaser of such property) if the Secretary has determined, after such investigation as the Secretary may deem appropriate, that there has been compliance with the conditions prescribed in 38 U.S.C. 3713(a). The assumption of full liability for repayment of the loan by the transferee of the property must be evidenced by an agreement in writing in such form as the Secretary may require. Release of the veteran from liability to the Secretary will not impair or otherwise affect the Secretary's guaranty on the loan, or the liability of the veteran to the holder. Any release of liability granted to a veteran by the Secretary shall inure to the spouse of such veteran. The release of the veteran from liability to the Secretary will constitute the Secretary's prior approval to a release of the veteran from liability on the loan by the holder thereof. This release will not result in the veteran being entitled to further loan benefits unless the requirements of § 36.4203 are met.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3713, 3714)
(f) If, on or after July 1, 1972, any veteran disposes of residential property securing a guaranteed loan obtained by him or her under 38 U.S.C. 3712, without securing a release from liability with respect to such loan under 38 U.S.C. 3713(a) and a default subsequently occurs which results in liability of the veteran to the Secretary on account of the loan, the Secretary may relieve the veteran of such liability if the Secretary determines that:
(1) A transferee either immediate or remote is legally liable to the Secretary for the debt of the original veteran-borrower established after the termination of the loan, and
(2) The original loan was current at the time such transferee acquired the property, and
(3) The transferee who is liable to the Secretary is found to have been a satisfactory credit risk at the time he or she acquired the property.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3713(b))
(g) If a veteran or any other person disposes of residential property securing a guaranteed or insured loan for which a commitment was made on or after March 1, 1988, and the veteran or other person notifies the loan holder in writing before disposing of the property, the veteran or other person shall be relieved of all further liability to the Secretary with respect to the loan
(including liability for any loss resulting from any default of the purchaser or any subsequent owner of the property) and the application for assumption shall be approved if the holder determines that:
(1) The proposed purchaser is creditworthy;
(2) The proposed purchaser is contractually obligated to assume the loan and the liability to indemnify the Department of Veterans Affairs for the amount of any claim paid under the guaranty as a result of a default on the loan, or has already done so; and,
(3) The payments on the loan are current.
Should these requirements be satisfied, the holder may also release the selling veteran or other person from liability on the loan. This does not apply if the approval for the assumption is granted upon special appeal to avoid immediate foreclosure.

§ 36.4286
Partial or total loss of guaranty.
(a) There shall be no guaranty liability on the part of the Secretary in respect to any loan as to which a signature to the note, the mortgage or other security instrument is a forgery. Except as to a holder who acquired the loan instrument before maturity, for value, and without notice, and who has not directly or by agent participated in the fraud, or in the misrepresentation hereinafter specified, any willful and material misrepresentation or fraud by the lender, or by a holder, or the agent of either, in procuring the guaranty shall relieve the Secretary of liability, or shall constitute a defense against liability on account of the guaranty of the loan in respect to which the willful misrepresentation, or the fraud, is practiced:
Provided,
That if a misrepresentation, although material, is not made willfully, or with fraudulent intent, it shall have only the consequences prescribed in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.
(b) In taking security required by 38 U.S.C. 3712 and the § 36.4200 series, a holder shall obtain the required lien on real property the title to which is such as to be acceptable to prudent lending institutions, informed buyers, title companies, and attorneys, generally in the community in which the property is situated:
Provided,
That a title will not be unacceptable by reason of any of the limitations on the quantum or quality of the property or title stated in § 36.4253. If such holder fails in this respect or fails to comply with any of the requirements of 38 U.S.C. 3712 and the § 36.4200 series with respect to:
(1) Obtaining and retaining a lien of the dignity prescribed on all property upon which a lien is required by 38 U.S.C. 3712 or the § 36.4200 series,
(2) Inclusion of power to substitute trustees,
(3) The procurement and maintenance of insurance coverage,
(4) Advice to Secretary as to default,
(5) Notice of intention to begin action,
(6) Notice to the Secretary in any suit or action, or notice of sale,
(7) The release, conveyance, substitution, or exchange of security,
(8) Lack of legal capacity of a party to the transaction incident to which the guaranty is granted,
(9) Failure of the lender to see that any escrowed or earmarked account is expended in accordance with the agreement,
(10) The taking into consideration of limitations upon the quantum or quality of the estate or property,
(11) Any other requirement of 38 U.S.C. 3712 or the § 36.4200 series which does not by the terms of said section or regulations result in relieving the Secretary of all liability with respect to the loan,
no claim on the guaranty shall be paid on account of the loan with respect to which such failure occurred, or in respect to which an unwillful misrepresentation occurred, until the amount by which the ultimate liability of the Secretary would thereby be increased has been ascertained. The burden of proof shall be upon the holder to establish that no increase of ultimate liability is attributable to such failure or misrepresentation. The amount of increased liability of the Secretary shall be offset by deduction from the amount
of the guaranty otherwise payable, or if consequent upon loss of security shall be offset by crediting to the indebtedness the amount of the impairment as proceeds of the sale of security in the final accounting to the Secretary. To the extent the loss resultant from the failure of misrepresentation prejudices the Secretary's right of subrogation acceptance by the holder of the guaranty payment shall subordinate the holder's right to those of the Secretary.
(c) If after the payment of a guaranty, or after a loan is transferred pursuant to § 36.4281, the fraud, misrepresentation, or failure to comply with the regulations concerning guaranty of loans to veterans as provided in this section is discovered and the Secretary determines that an increased loss to the Government resulted therefrom, the transferee or person to whom such payment was made shall be liable to the Secretary for the amount of the loss caused by such misrepresentation or failure.
§ 36.4287
Substitution of trustees.
In jurisdictions in which valid, any deed of trust or mortgage securing a guaranteed loan, if it names trustees or confers a power of sale otherwise, shall contain a provision empowering any holder of the indebtedness to appoint substitute trustees or other person with such power to sell, who shall succeed to all the rights, powers, and duties of the trustees, or other person, originally designated.

Net loss (insured loans).
Net loss on insured loans means the indebtedness, plus any other charges authorized under § 36.4314, remaining unsatisfied after the liquidation of all available security and recourse to all intangible rights of the holder against those obligated on the debt.
Net value.
The fair market value of real property, minus an amount representing the costs that the Secretary estimates would be incurred by VA in acquiring and disposing of the property. The number to be subtracted from the fair market value will be calculated by multiplying the fair market value by the current cost factor. The cost factor used will be the most recent percentage of the fair market value that VA calculated and published in the Notices section of the

(it is intended that this percentage will be calculated annually). In computing this cost factor, VA will determine the average operating expenses and losses (or gains) on resale incurred for properties acquired under § 36.4323 which were sold during the preceding fiscal year and the average administrative cost to VA associated with the property management activity. The final net value derived from this calculation will be stated as a whole dollar amount (any fractional amount will be rounded up to the next whole dollar).

The average administrative costs will be determined by:
(A) Dividing the total cost for VA personnel and overhead salary and benefits costs by the average number of properties on hand and adjusting this figure based on the average holding time for properties sold during the preceding fiscal year; and
(B) Dividing the figure calculated in paragraph (3)(i)(A) of this definition by the VBA ratio of personal services costs to total obligations.
(ii) The three cost averages will be added to the average loss (or gain) on property sold during the preceding fiscal year (based on the average property purchase price) and the sum will be divided by the average fair market value at the time of acquisition for properties which were sold during the preceding fiscal year to derive the percentage to be used in estimating net value.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3732)

Registered mail.
The term registered mail wherever used in the regulations concerning guaranty or insurance of loans to veterans shall include certified mail.
Repairs.
Any alteration of existing improved realty or equipment which is necessary or advisable for protective, safety or restorative purposes.

VA will generally issue guaranty claims and other payments to the servicer, who will be responsible for forwarding funds to the holder in accordance with its servicing agreement. Incentives under § 36.4319 will generally be paid directly to the servicer based on its performance under that section and in accordance with its tier ranking under § 36.4318.

§ 36.4302
Computation of guaranties or insurance credits.
(a) With respect to a loan to a veteran guaranteed under 38 U.S.C. 3710 the guaranty shall not exceed the lesser of the dollar amount of entitlement available to the veteran or—
(1) 50 percent of the original principal loan amount where the loan amount is not more than $45,000; or
(2) $22,500 where the original principal loan exceeds $45,000, but is not more than $56,250; or
(3) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, the lesser of $36,000 or 40 percent of the original principal loan amount where the loan amount exceeds $56,250; or
(4) The lesser of $60,000 or 25 percent of the original principal loan amount where the loan amount exceeds $144,000 and the loan is for the purchase or construction of a home or the purchase of a condominium unit.
(b) With respect to an interest rate reduction refinancing loan guaranteed under 38 U.S.C. 3710(a)(8), (a)(9)(B)(i), or (a)(11), the dollar amount of guaranty may not exceed the greater of the original guaranty amount of the loan being refinanced, or 25 percent of the refinancing loan amount.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3703, 3710)
(c) With respect to a loan for an energy efficient mortgage guaranteed under 38 U.S.C. 3710(d), the amount of the guaranty shall be in the same proportion as would have been provided if the energy efficient improvements were not added to the loan amount, and there shall be no additional charge to the veteran's entitlement as a result of the increased guaranty amount.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3703, 3710)
(d) An amount equal to 15 percent of the original principal amount of each insured loan shall be credited to the insurance account of the lender and shall
be charged against the guaranty entitlement of the borrower: Provided, That no loan may be insured unless the borrower has sufficient entitlement remaining to permit such credit.
(e) Subject to the provisions of § 36.4303(g), the following formulas shall govern the computation of the amount of the guaranty or insurance entitlement which remains available to an eligible veteran after prior use of entitlement:
(1) If a veteran previously secured a nonrealty (business) loan, the amount of nonrealty entitlement used is doubled and subtracted from $36,000. The sum remaining is the amount of available entitlement for use, except that:
(i) Entitlement may be increased by up to $24,000 if the loan amount exceeds $144,000 and the loan is for purchase or construction of a home or purchase of a condominium; and
(ii) Entitlement for manufactured home loans that are to be guaranteed under 38 U.S.C. 3712 may not exceed $20,000.
(2) If a veteran previously secured a realty (home) loan, the amount of realty (home) loan entitlement used is subtracted from $36,000. The sum remaining is the amount of available entitlement for use, except that:
(i) Entitlement may be increased by up to $24,000 if the loan amount exceeds $144,000 and the loan is for purchase or construction of a home or purchase of a condominium; and
(ii) Entitlement for manufactured home loans that are to be guaranteed under 38 U.S.C. 3712 may not exceed $20,000.
(3) If a veteran previously secured a manufactured home loan under 38 U.S.C. 3712, the amount of entitlement used for that loan is subtracted from $36,000. The sum remaining is the amount of available entitlement for home loans and the sum remaining may be increased by up to $24,000 if the loan amount exceeds $144,000 and the loan is for purchase or construction of a home or purchase of a condominium. To determine the amount of entitlement available for manufactured home loans processed under 38 U.S.C. 3712, the amount of entitlement previously used for that purpose is subtracted from $20,000. The sum remaining is the amount of available entitlement for use for manufactured home loan purposes under 38 U.S.C. 3712.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3703)
(f) For the purpose of computing the remaining guaranty or insurance benefit to which a veteran is entitled, loans guaranteed prior to February 1, 2008 shall be taken into consideration as if made subsequent thereto.
(g) A loan eligible for insurance may be either guaranteed or insured at the option of the borrower and the lender, provided that if the Secretary is not advised of the exercise of such option at the time the loan is reported pursuant to § 36.4303, such loan will not be eligible for insurance.
(h) A guaranty is reduced or increased pro rata with any deduction or increase in the amount of the guaranteed indebtedness, but in no event will the amount payable on a guaranty exceed the amount of the original guaranty, except where the guaranty has been increased under § 36.4315, or the percentage of the total indebtedness corresponding to that of the original guaranty whichever is less. However, on a graduated payment mortgage loan, the percentage of guaranty applicable to the original loan amount pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section shall apply to the loan indebtedness to the extent scheduled deferred interest is added to principal during the graduation period without regard to the original maximum dollar amount of guaranty.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3703(b) and (d))
(i) The amount of any guaranty or the amount credited to a lender's insurance account in relation to any insured loan shall be charged against the original or remainder of the guaranty benefit of the borrower. Complete or partial liquidation, by payment or otherwise, of the veteran's guaranteed or insured indebtedness does not increase the remainder of the guaranty benefit, if any, otherwise available to the veteran. When the maximum amount of guaranty or insurance legally available to a veteran shall have been granted, no further guaranty or insurance is available to the veteran.
(j) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (i) of this section, in computing the aggregate amount of guaranty or insurance housing loan entitlement available to a veteran under this chapter, the Secretary may exclude the amount of guaranty or insurance housing loan entitlement used for any guaranteed, insured, or direct loan under any one of the following circumstances:
(1)(i) The property which secured the loan has been disposed of by the veteran or has been destroyed by fire or other natural hazard; and
(ii) The loan has been repaid in full; or, the Secretary has been released from liability as to the loan; or, if the Secretary has suffered a loss on such loan, the loss has been paid in full.
(2) A veteran-transferee has agreed to assume the outstanding balance on the loan and consented to the use of the veteran-transferee's entitlement, to the extent that the entitlement of the veteran-transferor had been used originally, in place of the veteran-transferor's for the guaranteed, insured, or direct loan, and the veteran-transferee otherwise meets the requirements of this chapter.
(3)(i) The loan has been repaid in full; and
(ii) The loan for which the veteran seeks to use entitlement under this chapter is secured by the same property which secured the loan referred to in the preceding paragraph (j)(3)(i) of this paragraph.
(4) In a case not covered by (j)(1) or (j)(2) of this section, the Secretary may, one time per veteran, exclude entitlement used if:
(i) The loan has been repaid in full and, if the Secretary has suffered a loss on the loan, the loss has been paid in full; or
(ii) The Secretary has been released from liability as to the loan and, if the Secretary has suffered a loss on the loan, the loss has been paid in full.
(k) The Secretary may, in any case involving circumstances that the Secretary deems appropriate, waive one or more of the requirements set forth in paragraph (j)(1) of this section.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3702(b), 3710)
(l)(1) The amount of guaranty entitlement, available and unused, of an eligible unmarried surviving spouse (whose eligibility does not result from his or her own service) is determinable in the same manner as in the case of any veteran, and any entitlement which the decedent (who was his or her spouse) used shall be disregarded. A certificate as to the eligibility of such surviving spouse, issued by the Secretary, shall be a condition precedent to the guaranty or insurance of any loan made to a surviving spouse in such capacity.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3701(a))
(2) An unmarried surviving spouse who was a co-obligor under an existing VA guaranteed, insured or direct loan shall be considered to be a veteran eligible for an interest rate reduction refinancing loan pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 3710(a)(8) or (9)(B)(i).

§ 36.4303
Reporting requirements.
(a) With respect to loans automatically guaranteed under 38 U.S.C. 3703(a)(1), evidence of the guaranty will be issuable to a lender of a class described under 38 U.S.C. 3702(d) if the loan is reported to the Secretary not later than 60 days following full disbursement and upon the certification of the lender that:
(1) No default exists thereunder that has continued for more than 30 days;
(2) Except for acquisition and improvement loans as defined in § 36.4301, any construction, repairs, alterations, or improvements effected subsequent to the appraisal of reasonable value, and paid for out of the proceeds of the loan, which have not been inspected and approved upon completion by a compliance inspector designated by the Secretary, have been completed properly in full accordance with the plans and specifications upon which the original appraisal was based; and any deviations or changes of identity in said property have been approved as required in § 36.4304 concerning guaranty or insurance of loans to veterans;
(3) The loan conforms otherwise with the applicable provisions of 38 U.S.C. chapter 37 and of the regulations concerning guaranty or insurance of loans to veterans.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3703(c)(1))
(b) Loans made pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 3703(a), although not entitled to automatic insurance thereunder, may, when made by a lender of a class described in 38 U.S.C. 3702(d)(1), be reported for issuance of an insurance credit.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3702(d), 3703(a)(2))
(c) Each loan proposed to be made to an eligible veteran by a lender not within a class described in 38 U.S.C. 3702(d) shall be submitted to the Secretary for approval prior to closing. Lenders described in 38 U.S.C. 3702(d) shall have the optional right to submit any loan for such prior approval. The Secretary, upon determining any loan so submitted to be eligible for a guaranty, or for insurance, will issue a certificate of commitment with respect thereto.
(d) A certificate of commitment shall entitle the holder to the issuance of the evidence of guaranty or insurance upon the ultimate actual payment of the full proceeds of the loan for the purposes described in the original report and upon the submission within 60 days thereafter of a supplemental report showing that fact and:
(1) The identity of any property purchased therewith,
(2) That all property purchased or acquired with the proceeds of the loan has been encumbered as required by the regulations concerning guaranty or insurance of loans to veterans,
(3) Except for acquisition and improvement loans as defined in § 36.4301(c), any construction, repairs, alterations, or improvements paid for out of the proceeds of the loan, which have not been inspected and approved subsequent to completion by a compliance inspector designated by the Secretary, have been completed properly in full accordance with the plans and specifications upon which the original appraisal was based; and that any deviations or changes of identity in said property have been approved as required by § 36.4304, and
(4) That the loan conforms otherwise with the applicable provisions of 38 U.S.C. chapter 37 and the regulations concerning guaranty or insurance of loans to veterans.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3703(c)(1))
(e) Upon the failure of the lender to report in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (d) of this section, the certificate of commitment shall have no further effect, or the amount of guaranty or insurance shall be reduced pro rata, as may be appropriate under the facts of the case:
Provided
, nevertheless, that if the loan otherwise meets the requirements of this section, said certificate of commitment may be given effect by the Secretary, notwithstanding the report is received after the date otherwise required.
(f) For loans not reported within 60 days, evidence of guaranty will be issued only if the loan report is accompanied by a statement signed by a corporate officer of the lending institution which explains why the loan was reported late. The statement must identify the case or cases in issue and must set forth the specific reason or reasons why the loan was not submitted on time. Upon receipt of such a statement evidence of guaranty will be issued. A pattern of late reporting and the reasons therefore will be considered by VA in taking action under § 36.4353.
(g) Evidence of a guaranty will be issued by the Secretary by appropriate endorsement on the note or other instrument evidencing the obligation, or by a separate certificate at the option of the lender. Notice of credit to an insurance account will be given to the lender. Unused certificates of eligibility issued prior to March 1, 1946, are void. No certificate of commitment shall be issued and no loan shall be guaranteed or insured unless the lender, the veteran, and the loan are shown to be eligible. Evidence of guaranty or insurance will not be issued on any loan for the purchase or construction of residential property unless the veteran, or the veteran's spouse in the case of a veteran who cannot occupy the property because of active duty status with the Armed Forces, certifies
in such form as the Secretary shall prescribe that the veteran, or spouse of the active duty veteran, intends to occupy the property as his or her home. Guaranty or insurance evidence will not be issued on any loan for the alteration, improvement, or repair of any residential property or on a refinancing loan unless the veteran, or spouse of an active duty servicemember, certifies that he or she presently occupies the property as his or her home. An exception to this is if the home improvement or refinancing loan is for extensive changes to the property that will prevent the veteran or the spouse of the active duty veteran from occupying the property while the work is being completed. In such a case the veteran or spouse of the active duty veteran must certify that he or she intends to occupy or reoccupy the property as his or her home upon completion of the substantial improvements or repairs. All of the mentioned certifications must take place at the time of loan application and closing except in the case of loans automatically guaranteed, in which case veterans or, in the case of an active duty veteran, the veteran's spouse shall make the required certification only at the time the loan is closed.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3704(c))
(h) Subject to compliance with the regulations concerning guaranty or insurance of loans to veterans, the certificate of guaranty or the evidence of insurance credit will be issuable within the available entitlement of the veteran on the basis of the loan stated in the final loan report or certification of loan disbursement, except for refinancing loans for interest rate reductions. The available entitlement of a veteran will be determined by the Secretary as of the date of receipt of an application for guaranty or insurance of a loan or of a loan report. Such date of receipt shall be the date the application or loan report is date-stamped into VA. Eligibility derived from the most recent period of service:
(1) Shall cancel any unused entitlement derived from any earlier period of service, and
(2) Shall be reduced by the amount by which entitlement from service during any earlier period has been used to obtain a direct, guaranteed, or insured loan:
(i) On property which the veteran owns at the time of application, or
(ii) As to which the Secretary has incurred actual liability or loss, unless in the event of loss or the incurrence and payment of such liability by the Secretary, the resulting indebtedness of the veteran to the United States has been paid in full.
Provided
, that if the Secretary issues or has issued a certificate of commitment covering the loan described in the application for guaranty or insurance or in the loan report, the amount and percentage of guaranty or the amount of the insurance credit contemplated by the certificate of commitment shall not be subject to reduction if the loan has been or is closed on a date that is not later than the expiration date of the certificate of commitment, notwithstanding that the Secretary in the meantime and prior to the issuance of the evidence of guaranty or insurance shall have incurred actual liability or loss on a direct, guaranteed, or insured loan previously obtained by the borrower. For the purposes of this paragraph, the Secretary will be deemed to have incurred actual loss on a guaranteed or insured loan if the Secretary has paid a guaranty or insurance claim thereon and the veteran's resultant indebtedness to the Government has not been paid in full, and to have incurred actual liability on a guaranteed or insured loan if the Secretary is in receipt of a claim on the guaranty or insurance or is in receipt of a notice of default. In the case of a direct loan, the Secretary will be deemed to have incurred an actual loss if the loan is in default. A loan, the proceeds of which are to be disbursed progressively or at intervals, will be deemed to have been closed for the purposes of this paragraph if the loan has been completed in all respects excepting the actual “payout” of the entire loan proceeds.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3702(a), 3710(c))
(i) Any amounts that are disbursed for an ineligible purpose shall be excluded in computing the amount of guaranty or insurance credit.
(j) Notwithstanding the lender has erroneously, but without intent to misrepresent, made certification with respect to paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the guaranty or insurance will become effective upon the curing of such default and its continuing current for a period of not less than 60 days thereafter. For the purpose of this paragraph a loan will be deemed current so long as the installment is received within 30 days after its due date.
(k) No guaranty or insurance commitment or evidence of guaranty or insurance will be issuable in respect to any loan to finance a contract that:
(1) Is for the purchase, construction, repair, alteration, or improvement of a dwelling or farm residence;
(2) Is dated on or after June 4, 1969;
(3) Provides for a purchase price or cost to the veteran in excess of the reasonable value established by the Secretary; and
(4) Was signed by the veteran prior to the veteran's receipt of notice of such reasonable value; unless such contract includes, or is amended to include, a provision that reads substantially as follows:
It is expressly agreed that, notwithstanding any other provisions of this contract, the purchaser shall not incur any penalty by forfeiture of earnest money or otherwise be obligated to complete the purchase of the property described herein, if the contract purchase price or cost exceeds the reasonable value of the property established by the Department of Veterans Affairs. The purchaser shall, however, have the privilege and option of proceeding with the consummation of this contract without regard to the amount of the reasonable value established by the Department of Veterans Affairs.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 501, 3703(c)(1))
(l) With respect to any loan for which a commitment was made on or after March 1, 1988, the Secretary must be notified whenever the holder receives knowledge of disposition of the residential property securing a VA-guaranteed loan.
(1) If the seller applies for prior approval of the assumption of the loan, then:
(i) A holder (or its authorized servicing agent) who is an automatic lender must examine the creditworthiness of the purchaser and determine compliance with the provisions of 38 U.S.C. 3714. The creditworthiness review must be performed by the party that has automatic authority. If both the holder and its servicing agent are automatic lenders, then they must decide between themselves which one will make the determination of creditworthiness, whether the loan is current and whether there is a contractual obligation to assume the loan, as required by 38 U.S.C. 3714. If the actual loan holder does not have automatic authority and its servicing agent is an automatic lender, then the servicing agent must make the determinations required by 38 U.S.C. 3714 on behalf of the holder. The actual holder will remain ultimately responsible for any failure of its servicing agent to comply with the applicable law and VA regulations.
(A) If the assumption is approved and the transfer of the security is completed, then the notice required by this paragraph (l) shall consist of the credit package (unless previously provided in accordance with paragraph (l)(1)(i)(B) of this section) and a copy of the executed deed and/or assumption agreement as required by VA office of jurisdiction. The notice shall be submitted to the Department with the VA receipt for the funding fee provided for in § 36.4313(e)(2).
(B) If the application for assumption is disapproved, the holder shall notify the seller and the purchaser that the decision may be appealed to the VA office of jurisdiction within 30 days. The holder shall make available to that VA office all items used by the holder in making the holder's decision in case the decision is appealed to VA. If the application remains disapproved after 60 days (to allow time for appeal to and review by VA), then the holder must refund $50 of any fee previously collected under the provisions of § 36.4313(d)(8). If the application is subsequently approved and the sale is completed, then the holder (or its authorized servicing agent) shall provide the notice described in paragraph (l)(1)(i)(A) of this section.
(C) In performing the requirements of paragraphs (l)(1)(i)(A) or (l)(1)(i)(B) of this section, the holder must complete its examination of the creditworthiness of the prospective purchaser and advise
the seller no later than 45 days after the date of receipt by the holder of a complete application package for the approval of the assumption. The 45-day period may be extended by an interval not to exceed the time caused by delays in processing of the application that are documented as beyond the control of the holder, such as employers or depositories not responding to requests for verifications, which were timely forwarded, or follow-ups on those requests.
(ii) If neither the holder nor its authorized servicing agent is an automatic lender, the notice to VA shall include:
(A) Advice regarding whether the loan is current or in default;
(B) A copy of the purchase contract; and
(C) A complete credit package developed by the holder which the Secretary may use for determining the creditworthiness of the purchaser.
(D) The notice and documents required by this section must be submitted to the VA office of jurisdiction no later than 35 days after the date of receipt by the holder of a complete application package for the approval of the assumption, subject to the same extensions as provided in paragraph (l)(l)(i) of this section. If the assumption is not automatically approved by the holder or its authorized agent, pursuant to the automatic authority provisions, $50 of any fee collected in accordance with § 36.4313(d)(8) must be refunded. If the Department of Veterans Affairs does not approve the assumption, the holder will be notified and an additional $50 of any fee collected under § 36.4313(d)(8) must be refunded following the expiration of the 30-day appeal period set out in paragraph (l)(l)(i)(B) of this section. If such an appeal is made to the Department of Veterans Affairs, then the review will be conducted at the Department of Veterans Affairs office of jurisdiction by an individual who was not involved in the original disapproval decision. If the application for assumption is approved and the transfer of security is completed, then the holder (or its authorized servicing agent) shall provide the notice required in paragraph (l)(l)(i)(A) of this section.
(2) If the seller fails to notify the holder before disposing of property securing the loan, the holder shall notify the Secretary within 60 days after learning of the transfer. Such notice shall advise whether or not the holder intends to exercise its option to immediately accelerate the loan and whether or not an opportunity will be extended to the transferor and transferee to apply for retroactive approval of the assumption under the terms of this paragraph (l).

§ 36.4304
Deviations; changes of identity.
A deviation of more than 5 percent between the estimates upon which a certificate of commitment has been issued and the report of final payment of the proceeds of the loan, or a change in the identity of the property upon which the original appraisal was based, will invalidate the certificate of commitment unless such deviation or change be approved by the Secretary. Any deviation in excess of 5 percent or change in the identity of the property upon which the original appraisal was based must be supported by a new or supplemental appraisal of reasonable value: Provided, That substitution of materials of equal or better quality and value approved by the veteran and the designated appraiser shall not be deemed a “change in the identity of the property” within the purview of this section. A deviation not in excess of 5 percent will not require the prior approval of the Secretary.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3703(c)(1))
§ 36.4305
Partial disbursement.
In cases where intervening circumstances make it impracticable to complete the actual paying out of the loan originally proposed, or justify the lender in declining to make further disbursements on a construction loan, evidence of guaranty or of insurance of
the loan or the proper pro rata part thereof will be issuable if the loan is otherwise eligible for automatic guaranty or a certificate of commitment was issued thereon: Provided,
(a) A report of the loan is submitted to the Secretary within a reasonable time subsequent to the last disbursement, but in no event more than 90 days thereafter, unless report of the facts and circumstances is made and an extension of time obtained from the Secretary.
(b) There has been no default on the loan, except that the existence of a default shall not preclude issuance of a guaranty certificate or insurance advice if a certificate of commitment was issued with respect to the loan.
(c) The Secretary determines that a person of reasonable prudence similarly situated would not make further disbursements in the situation presented.
(d) There has been full compliance with the provisions of 38 U.S.C. chapter 37 and of the applicable regulations up to the time of the last disbursement.
(e) In the case of a construction loan when the construction is not fully completed, the amount and percentage of the guaranty and the amount of the loan for the purposes of insurance or accounting to the Secretary shall be based upon such portion of the amount disbursed out of the proceeds of the loan which, when added to any other payments made by or on behalf of the veteran to the builder or the contractor, does not exceed 80 percent of the value of that portion of the construction performed (basing value on the contract price) plus the sum, if any, disbursed by the lender out of the proceeds of the loan for the land on which the construction is situated: And provided further, That the lender shall certify as follows:
(1) Any amount advanced for land is protected by title or lien as provided in the regulations concerning guaranty or insurance of loans to veterans; and
(2) No enforceable liens, for any work done or material furnished for that part of the construction completed and for which payment has been made out of the proceeds of the loan, exist or can come into existence.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3703(c)(1) and (d))
§ 36.4306
Refinancing of mortgage or other lien indebtedness.
(a) A refinancing loan made pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 3710(a)(5) qualifies for guaranty in an amount as computed under 38 U.S.C. 3703, provided—
(1) The amount of the new loan must not exceed an amount equal to 100 percent of the reasonable value, as determined by the Secretary, of the dwelling or farm residence which will secure the loan.
(2) The funding fee as prescribed by 38 U.S.C. 3729 may be included in the new loan amount, except that any portion of the funding fee that would cause the new loan amount to exceed 100 percent of the reasonable value of the property must be paid in cash at the loan closing.
(3) The new loan must provide a net tangible benefit to the borrower. For the purposes of this section, net tangible benefit means that the new loan is in the financial interest of the borrower. The lender of the new loan must provide the borrower with a net tangible benefit test. The net tangible benefit test must be satisfied. The net tangible benefit test is defined as follows:
(i) The new loan must meet one or more of the following:
(A) The new loan eliminates monthly mortgage insurance, whether public or private, or monthly guaranty insurance;
(B) The term of the new loan is shorter than the term of the loan being refinanced;
(C) The interest rate on the new loan is lower than the interest rate on the loan being refinanced;
(D) The payment on the new loan is lower than the payment on the loan being refinanced;
(E) The new loan results in an increase in the borrower's monthly residual income as explained by § 36.4340(e);
(F) The new loan refinances an interim loan to construct, alter, or repair the primary home;
(G) The new loan amount is equal to or less than 90 percent of the reasonable value of the home; or
(H) The new loan refinances an adjustable rate mortgage to a fixed rate loan.
(ii) The lender must provide a borrower with a comparison of the following:
(A) The loan payoff amount of the new loan, with a comparison to the loan payoff amount of the loan being refinanced;
(B) The new type of loan, with a comparison to the type of the loan being refinanced;
(C) The interest rate of the new loan, with a comparison to the interest rate of the loan being refinanced;
(D) The term of the new loan, with a comparison to the term remaining on the loan being refinanced;
(E) The total the borrower will have paid after making all payments of principal, interest, and mortgage or guaranty insurance (if applicable), as scheduled, for both the loan being refinanced and the new loan; and
(F) The loan to value ratio of the loan being refinanced compared to the loan to value ratio under the new loan.
(iii) The lender must provide the borrower with an estimate of the dollar amount of home equity that, by refinancing into a new loan, is being removed from the reasonable value of the home, and explain that removal of this home equity may affect the borrower's ability to sell the home at a later date.
(iv) The lender must provide the information required under paragraphs (a)(3)(i) through (iii) of this section in a standardized format and on two separate occasions: Not later than 3 business days from the date of the loan application and again at loan closing. The borrower must certify that the borrower received the information required under paragraphs (a)(3)(i) through (iii) on both occasions.
(4) The dollar amount of discount, if any, to be paid by the borrower must be reasonable in amount as determined by the Secretary in accordance with § 36.4313(d)(7)(i).
(5) The loan must otherwise be eligible for guaranty.
(b) If the loan being refinanced is a VA-guaranteed or insured loan, and the new loan amount is equal to or less than the payoff amount of the loan being refinanced, the following requirements must also be met—
(1)(i) The lender of the refinanced loan must provide the Secretary with a certification of the recoupment period for fees, closing costs, and any expenses (other than taxes, amounts held in escrow, and fees paid under 38 U.S.C. chapter 37) that would be incurred by the borrower in the refinancing of the loan;
(ii) All of the fees and incurred costs must be scheduled to be recouped on or before the date that is 36 months after the date of loan issuance; and
(iii) The recoupment must be calculated through lower regular monthly payments (other than taxes, amounts held in escrow, and fees paid under 38 U.S.C. chapter 37) as a result of the refinanced loan.
(2) The new loan may not be guaranteed or insured until the date that is the later of 210 days from the date of the first monthly payment made by the borrower and the date on which the sixth monthly payment is made on the loan.
(3) In a case in which the loan being refinanced has a fixed interest rate and the new loan will also have a fixed interest rate, the interest rate on the new loan must not be less than 50 basis points less than the loan being refinanced.
(4) In a case in which the loan being refinanced has a fixed interest rate and the new loan will have an adjustable rate, the interest rate on the new loan must not be less than 200 basis points less than the previous loan. In addition—
(i) The lower interest rate must not be produced solely from discount points, unless such points are paid at closing; and
(ii) Such points are not added to the principal loan amount, unless—
(A) For discount point amounts that are less than or equal to one discount point, the resulting loan balance after any fees and expenses allows the property with respect to which the loan was issued to maintain a loan to value ratio of 100 percent or less; and
(B) For discount point amounts that are greater than one discount point, the resulting loan balance after any fees and expenses allows the property with respect to which the loan was issued to maintain a loan to value ratio of 90 percent or less.
(c) If the new loan amount exceeds the payoff amount of the loan being refinanced—
(1) The borrower is deemed to have recouped the costs of the refinancing if the requirements prescribed in paragraph (a) are met.
(2) The new loan may not be guaranteed or insured until the date that is the later of 210 days from the date of the first monthly payment made by the borrower and the date on which the sixth monthly payment is made on the loan; however, this requirement applies only when the loan being refinanced is a VA-guaranteed or insured loan.
(d) For the limited purpose of calculating entitlement, nothing shall preclude guaranty of a loan to an eligible veteran having home loan guaranty entitlement to refinance under the provisions of 38 U.S.C. 3710(a)(5) a VA-guaranteed or insured (or direct) mortgage loan made to him or her which is outstanding on the dwelling or farm residence owned and occupied or to be reoccupied after the completion of major alterations, repairs, or improvements to the property, by the veteran as a home, or in the case of an eligible veteran unable to occupy the property because of active duty status in the Armed Forces, occupied or to be reoccupied by the veteran's spouse as the spouse's home.
(e) A refinancing loan may include contractual prepayment penalties, if any, due the holder of the mortgage or other lien indebtedness to be refinanced.
(f) Nothing in this section shall preclude the determination that a loan is being made for a purpose authorized under 38 U.S.C. 3710, if the purpose of such loan is the refinancing of the balance due for the purchase of land on which new construction is to be financed through the proceeds of the loan, or the refinancing of the balance due on an existing land sale contract relating to a borrower's dwelling or farm residence.
(g) A veteran may refinance (38 U.S.C. 3710(a)(9)(B)(ii)) an existing loan that was for the purchase of, and is secured by, a manufactured home in order to purchase the lot on which the manufactured home is or will be permanently affixed, provided the following requirements are met:
(1) The refinancing of a manufactured home and the purchase of a lot must be considered as one loan;
(2) The manufactured home upon being permanently affixed to the lot will be considered real property under the laws of the State where it is located;
(3) The loan must be secured by the same manufactured home which is being refinanced and the real property on which the manufactured home is or will be located;
(4) The amount of the loan may not exceed an amount equal to the sum of the balance of the loan being refinanced; the purchase price, not to exceed the reasonable value of the lot; the costs of the necessary site preparation of the lot as determined by the Secretary; a reasonable discount as authorized in § 36.4313(d)(6) with respect to that portion of the loan used to refinance the existing purchase money lien on the manufactured home, and closing costs as authorized in § 36.4313.
(5) If the loan being refinanced was guaranteed by VA, the portion of the loan made for the purpose of refinancing an existing purchase money manufactured home loan may be, guaranteed without regard to the outstanding guaranty entitlement available for use by the veteran, and the veteran's guaranty entitlement shall not be charged as a result of any guaranty provided for the refinancing portion of the loan. For the purposes enumerated in 38 U.S.C. 3702(b), the refinancing portion of the loan shall be considered to have been obtained with the guaranty entitlement used to obtain VA-guaranteed loan being refinanced. The total guaranty for the new loan shall be the sum of the guaranty entitlement used to obtain VA-guaranteed loan being refinanced and any additional guaranty entitlement available to the veteran. However, the total guaranty may not exceed the guaranty amount as calculated under § 36.4302(a); and
(6) All other requirements of this section are met.
(h) Any refinancing loan that might be guaranteed under this section, when
made or purchased by any financial institution subject to examination and supervision by any agency of the United States or of any State may, in lieu of such guaranty, be insured by the Secretary under an agreement whereby the Secretary will reimburse any such institution for losses incurred on such loan up to 15 percent of the aggregate of loans so made or purchased by it.

§ 36.4307
Interest rate reduction refinancing loan.
(a) Pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 3710(a)(8), (a)(9)(B)(i), and (a)(11), a veteran may refinance an existing VA guaranteed, insured, or direct loan to reduce the interest rate payable on the existing loan provided that all of the following requirements are met:
(1) The new loan must be secured by the same dwelling or farm residence as the loan being refinanced.
(2) The veteran owns the dwelling or farm residence securing the loan and
(i) Occupies the dwelling or residence as his or her home; or
(ii) Previously occupied the dwelling or residence as his or her home and certifies, in such form as the Secretary shall require, that he or she has previously occupied the dwelling or residence as a home; or
(iii) In a case in which the veteran is or was unable to occupy the residence or dwelling as a home because the veteran was on active duty status as a member of the Armed Forces, the spouse of the veteran occupies, or previously occupied, the dwelling or residence as the spouse's home and certifies to that occupancy in such form as the Secretary shall require.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3710(e)(1))
(3) The monthly principal and interest payment on the new loan is lower than the principal and interest payment on the loan being refinanced; or the term of the new loan is shorter than the term of the loan being refinanced; or the new loan is a fixed-rate loan that refinances a VA-guaranteed adjustable rate mortgage; or the increase in the monthly payments on the loan results from the inclusion of energy efficient improvements, as provided by § 36.4339(a)(4); or the Secretary approves the loan in advance after determining that the new loan is necessary to prevent imminent foreclosure and the veteran qualifies for the new loan under the credit standards contained in § 36.4340.
(4) The amount of the refinancing loan does not exceed:
(i) An amount equal to the balance of the loan being refinanced, which is not delinquent, except as provided in paragraph (a)(5) of this section, plus closing costs authorized by § 36.4313(d) and a discount not to exceed 2 percent of the loan amount; or
(ii) In the case of a loan to refinance an existing VA-guaranteed or direct loan and to improve the dwelling securing such loan through energy efficient improvements, the amount referred to with respect to the loan under paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section, plus the amount authorized by § 36.4339(a)(4).
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3703, 3710)
(5) If the loan being refinanced is delinquent (delinquent means that a scheduled monthly payment of principal and interest is more than 30 days past due), the new loan will be guaranteed only if the Secretary approves it in advance after determining that the borrower, through the lender, has provided reasons for the loan deficiency, has provided information to establish that the cause of the delinquency has been corrected, and qualifies for the loan under the credit standards contained in § 36.4340. In such cases, the term “balance of the loan being refinanced” shall include any past due installments, plus allowable late charges.
(6) The dollar amount of guaranty on the 38 U.S.C. 3710(a)(8) or (a)(9)(B)(i) loan does not exceed the greater of the original guaranty amount of the loan being refinanced or 25 percent of the new loan.
(7) The term of the refinancing loan (38 U.S.C. 3710(a)(8)) may not exceed the original term of the loan being refinanced plus ten years, or the maximum loan term allowed under 38 U.S.C.
3703(d)(1), whichever is less. For manufactured home loans that were previously guaranteed under 38 U.S.C. 3712, the loan term, if being refinanced under 38 U.S.C. 3710(a)(9)(B)(i), may exceed the original term of the loan but may not exceed the maximum loan term allowed under 38 U.S.C. 3703(d)(1).
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3703(c)(1), 3710(e)(1))
(b) Notwithstanding any other regulatory provision, the interest rate reduction refinancing loan may be guaranteed without regard to the amount of guaranty entitlement available for use by the veteran, and the amount of the veteran's remaining guaranty entitlement, if any, shall not be charged for an interest rate reduction refinancing loan. The interest rate reduction refinancing loan will be guaranteed with the lesser of the entitlement used by the veteran to obtain the loan being refinanced or the amount of the guaranty as calculated under § 36.4302(a). The veteran's loan guaranty entitlement originally used for a purpose as enumerated in 38 U.S.C. 3710(a)(1) through (7) and (a)(9)(A)(i) and (ii) and subsequently transferred to an interest rate reduction refinancing loan (38 U.S.C. 3710(a)(8) or (a)(9)(B)(i)) shall be eligible for restoration when the interest rate reduction refinancing loan or subsequent interest rate reduction refinancing loans on the same property meets the requirements of § 36.4302(h).
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3703(a))
(c) Title to the estate which is refinanced for the purpose of an interest rate reduction must be in conformity with § 36.4354.

§ 36.4308
Joint loans.
(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the prior approval of the Secretary is required in respect to any loan to be made to two or more borrowers who become jointly and severally liable, or jointly liable therefor, and who will acquire an undivided interest in the property to be purchased or who will otherwise share in the proceeds of the loan, or in respect to any loan to be made to an eligible veteran whose interest in the property owned, or to be acquired with the loan proceeds, is an undivided interest only, unless such interest is at least a 50 percent interest in a partnership. The amount of the guaranty or insurance credit shall be computed in such cases only on that portion of the loan allocable to the eligible veteran which, taking into consideration all relevant factors, represents the proper contribution of the veteran to the transaction. Such loans shall be secured to the extent required by 38 U.S.C. chapter 37 and the regulations concerning guaranty or insurance of loans to veterans.
(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section, the joinder of the spouse of a veteran-borrower in the ownership of residential property shall not require prior approval or preclude the issuance of a guaranty or insurance credit based upon the entire amount of the loan. If both spouses be eligible veterans, either or both may, within permissible maxima, utilize available guaranty or insurance entitlement.
(c) For the purpose of determining the rights and the liabilities of the Secretary with respect to a loan subject to paragraph (a) of this section, credits legally applicable to the entire loan shall be applied as follows:
(1) Prepayments made expressly for credit to that portion of the indebtedness allocable to the veteran (including the gratuity paid pursuant to former provisions of law), shall be applied to such portion of the indebtedness. All other payments shall be applied ratably to those portions of the loan allocable respectively to the veteran and to the other debtors.
(2) Proceeds of the sale or other liquidation of the security shall be applied ratably to the respective portions of the loan, such portion of the proceeds as represents the interest of the
veteran being applied to that portion of the loan allocable to such veteran.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3703)
§ 36.4309
Transfer of title by borrower or maturity by demand or acceleration.
(a) Except as provided by paragraphs (b) or (c) of this section the conveyance of or other transfer of title to property by operation of law or otherwise, after the creation of a lien thereon to secure a loan which is guaranteed or insured in whole or in part by the Secretary, shall not constitute an event of default, or acceleration of maturity, elective or otherwise, and shall not of itself terminate or otherwise affect the guaranty or insurance.
(b)(1) The Secretary may issue guaranty on loans in which a State, Territorial, or local governmental agency provides assistance to a veteran for the acquisition of a dwelling. Such loans will not be considered ineligible for guaranty if the State, Territorial, or local authority, by virtue of its laws or regulations or by virtue of Federal law, requires the acceleration of maturity of the loan upon the sale or conveyance of the security property to a person ineligible for assistance from such authority.
(2) At the time of application for a loan assisted by a State, Territorial, or local governmental agency, the veteran-applicant must be fully informed and consent in writing to the housing authority restrictions. A copy of the veteran's consent statement must be forwarded with the loan application or the report of a loan processed on the automatic basis.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3703(c))
(c) Any housing loan which is financed under 38 U.S.C. chapter 37, and to which section 3714 of that chapter applies, shall include a provision in the security instrument that the holder may declare the loan immediately due and payable upon transfer of the property securing such loan to any transferee unless the acceptability of the assumption of the loan is established pursuant to section 3714.
(1) A holder may not exercise its option to accelerate a loan upon:
(i) The creation of a lien or other encumbrance subordinate to the lender's security instrument which does not relate to the transfer of rights of occupancy in the property;
(ii) The creation of a purchase money security interest for household appliances;
(iii) A transfer by devise, descent, or operation of law on the death of a joint tenant or tenant by the entirety;
(iv) The granting of a leasehold interest of three years or less not containing an option to purchase;
(v) A transfer to a relative resulting from the death of a borrower;
(vi) A transfer where the spouse or children of the borrower become joint owners of the property with the borrower;
(vii) A transfer resulting from a decree of a dissolution of marriage, legal separation agreement, or from an incidental property settlement agreement by which the spouse of the borrower becomes the sole owner of the property. In such a case the borrower shall have the option of applying directly to the Department of Veterans Affairs regional office of jurisdiction for a release of liability in accordance with § 36.4326; or
(viii) A transfer into an inter vivos trust in which the borrower is and remains a beneficiary and which does not relate to a transfer of rights of occupancy in the property.
(2) With respect to each such loan at least one of the instruments used in the transaction shall contain the following statement: “This loan is not assumable without the approval of the Department of Veterans Affairs or its authorized agent.” This statement must be:
(i) Printed in a font size which is the larger of:
(A) Two times the largest font size contained in the body of the instrument; or
(B) 18 points; and
(ii) Contained in at least one of the following:
(A) The note;
(B) The mortgage or deed of trust; or
(C) A rider to either the note, the mortgage, or the deed of trust.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3714(d))
(d) The term of payment of any guaranteed or insured obligation shall bear a proper relation to the borrower's present and anticipated income and expenses, (except loans pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 3710(a)(8) or (a)(9)(B)(i)). In addition the terms of payment of any guaranteed or insured obligation shall provide for discharge of the obligation at a definite date or dates or intervals, in amount specified on or computable from the face of the instrument. A loan which is payable on demand, or at sight, or on presentation, or at a time not specified or computable from the language in the note, mortgage, or other loan instrument, or which contemplates periodic renewals at the option of the holder to satisfy the repayment requirements of this section, is not eligible for guaranty or insurance, except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section.
(e) No guaranteed or insured obligation shall contain a provision to the effect that the holder shall have the right to declare the indebtedness due, or to pursue one or more legal or equitable remedies, if holder “shall feel insecure,” or upon the occurrence of one or more such conditions optional to the holder, without regard to an act or omission by the debtor, which condition by the terms of the note, mortgage, or other loan instrument would at the option of the holder afford a basis for declaring a default.
(f) Notwithstanding the inclusion in the guaranteed or insured obligation of a provision contrary to the provisions of this section, the right of the holder to payment of the guaranty or insurance shall not be thereby impaired: Provided,
(1) Default was declared or maturity was accelerated under some other provision of the note, mortgage, or other loan instrument, or
(2) Activation or enforcement of such provision is warranted under § 36.4350(i)(2), or if there exist conditions justifying the appointment of a receiver for the property (without reference to any contractual provisions for such appointment), or
(3) The prior approval of the Secretary was obtained.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3703(c))
(g) The holder of any guaranteed or insured obligation shall have the right, notwithstanding the absence of express provision therefor in the instruments evidencing the indebtedness, to accelerate the maturity of such obligation at any time after the continuance of any default for the period of three months.
(h) If sufficient funds are tendered to bring a delinquency current at any time prior to a judicial or statutory sale or other public sale under power of sale provisions contained in the loan instruments to liquidate any security for a guaranteed loan, the holder shall be obligated to accept the funds in payment of the delinquency unless the prior approval of the Secretary is obtained to do otherwise, or unless reinstatement of the loan would adversely affect the dignity of the lien or be otherwise precluded by law. A delinquency will include all installment payments (principal, interest, taxes, insurance, advances, etc.) due and unpaid and any accumulated late charges plus any reasonable expenses incurred and paid by the holder if termination proceedings have begun (e.g., advertising costs, foreclosure costs, attorney or trustee fees, recording fees, etc.).

§ 36.4310
Amortization.
(a) All loans, the maturity date of which is beyond 5 years from date of loan or date of assumption by the veteran, shall be amortized. Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, the schedule of payments thereon shall be in accordance with any generally recognized plan of amortization requiring approximately equal periodic payments and shall require a principal reduction not less often than annually during the life of the loan. The final installment on any loan shall not be in excess of two times the average of the preceding installments, except that on a construction loan such installment may be for an amount not in excess of
5 percent of the original principal amount of the loan. The limitations imposed herein on the amount of the final installment shall not apply in the case of any loan extended pursuant to § 36.4315.
(b) Any plan of repayment on loans required to be amortized which does not provide for approximately equal periodic payments shall not be eligible unless the plan conforms with the provisions of paragraph (e) of this section, or is otherwise approved by the Secretary.
(c) Every guaranteed or insured loan shall be repayable within the estimated economic life of the property securing the loan.
(d) Subject to paragraph (a) of this section, any amounts which under the terms of a loan do not become due and payable on or before the last maturity date permissible for loans of its class under the limitations contained in 38 U.S.C. chapter 37 shall automatically fall due on such date.
See
§ 36.4337.
(e) A graduated payment mortgage loan, providing for deferrals of interest during the first 5 years of the loan and addition of the deferred amounts to principal shall be eligible, Provided:
(1) The loan is for the purpose of acquiring a single-family dwelling unit, including a condominium unit or simultaneously acquiring and improving a previously occupied, existing single-family dwelling unit.
(2)(i) For proposed construction or existing homes not previously occupied (new homes), the maximum loan amount cannot exceed 97.5 percent of the lesser of the reasonable value of the property as of the time the loan is made or the purchase price.
(ii) For previously occupied, existing homes the maximum loan amount must be computed to assure that the principal amount of the loan, including all interest scheduled to be deferred and added to the loan principal, will not exceed the purchase price or reasonable value of the property, whichever is less, as of the time the loan is made;
(3) The increases in the monthly periodic payment amount occur annually on each of the first five annual anniversary dates of the first loan installment due date, at a rate of 7.5 percent over the preceding year's monthly payment amount;
(4) Beginning with the payment due on the fifth annual anniversary date of the first loan installment due date, all remaining monthly periodic payments are approximately equal in amount and amortize the loan fully in accordance with the requirements of this section, and
(5) The plan is otherwise acceptable to the Secretary.

§ 36.4311
Prepayment.
The debtor shall have the right to prepay at any time, without premium or fee, the entire indebtedness or any part thereof not less than the amount of one installment, or $100, whichever is less. Any prepayment in full of the indebtedness shall be credited on the date received, and no interest may be charged thereafter. Any partial prepayment made on other than an installment due date need not be credited until the next following installment due date or 30 days after such prepayment, whichever is earlier. The holder and the debtor may agree at any time that any prepayment not previously applied in satisfaction of matured installments shall be reapplied for the purpose of curing or preventing any subsequent default.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3703(d))
§ 36.4312
Interest rates.
(a) In guaranteeing or insuring loans under 38 U.S.C. chapter 37, the Secretary may elect to require that such loans either bear interest at a rate that is agreed upon by the veteran and the lender, or bear interest at a rate not in excess of a rate established by the Secretary. The Secretary may, from time to time, change that election by publishing a notice in the
Federal Register.
However, the interest rate of a loan for the purpose of an interest rate reduction under 38 U.S.C. 3710(a)(8), (a)(9)(B)(i), or (a)(11) must be less than the interest rate of the VA loan being refinanced. This paragraph does not apply in the case of an adjustable rate
mortgage being refinanced under 38 U.S.C. 3710(a)(8), (a)(9)(B)(i), or (a)(11) with a fixed rate loan.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3703, 3710)
(b) For loans bearing an interest rate agreed upon by the veteran and the lender, the veteran may pay reasonable discount points in connection with the loan. The discount points may not be included in the loan amount, except for interest rate reduction refinancing loans under 38 U.S.C. 3710(a)(8), (a)(9)(B)(i), and (a)(11). For loans bearing an interest rate agreed upon by the veteran and the lender, the provisions of § 36.4313(d)(6) and (d)(7) do not apply.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3703, 3710)
(c) Except as provided in § 36.4315, interest in excess of the rate reported by the lender when requesting evidence of guaranty or insurance shall not be payable on any advance, or in the event of any delinquency or default: Provided, that a late charge not in excess of an amount equal to 4 percent on any installment paid more than 15 days after due date shall not be considered a violation of this limitation.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3710)
(d) Effective October 1, 2003, adjustable rate mortgage loans which comply with the requirements of this paragraph (d) are eligible for guaranty.
(1)
Interest rate index.
Changes in the interest rate charged on an adjustable rate mortgage must correspond to changes in the weekly average yield on one year (52 weeks) Treasury bills adjusted to a constant maturity. Yields on one year Treasury bills at “constant maturity” are interpolated by the United States Treasury from the daily yield curve. This curve, which relates the yield on the security to its time to maturity, is based on the closing market bid yields on actively traded one year Treasury bills in the over-the-counter market. The weekly average one year constant maturity Treasury bill yields are published by the Federal Reserve Board of the Federal Reserve System. The Federal Reserve Statistical Release Report H. 15 (519) is released each Monday. These one year constant maturity Treasury bill yields are also published monthly in the Federal Reserve Bulletin, published by the Federal Reserve Board of the Federal Reserve System, as well as quarterly in the Treasury Bulletin, published by the Department of the Treasury.
(2)
Frequency of interest rate changes.
Interest rate adjustments must occur on an annual basis, except that the first adjustment may occur no sooner than 36 months from the date of the borrower's first mortgage payment. The adjusted rate will become effective the first day of the month following the adjustment date; the first monthly payment at the new rate will be due on the first day of the following month. To set the new interest rate, the lender will determine the change between the initial (
i.e.,
base) index figure and the current index figure. The initial index figure shall be the most recent figure available before the date of the note. For loans where the date of the note is before January 10, 2015, the current index figure shall be the most recent index figure available 30 days before the date of each interest rate adjustment. For loans where the date of the note is on or after January 10, 2015, the current index figure shall be the most recent index figure available 45 days before the date of each interest rate adjustment.
(3)
Method of rate changes.
Interest rate changes may only be implemented through adjustments to the borrower's monthly payments.
(4)
Initial rate and magnitude of changes.
The initial contract interest rate of an adjustable rate mortgage shall be agreed upon by the lender and the veteran. Annual adjustments in the interest rate shall correspond to annual changes in the interest rate index, subject to the following conditions and limitations:
(i) No single adjustment to the interest rate may result in a change in either direction of more than one percentage point from the interest rate in effect for the period immediately preceding that adjustment. Index changes in excess of one percentage point may not be carried over for inclusion in an
adjustment in a subsequent year. Adjustments in the effective rate of interest over the entire term of the mortgage may not result in a change in either direction of more than five percentage points from the initial contract interest rate.
(ii) At each adjustment date, changes in the index interest rate, whether increases or decreases, must be translated into the adjusted mortgage interest rate, rounded to the nearest one-eighth of one percent, up or down. For example, if the margin is 2 percent and the new index figure is 6.06 percent, the adjusted mortgage interest rate will be 8 percent. If the margin is 2 percent and the new index figure is 6.07 percent, the adjusted mortgage interest rate will be 8
1/8
percent.
(5)
Pre-loan disclosure.
The lender shall explain fully and in writing to the borrower, at the time of loan application, the nature of the obligation taken. The borrower shall certify in writing that he or she fully understands the obligation and a copy of the signed certification shall be placed in the loan folder and furnished to VA upon request.
(i) The fact that the mortgage interest rate may change, and an explanation of how changes correspond to changes in the interest rate index;
(ii) Identification of the interest rate index, its source of publication and availability;
(iii) The frequency (
i.e.
, annually) with which interest rate levels and monthly payments will be adjusted, and the length of the interval that will precede the initial adjustment; and
(iv) A hypothetical monthly payment schedule that displays the maximum potential increases in monthly payments to the borrower over the first five years of the mortgage, subject to the provisions of the mortgage instrument.
(6)
Disclosures.
The lender must provide the borrower with disclosures in accordance with the timing, content, and format required by the regulations implementing the Truth in Lending Act (15 U.S.C. 1601
et seq.
) at 12 CFR 1026.20(c) and (d). A copy of these disclosures will be made a part of the lender's permanent record on the loan.

§ 36.4313
Charges and fees.
(a) No charge shall be made against, or paid by, the borrower incident to the making of a guaranteed or insured loan other than those expressly permitted under paragraph (d) or (e) of this section, and no loan shall be guaranteed or insured unless the lender certifies to the Secretary that it has not imposed and will not impose any charges or fees against the borrower in excess of those permissible under paragraph (d) or (e) of this section. Any charge which is proper to make against the borrower under the provisions of this paragraph may be paid out of the proceeds of the loan: Provided, That if the purpose of the loan is to finance the purchase or construction of residential property the costs of closing the loan including the pro rata portion of the ground rents, hazard insurance premiums, current year's taxes, and other prepaid items normally involved in financing such transaction may not be included in the loan.
(b) Except as provided in this subpart, no brokerage or service charge or their equivalent may be charged against the debtor or the proceeds of the loan either initially, periodically, or otherwise.
(c) Brokerage or other charges shall not be made against the veteran for obtaining any guaranty or insurance under 38 U.S.C. chapter 37, nor shall any premiums for insurance on the life of the borrower be paid out of the proceeds of a loan.
(d) The following schedule of permissible fees and charges shall be applicable to all Department of Veterans Affairs guaranteed or insured loans.
(1) The veteran may pay reasonable and customary amounts for any of the following items:

(ii) Recording fees and recording taxes or other charges incident to recordation.
(iii) Credit report.
(iv) That portion of taxes, assessments, and other similar items for the current year chargeable to the borrower and an initial deposit (lump-sum payment) for the tax and insurance account.
(v) Hazard insurance required by § 36.4329.
(vi) Survey, if required by lender or veteran; except that any charge for a survey in connection with a loan under §§ 36.4360 through 36.4365 (Condominium Loans) must have the prior approval of the Secretary.
(vii) Title examination and title insurance, if any.
(viii) The actual amount charged for flood zone determinations, including a charge for a life-of-the-loan flood zone determination service purchased at the time of loan origination, if made by a third party who guarantees the accuracy of the determination. A fee may not be charged for a flood zone determination made by a Department of Veterans Affairs appraiser or for the lender's own determination.
(ix) Such other items as may be authorized in advance by the Under Secretary for Benefits as appropriate for inclusion under this paragraph (d) as proper local variances.
(2) A lender may charge and the veteran may pay a flat charge not exceeding 1 percent of the amount of the loan, provided that such flat charge shall be in lieu of all other charges relating to costs of origination not expressly specified and allowed in this schedule.
(3) In cases where a lender makes advances to a veteran during the progress of construction, alteration, improvement, or repair, either under a commitment of the Department of Veterans Affairs to issue a guaranty certificate or insurance credit upon completion, or where the lender would be entitled to guaranty or insurance on such advances when reported under automatic procedure, the lender may make a charge against the veteran of not exceeding 2 percent of the amount of the loan for its services in supervising the making of advances and the progress of construction notwithstanding that the “holdback” or final advance is not actually paid out until after the construction, alteration, improvement, or repair is fully completed: Provided, That the major portion (51 percent or more) of the loan proceeds is paid out during the actual progress of the construction, alteration, improvement, or repair. Such charge may be in addition to the 1 percent charge allowed under paragraph (d)(2) of this section.
(4) In consideration, alteration, improvement or repair loans, including supplemental loans made pursuant to § 36.4359, where no charge is permissible under the provisions of paragraph (d)(3) of this section the lender may charge and the veteran may pay a flat sum not exceeding 1 percent of the amount of the loan. Such charge may be in addition to the 1 percent allowed under paragraph (d)(2) of this section.
(5) The fees and charges permitted under this paragraph are maximums and are not intended to preclude a lender from making alternative charges against the veteran which are not specifically authorized in the schedule provided the imposition of such alternative charges would not result in an aggregate charge or payment in excess of the prescribed maximum.
(6) The veteran borrower subject to the limitations set forth in paragraphs (d)(6) and (7) of this section may pay a discount required by a lender when the proceeds of the loan will be used for any of the following purposes:
(i) To refinance existing indebtedness pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 3710(a)(5), (a)(8), (a)(9)(B)(i) or (a)(9)(B)(ii);
(ii) To repair, alter or improve a dwelling owned by the veteran pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 3710(a)(4) or (7) if such loan is to be secured by a first lien;
(iii) To construct a dwelling or farm residence on land already owned or to be acquired by the veteran, provided that the veteran did not or will not acquire the land directly or indirectly from a builder or developer who will be
constructing such dwelling or farm residence;
(iv) To purchase a dwelling from a class of sellers which the Secretary determines are legally precluded under all circumstances from paying such a discount if the best interest of the veteran would be so served.
(7) Discounts shall be computed as follows:
(i) Unless otherwise approved by the Secretary, the discount, if any, to be paid by the borrower on a loan secured by a first lien may not exceed the difference between the bid price, rounded to the lower whole number, and par value for GNMA (Government National Mortgage Association) 90-day forward bid closing price for pass through securities
1/2
percent less than the face note rate of the loan. Unless the lender and borrower negotiate a firm written commitment for a maximum amount of discount to be paid, the bid price to be used in the computation must be the GNMA 90-day forward bid closing quote for any day 1 to 4 business days prior to loan closing. “Loan closing” is defined for this purpose as the date on which the borrower's 3-day right of rescission commences pursuant to the Truth in Lending Act. If the lender and borrower choose to negotiate a firm discount commitment for a maximum amount of discount to be paid, the bid price to be used in establishing the maximum discount must be the closing quote for the business day prior to the date of the commitment. Lenders negotiating firm commitments must close that loan at a discount no higher than the firm commitment regardless of changes in the maximum allowable Department of Veterans Affairs interest rate. If a lender's commitment expires prior to loan closing, the lender and borrower may negotiate a new firm commitment based on the procedure outlined in this paragraph (d)(7)(i) or may use the procedure for determining the discount based on the GNMA 90-day forward bid closing quote for any day 1 to 4 business days prior to loan closing.
(ii) The borrower, subject to the limitations set forth in paragraphs (d)(6) and (7) of this section, may pay a discount required by the lender when the proceeds of the loan will be used to repair, alter, or improve a dwelling owned by the veteran pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 3710(a)(4) or (7) if such loan is unsecured or secured by less than a first lien. No such discount may be charged unless:

(8) On any loan to which 38 U.S.C. 3714 applies, the holder may charge a reasonable fee, not to exceed the lesser of $300 and the actual cost of any credit report required, or any maximum prescribed by applicable State law, for processing an application for assumption and changing its records.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3714)
(e) Subject to the limitations set out in paragraph (e)(4) of this section, a fee must be paid to the Secretary.
(1) The fee on loans to veterans shall be as follows:
(i) On all interest rate reduction refinancing loans guaranteed under 38 U.S.C. 3710(a)(8), (a)(9)(B)(i), and (a)(11), the fee shall be 0.50 percent of the total loan amount.
(ii) On all refinancing loans other than those described in paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section, the funding fee shall be 2.75 percent of the loan amount for loans to veterans whose entitlement is based on service in the Selected Reserve under the provisions of 38 U.S.C. 3701(b)(5), and 2 percent of the loan amount for loans to all other veterans; provided, however, that if the veteran is using entitlement for a second or subsequent time, the fee shall be 3 percent of the loan amount.
(iii) Except for loans to veterans whose entitlement is based on service in the Selected Reserve under the provisions of 38 U.S.C. 3701(b)(5), the funding fee shall be 2 percent of the total loan amount for all loans for the purchase or construction of a home on which the veteran does not make a down payment, unless the veteran is using entitlement for a second or subsequent time, in which case the fee shall be 3 percent. On purchase or construction loans on which the veteran makes a down payment of 5 percent or more, but less than 10 percent, the amount of the funding fee shall be 1.50 percent of the total loan amount. On purchase or construction loans on which the veteran makes a down payment of 10 percent or more, the amount of the funding fee shall be 1.25 percent of the total loan amount.
(iv) On loans to veterans whose entitlement is based on service in the Selected Reserve under the provisions of 38 U.S.C. 3701(b)(5), the funding fee shall be 2.75 percent of the total loan amount on loans for the purchase or construction of a home on which the veteran does not make a down payment, unless the veteran is using entitlement for a second or subsequent time, in which case the fee shall be 3 percent. On purchase or construction loans on which veterans whose entitlement is based on service in the Selected Reserve make a down payment of 5 percent or more, but less than 10 percent, the amount of the funding fee shall be 2.25 percent of the total loan amount. On purchase or construction loans on which such veterans make a down payment of 10 percent or more, the amount of the funding fee shall be 2 percent of the total loan amount.
(v) All or part of the fee may be paid in cash at loan closing or all or part of the fee may be included in the loan without regard to the reasonable value of the property or the computed maximum loan amount, as appropriate. In computing the fee, the lender will disregard any amount included in the loan to enable the borrower to pay such fee.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3729)
(2) Subject to the limitations set out in this section, a fee of one-half of one percent of the loan balance must be paid to the Secretary in a manner prescribed by the Secretary by a person assuming a loan to which 38 U.S.C. 3714 applies. The instrument securing such a loan shall contain a provision describing the right of the holder to collect this fee as trustee for the Department of Veterans Affairs. The loan holder shall list the amount of this fee in every assumption statement provided and include a notice that the fee must be paid to the holder immediately following loan settlement. The fee must be transmitted to the Secretary within 15 days of the receipt by the holder of the notice of transfer.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3714, 3729)
(3) The lender is required to pay to the Secretary the fee described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section within 15 days after loan closing. Any lender closing a loan, subject to the limitations set out in paragraph (e)(4) of this section who fails to submit timely payment of this fee will be subject to a late charge equal to 4 percent of the total fee due. If payment of the fee described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section is made more than 30 days after loan closing, interest will be assessed at a rate set in conformity with the Department of Treasury's Fiscal Requirements Manual. This interest charge is in addition to the 4 percent late charge, but the late charge is not included in the amount on which interest is computed. This interest charge is
to be calculated on a daily basis beginning on the date of closing, although the interest will be assessed only on funding fee payments received more than 30 days after closing.
(4) The lender is required to pay to the Secretary electronically through the Automated Clearing House (ACH) system the fees described in paragraphs (e)(1) and (e)(2) of this section and any late fees and interest due on them. This shall be paid to a collection agent by operator-assisted telephone, terminal entry, or CPU-to-CPU transmission. The collection agent will be identified by the Secretary. The lender shall provide the collection agent with the following: authorization for payment of the funding fee (including late fees and interest) along with the following information: VA lender ID number; four-digit personal identification number; dollar amount of debit; VA loan number; OJ (office of jurisdiction) code; closing date; loan amount; information about whether the payment includes a shortage, late charge, or interest; veteran name; loan type; sale amount; down payment; whether the veteran is a reservist; and whether this is a subsequent use of entitlement. For all transactions received prior to 8:15 p.m. on a workday, VA will be credited with the amount paid to the collection agent at the opening of business the next banking day.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3729(a))
(5) The fees described in paragraph (e)(1) and (e)(2) of this section shall not be collected from a veteran who is receiving compensation (or who but for the receipt of retirement pay would be entitled to receive compensation) or from a surviving spouse described in section 3701(b) of title 38, United States Code.
(The Office of Management and Budget has approved the information collection requirements in this section under control numbers 2900-0474 and 2900-0516)

§ 36.4314
Advances and other charges.
(a) A holder may advance any amount reasonably necessary and proper for the maintenance or repair of the security, or for the payment of accrued taxes, special assessments, ground or water rents, or premiums on fire or other casualty insurance against loss of or damage to such property and any such advance so made may be added to the guaranteed or insured indebtedness. A holder may also advance the one-half of one percent funding fee due on a transfer under 38 U.S.C. 3714 when this is not paid at the time of transfer. All security instruments for loans to which 38 U.S.C. 3714 applies must include a clause authorizing the collection of an assumption funding fee and an advance for this fee if it is not paid at the time of transfer.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3703, 3714, 3732)
(b) In addition to advances allowable under paragraph (a) of this section, the holder may charge against the proceeds of the sale of the security; may charge against gross amounts collected; may include in any accounting to the Secretary after payment of a claim under the guaranty; may include in the computation of a claim under the guaranty, if lawfully authorized by the loan agreement and subject to § 36.4324(a); or, may include in the computation of an insurance loss, any of the following items actually paid:
(1) Any expense which is reasonably necessary for preservation of the security;
(2) Court costs in a foreclosure or other proper judicial proceeding involving the security;
(3) Other expenses reasonably necessary for collecting the debt, or repossession or liquidation of the security;
(4) Reasonable trustee's fees or commissions not in excess of those allowed by statute and in no event in excess of 5 percent of the unpaid indebtedness;
(5)(i) Fees for legal services actually performed, not to exceed the reasonable and customary fees for such services in the State where the property is located, as determined by the Secretary.
(ii) In determining what constitutes the reasonable and customary fees for
legal services, the Secretary shall review allowances for legal fees in connection with the foreclosure of single-family housing loans, including bankruptcy-related services, issued by HUD, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac. The Secretary will review such fees annually and, as the Secretary deems necessary, publish in the
Federal Register
a table setting forth the amounts the Secretary determines to be reasonable and customary. The table will reflect the primary method for foreclosing in each state, either judicial or non-judicial, with the exception of those States where either judicial or non-judicial is acceptable. The use of a method not authorized in the table will require prior approval from VA. This table will be available throughout the year on a VA controlled Web site, such as at
http://www.homeloans.va.gov.
(iii) If the foreclosure attorney has the discretion to conduct the sale or to name a substitute trustee to conduct the sale, the combined total paid for legal fees under paragraph (b)(5)(i) of this section and trustee's fees pursuant to paragraph (b)(4) of this section shall not exceed the applicable maximum allowance for legal fees established under paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section. If the trustee conducting the sale must be a Government official under local law, or if an individual other than the foreclosing attorney (or any employee of that attorney) is appointed as part of judicial proceedings, and local law also establishes the fees payable for the services of the public or judicially appointed trustee, then those fees will not be subject to the maximum established for legal fees under paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section and may be included in the total indebtedness.
(6) The cost of a credit report(s) on the debtor(s), which is (are) to be forwarded to the Secretary in connection with the claim;
(7) Reasonable and customary costs of property inspections;
(8) Any other expense or fee that is approved in advance by the Secretary.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3720(a)(3), 3732)
(c) Any advances or charges enumerated in paragraph (a) or (b) of this section may be included as specified in the holder's accounting to the Secretary, but they are not chargeable to the debtor unless he or she otherwise be liable therefor.
(d) Advances of the type enumerated in paragraph (a) of this section and any other advances determined by VA to be necessary and proper in order to preserve or protect the security may be authorized by employees designated in § 36.4345(b) in the case of any property constituting the security for a loan acquired by the Secretary or constituting the security for the unpaid balance of the purchase price owing to the Secretary on account of the sale of such property. Such advances shall be secured to the extent legal and practicable by a lien on the property.
(e) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, holders of condominium loans guaranteed or insured under 38 U.S.C. 3710(a)(6) shall not pay those assessments or charges allocable to the condominium unit which are provided for in the instruments establishing the condominium form of ownership in the absence of the prior approval of the Secretary.
(f)(1) Fees and charges otherwise allowable by this section that accrue after the date specified in paragraph (f)(2) of this section may not be included in a claim under the guaranty.
(2) The date referenced in paragraph (f)(1) of this section will be computed by adding 210 calendar days to the due date of the last paid installment, plus the reasonable period that the Secretary has determined, pursuant to § 36.4322(a), it should have taken to complete the foreclosure. There will also be added to the time period specified in the previous sentence such additional time as the Secretary determines was reasonably necessary to complete the foreclosure if the Secretary determines the holder was unable to complete the foreclosure within the time specified in that section due to Bankruptcy proceedings, appeal of the foreclosure by the debtor, the holder granting forbearance in excess of 30 days at the request of the Secretary, or
other factors beyond the control of the holder.

§ 36.4315
Loan modifications.
(a) The terms of any guaranteed loan may be modified by a documented agreement between the holder and the borrower, without prior approval of the Secretary, if all of the following conditions are met:
(1) The loan is in default;
(2) The event or circumstances that caused the default has been or will be resolved and it is not expected to re-occur;
(3) The obligor is considered to be a reasonable credit risk, based on a review by the holder of the obligor's creditworthiness under the criteria specified in § 36.4340, including a current credit report. The fact of the recent default will not preclude the holder from determining the obligor is now a satisfactory credit risk provided the holder determines that the obligor is able to resume regular mortgage installments when the modification becomes effective based upon a review of the obligor's current and anticipated income, expenses, and other obligations as provided in § 36.4340;
(4) At least 12 monthly payments have been paid since the closing date of the loan;
(5) The current owner(s) is obligated to repay the loan, and is party to the loan modification agreement;
(6) The loan will be reinstated to performing status by virtue of the loan modification;
(7) A loan has not been modified more than once in a 3-year period or more than 3 times during the life of the loan;
(8) The loan as modified will bear a fixed-rate of interest, which—
(i) May not exceed the most recent Freddie Mac Weekly Primary Mortgage Market Survey Rate for 30-year fixed-rate conforming mortgages (U.S. Average), rounded to the nearest one-eighth of one percent (0.125%), as of the date the Modification Agreement is approved, plus 50 basis points;
(ii) After being determined and selected in accordance with paragraph (i), is not more than one percent higher than the existing rate on the loan; or,
(iii) In the case of a loan in which a State, Territorial, or local governmental agency provided assistance to the veteran for the acquisition of the dwelling, and the law providing that assistance precludes any revision in the interest rate on the loan, then the interest rate on the modified loan is the same or less than that on the original note evidencing the loan;
(9) The unpaid balance of the modified loan will be re-amortized over the remaining life of the loan, or if the loan term is to be extended, the maturity date will not exceed the shorter of:
(i) 360 months from the due date of the first installment required under the modification, or
(ii) 120 months after the original maturity date of the loan (unless the original term was less than 360 months, in which case the term may be extended to 480 months from the due date of the first installment on the original loan);
(10) Only the following items may be included in the modified indebtedness: Unpaid principal; accrued interest; deficits in the taxes and insurance impound accounts; amounts incurred to pay actual legal fees and foreclosure costs related to the canceled foreclosure; (subject to the maximum amounts prescribed in § 36.4314) the cost of a title insurance policy endorsement or other update for the modified loan; and advances required to preserve the lien position, such as homeowner association fees, special assessments, water and sewer liens, etc. Late fees and other charges may not be capitalized;
(11) The holder will not charge a processing fee, and all unpaid late fees will be waived. Any other actual costs incurred and legally chargeable, but which cannot be capitalized in the modified indebtedness, may be collected directly from the borrower as part of the modification process or waived, at the discretion of the servicer;
(12) Holders will ensure the first lien status of the modified loan;
(13) The dollar amount of the guaranty will not exceed the greater of:
(i) The original guaranty amount of the loan being modified (but if the
modified loan amount is less than the original loan amount, then the amount of guaranty will be equal to the original guaranty percentage applied to the modified loan), or
(ii) 25 percent of the loan being modified subject to the statutory maximum specified at 38 U.S.C. 3703(a)(1)(B); and
(14) The obligor will not receive any cash back from the modification.
(b) If a loan fails to meet one or more of the conditions identified in paragraph (a), the holder must submit the loan file to the Secretary for approval before entering into any loan modification agreement. The Secretary will grant such approval if the Secretary determines that the modification is in the best interests of the veteran and the Government after balancing the risks of non-approval versus approval despite the absence of one or more of the conditions identified in paragraph (a) of this section.
(c) This section does not create a right of a borrower to have a loan modified, but simply authorizes the loan holder to modify a loan in certain situations without the prior approval of the Secretary.

Acceptability of partial payments.
A partial payment is a remittance by or on behalf of the borrower on a loan in default (as defined in § 36.4301) of any amount less than the full amount due under the terms of the loan and security instruments at the time the remittance is tendered.
(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, or upon the express waiver of the Secretary, the mortgage holder shall accept any partial payment and either apply it to the mortgagor's account or identify it with the mortgagor's account and hold it in a special account pending disposition. When partial payments held for disposition aggregate a full monthly installment, including escrow, they shall be applied to the mortgagor's account.
(b) A partial payment may be returned to the mortgagor, within 10 calendar days from date of receipt of such payment, with a letter of explanation only if one or more of the following conditions exist:
(1) The property is wholly or partially tenant-occupied and rental payments are not being remitted to the holder for application to the loan account;
(2) The payment is less than one full monthly installment, including escrows and late charge, if applicable, unless the lesser payment amount has been agreed to under a repayment plan;
(3) The payment is less than 50 percent of the total amount then due, unless the lesser payment amount has been agreed to under a repayment plan;
(4) The payment is less than the amount agreed to in a repayment plan;
(5) The amount tendered is in the form of a personal check and the holder has previously notified the mortgagor in writing that only cash or certified remittances are acceptable;
(6) A delinquency of any amount has continued for at least 6 months since the account first became delinquent and no repayment plan has been arranged;
(7) Foreclosure has been commenced by the taking of the first action required for foreclosure under local law; or
(8) The holder's lien position would be jeopardized by acceptance of the partial payment.
(c) A failure by the holder to comply with the provisions of this paragraph may result in a partial or total loss of guaranty or insurance pursuant to § 36.4328(b), but such failure shall not constitute a defense to any legal action to terminate the loan.

§ 36.4318
Servicer tier ranking—temporary procedures.
(a) The Secretary shall assign to each servicer a “Tier Ranking” based upon the servicer's performance in servicing guaranteed loans. There shall be four tiers, known as tier one, tier two, tier three, and tier four, with tier one being the highest rated and tier four the lowest. Upon the effective date of this regulation, every servicer of loans guaranteed by the Secretary shall be presumed to be in servicer tier two, and shall remain in tier two until the date specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
(b) For purposes of this section, the term “calendar quarter” shall mean the 3-month periods ending on March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31.
(c)(1) No later than 30 calendar days after the last business day of the first calendar quarter occurring after the rules for determining tier rankings take effect, and then not later than 30 calendar days after the last business day of each subsequent calendar quarter, the Secretary shall provide each servicer with an evaluation of their performance under such rules.

thereafter, VA shall advise each servicer of its tier ranking.
(3) Any entity which begins servicing guaranteed loans after the first calendar quarter occurring after rules for determining tier rankings take effect shall be presumed to be in tier two. The Secretary will evaluate the performance of such servicer as provided in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. The Secretary will advise such servicer of its tier ranking at the time other servicers are advised of their tier rankings pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) of this section, provided the servicer has received evaluations for at least four continuous calendar quarters.

§ 36.4319
Servicer loss-mitigation options and incentives.
(a) The Secretary will pay a servicer in tiers one, two, or three an incentive payment for each of the following successful loss-mitigation options or alternatives to foreclosure completed: repayment plans, special forbearances, loan modifications, short sales, and deeds-in-lieu of foreclosure. Only one incentive payment will be made with respect to any default required to be reported to the Secretary pursuant to § 36.4317(c). No incentive payment will be made to a servicer in tier four. The options and alternatives are listed in paragraph (b) of this section from top to bottom in their preferred order of consideration (
i.e.
, a hierarchy for review), but VA recognizes that individual circumstances may lead to “out of the ordinary” considerations.

(2) With respect to special forbearance (as defined in § 36.4301), when the loan reinstates. If a repayment plan is developed at the end of the forbearance period, then the special forbearance is not eligible for an incentive payment, although the subsequent repayment plan may be eligible upon loan reinstatement;
(3) With respect to a loan modification, when the modification is executed and the loan reinstates;
(4) With respect to a short sale, when the claim under guaranty is filed; or
(5) With respect to a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure, when the claim under guaranty is filed.
(d) Incentive payments with respect to repayment plans, special forbearances and loan modifications shall be made no less frequently than monthly. For all other successful loss-mitigation options, incentives shall be paid in the final claim payment.
(e) The Secretary shall reserve the right to stop an incentive payment to a servicer if the servicer fails to perform adequate servicing.

§ 36.4320
VA purchase of loans in default.
(a) Upon receiving a notice of default or a notice under § 36.4317, the Secretary may require the holder upon
penalty of otherwise losing the guaranty or insurance to transfer and assign the loan and the security therefore to the Secretary or to another designated by the Secretary upon receipt of payment in full of the balance of the indebtedness remaining unpaid to the date of such assignment. Such assignment may be made without recourse but the transferor shall not thereby be relieved from the provisions of § 36.4328.
(b) If the obligation is assigned or transferred to a third party pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section the Secretary may continue in effect the guaranty or insurance issued with respect to the previous loan in such manner as to cover the assignee or transferee.
(c) Servicers must deliver to the Secretary all legal documents, including but not limited to proper loan assignments, required as evidence of proper loan transfer within 60 calendar days from the date that VA sends notice to the servicer that VA has decided to purchase a loan under this section. Servicers exhibiting a continued failure to provide timely loan transfer documentation may, at the discretion of the Secretary and following advance notice to the servicer, be subject to temporary suspension of all property acquisition and claim payments until all deficiencies identified in the notice provided to the servicer have been corrected.

§ 36.4321
Service of process.
(a) In any legal or equitable proceeding to which the Secretary is a party (including probate and bankruptcy proceedings) arising from a loan guaranteed, insured, or made, or a property acquired by the Secretary pursuant to title 38, U.S.C. chapter 37, original process and any other process prior to appearance that may be served on the Secretary must be delivered to the VA Regional Counsel located in the jurisdiction in which the proceeding is docketed. Copies of such process will also be served on the Attorney General of the United States and the United States Attorney having jurisdiction over that area. Within the time required by applicable law, or rule of court, the Secretary will cause appropriate special or general appearance to be entered in the case by an authorized attorney.

§ 36.4322
Loan termination.
(a) For purposes of this part, a holder, using reasonable diligence must complete a foreclosure within the timeframe and in the manner determined by the Secretary. In determining what constitutes allowable time and method for foreclosure, the Secretary shall review allowances for time and method in connection with the foreclosure of single-family housing loans issued by HUD, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac, as well as State statutory requirements. The Secretary will review such timeframes annually and, as the Secretary deems necessary, publish in the
Federal Register
a table setting forth the timeframes and methods the Secretary determines to be reasonable. The schedule will reflect the timeframe allowed for the standard, acceptable method for foreclosure proceedings in each State. The use of another method will require prior approval from VA. VA will maintain the loan termination time allowable timeframes on a Web site under VA's control, such as at
http://www.homeloans.va.gov.
(b)(1) At least 30 days prior to the scheduled or anticipated date of the liquidation sale, the holder must request that VA assign an appraiser to conduct a liquidation appraisal.
(2) If the holder (or its authorized servicing agent) has been approved by
the Secretary to process liquidation appraisals under 38 CFR 36.4348, the appraiser shall forward the liquidation appraisal report directly to the holder for a determination of the fair market value of the property pursuant to § 36.4348.
(3) If the holder (or its authorized servicing agent) has not been approved by the Secretary to process liquidations appraisals under 38 CFR 36.4348, the Secretary shall review the appraisal and determine the fair market value of the property. The Secretary will provide the holder with a statement of the fair market value.
(4)(i) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section, a liquidation appraisal or statement of fair market value issued pursuant to paragraph (b)(3) of this section will be valid for 180 calendar days.
(ii) The Secretary may specify in writing a shorter validity period, not less than 90 calendar days, for a liquidation appraisal or statement of fair market value if rapidly-changing market conditions in the area where the property is located make such shorter validity period in the best fiscal interests of the United States.
(c) Prior to the liquidation sale, the holder shall compute the net value of the property securing the guaranteed loan by subtracting the estimated costs to the Secretary for the acquisition and disposition of the property from the fair market value, as determined under paragraph (b) of this section. Those costs will be calculated using the percentage derived by the Secretary and published in the
Federal Register
pursuant to § 36.4301.
(d) If the holder learns of any material damage to the property occurring after the appraisal and prior to the liquidation sale, the impact of such damage on the fair market value must be determined in consultation with the fee appraiser, and the net value adjusted accordingly.
(e)(1) A holder may approve a short sale of the property securing the loan without the prior approval of the Secretary provided that:
(i) The holder has determined the loan is insoluble;
(ii) The credit to the indebtedness (consisting of the net proceeds from the short sale and any waiver of indebtedness by the holder) must equal or exceed the net value of the property securing the loan; and
(iii) The current owner of the property securing the loan will not receive any proceeds from the sale of the property.
(2) A holder may request advance approval from the Secretary for a short sale notwithstanding that all of the conditions specified in paragraph (e)(1) of this section cannot be met if the holder believes such short sale would be in the best interests of the veteran and the Secretary.
(f)(1) A holder may accept a deed voluntarily tendered by the current owner of the property securing the loan in lieu of conducting a foreclosure without the prior approval of the Secretary provided that:
(i) The holder has determined the loan is insoluble;
(ii) The holder has computed the net value of the property securing the loan pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section;
(iii) The holder has considered a short sale pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section and determined such short sale is not practical; and,
(iv) The holder has determined the current owner of the property can convey clear and marketable title to the property that would meet the standard stated in paragraph (d)(5) of § 36.4323.
(2) A holder may request advance approval from the Secretary for a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure notwithstanding that all of the conditions specified in paragraph (f)(1) of this section cannot be met if the holder believes such deed-in-lieu would be in the best interests of the veteran and the Secretary.

§ 36.4323
Election to convey security.
(a) If the holder acquires the property that secured the guaranteed loan at the liquidation sale or through acceptance of a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure and if, under 38 U.S.C. 3732(c), the Secretary may accept conveyance of the property, the holder must notify
the Secretary by electronic means no later than 15 calendar days after the date of liquidation sale (
i.e.
, the event which fixes the rights of the parties in the property, such as the date of foreclosure sale, date of recordation of a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure, or confirmation/ratification of sale date when required under local practice) that the holder elects to convey the property to the Secretary. The Secretary will not accept conveyance of the property if the holder fails to notify the Secretary of its election within such 15 calendar days. In computing the eligible indebtedness under 38 U.S.C. 3732(c), the holder may follow the alternative procedure described in paragraph (b) of this section.
(b) If the calculation by the holder shows that the net value is equal to or less than the unguaranteed portion of the loan (
i.e.
, the total indebtedness minus VA's maximum claim payable under the guaranty), this would preclude conveyance under 38 U.S.C. 3732(c). However, the holder may desire to convey the property to VA and may decide to waive a portion of the indebtedness to the extent that the property may be conveyed under 38 U.S.C. 3732(c). In such a case, the holder must provide the notice described in paragraph (a) of this section, and must subsequently waive that portion of the total indebtedness remaining after application of the net value amount and VA's guaranty claim payment. The holder must send the borrower(s) a notice describing the amount of indebtedness that has been waived no later than 15 calendar days after receipt of the guaranty claim.
(c) The holder, in accounting to the Secretary in connection with the conveyance of any property pursuant to this section, may include as a part of the indebtedness all actual expenses or costs of the proceedings, paid by the holder, within the limits defined in § 36.4314. In connection with the conveyance or transfer of property to the Secretary the holder may include in accounting to the Secretary the following expense items if actually paid by the holder, in addition to the consideration payable for the property under 38 U.S.C. 3732(c):
(1) State and documentary stamp taxes as may be required.
(2) Amount expended for taxes, special assessments, including such payments which are specified in paragraph (d)(4) of this section.
(3) Recording fees.
(4) Any other expenditures in connection with the property which are approved by the Secretary, including, but not limited to, the cost of a title policy insuring title in the name of the Secretary of Veterans Affairs.
(d) The conveyance or transfer of any property to the Secretary pursuant to this section shall be subject to the following provisions:
(1) The notice of the holder's election to convey the property to the Secretary shall state the amount of the holder's successful bid and shall state the insurance coverage then in force, specifying for each policy, the name of the insurance company, the hazard covered, the amount, and the expiration date. With respect to a voluntary conveyance to the holder in lieu of foreclosure, the amount of the holder's successful bid shall be deemed to be the lesser of the net value of the property or the total indebtedness.
(2) Coincident with the notice of election to convey or transfer the property to the Secretary or with the acquisition of the property by the holder, following such notice, whichever is later, the holder shall request endorsements on all insurance policies naming the Secretary as an assured, as his/her interest may appear. Such insurance policies shall be forwarded to the Secretary at the time of the conveyance or transfer of the property to the Secretary or as soon after that time as feasible. If insurers cancel policies, holders must properly account for any unearned premiums refunded by the insurer.
(3) Occupancy of the property by anyone properly in possession by virtue of and during a period of redemption, or by anyone else unless under a claim of title which makes the title sought to be conveyed by the holder of less dignity or quality than that required by this section, shall not preclude the holder from conveying or transferring the property to the Secretary. Except
with the prior approval of the Secretary, the holder shall not rent the property to a new tenant, nor extend the term of an existing tenancy on other than a month-to-month basis.
(4) The notice shall provide property tax information to include all taxing authority property identification numbers. Any taxes, special assessments or ground rents due and payable within 30 days after date of conveyance or transfer to the Secretary must be paid by the holder.
(5)(i) Each conveyance or transfer of real property to the Secretary pursuant to this section shall be acceptable if:
(A) The holder thereby covenants or warrants against the acts of the holder and those claiming under the holder (e.g., by special warranty deed); and
(B) It vests in the Secretary or will entitle the Secretary to such title as is or would be acceptable to prudent lending institutions, informed buyers, title companies, and attorneys, generally, in the community in which the property is situated.
(ii) Any title will not be unacceptable to the Secretary by reason of any of the limitations on the quantum or quality of the property or title stated in § 36.4354(b),
Provided,
that:
(A) At the time of conveyance or transfer to the Secretary there has been no breach of any conditions affording a right to the exercise of any reverter.
(B) With respect to any such limitations which came into existence subsequent to the making of the loan, full compliance was had with the requirements of § 36.4327.
(iii) The acceptability of a conveyance or transfer pursuant to the requirements of this paragraph will generally be established by delivery to the Secretary of the following evidence of title showing that title to the property of the quality specified in this paragraph (d)(5) is or will be vested in the Secretary:
(A) A copy of the deed or document evidencing transfer of interest and title at the liquidation sale;
(B) A special warranty deed conveying the property to the Secretary;
(C) Origination Deed of Trust or Mortgage;
(D) Original or Copy of Mortgagee's Title Insurance Policy from Loan Origination (except in Iowa, where a title abstract is required);
(E) Owner's Title Insurance Policy issued after loan termination in the name of the Secretary (except in Iowa, where a title abstract is required);
(F) Loan Assignments;
(G) Appointment of Substitute Trustee (where required as part of the termination process);
(H) Estoppel Affidavit for deed in lieu of foreclosure, if required by State law and appropriate language cannot be included in the deed in lieu of foreclosure; and/or
(I) Any evidence that the Secretary may reasonably require.
(iv) In lieu of such title evidence listed in paragraph (d)(5)(iii) of this section, the Secretary will accept a conveyance or transfer with general warranty with respect to the title from a holder described in 38 U.S.C. 3702(d) or from a holder of financial responsibility satisfactory to the Secretary.
(6) Except with respect to matters covered by any covenants or warranties of the holder, the acceptance by the Secretary of a conveyance or transfer by the holder shall conclude the responsibility of the holder to the Secretary under the regulations of this subpart with respect to the title. In the event of the subsequent discovery of title defects, the Secretary shall have no recourse against the holder with respect to such title other than by reason of such covenants or warranties.
(7) As between the holder and the Secretary, the responsibility for any loss due to damage to or destruction of the property or due to personal injury sustained in respect to such property shall be governed by the provisions of this paragraph and paragraph (d)(11) of this section. Ordinary wear and tear excepted, the holder shall bear such risk of loss from the date of acquisition by the holder to the date such risk of loss is assumed by the Secretary. Such risk of loss is assumed by the Secretary from the date of receipt of the holder's election to convey or transfer the property to the Secretary. The amount of any loss chargeable to the holder may be deducted from the amount payable by the Secretary at
the time the property is transferred. In any case where pursuant to the VA regulations rejection of the title is legally proper, the Secretary may surrender custody of the property as of the date specified in the Secretary's notice to the holder. The Secretary's assumption of such risk shall terminate upon such surrender.
(8) The conveyance should be made to “Secretary of Veterans Affairs, an Officer of the United States.” The name of the incumbent Secretary should not be included unless State law requires naming a real person.
(9) The holder shall not be liable to the Secretary for any portion of the paid or unpaid taxes, special assessments, ground rents, insurance premiums, or other similar items. The holder shall be liable to the Secretary for all penalties and interest associated with taxes not timely paid by the holder prior to conveyance.
(10) The Secretary shall be entitled to all rentals and other income collected from the property and to any insurance proceeds or refunds subsequent to the date of acquisition by the holder.
(11) In respect to a property which was the security for a condominium loan guaranteed or insured under 38 U.S.C. 3710(a)(6) the responsibility for any loss due to damage to or destruction of the property or due to personal injury sustained in respect to such property shall in no event pass to the Secretary until the Secretary expressly assumes such responsibility or until conveyance of the property to the Secretary, whichever first occurs. The holder shall have the right to convey such property to the Secretary only if the property (including elements of the development or project owned in common with other unit owners) is undamaged by fire, earthquake, windstorm, flooding or boiler explosion. The absence of a right in the holder to convey such property which is so damaged shall not preclude a conveyance, if the Secretary agrees in a given case to such a conveyance upon completion of repairs within a specified period of time and such repairs are so completed and the conveyance is otherwise in order.
(e) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(6) of this section, the provisions of this section shall not be in derogation of any rights which the Secretary may have under § 36.4328. The Under Secretary for Benefits, or the Executive Director, Loan Guaranty Service, may authorize any deviation from the provisions of this section, within the limitations prescribed in 38 U.S.C. chapter 37, which may be necessary or desirable to accomplish the objectives of this section if such deviation is made necessary by reason of any laws or practice in any State or Territory or the District of Columbia,
Provided,
that no such deviation shall impair the rights of any holder not consenting to the deviation with respect to loans made or approved prior to the date the holder is notified of such action.

§ 36.4324
Guaranty claims; subsequent accounting.
(a) Subject to the limitation that the total amounts payable shall in no event exceed the amount originally guaranteed, or in the case of a modified loan, such amount as may have been increased under the provisions of § 36.4315(h)(2), the amount payable on a claim for the guaranty shall be the percentage of the loan originally guaranteed, or the percentage as adjusted under § 36.4315(h)(2), whichever is applicable, applied to the sum of:
(1) The unpaid principal as of the date of the liquidation sale;
(2) Allowable expenses/advances as described in § 36.4314; and
(3) The lesser of:
(i) The unpaid interest as of the date of the liquidation sale; or
(ii) The unpaid interest for the reasonable period that the Secretary has determined, pursuant to § 36.4322(a), it should have taken to complete the foreclosure, plus 210 days from the due date of the last paid installment. This
amount will be increased if the Secretary determines the holder was unable to complete the foreclosure within the time specified in this paragraph due to Bankruptcy proceedings, appeal of the foreclosure by the debtor, the holder granting forbearance in excess of 30 days at the request of the Secretary, or other factors beyond the control of the holder.
(b) Deposits or other credits or setoffs legally applicable to the indebtedness shall be applied in reduction of the indebtedness on which the claim is based. Any escrowed or earmarked funds not subject to superior claims of third persons must likewise be so applied.
(c)(1) Credits accruing from the proceeds of a liquidation sale shall be reported to the Secretary incident to claim submission, and the amount payable on the claim shall in no event exceed the remaining balance of the indebtedness.
(2) The amount payable under the guaranty shall be computed applying the formulae in 38 U.S.C. 3732(c). With respect to a voluntary conveyance to the holder in lieu of foreclosure, the holder shall be deemed to have acquired the property at the liquidation sale for the lesser of the net value of the property or the total indebtedness.
(d)(1)(i) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section, holders shall file a claim for payment under the guaranty electronically no later than 1 year after the completion of the liquidation sale. For purposes of this section, the liquidation sale will be considered completed when:
(A) The last act required under State law is taken to make the liquidation sale final, but excluding any redemption period permitted under State law;
(B) If a holder accepts a voluntary conveyance of the property in lieu of foreclosure, the date of recordation of the deed to the holder or the holder's designee; or
(C) In the case of a sale of the property to a third party for an amount less than is sufficient to repay the unpaid balance on the loan where the holder has agreed in advance to release the lien in exchange for the proceeds of such sale, the date of settlement of such sale.
(ii) With respect to any liquidation sale completed prior to February 1, 2008, all claims must be submitted no later than February 2, 2009.
(2) If additional information becomes known to a holder after the filing of a guaranty claim, the holder may file a supplemental claim provided that such supplemental claim is filed within the time period specified in paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
(3) No claim under a guaranty shall be payable unless it is submitted within the time period specified in paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
(4) A claim shall be submitted to VA electronically on the VA Loan Electronic Reporting Interface system.
(5) Supporting documents will not be submitted with the claim, but must be retained by the servicer and are subject to inspection as provided in § 36.4333 of this title.
(e) In the event that VA does not approve payment of any item submitted under a guaranty claim, VA shall notify the holder electronically what items are being denied and the reasons for such denial. The holder may, within 30 days after the date of such denial notification, submit an electronic request to VA that one or more items that were denied be reconsidered. The holder must present any additional information justifying payment of items denied.

Computation of indebtedness.
In computing the indebtedness for the purpose of filing a claim for payment of a guaranty or for payment of an insured loss, or in the event of a transfer of the loan under § 36.4320(a), or other accounting to the Secretary, the holder shall not be entitled to treat repayments theretofore made as liquidated damages, or rentals, or otherwise than as payments on the indebtedness, notwithstanding any provision in
the note, or mortgage, or otherwise, to the contrary.

§ 36.4326
Subrogation and indemnity.
(a) The Secretary shall be subrogated to the contract and the lien or other rights of the holder to the extent of any sum paid on a guaranty or on account of an insured loss, which right shall be junior to the holder's rights as against the debtor or the encumbered property until the holder shall have received the full amount payable under the contract with the debtor. No partial or complete release by a creditor shall impair the rights of the Secretary with respect to the debtor's obligation.
(b) The holder, upon request, shall execute, acknowledge and deliver an appropriate instrument tendered for that purpose, evidencing any payment received from the Secretary and the Secretary's resulting right of subrogation.
(c) The Secretary shall cause the instrument required by paragraph (b) of this section to be filed for record in the office of the recorder of deeds, or other appropriate office of the proper county, town or State, in accordance with the applicable State law. The filing or failure to file such instrument for record shall have the legal results prescribed by the applicable law of the State where the real or personal property is situated, with respect to filing or failure to so file mortgages and other lien instruments and assignments thereof. The references herein to “filing for record” include “registration” or any similar transaction, by whatever name designated when title to the encumbered property has been “registered” pursuant to a Torrens or other similar title registration system provided by law.
(d) As a condition to paying a claim for an insured loss the Secretary may require that the loan, including any security or judgment held therefor, be assigned to the extent of such payment, and if any claim has been filed in bankruptcy, insolvency, probate, or similar proceedings such claim may likewise be required to be so assigned.
(e) Any amounts paid by the Secretary on account of the liabilities of any veteran guaranteed or insured under the provisions of 38 U.S.C. chapter 37 shall constitute a debt owing to the United States by such veteran. Before a liquidation sale, an official authorized to act for the Secretary under provisions of § 36.4345 may approve a complete or partial release of the Secretary's right to collect a debt owing to the United States under this paragraph and/or under paragraph (a) of this section as follows:
(1)
Complete release.
VA will approve a complete release if an official authorized to act for the Secretary under § 36.4345 determines that all of the following are true:
(i) The loan default was caused by circumstances beyond the control of the obligor; and
(ii) There are no indications of fraud, misrepresentation or bad faith on the part of the obligor in obtaining the loan or in connection with the loan default; and
(iii) The obligor cooperated with VA in exploring all realistic alternatives to termination of the loan through foreclosure, and, either:
(A) Review of the obligor's current financial situation and prospective earning potential and obligations indicates there are no realistic prospects that the obligor could repay all or part of the anticipated debt within six years after the liquidation sale and still provide the necessities of life for himself or herself and his or her family; or,
(B) In consideration for a release of the Secretary's collection rights the obligor completes, or VA is enabled to authorize, an action which reduces the Government's claim liability sufficiently to offset the amount of the anticipated indebtedness which would otherwise be established pursuant to this paragraph and likely be collectible by VA after foreclosure in view of the obligor's financial situation. Such actions would include termination of the loan by means of a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure, private sale of the property for less than the indebtedness with a reduced claim paid by VA for the balance due the loan holder, or enabling VA to authorize the holder to elect a more expeditious foreclosure procedure when
such an election would result in the legal release of the obligor's liability; or
(C) The obligor being released is not the current titleholder to the property and there are no indications of fraud, misrepresentation, or bad faith on the obligor's part in disposing of the property.
(2)
Partial release.
In the event of a partial release, the amount of indebtedness established will be such that the obligor's financial situation permits repayment of the debt to the Government in regular monthly installments of principal plus interest over a five year period commencing within one year after the date the promissory note is executed, except in those cases in which a lump sum settlement appears to be in the best interest of the Government or in which it appears the obligor may reasonably expect significant changes in his or her financial situation which would permit higher payments to be made during later periods of the life of the note. VA may authorize a partial release if an official authorized to act for the Secretary under § 36.4345 determines that all of the following are true:
(i) The loan default was caused by circumstances beyond the control of the obligor; and,
(ii) There are no indications of fraud, misrepresentation or bad faith on the part of the obligor in obtaining the loan or in connection with the loan default; and,
(iii) The obligor cooperated with VA in exploring all realistic alternatives to termination of the loan through foreclosure; and,
(iv) Review of the obligor's current financial situation and prospective earning potential and obligations indicates there are no realistic prospects that the obligor could repay all of the anticipated debt within six years of the liquidation sale while providing the necessities of life for himself or herself and his or her family; and,
(v) The obligor executes a written agreement acknowledging his or her liability to VA under this paragraph and executes a promissory note which provides for regular amortized monthly payments of an amount determined by VA in accordance with paragraph (e)(3) of this section including interest on the total amount payable at the rate in effect for Loan Guaranty liability accounts at the time of execution, or, the obligor agrees to other terms of repayment acceptable to VA including payment of a lump sum in settlement of his or her obligation under this paragraph.
(3)
Review of obligor's financial situation.
For purposes of authorizing a complete or partial release under this paragraph, a VA official reviewing an obligor's financial situation will consider all of the following:
(i) The obligor's current and anticipated family income based on employment skills and experience;
(ii) The obligor's current short-term and long-term financial obligations, including the obligation to repay the Government which must be afforded consideration at least equal to his or her consumer debt obligations;
(iii) A current credit report on the obligor;
(iv) The obligor's assets and net worth; and
(v) The required balance available for family support used in underwriting VA guaranteed loans in the area.
(4) Determinations made under paragraphs (e)(1) and (2) of this section are intended for the benefit of the Government in reducing the amount of claim payable by VA and/or avoiding the establishment of uncollectible debts owing to the United States. Such determinations are discretionary on the part of VA and shall not constitute a defense to any legal action to terminate the loan nor vest any appellate right in an obligor which would require further review of the case.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 501, 3703(c)(1), 5302)
(f) Whenever any veteran disposes of residential property securing a guaranteed or insured loan obtained by him or her under 38 U.S.C. chapter 37, and for which the commitment to make the loan was made prior to March 1, 1988, the Secretary, upon application made by such veteran, shall issue to the veteran a release relieving him or her of all further liability to the Secretary on
account of such loan (including liability for any loss resulting from any default of the transferee or any subsequent purchaser of such property) if the Secretary has determined, after such investigation as may be deemed appropriate, that there has been compliance with the conditions prescribed in 38 U.S.C. 3713. The assumption of full liability for repayment of the loan by the transferee of the property must be evidenced by an agreement in writing in such form as the Secretary may require. Release of the veteran from liability to the Secretary will not impair or otherwise affect the Secretary's guaranty or insurance liability on the loan, or the liability of the veteran to the holder. Any release of liability granted to a veteran by the Secretary shall inure to the spouse of such veteran. The release of the veteran from liability to the Secretary will constitute the Secretary's prior approval to a release of the veteran from liability on the loan by the holder thereof.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3713)
(g) If any veteran disposes of residential property securing a guaranteed or insured loan obtained under 38 U.S.C. chapter 37, without receiving a release from liability with respect to such loan under 38 U.S.C. 3713 and a default subsequently occurs which results in liability of the veteran to the Secretary on account of the loan, the Secretary may relieve the veteran of such liability if he determines that:
(1) A transferee either immediate or remote is legally liable to the Secretary for the debt of the original veteran-borrower established after the termination of the loan, and
(2) The original loan was current at the time such transferee acquired the property, and
(3) The transferee who is liable to the Secretary is found to have been a satisfactory credit risk at the time he or she acquired the property.
(h)(1) If a veteran or any other person disposes of residential property securing a guaranteed or insured loan for which a commitment was made on or after March 1, 1988, and the veteran or other person notifies the loan holder in writing before disposing of the property, the veteran or other person shall be relieved of all further liability to the Secretary with respect to the loan (including liability for any loss resulting from any default of the purchaser or any subsequent owner of the property) and the application for assumption shall be approved if the holder determines that:
(i) The proposed purchaser is creditworthy;
(ii) The proposed purchaser is contractually obligated to assume the loan and the liability to indemnify the Department of Veterans Affairs for the amount of any claim paid under the guaranty as a result of a default on the loan, or has already done so; and
(iii) The payments on the loan are current.
(2) Should these requirements be satisfied, the holder may also release the veteran or other person from liability on the loan. This does not apply if the approval for the assumption is granted upon special appeal to avoid immediate foreclosure.
(i) If a veteran requests a release of liability under paragraph (f) of this section, or if a borrower requests a release of liability pursuant to § 36.4309(c)(1)(vii), a holder described in the first sentence of § 36.4303(l)(1)(i) is authorized to and must make all decisions regarding the credit-worthiness of the transferee, subject to the right of a transferee to appeal any denial to the Secretary within 30 days of being notified in writing of the denial by the holder or servicer. The procedures and fees specified in §§ 36.4303(l)(1)(i) and 36.4313(d)(8) applicable to decisions under 38 U.S.C. 3714 shall also apply to decisions specified in this paragraph.

§ 36.4327
Release of security.
(a)(1) Except upon full payment of the indebtedness, or except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section or in paragraphs (e) and (f) of § 36.4322, the holder shall not release a lien or other
right in or to real property held as security for a guaranteed or insured loan, or grant a fee or other interest in such property, without prior approval of the Secretary.
(2) The holder may, without the prior approval of the Secretary, release the lien on a portion of the property securing the loan provided:
(i) The holder has obtained an appraisal from the Secretary showing the value of the security prior to the partial release of the lien and the value of the security on which the lien will remain;
(ii) The portion of the property still subject to the lien is fit for dwelling purposes; and
(iii) The loan-to-value ratio after the partial release of the lien:
(A) Will be not more than 80 percent; or
(B) If the loan-to-value ratio after the partial release of the lien is 80 percent or higher, any proceeds received as consideration from the partial release of the lien shall be applied to the unpaid loan balance.
(b) A holder may release from the lien personal property including crops without the prior approval of the Secretary.
(c) Failure of the holder to comply with the provisions of this section shall not in itself affect the validity of the title of a purchaser to the property released.
(d) The release of the personal liability of any obligor on a guaranteed or insured obligation resultant from the act or omission of any holder without the prior approval of the Secretary shall release the obligation of the Secretary as guarantor or insurer, except when such act or omission consists of:
(1) Failure to establish the debt as a valid claim against the assets of the estate of any deceased obligor, provided no lien for the guaranteed or insured debt is thereby impaired or destroyed; or
(2) An election and appropriate prosecution of legally available effective remedies with respect to the repossession or the liquidation of the security in any case, irrespective of the identity or the survival of the original or of any subsequent debtor, if holder shall have given such notice as required by § 36.4317 and if, after receiving such notice, the Secretary shall have failed to notify the holder within 15 days to proceed in such manner as to effectively preserve the personal liability of the parties liable, or such of them as the Secretary indicates in such notice to the holder; or
(3) The release of an obligor, or obligors, from liability on an obligation secured by a lien on property, which release is an incident of and contemporaneous with the sale of such property to an eligible veteran who assumed such obligation, which assumed obligation is guaranteed on the assuming veteran's account pursuant to 38 U.S.C. chapter 37; or
(4) The release of an obligor or obligors as provided in § 36.4315; or, the release of an obligor, or obligors, incident to the sale of property securing the loan which the holder is authorized to approve under the provisions of 38 U.S.C. 3714.

§ 36.4328
Partial or total loss of guaranty or insurance.
(a) Subject to the incontestable provisions of 38 U.S.C. 3721 as to loans guaranteed or insured on or subsequent to July 1, 1948, there shall be no liability on account of a guaranty or insurance, or any certificate or other evidence thereof, with respect to a transaction in which a signature to the note, the mortgage, or any other loan papers, or the application for guaranty or insurance is a forgery; or in which the certificate of discharge or the certificate of eligibility is counterfeited, or falsified, or is not issued by the Government.
(1) Except as to a holder who acquired the loan instrument before maturity, for value, and without notice, and who has not directly or by agent participated in the fraud, or in the misrepresentation hereinafter specified, any willful and material misrepresentation or fraud by the lender, or by a holder, or the agent of either, in procuring the guaranty or the insurance credit, shall relieve the Secretary of liability, or, as to loans guaranteed or
insured on, or subsequent to July 1, 1948, shall constitute a defense against liability on account of the guaranty or insurance of the loan in respect to which the willful misrepresentation, or the fraud, is practiced:
Provided
, that if a misrepresentation, although material, is not made willfully, or with fraudulent intent, it shall have only the consequences prescribed in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.
(2) [Reserved]
(b) In taking security required by 38 U.S.C. chapter 37 and the regulations concerning guaranty or insurance of loans to veterans, a holder shall obtain the required lien on property the title to which is such as to be acceptable to prudent lending institutions, informed buyers, title companies, and attorneys, generally, in the community in which the property is situated:
Provided
, that a title will not be unacceptable by reason of any of the limitations on the quantum or quality of the property or title stated in § 36.4354(b) and if such holder fails in this respect or fails to comply with 38 U.S.C. chapter 37 and the regulations concerning guaranty or insurance of loans to veterans, then no claim on the guaranty or insurance shall be paid on account of the loan with respect to which such failure occurred, or in respect to which an unwillful misrepresentation occurred, until the amount by which the ultimate liability of the Secretary would thereby be increased has been ascertained. The burden of proof shall be upon the holder to establish that no increase of ultimate liability is attributable to such failure or misrepresentation. The amount of increased liability of the Secretary shall be offset by deduction from the amount of the guaranty or insurance otherwise payable, or if consequent upon loss of security shall be offset by crediting to the indebtedness the amount of the impairment as proceeds of the sale of security in the final accounting to the Secretary. To the extent the loss resultant from the failure or misrepresentation prejudices the Secretary's right of subrogation acceptance by the holder of the guaranty or insurance payment shall subordinate the holder's right to those of the Secretary. Adjustments under this section may be made for failure to comply with:
(1) Obtaining and retaining a lien of the dignity prescribed on all property upon which a lien is required by 38 U.S.C. chapter 37 or the regulations concerning guaranty or insurance of loans to veterans,
(2) Inclusion of power to substitute trustees (§ 36.4330),
(3) The procurement and maintenance of insurance coverage (§ 36.4329),
(4) Any notice required by § 36.4317,
(5) The release, conveyance, substitution, or exchange of security (§ 36.4327),
(6) Lack of legal capacity of a party to the transaction incident to which the guaranty or the insurance is granted (§ 36.4331),
(7) Failure of the lender to see that any escrowed or earmarked account is expended in accordance with the agreement,
(8) The taking into consideration of limitations upon the quantum or quality of the estate or property (§ 36.4354(b)),
(9) Any other requirement of 38 U.S.C. chapter 37 or the regulations concerning guaranty or insurance of loans to veterans which does not by the terms of said chapter or the regulations concerning guaranty or insurance of loans to veterans result in relieving the Secretary of all liability with respect to the loan,
(c) If after the payment of a guaranty or an insurance loss, or after a loan is transferred pursuant to § 36.4320(a), the fraud, misrepresentation or failure to comply with the regulations in this subpart as provided in this section is discovered and the Secretary determines that an increased loss to the government resulted therefrom the transferor or person to whom such payment was made shall be liable to the Secretary for the amount of the loss caused by such misrepresentation or failure.

§ 36.4329
Hazard insurance.
The holder shall require insurance policies to be procured and maintained
in an amount sufficient to protect the security against the risks or hazards to which it may be subjected to the extent customary in the locality. All moneys received under such policies covering payment of insured losses shall be applied to restoration of the security or to the loan balance. Flood insurance will be required on any building or personal property securing a loan at any time during the term of the loan that such security is located in an area identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency as having special flood hazards and in which flood insurance has been made available under the National Flood Insurance Act, as amended. The amount of flood insurance must be at least equal to the lesser of the outstanding principal balance of the loan or the maximum limit of coverage available for the particular type of property under the National Flood Insurance Act, as amended. The Secretary cannot guarantee a loan for the acquisition or construction of property located in an area identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency as having special flood hazards unless the community in which such area is situated is then participating in the National Flood Insurance Program.

In jurisdictions in which valid, any deed of trust or mortgage securing a guaranteed or insured loan, if it names trustees, or confers a power of sale otherwise, shall contain a provision empowering any holder of the indebtedness to appoint substitute trustees, or other person with such power to sell, who shall succeed to all the rights, powers and duties of the trustees, or other person, originally designated.

Capacity of parties to contract.
Nothing in §§ 36.4300 through 36.4380 shall be construed to relieve any lender of responsibility otherwise existing, for any loss caused by the lack of legal capacity of any person to contract, convey, or encumber, or caused by the existence of other legal disability or defects invalidating, or rendering unenforceable in whole or in part, either the loan obligation or the security therefor.

Maintenance of records.
(a)(1) The holder shall maintain a record of the amounts of payments received on the obligation and disbursements chargeable thereto and the dates thereof, including copies of bills and receipts for such disbursements. These records shall be maintained until the Secretary ceases to be liable as guarantor or insurer of the loan, or, if the Secretary has paid a claim on the guaranty, until 3 years after such claim was paid. For the purpose of any accounting with the Secretary or computation of a claim, any holder who fails to maintain such record and, upon request, make it available to the Secretary for review shall be presumed to have received on the dates due all sums which by the terms of the contract are payable prior to date of claim for default, or to have not made the disbursement for which reimbursement is claimed, and the burden of going forward with evidence and of ultimate proof of the contrary shall be on such holder.
(2) The holder shall maintain records supporting their decision to approve any loss mitigation option. The holder shall maintain records supporting their
decision to pursue a partial claim payment under the COVID-19 Veterans Assistance Partial Claim Payment program established under subpart F of this part. Such records shall be retained a minimum of 3 years from the date of any incentive paid in accordance with § 36.4319(a) or, in the case of a partial claim payment under the COVID-19 Veterans Assistance Partial Claim Payment program, the date the veteran's guaranteed loan is made current under such program, whichever is later, and shall include, but not be limited to, credit reports, verifications of income, employment, assets, liabilities, and other factors affecting the obligor's credit worthiness, work sheets, and other documents supporting the holder's decision.
(3) For any loan where the claim on the guaranty was paid on or after February 1, 2008, or action described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section was taken after February 1, 2008, holders shall submit any documents described in paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section to the Secretary in electronic form;
i.e.
, an image of the original document in .jpg, .gif, .pdf, or a similar widely accepted format.
(b) The lender shall retain copies of all loan origination records on a VA-guaranteed loan for at least two years from the date of loan closing.

If such requirement, condition, or limitation is of an administrative or procedural (not substantive) nature, any employee designated in § 36.4345 is hereby authorized to grant similar relief if he or she finds the failure or error of the lender was due to misunderstanding or mistake and that the interests of the Government are not adversely affected. Provisions of the regulations considered to be of an administrative or procedural (nonsubstantive) nature are limited to the following:

§ 36.4339
Eligibility of loans; reasonable value requirements.
(a) Evidence of guaranty or insurance shall be issued in respect to a loan for any of the purposes specified in 38 U.S.C. 3710(a) only if all of the following conditions are met:
(1) The proceeds of such loan have been used to pay for the property purchased, constructed, repaired, refinanced, altered, or improved.
(2) Except as to refinancing loans pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 3710(a)(8), (a)(9)(B)(i), (a)(11), or (b)(7) and energy efficient mortgages pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 3710(d), the loan (including any scheduled deferred interest added to principal) does not exceed the reasonable value of the property or projected reasonable value of a new home which is security for a graduated payment mortgage loan, as appropriate, as determined by the Secretary. For the purpose of determining the reasonable value of a graduated payment mortgage loan to purchase a new home, the reasonable value of the property as of the time the loan is made shall be calculated to increase at a rate not in excess of 2.5 percent per year, but in no event may the projected value of the property exceed 115 percent of the initially established reasonable value.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3703(d)(2))
(3) The veteran has certified, in such form as the Secretary may prescribe, that the veteran has paid in cash from his or her own resources on account of such purchase, construction, alteration, repair, or improvement a sum equal to the difference, if any, between the purchase price or cost of the property and its reasonable value.
(b) A loan guaranteed under 38 U.S.C. 3710(d) which includes the cost of energy efficient improvements may exceed the reasonable value of the property. The cost of the energy efficient improvements that may be financed may not exceed $3,000; provided, however, that up to $6,000 in energy efficient improvements may be financed if the increase in the monthly payment for principal and interest does not exceed the likely reduction in monthly utility costs resulting from the energy efficient improvements.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3710)
(c) Notwithstanding that the aggregate of the loan amount in the case of loans for the purposes specified in paragraph (a) of this section, and the amount remaining unpaid on taxes, special assessments, prior mortgage indebtedness, or other obligations of any character secured by enforceable superior liens or a right to such lien existing as of the date the loan is closed exceeds the reasonable value of such property as of said date and that evidence of guaranty or insurance credit is issued in respect thereof, as between the holder and Secretary (for the purpose of computing the claim on the guaranty or insurance and for the purposes of § 36.4323, and all accounting), the indebtedness which is the subject of the guaranty or insurance shall be deemed to have been reduced as of the date of the loan by a sum equal to such excess, less any amounts secured by liens released or paid on the obligations secured by such superior liens or rights by a holder or others without expense to or obligation on the debtor resulting from such payment, or release of lien or right; and all payments made on the loan shall be applied to the indebtedness as so reduced. Nothing in this paragraph affects any right or liability resulting from fraud or willful misrepresentation.

§ 36.4340
Underwriting standards, processing procedures, lender responsibility, and lender certification.
(a)
Use of standards.
The standards contained in paragraphs (c) through (j) of this section will be used to determine whether the veteran's present and anticipated income and expenses, and credit history, are satisfactory. These standards do not apply to loans guaranteed pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 3710(a)(8) except for cases where the Secretary is required to approve the loan in advance under § 36.4307.
(b)(1)
Waiver of standards.
Use of the standards in paragraphs (c) through (j) of this section for underwriting home loans will be waived only in extraordinary circumstances when the Secretary determines, considering the totality of circumstances, that the veteran is a satisfactory credit risk.
(2)
Exemption from income verification for certain refinance loans.
Notwithstanding paragraphs (a) and (b)(1) of
this section, a streamlined refinance loan to be guaranteed pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 3710(a)(8) and (e) is exempt from income verification requirements of the Truth-in-Lending Act (15 U.S.C. 1639C) and its implementing regulations only if all of the following conditions are met:
(i) The veteran is not 30 days or more past due on the prior existing residential mortgage loan;
(ii) The proposed streamlined refinance loan would not increase the principal balance outstanding on the prior existing residential mortgage loan, except to the extent of fees and charges allowed by VA;
(iii) Total points and fees payable in connection with the proposed streamlined refinance loan are in accordance with 12 CFR 1026.32, will not exceed 3 percent of the total new loan amount, and are in compliance with VA's allowable fees and charges found at 38 CFR 36.4313;
(iv) The interest rate on the proposed streamlined refinance loan will be lower than the interest rate on the original loan, unless the borrower is refinancing from an adjustable rate to a fixed-rate loan, under guidelines that VA has established;
(v) The proposed streamlined refinance loan will be subject to a payment schedule that will fully amortize the IRRRL in accordance with VA regulations;
(vi) The terms of the proposed streamlined refinance loan will not result in a balloon payment, as defined in TILA; and
(vii) Both the residential mortgage loan being refinanced and the proposed streamlined refinance loan satisfy all other VA requirements.
(Authority: 15 U.S.C. 1639C(a)(5), 38 U.S.C. 3710)
(c)
Methods.
The two primary underwriting standards that will be used in determining the adequacy of the veteran's present and anticipated income are debt-to-income ratio and residual income analysis. They are described in paragraphs (d) through (f) of this section. Ordinarily, to qualify for a loan, the veteran must meet both standards. Failure to meet one standard, however, will not automatically disqualify a veteran. The following exceptions shall apply to cases where a veteran does not meet both standards:
(1) If the debt-to-income ratio is 41 percent or less, and the veteran does not meet the residual income standard, the loan may be approved with justification, by the underwriter's supervisor, as set out in paragraph (c)(4) of this section.
(2) If the debt-to-income ratio is greater than 41 percent (unless it is larger due solely to the existence of tax-free income which should be noted in the loan file), the loan may be approved with justification, by the underwriter's supervisor, as set out in paragraph (c)(4) of this section.
(3) If the ratio is greater than 41 percent and the residual income exceeds the guidelines by at least 20 percent, the second level review and statement of justification are not required.
(4) In any case described by paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section, the lender must fully justify the decision to approve the loan or submit the loan to the Secretary for prior approval in writing. The lender's statement must not be perfunctory, but should address the specific compensating factors, as set forth in paragraph (c)(5) of this section, justifying the approval of the loan. The statement must be signed by the underwriter's supervisor. It must be stressed that the statute requires not only consideration of a veteran's present and anticipated income and expenses, but also that the veteran be a satisfactory credit risk. Therefore, meeting both the debt-to-income ratio and residual income standards does not mean that the loan is automatically approved. It is the lender's responsibility to base the loan approval or disapproval on all the factors present for any individual veteran. The veteran's credit must be evaluated based on the criteria set forth in paragraph (g) of this section as well as a variety of compensating factors that should be evaluated.
(5) The following are examples of acceptable compensating factors to be considered in the course of underwriting a loan:
(i) Excellent long-term credit;
(ii) Conservative use of consumer credit;
(iii) Minimal consumer debt;
(iv) Long-term employment;
(v) Significant liquid assets;
(vi) Down payment or the existence of equity in refinancing loans;
(vii) Little or no increase in shelter expense;
(viii) Military benefits;
(ix) Satisfactory homeownership experience;
(x) High residual income;
(xi) Low debt-to-income ratio;
(xii) Tax credits of a continuing nature, such as tax credits for child care; and
(xiii) Tax benefits of home ownership.
(6) The list in paragraph (c)(5) of this section is not exhaustive and the items are not in any priority order. Valid compensating factors should represent unusual strengths rather than mere satisfaction of basic program requirements. Compensating factors must be relevant to the marginality or weakness.
(d)
Debt-to-income ratio.
A debt-to-income ratio that compares the veteran's anticipated monthly housing expense and total monthly obligations to his or her stable monthly income will be computed to assist in the assessment of the potential risk of the loan. The ratio will be determined by taking the sum of the monthly Principal, Interest, Taxes and Insurance (PITI) of the loan being applied for, homeowners and other assessments such as special assessments, condominium fees, homeowners association fees, etc., and any long-term obligations divided by the total of gross salary or earnings and other compensation or income. The ratio should be rounded to the nearest two digits; e.g., 35.6 percent would be rounded to 36 percent. The standard is 41 percent or less. If the ratio is greater than 41 percent, the steps cited in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(6) of this section apply.
(e)
Residual income guidelines.
The guidelines provided in this paragraph for residual income will be used to determine whether the veteran's monthly residual income will be adequate to meet living expenses after estimated monthly shelter expenses have been paid and other monthly obligations have been met. All members of the household must be included in determining if the residual income is sufficient. They must be counted even if the veteran's spouse is not joining in title or on the note, or if there are any other individuals depending on the veteran for support, such as children from a spouse's prior marriage who are not the veteran's legal dependents. It is appropriate, however, to reduce the number of members of a household to be counted for residual income purposes if there is sufficient verified income not otherwise included in the loan analysis, such as child support being regularly received as discussed in paragraph (e)(4) of this section. In the case of a spouse not to be obligated on the note, verification that he/she has stable and reliable employment as discussed in paragraph (f)(3) of this section would allow not counting the spouse in determining the sufficiency of the residual income. The guidelines for residual income are based on data supplied in the Consumer Expenditure Survey (CES) published by the Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics. Regional minimum incomes have been developed for loan amounts up to $79,999 and for loan amounts of $80,000 and above. It is recognized that the purchase price of the property may affect family expenditure levels in individual cases. This factor may be given consideration in the final determination in individual loan analyses. For example, a family purchasing in a higher-priced neighborhood may feel a need to incur higher-than-average expenses to support a lifestyle comparable to that in their environment, whereas a substantially lower-priced home purchase may not compel such expenditures. It should also be clearly understood from this information that no single factor is a final determinant in any applicant's qualification for a VA-guaranteed loan. Once the residual income has been established, other important factors must be examined. One such consideration is the amount being paid currently for rental or housing expenses. If the proposed shelter expense is materially in excess of what is currently being paid, the case may require closer scrutiny. In such cases, consideration should be given to the ability of the borrower and spouse to accumulate liquid assets, such as cash and bonds,
and to the amount of debts incurred while paying a lesser amount for shelter. For example, if an application indicates little or no capital reserves and excessive obligations, it may not be reasonable to conclude that a substantial increase in shelter expenses can be absorbed. Another factor of prime importance is the applicant's manner of meeting obligations. A poor credit history alone is a basis for disapproving a loan, as is an obviously inadequate income. When one or the other is marginal, however, the remaining aspect must be closely examined to assure that the loan applied for will not exceed the applicant's ability or capacity to repay. Therefore, it is important to remember that the figures provided below for residual income are to be used as a guide and should be used in conjunction with the steps outlined in paragraphs (c) through (j) of this section. The residual income guidelines are as follows:

(4)
Military adjustments.
For loan applications involving an active-duty servicemember or military retiree, the residual income figures will be reduced by a minimum of 5 percent if there is a clear indication that the borrower or spouse will continue to receive the benefits resulting from the use of facilities on a nearby military base. (This reduction applies to tables in paragraph (e) of this section.)
(f)
Stability and reliability of income.
Only stable and reliable income of the veteran and spouse can be considered in determining ability to meet mortgage payments. Income can be considered stable and reliable if it can be concluded that it will continue during the foreseeable future.
(1)
Verification.
Income of the borrower and spouse which is derived from employment and which is considered in determining the family's ability to meet the mortgage payments, payments on debts and other obligations, and other expenses must be verified. If the spouse is employed and will be contractually obligated on the loan, the combined income of both the veteran and spouse is considered when the income of the veteran alone is not sufficient to qualify for the amount of the loan sought. In other than community property states, if the spouse will not be contractually obligated on the loan, Regulation B (12 CFR part 202), promulgated by the Federal Reserve Board pursuant to the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, prohibits any request for, or consideration of, information concerning the spouse (including income, employment, assets, or liabilities), except that if the applicant is relying on alimony, child support, or maintenance payments from a spouse or former spouse as a basis for repayment of the loan, information concerning such spouse or former spouse may be requested and considered (see paragraph (f)(4) of this section). In community property states, information concerning a spouse may be requested and considered in the same manner as that for the applicant. The standards applied to income of the veteran are also applicable to that of the spouse. There can be no discounting of income on account of sex, marital status, or any other basis prohibited by the Equal Credit Opportunity Act. Income claimed by an applicant that is not or cannot be verified cannot be considered when analyzing the loan. If the veteran or spouse has been employed by a present employer for less than 2 years, a 2-year history covering prior employment, schooling, or other training must be secured. Any periods of unemployment must be explained. Employment verifications and pay stubs must be no more than 120 days (180 days for new construction) old to be considered valid. For loans closed automatically, this requirement will be considered satisfied if the date of the employment verification is within 120 days (180 days for new construction) of the date the note is signed. For prior approval loans, this requirement will be considered satisfied if the verification of employment is dated within 120 days of the date the application is received by VA.
(2)
Active-duty, Reserve, or National Guard applicants.
(i) In the case of an active-duty applicant, a military Leave
Earnings Statement is required and will be used instead of an employment verification. The statement must be no more than 120 days old (180 days for new construction) and must be the original or a lender-certified copy of the original. For loans closed automatically, this requirement is satisfied if the date of the Leave
Earnings Statement is within 120 days (180 days for new construction) of the date the note is signed. For prior approval loans, this requirement will be considered satisfied if the verification of employment is dated within 120 days of the date the application is received by VA.
(ii) For servicemembers within 12 months of release from active duty, or members of the Reserves or National Guard within 12 months of release, one of the following is also required:
(A) Documentation that the servicemember has in fact already reenlisted or extended his/her period of active duty or Reserve or National Guard service to a date beyond the 12-month period following the projected closing of the loan.
(B) Verification of a valid offer of local civilian employment following release from active duty. All data pertinent to sound underwriting procedures (date employment will begin, earnings, etc.) must be included.
(C) A statement from the servicemember that he/she intends to reenlist or extend his/her period of active duty or Reserve or National Guard service to a date beyond the 12 month period following the projected loan closing date, and a statement from the servicemember's commanding officer confirming that the servicemember is eligible to reenlist or extend his/her active duty or Reserve or National Guard service as indicated and that the commanding officer has no reason to believe that such reenlistment or extension will not be granted.
(D) Other unusually strong positive underwriting factors, such as a down payment of at least 10 percent, significant cash reserves, or clear evidence of strong ties to the community coupled with a nonmilitary spouse's income so high that only minimal income from the active duty servicemember or member of the Reserves or National Guard is needed to qualify.
(iii) Each active-duty member who applies for a loan must be counseled through the use of VA Form 26-0592, Counseling Checklist for Military Homebuyers. Lenders must submit a signed and dated VA Form 26-0592 with each prior approval loan application or automatic loan report involving a borrower on active duty.
(3)
Income reliability.
Income received by the borrower and spouse is to be used only if it can be concluded that the income will continue during the foreseeable future and, thus, should be properly considered in determining ability to meet the mortgage payments. If an employer puts N/A or otherwise declines to complete a verification of employment statement regarding the probability of continued employment, no further action is required of the lender. Reliability will be determined based on the duration of the borrower's current employment together with his or her overall documented employment history. There can be no discounting of income solely because it is derived from an annuity, pension or other retirement benefit, or from part-time employment. However, unless income from overtime work and part-time or second jobs can be accorded a reasonable likelihood that it is continuous and will continue in the foreseeable future, such income should not be used. Generally, the reliability of such income cannot be demonstrated unless the income has continued for 2 years. The hours of duty and other work conditions of the applicant's primary job, and the period of time in which the applicant was employed under such arrangement, must be such as to permit a clear conclusion as to a good probability that overtime or part-time or secondary employment can and will continue. Income from overtime work and part-time jobs not eligible for inclusion as primary income may, if properly verified for at least 12 months, be used to offset the payments due on debts and obligations of an intermediate term,
i.e.
, 6 to 24 months. Such income must be described in the loan file. The amount of any pension or compensation and other income, such as dividends from stocks, interest from bonds, savings accounts, or other deposits, rents, royalties, etc., will be used as primary income if it is reasonable to conclude that such income will continue in the foreseeable future. Otherwise, it may be used only to offset intermediate-term debts, as described in this paragraph. Also, the likely duration of certain military allowances cannot be determined and, therefore, will be used only to offset intermediate-term debts, as described in this paragraph. Such allowances are: Pro-pay, flight or hazard pay, and overseas or combat pay, all of which are subject to periodic review and/or testing of the recipient to ascertain whether eligibility for such pay will continue. Only if it can be shown that such pay has continued for a prolonged period and can be expected to continue because of the nature of the recipient's assigned duties, will such income be considered as primary income. For instance, flight pay verified for a pilot can be regarded as probably continuous and, thus, should be added to the base pay. Income derived from service in the Reserves or National Guard may be used if the applicant has served in such capacity for a period of time sufficient to evidence good probability that such income will continue beyond 12 months. The total period of active and reserve service may be helpful in this regard. Otherwise, such income may be used to offset intermediate-term debts. There are a number of additional income sources whose contingent nature precludes their being considered as available for repayment of a long-term mortgage obligation. Temporary income items such as VA educational allowances and unemployment compensation do not represent stable and reliable income and will not be taken into consideration in determining the ability of the veteran to meet the income requirement of the governing law. As required by the Equal Opportunity Act Amendments of 1976, Public
Law 94-239, income from public assistance programs is used to qualify for a loan if it can be determined that the income will probably continue for 3 years or more.
(4)
Tax-exempt income.
Special consideration can be given to verified nontaxable income once it has been established that such income is likely to continue (and remain untaxed) into the foreseeable future. Such income includes certain military allowances, child support payments, workers' compensation benefits, disability retirement payments and certain types of public assistance payments. In such cases, current income tax tables may be used to determine an amount which can be prudently employed to adjust the borrower's actual income. This adjusted or “grossed up” income may be used to calculate the monthly debt-to-income ratio, provided the analysis is documented. Only the borrower's actual income may be used to calculate the residual income. Care should be exercised to ensure that the income is in fact tax-exempt.
(5)
Alimony, child support, maintenance, workers' compensation, foster care payments.
(i) If an applicant chooses to reveal income from alimony, child support or maintenance payments (after first having been informed that any such disclosure is voluntary pursuant to the Federal Reserve Board's Regulation B (12 CFR part 202)), such payments are considered as income to the extent that the payments are likely to be consistently made. Factors to be considered in determining the likelihood of consistent payments include, but are not limited to: Whether the payments are received pursuant to a written agreement or court decree; the length of time the payments have been received; the regularity of receipt; the availability of procedures to compel payment; and the creditworthiness of the payor, including the credit history of the payor when available under the Fair Credit Reporting Act or other applicable laws. However, the Fair Credit Reporting Act (15 U.S.C. 1681(b)) limits the permissible purposes for which credit reports may be ordered, in the absence of written instructions of the consumer to whom the report relates, to business transactions involving the subject of the credit report or extensions of credit to the subject of the credit report.
(ii) If the applicant chooses to reveal income related to workers' compensation, it will be considered as income to the extent it can be determined such income will continue.
(iii) Income received specifically for the care of any foster child(ren) may be counted as income if documented. Generally, however, such foster care income is to be used only to balance the expenses of caring for the foster child(ren) against any increased residual income requirements.
(6)
Military quarters allowance.
With respect to off-base housing (quarters) allowances for service personnel on active duty, it is the policy of the Department of Defense to utilize available on-base housing when possible. In order for a quarters allowance to be considered as continuing income, it is necessary that the applicant furnish written authorization from his or her commanding officer for off-base housing. This authorization should verify that quarters will not be made available and that the individual should make permanent arrangements for nonmilitary housing. A Department of Defense form, DD Form 1747, Status of Housing Availability, is used by the Family Housing Office to advise personnel regarding family housing. The applicant's quarters allowance cannot be considered unless item b (Permanent) or d is completed on DD Form 1747, dated October 1990. Of course, if the applicant's income less quarters allowance is sufficient, there is no need for assurance that the applicant has permission to occupy nonmilitary housing provided that a determination can be made that the occupancy requirements of the law will be met. Also, authorization to obtain off-base housing will not be required when certain duty assignments would clearly qualify service personnel with families for quarters allowance. For instance, off-base housing authorizations need not be obtained for service personnel stationed overseas who are not accompanied by their families, recruiters on detached duty, or military personnel stationed in areas where no on-base housing exists. In any case in which no
off-base housing authorization is obtained, an explanation of the circumstances justifying its omission must be included with the loan application except when it has been established by the VA facility of jurisdiction that the waiting lists for on-base housing are so long that it is improbable that individuals desiring to purchase off-base housing would be precluded from doing so in the foreseeable future. If stations make such a determination, a release shall be issued to inform lenders.
(7)
Automobile (or similar) allowance.
Generally, automobile allowances are paid to cover specific expenses related to an applicant's employment, and it is appropriate to use such income to offset a corresponding car payment. However, in some instances, such an allowance may exceed the car payment. With proper documentation, income from a car allowance which exceeds the car payment can be counted as effective income. Likewise, any other similar type of allowance which exceeds the specific expense involved may be added to gross income to the extent it is documented to exceed the actual expense.
(8)
Commissions.
When all or a major portion of the veteran's income is derived from commissions, it will be necessary to establish the stability of such income if it is to be considered in the loan analysis for the repayment of the mortgage debt and/or short-term obligations. In order to assess the value of such income, lenders should obtain written verification of the actual amount of commissions paid to date, the basis for the payment of such commissions and when commissions are paid;
i.e.
, monthly, quarterly, semiannually, or annually. Lenders should also obtain signed and dated individual income tax returns, plus applicable schedules, for the previous 2 years, or for whatever additional period is deemed necessary to properly demonstrate a satisfactory earnings record. The length of the veteran's employment in the type of occupation for which commissions are paid is also an important factor in the assessment of the stability of the income. If the veteran has been employed for a relatively short time, the income should not normally be considered stable unless the product or service was the same or closely related to the product or service sold in an immediate prior position. Generally, income from commissions is considered stable when the applicant has been receiving such income for at least 2 years. Less than 2 years of income from commissions cannot usually be considered stable. When an applicant has received income from commissions for less than 1 year, it will rarely be possible to demonstrate that the income is stable for qualifying purposes; such cases would require in-depth development.
(9)
Self-employment.
Generally, income from self-employment is considered stable when the applicant has been in business for at least 2 years. Less than 2 years of income from self-employment cannot usually be considered stable unless the applicant has had previous related employment and/or extensive specialized training. When an applicant has been self-employed less than 1 year, it will rarely be possible to demonstrate that the income is stable for qualifying purposes; such cases would require in-depth development. The following documentation is required for all self-employed borrowers:
(i) A profit-and-loss statement for the prior fiscal year (12-month accounting cycle), plus the period year to date since the end of the last fiscal year (or for whatever shorter period records may be available), and balance sheet based on the financial records. The financial statement must be sufficient for a loan underwriter to determine the necessary information for loan approval and an independent audit (on the veteran and/or the business) by a Certified Public Accountant will be required if necessary for such determination; and
(ii) Copies of signed individual income tax returns, plus all applicable schedules for the previous 2 years, or for whatever additional period is deemed necessary to properly demonstrate a satisfactory earnings record, must be obtained. If the business is a corporation or partnership, copies of signed Federal business income tax returns for the previous two years plus
all applicable schedules for the corporation or partnership must be obtained; and
(iii) If the business is a corporation or partnership, a list of all stockholders or partners showing the interest each holds in the business will be required. Some cases may justify a written credit report on the business as well as the applicant. When the business is of an unusual type and it is difficult to determine the probability of its continued operation, explanation as to the function and purpose of the business may be needed from the applicant and/or any other qualified party with the acknowledged expertise to express a valid opinion.
(10)
Recently discharged veterans.
Loan applications received from recently discharged veterans who have little or no employment experience other than their military occupation and from veterans seeking VA-guaranteed loans who have retired after 20 years of active military duty require special attention. The retirement income of the latter veterans in many cases may not be sufficient to meet the statutory income requirements for the loan amount sought. Many have obtained full-time employment and have been employed in their new jobs for a very short time.
(i) It is essential in determining whether veterans in these categories qualify from the income standpoint for the amount of the loan sought, that the facts in respect to their present employment and retirement income be fully developed, and that each case be considered on its individual merits.
(ii) In most cases the veteran's current income or current income plus his or her retirement income is sufficient. The problem lies in determining whether it can be properly concluded that such income level will continue for the foreseeable future. If the veteran's employment status is that of a trainee or an apprentice, this will, of course, be a factor. In cases of the self-employed, the question to be resolved is whether there are reasonable prospects that the business enterprise will be successful and produce the required income. Unless a favorable conclusion can be made, the income from such source should not be considered in the loan analysis.
(iii) If a recently discharged veteran has no prior employment history and the veteran's verification of employment shows he or she has not been on the job a sufficient time in which to become established, consideration should be given to the duties the veteran performed in the military service. When it can be determined that the duties a veteran performed in the service are similar or are in direct relation to the duties of the applicant's present position, such duties may be construed as adding weight to his or her present employment experience and the income from the veteran's present employment thus may be considered available for qualifying the loan, notwithstanding the fact that the applicant has been on the present job only a short time. This same principle may be applied to veterans recently retired from the service. In addition, when the veteran's income from retirement, in relation to the total of the estimated shelter expense, long-term debts and amount available for family support, is such that only minimal income from employment is necessary to qualify from the income standpoint, it would be proper to resolve the doubt in favor of the veteran. It would be erroneous, however, to give consideration to a veteran's income from employment for a short duration in a job requiring skills for which the applicant has had no training or experience.
(iv) To illustrate the provisions of paragraph (f)(10), it would be proper to use short-term employment income in qualifying a veteran who had experience as an airplane mechanic in the military service and the individual's employment after discharge or retirement from the service is in the same or allied fields; e.g., auto mechanic or machinist. This presumes, however, that the verification of employment included a statement that the veteran was performing the duties of the job satisfactorily, the possibility of continued employment was favorable and that the loan application is eligible in all other respects. An example of nonqualifying experience is that of a veteran who was an Air Force pilot and has been employed in insurance sales
on commission for a short time. Most cases, of course, fall somewhere between those extremes. It is for this reason that the facts of each case must be fully developed prior to closing the loan automatically or submitting the case to VA for prior approval.
(11)
Employment of short duration.
The provisions of paragraph (f)(7) of this section are similarly applicable to applicants whose employment is of short duration. Such cases will entail careful consideration of the employer's confirmation of employment, probability of permanency, past employment record, the applicant's qualifications for the position, and previous training, including that received in the military service. In the event that such considerations do not enable a determination that the income from the veteran's current position has a reasonable likelihood of continuance, such income should not be considered in the analysis. Applications received from persons employed in the building trades, or in other occupations affected by climatic conditions, should be supported by documentation evidencing the applicant's total earnings to date and covering a period of not less than 1 year as well as signed and dated copies of complete income tax returns, including all schedules for the past 2 years or for whatever additional period is deemed necessary to properly demonstrate a satisfactory earnings record. If the applicant works out of a union, evidence of the previous year's earnings should be obtained together with a verification of employment from the current employer.
(12)
Rental income
—(i)
Multi-unit subject property.
When the loan pertains to a structure with more than a one-family dwelling unit, the prospective rental income will not be considered unless the veteran can demonstrate a reasonable likelihood of success as a landlord, and sufficient cash reserves are verified to enable the veteran to carry the mortgage loan payments (principal, interest, taxes, and insurance) without assistance from the rental income for a period of at least 6 months. The determination of the veteran's likelihood of success as a landlord will be based on documentation of any prior experience in managing rental units or other collection activities. The amount of rental income to be used in the loan analysis will be based on 75 percent of the amount indicated on the lease or rental agreement, unless a greater percentage can be documented.
(ii)
Rental of existing home.
Proposed rental of a veteran's existing property may be used to offset the mortgage payment on that property, provided there is no indication that the property will be difficult to rent. If available, a copy of the rental agreement should be obtained. It is the responsibility of the loan underwriter to be aware of the condition of the local rental market. For instance, in areas where the rental market is very strong the absence of a lease should not automatically prohibit the offset of the mortgage by the proposed rental income.
(iii)
Other rental property.
If income from rental property will be used to qualify for the new loan, the documentation required of a self-employed applicant should be obtained together with evidence of cash reserves equaling 3 months PITI on the rental property. As for any self-employed earnings (see paragraph (f)(7) of this section), depreciation claimed may be added back in as income. In the case of a veteran who has no experience as a landlord, it is unlikely that the income from a rental property may be used to qualify for the new loan.
(13)
Taxes and other deductions.
Deductions to be applied for Federal income taxes and Social Security may be obtained from the Employer's Tax Guide (Circular E) issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). (For veterans receiving a mortgage credit certificate (MCC), see paragraph (f)(14) of this section.) Any State or local taxes should be estimated or obtained from charts similar to those provided by IRS which may be available in those states with withholding taxes. A determination of the amount paid or withheld for retirement purposes should be made and used when calculating deductions from gross income. In determining whether a veteran-applicant meets the income criteria for a loan, some consideration may be given to the potential tax benefits the veteran will realize if the loan is approved. This can be done by using the instructions and
worksheet portion of IRS Form W-4, Employee's Withholding Allowance Certificate, to compute the total number of permissible withholding allowances. That number can then be used when referring to IRS Circular E and any appropriate similar State withholding charts to arrive at the amount of Federal and State income tax to be deducted from gross income.
(14)
Mortgage credit certificates.
(i) The Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C.) as amended by the Tax Reform Act of 1984, allows states and other political subdivisions to trade in all or part of their authority to issue mortgage revenue bonds for authority to issue MCCs. Veterans who are recipients of MCCs may realize a significant reduction in their income tax liability by receiving a Federal tax credit for a percentage of their mortgage interest payment on debt incurred on or after January 1, 1985.
(ii) Lenders must provide a copy of the MCC to VA with the home loan application. The MCC will specify the rate of credit allowed and the amount of certified indebtedness;
i.e.
, the indebtedness incurred by the veteran to acquire a principal residence or as a qualified home improvement or rehabilitation loan.
(iii) For credit underwriting purposes, the amount of tax credit allowed to a veteran under an MCC will be treated as a reduction in the monthly Federal income tax. For example, a veteran having a $600 monthly interest payment and an MCC providing a 30-percent tax credit would receive a $180 (30 percent × $600) tax credit each month. However, because the annual tax credit, which amounts to $2,160 (12 × $180), exceeds $2,000 and is based on a 30-percent credit rate, the maximum tax credit the veteran can receive is limited to $2,000 per year (Pub. L. 98-369) or $167 per month ($2,000/12). As a consequence of the tax credit, the interest on which a deduction can be taken will be reduced by the amount of the tax credit to $433 ($600−$167). This reduction should also be reflected when calculating Federal income tax.
(iv) For underwriting purposes, the amount of the tax credit is limited to the amount of the veteran's maximum tax liability. If, in the example in paragraph (f)(14)(iii) of this section, the veteran's tax liability for the year were only $1,500, the monthly tax credit would be limited to $125 ($1,500/12).
(g)
Credit.
The conclusion reached as to whether or not the veteran and spouse are satisfactory credit risks must also be based on a careful analysis of the available credit data. Regulation B (12 CFR part 202), promulgated by the Federal Reserve Board pursuant to the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, requires that lenders, in evaluating creditworthiness, shall consider, on the applicant's request, the credit history, when available, of any account reported in the name of the applicant's spouse or former spouse which the applicant can demonstrate accurately reflects the applicant's creditworthiness. In other than community property states, if the spouse will not be contractually obligated on the loan, Regulation B prohibits any request for or consideration of information about the spouse concerning income, employment, assets or liabilities. In community property states, information concerning a spouse may be requested and considered in the same manner as that for the applicant.
(1)
Adverse data.
If the analysis develops any derogatory credit information and, despite such facts, it is determined that the veteran and spouse are satisfactory credit risks, the basis for the decision must be explained. If a veteran and spouse have debts outstanding which have not been paid timely, or which they have refused to pay, the fact that the outstanding debts are paid after the acceptability of the credit is questioned or in anticipation of applying for new credit does not, of course, alter the fact that the record for paying debts has been unsatisfactory. With respect to unpaid debts, lenders may take into consideration a veteran's claim of bona fide or legal defenses. Such defenses are not applicable when the debt has been reduced to judgment. Where a collection account has been established, if it is determined that the borrower is a satisfactory credit risk, it is not mandatory that such an account be paid off in order for a loan to be approved. Court-ordered judgments, however, must be paid off before a new loan is approved.
(2)
Bankruptcy.
When the credit information shows that the borrower or spouse has been discharged in bankruptcy under the “straight” liquidation and discharge provisions of the bankruptcy law, this would not in itself disqualify the loan. However, in such cases it is necessary to develop complete information as to the facts and circumstances concerning the bankruptcy. Generally speaking, when the borrower or spouse, as the case may be, has been regularly employed (not self-employed) and has been discharged in bankruptcy within the last one to two years, it probably would not be possible to determine that the borrower or spouse is a satisfactory credit risk unless both of the following requirements are satisfied:
(i) The borrower or spouse has obtained credit subsequent to the bankruptcy and has met the credit payments in a satisfactory manner over a continued period; and
(ii) The bankruptcy was caused by circumstances beyond the control of the borrower or spouse, e.g., unemployment, prolonged strikes, medical bills not covered by insurance. Divorce is not generally viewed as beyond the control of the borrower and/or spouse. The circumstances alleged must be verified. If a borrower or spouse is self-employed, has been adjudicated bankrupt, and subsequently obtains a permanent position, a finding as to satisfactory credit risk may be made provided there is no derogatory credit information prior to self-employment, there is no derogatory credit information subsequent to the bankruptcy, and the failure of the business was not due to misconduct. If a borrower or spouse has been discharged in bankruptcy within the past 12 months, it will not generally be possible to determine that the borrower or spouse is a satisfactory credit risk.
(3)
Petition under Chapter 13 of Bankruptcy Code.
A petition under chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code (11 U.S.C.) filed by the borrower or spouse is indicative of an effort to pay their creditors. Some plans may provide for full payment of debts while others arrange for payment of scaled-down debts. Regular payments are made to a court-appointed trustee over a 2- to 3-year period (or up to 5 years in some cases). When the borrowers have made all payments in a satisfactory manner, they may be considered as having reestablished satisfactory credit. When they apply for a home loan before completion of the payout period, favorable consideration may nevertheless be given if at least 12 months' worth of payments have been made satisfactorily and the Trustee or Bankruptcy Judge approves of the new credit.
(4)
Foreclosures.
(i) When the credit information shows that the veteran or spouse has had a foreclosure on a prior mortgage; e.g., a VA-guaranteed or HUD-insured mortgage, this will not in itself disqualify the borrower from obtaining the loan. Lenders and field station personnel should refer to the preceding guidelines on bankruptcies for cases involving foreclosures. As with a borrower who has been adjudicated bankrupt, it is necessary to develop complete information as to the facts and circumstances of the foreclosure.
(ii) When VA pays a claim on a VA-guaranteed loan as a result of a foreclosure, the original veteran may be required to repay any loss to the Government. In some instances VA may waive the veteran's debt, in part or totally, based on the facts and circumstances of the case. However, guaranty entitlement cannot be restored unless the Government's loss has been repaid in full, regardless of whether or not the debt has been waived, compromised, or discharged in bankruptcy. Therefore, a veteran who is seeking a new VA loan after having experienced a foreclosure on a prior VA loan will in most cases have only remaining entitlement to apply to the new loan. The lender should assure that the veteran has sufficient entitlement for its secondary marketing purposes.
(5)
Federal debts.
An applicant for a Federally-assisted loan will not be considered a satisfactory credit risk for such loan if the applicant is presently delinquent or in default on any debt to the Federal Government, e.g., a Small Business Administration loan, a U.S. Guaranteed Student loan, a debt to the Public Health Service, or where there is a judgment lien against the applicant's property for a debt owed to the Government. The applicant may not be
approved for the loan until the delinquent account has been brought current or satisfactory arrangements have been made between the borrower and the Federal agency owed, or the judgment is paid or otherwise satisfied. Of course, the applicant must also be able to otherwise qualify for the loan from an income and remaining credit standpoint. Refinancing under VA's interest rate reduction refinancing provisions, however, is allowed even if the borrower is delinquent on the VA guaranteed mortgage being refinanced. Prior approval processing is required in such cases.
(6)
Absence of credit history.
The fact that recently discharged veterans may have had no opportunity to develop a credit history will not preclude a determination of satisfactory credit. Similarly, other loan applicants may not have established credit histories as a result of a preference for purchasing consumer items with cash rather than credit. There are also cases in which individuals may be genuinely wary of acquiring new obligations following bankruptcy, consumer credit counseling (debt proration), or other disruptive credit occurrence. The absence of the credit history in these cases will not generally be viewed as an adverse factor in credit underwriting. However, before a favorable decision is made for cases involving bankruptcies or other derogatory credit factors, efforts should be made to develop evidence of timely payment of non-installment debts such as rent and utilities. It is anticipated that this special consideration in the absence of a credit history following bankruptcy would be the rare case and generally confined to bankruptcies that occurred over 3 years ago.
(7)
Consumer credit counseling plan.
If a veteran, or veteran and spouse, have prior adverse credit and are participating in a Consumer Credit Counseling plan, they may be determined to be a satisfactory credit risk if they demonstrate 12 months' satisfactory payments and the counseling agency approves the new credit. If a veteran, or veteran and spouse, have good prior credit and are participating in a Consumer Credit Counseling plan, such participation is to be considered a neutral factor, or even a positive factor, in determining creditworthiness.
(8)
Re-establishment of satisfactory credit.
In circumstances not involving bankruptcy, satisfactory credit is generally considered to be reestablished after the veteran, or veteran and spouse, have made satisfactory payments for 12 months after the date of the last derogatory credit item.
(9)
Long-term
v.
short-term debts.
All known debts and obligations including any alimony and/or child support payments of the borrower and spouse must be documented. Significant liabilities, to be deducted from the total income in determining ability to meet the mortgage payments are accounts that, generally, are of a relatively long term,
i.e.
, 10 months or over. Other accounts for terms of less than 10 months must, of course, be considered in determining ability to meet family expenses. Certainly, any severe impact on the family's resources for any period of time must be considered in the loan analysis. For example, monthly payments of $300 on an auto loan with a remaining balance of $1,500 would be included in those obligations to be deducted from the total income regardless of the fact that the account can be expected to pay out in 5 months. It is clear that the applicant will, in this case, continue to carry the burden of those $300 payments for the first, most critical months of the home loan.
(10)
Requirements for verification.
If the credit investigation reveals debts or obligations of a material nature which were not divulged by the applicant, lenders must be certain to obtain clarification as to the status of such debts from the borrower. A proper analysis is obviously not possible unless there is total correlation between the obligations claimed by the borrower and those revealed by a credit report or deposit verification. Conversely, significant debts and obligations reported by the borrower must be dated. If the credit report fails to provide necessary information on such accounts, lenders will be expected to obtain their own verifications of those debts directly from the creditors. Credit reports and verifications must be no more than 120 days old (180 days for new construction) to be considered
valid. For loans closed automatically, this requirement will be considered satisfied if the date of the credit report or verification is within 120 days (180 days for new construction) of the date the note is signed. For prior approval loans, this requirement will be considered satisfied if the date of the credit report or verification is within 120 days of the date the application is received by VA. Of major significance are the applicant's rental history and outstanding or recently retired mortgages, if any, particularly prior VA loans. Lenders should be sure ratings on such accounts are obtained; a written explanation is required when ratings are not available. A determination is necessary as to whether alimony and/or child support payments are required. Verification of the amount of such obligations should be obtained, although documentation concerning an applicant's divorce should not be obtained automatically unless it is necessary to verify the amount of any alimony or child support liability indicated by the applicant. If in the routine course of processing the loan application, however, direct evidence is received (e.g., from the credit report) that an obligation to pay alimony or child support exists (as opposed to mere evidence that the veteran was previously divorced), the discrepancy between the loan application and credit report can and should be fully resolved in the same manner as any other such discrepancy would be handled. When a pay stub or leave-and-earnings statement indicates an allotment, the lender must investigate the nature of the allotment(s) to determine whether the allotment is related to a debt. Debts assigned to an ex-spouse by a divorce decree will not generally be charged against a veteran-borrower.
(11)
Job-related expenses.
Known job-related expenses should be documented. This will include costs for any dependent care, significant commuting costs, etc. When a family's circumstances are such that dependent care arrangements would probably be necessary, it is important to determine the cost of such services in order to arrive at an accurate total of deductions.
(12)
Credit reports.
Credit reports obtained by lenders on VA-guaranteed loan applications must be either a three-file Merged Credit Report (MCR) or a Residential Mortgage Credit Report (RMCR). If used, the RMCR must meet the standards formulated jointly by the Department of Veterans Affairs, Federal National Mortgage Association, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, Federal Housing Administration, Farmers Home Administration, credit repositories, repository affiliated consumer reporting agencies and independent consumer reporting agencies. All credit reports obtained by the lender must be submitted to VA.
(h)
Borrower's personal and financial status.
The number and ages of dependents have an important bearing on whether income after deduction of fixed charges is sufficient to support the family. Type and duration of employment of both the borrower and spouse are important as an indication of stability of their employment. The amount of liquid assets owned by the borrower or spouse, or both, is an important factor in determining that they have sufficient funds to close the loan, as well as being significant in analyzing the overall qualifications for the loan. (It is imperative that adequate cash assets from the veteran's own resources are verified to allow the payment (see § 36.4339(a)(3)) of any difference between the sales price of the property and the loan amount, in addition to that necessary to cover closing costs, if the sales price exceeds the reasonable value established by VA.) Verifications must be no more than 120 days old (180 days for new construction) to be considered valid. For loans closed on the automatic basis, this requirement will be considered satisfied if the date of the deposit verification is within 120 days (180 days for new construction) of the date of the veteran's application to the lender. For prior approval loans, this requirement will be considered satisfied if the verification of employment is dated within 120 days of the date the application is received by VA. Current monthly rental or other housing expense is an important consideration when compared to that to be undertaken in connection with the contemplated housing purchase.
(i)
Estimated monthly shelter expenses.
It is important that monthly expenses
such as taxes, insurance, assessments and maintenance and utilities be estimated accurately based on property location and type of house; e.g., old or new, large or small, rather than using or applying a “rule of thumb” to all properties alike. Maintenance and utility amounts for various types of property should be realistically estimated. Local utility companies should be consulted for current rates. The age and type of construction of a house may well affect these expenses. In the case of condominiums or houses in a planned unit development (PUD), the monthly amount of the maintenance assessment payable to a homeowners association should be added. If the amount currently assessed is less than the maximum provided in the covenants or master deed, and it appears likely that the amount will be insufficient for operation of the condominium or PUD, the amount used will be the maximum the veteran could be charged. If it is expected that real estate taxes will be raised, or if any special assessments are expected, the increased or additional amounts should be used. In special flood hazard areas, include the premium for any required flood insurance.
(j)
Lender responsibility.
(1) Lenders are fully responsible for developing all credit information;
i.e.
, for obtaining verifications of employment and deposit, credit reports, and for the accuracy of the information contained in the loan application.
(2) Verifications of employment and deposits, and requests for credit reports and/or credit information must be initiated and received by the lender.
(3) In cases where the real estate broker/agent or any other party requests any of this information, the report(s) must be returned directly to the lender. This fact must be disclosed by appropriately completing the required certification on the loan application or report and the parties must be identified as agents of the lender.
(4) Where the lender relies on other parties to secure any of the credit or employment information or otherwise accepts such information obtained by any other party, such parties shall be construed for purposes of the submission of the loan documents to VA to be authorized agents of the lender, regardless of the actual relationship between such parties and the lender, even if disclosure is not provided to VA under paragraph (j)(3) of this section. Any negligent or willful misrepresentation by such parties shall be imputed to the lender as if the lender had processed those documents and the lender shall remain responsible for the quality and accuracy of the information provided to VA.
(5) All credit reports secured by the lender or other parties as identified in paragraphs (j)(3) and (4) of this section shall be provided to VA. If updated credit reports reflect materially different information than that in other reports, such discrepancies must be explained by the lender and the ultimate decision as to the effects of the discrepancy upon the loan application fully addressed by the underwriter.
(k)
Lender certification.
Lenders originating loans are responsible for determining and certifying to VA on the appropriate application or closing form that the loan meets all statutory and regulatory requirements.

§ 36.4346
Cooperative loans.
(a) To be eligible for guaranty or insurance, any loan of the following types shall require prior approval of the Under Secretary for Benefits, or
the Executive Director, Loan Guaranty Service, who may issue such approval upon such conditions and limitations deemed appropriate, not inconsistent with the provisions of 38 U.S.C. chapter 37 and this subpart:
(1) Any loan which is related to an enterprise in which more than 10 individuals will participate; or
(2) Any loan to be made for the purchase or construction of residential units in any housing development, cooperative or otherwise, the title to which development or to the individual units therein is not to be held directly by the veteran-participants, or which contemplates the ownership or maintenance of more than three units or of their major appurtenances in common.
(b) The issuance of such approval with respect to a residential development under paragraph (a)(2) of this section also shall be subject to such conditions and stipulation as in the judgment of the approving officer are possible and proper to:
(1) Afford reasonable and feasible protection to the rights of the Government as guarantor or insurer, and as subrogee, and to each veteran-participant against loss of his or her respective equity consequent upon the failure of other participants to discharge their obligations;
(2) Provide for a reasonable and workable plan for the operation and management of the project;
(3) Limit the personal liability of each veteran-participant to those sums allocable on a proper ratable basis to the purchase, cost, and maintenance of his or her individual unit or participating interest; and
(4) Limit commercial features to those reasonably calculated to promote the economic soundness of the project and the living convenience of the participants, retaining the essential character of a residential project.
(c) No such project, development, or enterprise may be approved which involves an initial grouping of more than 500 veterans, or a cost of more than five million dollars, unless it is conclusively shown to the satisfaction of the approving officer that a greater number of veterans or dollar amount will assure substantial advantages to the veteran-participants which could not be achieved in a smaller project.
(d) When approved as in this section provided, and upon performance of the conditions indicated in the prior approval, proper guaranty certificate or certificates may be issued in connection with the loan or loans to be guaranteed on behalf of eligible veterans participating in the project, development or enterprise not to exceed in total amount the sum of the guaranties applied for by the individual participants and for which guaranty each participant is then eligible.
(e) In lieu of guaranty as authorized in paragraph (d) of this section, insurance shall be available on application by the lender and all veterans concerned. In such case the insurance credit shall be limited to 15 percent of the obligation of the veteran applicant (subject to available eligibility) and the total insurance credit in respect to the veterans' loans involved in the project shall not exceed 15 percent of the aggregate of the principal sums of the individual indebtedness incurred by the veterans participating in the project for the purpose of acquiring their respective interests therein.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3703(c)(1))
§ 36.4347
Lender Appraisal Processing Program.
(a)
Delegation of authority to lenders to review appraisals and determine reasonable value.
(1) To be eligible for delegation of authority to review VA appraisals and determine the reasonable value of properties to be purchased with VA guaranteed loans, a lender must—
(i) Have automatic processing authority under 38 U.S.C. 3702(d), and
(ii) Employ one or more staff appraisal reviewers acceptable to the Secretary.
(2) To qualify as a lender's staff appraisal reviewer an applicant must be a full-time member of the lender's permanent staff and may not be employed by, or perform services for, any other mortgagee. The individual must not engage in any private pursuits in which there will be, or appear to be, any conflict of interest between those pursuits and his/her duties, responsibilities, and performance as a Lender Appraisal
Processing Program (LAPP) staff appraisal reviewer. Three years of experience is necessary to qualify as a lender's staff appraisal reviewer. That experience must demonstrate a knowledge of, and the ability to apply industry-accepted principles, methods, practices and techniques of appraising, and the ability to competently determine the value of property within a prescribed geographical area. The individual must demonstrate the ability to review the work of others and to recognize deviations from accepted appraisal principles, practices, and techniques; errors in computations, and unjustifiable and unsupportable conclusions.
(3) Lenders that meet the requirements of 38 U.S.C. 3702(d), and have a staff appraisal reviewer determined acceptable by VA, will be authorized to review appraisals and make reasonable value determinations on properties that will be security for VA guaranteed loans. The lender's authorization will be subject to a one-year probationary period. Additionally, lenders must satisfy initial and subsequent VA office case review requirements prior to being allowed to determine reasonable value without VA involvement. The initial office case review requirement must be satisfied in the VA regional office in whose jurisdiction the lender's staff appraisal reviewer is located before the LAPP authority may be utilized by that lender in any other VA office's jurisdiction. To satisfy the initial office case review requirement, the first five cases of each lender staff appraisal reviewer involving properties in the regional office location where the staff appraisal reviewer is located will be processed by him or her up to the point where he or she has made a reasonable value determination and fully drafted, but not issued, the lender's notification of reasonable value letter to the veteran. At that point, and prior to loan closing, each of the five cases will be submitted to the local VA office. After a staff review of each case, VA will issue a Certificate of Reasonable Value, which the lender may use in closing the loan automatically if it meets all other requirements of the VA. If these five cases are found to be acceptable by VA, the lender's staff appraisal reviewer will be allowed to fully process subsequent appraisals for properties located in that VA office's jurisdiction without prior submission to VA and issuance by VA of a Certificate of Reasonable Value. Lenders must also satisfy a subsequent VA office case review requirement in each additional VA office location in which they desire to extend and utilize this authority. Under this requirement, the lender must have first satisfied the initial office case review requirement and then must submit to the additional VA office(s) the first case each staff appraisal reviewer processes in the jurisdiction of that office. As provided under the initial office case review requirement, VA office personnel will issue a Certificate of Reasonable Value for this case and subsequently determine the acceptability of the lender's staff appraisal reviewer's processing. If VA finds this first case to be acceptable, the lender's staff appraisal reviewer will be allowed to fully process subsequent cases in that additional VA office's jurisdiction without prior submission to VA. The initial and subsequent office case review requirements may be expanded by VA if acceptable performance has not been demonstrated. After satisfaction of the initial and subsequent office case review requirements, routine reviews of LAPP cases will be made by VA staff based upon quality control procedures established by the Under Secretary for Benefits. Such review will be made on a random sampling or performance related basis. During the probationary period a high percentage of reviews will be made by VA staff.
(4) The following certification by the lender's nominated staff appraisal reviewer must be provided with the lender's application for delegation of LAPP authority:
I hereby acknowledge and represent that by signing the Uniform Residential Appraisal Report (URAR), FHLMC (Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation) Form 70/FNMA (Federal Notice Mortgage Association) Form 1004, I am certifying, in all cases, that I have personally reviewed the appraisal report. In doing so I have considered and utilized recognized professional appraisal techniques, have found the appraisal report to have been prepared in compliance with applicable VA requirements, and concur with the recommendations of the fee appraiser, who
was assigned by VA to the case. Furthermore, in those cases where clarifications or corrections have been requested from the VA fee appraiser there has been no pressure or influence exerted on that appraiser to remove or change information that might be considered detrimental to the subject property, or VA's interests, or to reach a predetermined value for that property.
Signature of Staff Appraisal Reviewer.
(5) Other certifications required from the lender will be specified with particularity in the separate instructions issued by the Secretary, as noted in § 36.4347(b).
(b)
Instructions for LAPP Procedures.
The Secretary will publish separate instructions for processing appraisals under the Lenders Appraisal Processing Program. Compliance with these regulations and the separate instructions issued by the Secretary is deemed by VA to be the minimum exercise of due diligence in processing LAPP cases. Due diligence is considered by VA to represent that care, as is to be properly expected from, and ordinarily exercised by, reasonable and prudent lenders who would be dependent on the property as security to protect its investment.
(c)
VA minimum property requirements.
Lenders are responsible for determining that the property meets VA minimum property requirements. The separate instructions issued by the Secretary will set forth the lender's ability to adjust, remove, or alter the fee appraiser's or fee compliance inspector's recommendations concerning VA minimum property requirements. Condominiums, planned-unit developments and leasehold estates must have been determined acceptable by VA. A condominium or planned-unit development which is acceptable to the Department of Housing and Urban Development or the Department of Agriculture may also be acceptable to VA.
(d)
Adjustment of value recommendations.
The amount of authority to upwardly adjust the fee appraiser's estimated market value during the lender staff appraisal reviewer's initial review of the appraisal report or to subsequently process an appeal of the lender's established reasonable value will be specified in the separate instructions issued by VA as noted in § 36.4347(b). The amount specified must not in any way be considered an administrative adjustment figure which may be applied indiscriminately and without valid basis or justification with the sole purpose of reaching an amount necessary to complete the sale or mortgage transaction.
(1)
Adjustment during initial review.
Any adjustment during the staff appraisal reviewer's initial review of the appraisal report must be fully and clearly justified in writing on the appraisal report form or, if necessary, on an addendum. The basis for the adjustment must be adequate and reasonable by professional appraisal standards. If real estate market or other valid data was utilized in arriving at the decision to make the adjustment, such data must be attached to the appraisal report. All adjustments, comments, corrections, justifications, etc., to the appraisal report must be made in a contrasting color, be clearly legible, and signed and dated by the staff appraisal reviewer.
(2)
Processing appeals.
The authority provided under 38 U.S.C. 3731(d) which permits a lender to obtain a VA fee panel appraiser's report which VA is obligated to consider in an appeal of the established reasonable value shall not apply to cases processed under the authority provided by this section. All appeals of VA fee appraisers' estimated market values or lenders' reasonable value determinations above the amount specified in the separate instructions issued by VA must be submitted, along with the lender's recommendations, if any, to VA for processing and final determination. Unless otherwise authorized in the separate instructions lenders must also submit appeals, regardless of the amount, to VA in all cases where the staff appraisal reviewer has made an adjustment during their initial review of the appraisal report to the fee appraiser's market value estimate. The fee appraiser's estimated market value or lender's reasonable value determination may be increased only when such increase is clearly warranted and fully supported by real estate market or other valid data considered adequate and reasonable by professional appraisal standards and the lender's staff appraisal reviewer clearly and fully
justifies the reasoning and basis for the increase in writing on the appraisal report form or an addendum. The staff appraisal reviewer must date and sign the written justification and must cite within it the data used in arriving at the decision to make the increase. All such data shall be attached to the appraisal report form and any addendum.
(e)
Notification.
It will be the responsibility of the lender to notify the veteran borrower in writing of the determination of reasonable value and related conditions specific to the property and to provide the veteran with a copy of the appraisal report. Any delay in processing the notification of value must be documented. Any delay of more than five work days between the date of the lender's receipt of the fee appraiser's report and date of the notification of value to the veteran, without reasonable and documented extenuating circumstances, will not be acceptable. A copy of the lender notification letter to the veteran and the appraisal report must be forwarded to the VA office of jurisdiction at the same time the veteran is notified. In addition, the original appraisal report, related appraisal documentation, and a copy of the reasonable value determination notification to the veteran must be submitted to the VA with the request for loan guaranty.
(f)
Indemnification.
When the Secretary has incurred a loss as a result of a payment of claim under guaranty and in which the Secretary determines an increase made by the lender under § 36.4347(d) was unwarranted, or arbitrary and capricious, the lender shall indemnify the Secretary to the extent the Secretary determines such loss was caused, or increased, by the increase in value.
(g)
Affiliations.
A lender affiliated with a real estate firm builder, land developer or escrow agent as a subsidiary division, investment or any other entity in which it has a financial interest or which it owns may not use this authority for any cases involving the affiliate unless the lender demonstrates to the Secretary's satisfaction that the lender and its affiliate(s) are essentially separate entities that operate independently of each other, free of all cross-influences (e.g., a formal corporate agreement exists which specifically sets forth this fact).
(h)
Quality control plans.
The lender must have an effective self-policing or quality control system to ensure the adequacy and quality of their LAPP staff appraisal reviewer's processing and, that its activities do not deviate from high standards of integrity. The quality control system must include frequent, periodic audits that specifically address the appraisal review activity. These audits may be performed by an independent party, or by the lender's independent internal audit division which reports directly to the firm's chief executive officer. The lender must agree to furnish findings and information under this system to VA on demand. While the quality control personnel need not be appraisers, they should have basic familiarity with appraisal theory and techniques and the ability to prescribe appropriate corrective action(s) in the appraisal review process when discrepancies or problems are identified. The basic elements of the system will be described in separate instructions issued by the Secretary. Copies of the lender's quality control plan or self-policing system evidencing appraisal related matters must be provided to the VA office of jurisdiction with the lender's application for LAPP authority.
(i)
Fees.
The Secretary may require mortgagees to pay an application fee and/or annual fees, including additional fees for each branch office authorized to process cases under the authority delegated under this section, in such amounts and at such times as the Secretary may require.
(j)
Withdrawal of lender authority.
The authority for a lender to determine reasonable value may be withdrawn by the Loan Guaranty Officer when proper cause exists. A lender's authority to make reasonable value determinations shall be withdrawn when the lender no longer meets the basic requirements for delegating the authority, or when it can be shown that the lender's reasonable value determinations have not been made in accordance with VA regulations, requirements, guidelines, instructions or applicable laws, or when there is adequate evidence to support
reasonable belief by VA that a particular unacceptable act, practice, or performance by the lender or the lender's staff has occurred. Such acts, practices or performance include, but are not limited to: Demonstrated technical incompetence (
i.e.
, conduct which demonstrates an insufficient knowledge of industry accepted appraisal principles, techniques and practices; or the lack of technical competence to review appraisal reports and make value determinations in accordance with those requirements); substantive or repetitive errors (
i.e.
, any error(s) of a nature that would materially or significantly affect the determination of reasonable value or condition of the property; or a number or series of errors that, considered individually, may not significantly impact the determination of reasonable value or property condition, but which when considered in the aggregate would establish that appraisal reviews or LAPP case processing are being performed in a careless or negligent manner), or continued instances of disregard for VA requirements after they have been called to the lender's attention.
(1) Withdrawal of authority by the Loan Guaranty Officer may be either for an indefinite or a specified period of time. For any withdrawal longer than 90 days, a reapplication for lender authority to process appraisals under these regulations will be required. Written notice will be provided at least 30 days in advance of withdrawal unless the Government's interests are exposed to immediate risk from the lender's activities in which case the withdrawal will be effected immediately. The notice will clearly and specifically set forth the basis and grounds for the action. There is no right to a formal hearing to contest the withdrawal of LAPP processing privileges. However, if within 15 days after receiving notice the lender requests an opportunity to contest the withdrawal, the lender may submit, in person, in writing, or through a representative, information and argument to the Loan Guaranty Officer in opposition to the withdrawal. The Loan Guaranty Officer will make a recommendation to the Regional Office Director who shall make the determination as to whether the action should be sustained, modified or rescinded. The lender will be informed in writing of the decision.
(2) The lender has the right to appeal the Regional Office Director's decision to the Under Secretary for Benefits. In the event of such an appeal, the Under Secretary for Benefits will review all relevant material concerning the matter and make a determination that shall constitute final agency action. If the lender's submission of opposition raises a genuine dispute over facts material to the withdrawal of LAPP authority, the lender will be afforded an opportunity to appear with a representative, submit documentary evidence, present witnesses and confront any witness the Veterans Benefits Administration presents. The Under Secretary for Benefits will appoint a hearing officer or panel to conduct the hearing. When such additional proceedings are necessary, the Under Secretary for Benefits shall base the determination on the facts as found, together with any information and argument submitted by the lender.
(3) In actions based upon a conviction or civil judgment, or in which there is no genuine dispute over material facts, the Under Secretary for Benefits shall make a decision on the basis of all the information in the administrative record, including any submission made by the lender.
(4) Withdrawal of the LAPP authority will require that VA make subsequent determinations of reasonable value for the lender. Consequently, VA staff will review each appraisal report and issue a Certificate of Reasonable Value which can then be used by the lender to close loans on either the prior VA approval or automatic basis.
(5) Withdrawal by VA of the lender's LAPP authority does not prevent VA from also withdrawing automatic processing authority or taking debarment or suspension action based upon the same conduct by the lender.

§ 36.4348
Servicer Appraisal Processing Program.
(a)
Delegation of authority to servicers to review liquidation appraisals and determine reasonable value.
Based on the reasonable value, the servicer will be able to determine net value.
(1) To be eligible for delegation of authority to review VA liquidation appraisals and determine the reasonable value for liquidation purposes on properties secured by VA guaranteed or insured loans, a lender must:
(i) Have automatic processing authority under 38 U.S.C. 3702(d), and
(ii) Employ one or more Staff Appraisal Reviewers (SAR) acceptable to the Secretary.
(2) To qualify as a servicer's staff appraisal reviewer an applicant must be a full-time member of the servicer's permanent staff and may not be employed by, or perform services for, any other mortgagee. The individual must not engage in any private pursuits in which there will be, or appear to be, any conflict of interest between those pursuits and his/her duties, responsibilities, and performance as a Servicer Appraisal Processing Program (SAPP) staff appraisal reviewer. Three years of appraisal related experience is necessary to qualify as a servicer's staff appraisal reviewer. That experience must demonstrate knowledge of, and the ability to apply industry-accepted principles, methods, practices and techniques of appraising, and the ability to competently determine the value of property. The individual must demonstrate the ability to review the work of others and to recognize deviations from accepted appraisal principle, practices, and techniques, error in computations, and unjustifiable and unsupportable conclusions.
(3) Servicers that have a staff appraisal reviewer determined acceptable to VA, will be authorized to review liquidation appraisals and make reasonable value determinations for liquidation purposes on properties that are the security for VA guaranteed or insured loans. Additionally, servicers must satisfy initial VA office case review requirements prior to being allowed to determine reasonable value without VA involvement. The initial office case review requirement must be satisfied in the VA regional loan center in whose jurisdiction the servicer's staff appraisal reviewer is located before the SAPP authority may be utilized by that servicer in any other VA office's jurisdiction. To satisfy the initial office case review requirement, the first five cases of each servicer staff appraisal reviewer involving properties in the regional office location where the staff appraisal reviewer is located will be processed by him or her up to the point where he or she has made a reasonable value determination and fully drafted, but not issued, the servicer's notice of value. At that point, and prior to loan termination, each of the five cases will be submitted to the VA regional loan center having jurisdiction over the property. After a staff review of each case, VA will issue a notice of value which the servicer may use to compute the net value of the property for liquidation purposes. If these five cases are found to be acceptable by VA, the servicer's staff appraisal reviewer will be allowed to fully process subsequent appraisals for properties regardless of jurisdictional location without prior submission to VA and issuance by VA of a notice of value. Where the servicer's reviewer cannot readily meet the jurisdictional review requirement, the SAR applicant may request that VA expand the geographic area of consideration. VA will accommodate such requests if practicable. The initial office case review requirement may be expanded by VA if acceptable performance has not been demonstrated. After satisfaction of the initial office case review requirement, routine reviews of SAPP cases will be made by VA staff based upon quality control procedures established by the Undersecretary for Benefits. Such review will be made on a random sampling or performance related basis.
(4) Certifications required from the servicer will be specified with particularity in the separate instructions issued by the Secretary, as noted in § 36.4348(b).
(b)
Instructions for SAPP Procedures.
The Secretary will publish separate instructions for processing appraisals under the Servicer Appraisal Processing Program. Compliance with these
regulations and the separate instructions issued by the Secretary is deemed by VA to be the minimum exercise of due diligence in processing SAPP cases. Due diligence is considered by VA to represent that care, as is to be properly expected from, and ordinarily exercised by, a reasonable and prudent servicer who would be dependent on the property as security to protect its investment.
(c)
Adjustment of value recommendations.
The amount of authority to upwardly adjust the fee appraiser's estimated market value during the servicer staff appraisal reviewer's initial review of the appraisal report or to subsequently process an appeal of the servicer's established reasonable value will be specified in the separate instructions issued by VA as noted in § 36.4348(b). The amount specified must not in any way be considered an administrative adjustment figure which may be applied indiscriminately and without valid basis or justification.
(1)
Adjustment during initial review.
Any adjustment during the staff appraisal reviewer's initial review of the appraisal report must be fully and clearly justified in writing on the appraisal report form or, if necessary, on an addendum. The basis for the adjustment must be adequate and reasonable by professional appraisal standards. If real estate market or other valid data was utilized in arriving at the decision to make the adjustment, such data must be attached to the appraisal report. All adjustments, comments, corrections, justifications, etc., to the appraisal report must be made in a contrasting color, be clearly legible, and signed and dated by the staff appraisal reviewer.
(2)
Processing appeals.
The authority provided under 38 U.S.C. 3731(d) which permits a lender to obtain a VA fee panel appraiser's report which VA is obligated to consider in an appeal of the established reasonable value shall not apply to cases processed under the authority provided by this section. All appeals of VA fee appraiser's estimated market values or servicer's reasonable value determinations above the amount specified in the separate instructions issued by VA must be submitted, along with the servicer's recommendations, if any, to VA for processing and final determination. Unless otherwise authorized in the separate instructions servicers must also submit appeals, regardless of the amount, to VA in all cases where the staff appraisal reviewer has made an adjustment during their initial review of the appraisal report to the fee appraiser's market value estimate. The fee appraiser's estimated market value or servicer's reasonable value determination may be increased only when such increase is clearly warranted and fully supported by real estate market or other valid data considered adequate and reasonable by professional appraisal standards and the servicer's staff appraisal reviewer clearly and fully justifies the reasoning and basis for the increase in writing on the appraisal report form or an addendum. The staff appraisal reviewer must date and sign the written justification and must cite within it the data used in arriving at the decision to make the increase. All such data shall be attached to the appraisal report form and any addendum.
(d)
Indemnification.
When the Secretary has incurred a loss as a result of a payment of claim under guaranty and in which the Secretary determines an increase made by the servicer under § 36.4348(c) was unwarranted, or arbitrary and capricious, the lender shall indemnify the Secretary to the extent the Secretary determines such loss was caused or increased, by the increase in value.
(e)
Affiliations.
A servicer affiliated with a real estate firm, builder, land developer or escrow agent as a subsidiary division, or in any other entity in which it has a financial interest or which it owns may not use the authority for any cases involving the affiliate unless the servicer demonstrates to the Secretary's satisfaction that the servicer and its affiliate(s) are essentially separate entities that operate independently of each other, free of all cross-influences (e.g., a formal corporate agreement exists which specifically sets forth this fact).

Copies of the lender's quality control plan or self-policing system evidencing appraisal related matters must be provided to the VA office of jurisdiction with the servicer's application of SAPP authority.
(g)
Fees.
The Secretary will require servicers to pay a $100.00 application fee for each SAR the servicer nominates for approval. The application fee will also apply if the SAR begins work for another servicer.
(h)
Withdrawal of servicer authority.
The authority for a servicer to determine reasonable value may be withdrawn by the Loan Guaranty Officer when proper cause exists. A servicer's authority to make reasonable value determinations shall be withdrawn when the servicer no longer meets the basic requirements for delegating the authority, or when it can be shown that the servicer's reasonable value determinations have not been made in accordance with VA regulations, requirements, guidelines, instructions or applicable laws, or when there is adequate evidence to support reasonable belief by VA that a particular unacceptable act, practice, or performance by the servicer or the servicer's staff has occurred.

The servicer will be informed in writing of the decision.
(2) The servicer has the right to appeal the Regional Loan Center Director's decision to the Undersecretary for Benefits. In the event of such an appeal, the Undersecretary for Benefits
will review all relevant material concerning the matter and make a determination that shall constitute final agency action. If the servicer's submission of opposition raises a genuine dispute over facts material to the withdrawal of SAPP authority, the servicer will be afforded an opportunity to appear with a representative, submit documentary evidence, present witnesses and confront any witness the Veterans Benefits Administration presents. The Undersecretary for Benefits will appoint a hearing officer or panel to conduct the hearing.

Servicing procedures for holders.
(a)
Establishment of loan servicing program.
The holder of a loan guaranteed or insured by the Secretary shall develop and maintain a loan servicing program which follows accepted industry standards for servicing of similar type conventional loans.

However, it must incorporate each of the provisions specified in paragraphs (b) through (l) of this section.
(b)
Procedures for providing information.
(1) Loan holders shall establish procedures to provide loan information to borrowers, arrange for individual loan consultations upon request and maintain controls to assure prompt responses to inquiries. One or more of the following means of making information readily available to borrowers is required.
(i) An office staffed with trained servicing personnel with access to loan account information located within 200 miles of the property.
(ii) Toll-free telephone service or acceptance of collect telephone calls at an office capable of providing needed information.
(2) All borrowers must be informed of the system available for obtaining answers to loan inquiries, the office from which the needed information may be obtained, and reminded of the system at least annually.
(c)
Statement for income tax purposes.
Before February 1st of each calendar year, the holder shall furnish to the borrower a statement of the interest paid and, if applicable, a statement of the taxes disbursed from the escrow account during the preceding year. At the borrower's request, the holder shall furnish a statement of the escrow account sufficient to enable the borrower to reconcile the account.
(d)
Change of servicing.
Whenever servicing of a loan guaranteed or insured by the Secretary is transferred from one holder to another, notice of such transfer by both the transferor and transferee, the form and content of such notice, the timing of such notice, the treatment of payments during the period of such transfer, and damages and costs for failure to comply with these requirements shall be governed by the pertinent provisions of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act as administered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development.
(e)
Escrow accounts.
A holder of a loan guaranteed or insured by the Secretary may collect periodic deposits from the borrower for taxes and/or insurance on the security and maintain a tax and insurance escrow account provided such a requirement is authorized under the terms of the security instruments. In maintaining such accounts, the holder shall comply with the pertinent provisions of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act.
(f)
System for servicing delinquent loans.
In addition to the requirements of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, concerning the duties of the loan servicer to respond to borrower inquiries, to protect the borrower's credit rating during a payment dispute period, and to pay damages and costs for noncompliance, holders shall establish a system for servicing delinquent loans which ensures that prompt action is taken to collect amounts due from borrowers and minimize the number of loans in a default status. The holder's servicing system must include the following:
(1) An accounting system which promptly alerts servicing personnel when a loan becomes delinquent;
(2) A collection staff which is trained in techniques of loan servicing and counseling delinquent borrowers to advise borrowers how to cure delinquencies, protect their equity and credit rating and, if the default is insoluble, pursue alternatives to foreclosure;
(3) Procedural guidelines for individual analysis of each delinquency;
(4) Instructions and appropriate controls for sending delinquent notices, assessing late charges, handling partial payments, maintaining servicing histories and evaluating repayment proposals;
(5) Management review procedures for evaluating efforts made to collect the delinquency and the response from the borrower before a decision is made to initiate action to liquidate a loan;
(6) Procedures for reporting delinquencies of 90 days or more and loan terminations to major consumer credit bureaus as specified by the Secretary and for informing borrowers that such action will be taken; and
(7) Controls to ensure that all notices required to be given to the Secretary on delinquent loans are provided timely and in such form as the Secretary shall require.
(g)
Collection actions.
(1) Holders shall employ collection techniques which provide flexibility to adapt to the individual needs and circumstances of each borrower. A variety of collection techniques may be used based on the holder's determination of the most effective means of contact with borrowers during various stages of delinquency. However, at a minimum the holder's collection procedures must include the following actions:
(i) An effort, concurrent with the initial late payment notice to establish contact with the borrower(s) by telephone. When talking with the borrower(s), the holder should attempt to determine why payment was not made and emphasize the importance of remitting loan installments as they come due.
(ii) A letter to the borrower(s) if payment has not been received within 30 days after it is due and telephone contact could not be made. This letter should emphasize the seriousness of the delinquency and the importance of taking prompt action to resolve the default. It should also notify the borrower(s) that the loan is in default, state the total amount due and advise the borrower(s) how to contact the holder to make arrangements for curing the default.
(iii) In the event the holder has not established contact with the borrower(s) and has not determined the financial circumstances of the borrower(s) or established a reason for the
default or obtained agreement to a repayment plan from the borrower(s), then a face-to-face interview with the borrower(s) or a reasonable effort to arrange such a meeting is required.
(iv)(A) A letter to the borrower if payment has not been received:
(
1
) In the case of a default occurring within the first 6 months following loan closing or the execution of a modification agreement pursuant to § 36.4315, within 45 calendar days after such payment was due; or
(
2
) In the case of any other default, within 75 calendar days after such payment was due.
(B) The letter required by paragraph (g)(1)(iv)(A) must be mailed no later than 7 calendar days after the payment is delinquent for the time period stated in paragraph (g)(1)(iv)(A) and shall:
(
1
) Provide the borrower with a toll-free telephone number and, if available, an e-mail address for contacting the servicer;
(
2
) Explain loss mitigation options available to the borrower;
(
3
) Emphasize that the intent of servicing is to retain home ownership whenever possible; and
(
4
) Contain the following language:
The delinquency of your mortgage loan is a serious matter that could result in the loss of your home. If you are the veteran whose entitlement was used to obtain this loan, you can also lose your entitlement to a future VA home loan guaranty. If you are not already working with us to resolve the delinquency, please call us to discuss your workout options. You may be able to make special payment arrangements that will reinstate your loan. You may also qualify for a repayment plan or loan modification.
VA has guaranteed a portion of your loan and wants to ensure that you receive every reasonable opportunity to bring your loan current and retain your home. VA can also answer any questions you have regarding your entitlement. If you have access to the Internet and would like to obtain more information, you may access the VA web site at
www.va.gov.
You may also learn where to speak to a VA Loan Administration representative by calling 1-800-827-1000.
(2) The holder must provide a valid explanation of any failure to perform these collection actions when reporting loan defaults to the Secretary. A pattern of such failure may be a basis for sanctions under 2 CFR parts 180 and 801.
(h)
Conducting interviews with delinquent borrowers.
When personal contact with the borrower(s) is established, the holder shall solicit sufficient information to properly evaluate the prospects for curing the default and whether the granting of forbearance or other relief assistance would be appropriate. At a minimum, the holder must make a reasonable effort to establish the following:
(1) The reason for the default and whether the reason is a temporary or permanent condition;
(2) The present income and employment of the borrower(s);
(3) The current monthly expenses of the borrower(s) including household and debt obligations;
(4) The current mailing address and telephone number of the borrower(s); and
(5) A realistic and mutually satisfactory arrangement for curing the default.
(i)
Property inspections.
(1) The holder shall make an inspection of the property securing the loan whenever it becomes aware that the physical condition of the security may be in jeopardy. Unless a repayment agreement is in effect, a property inspection shall also be made at the following times:
(i) Before the 60th day of delinquency or before initiating action to liquidate a loan, whichever is earlier; and
(ii) At least once each month after liquidation proceedings have been started unless servicing information shows the property remains owner-occupied.
(2) Whenever a holder obtains information which indicates that the property securing the loan is abandoned, it shall make appropriate arrangements to protect the property from vandalism and the elements. Thereafter, the holder shall schedule inspections at least monthly to prevent unnecessary deterioration due to vandalism, or neglect. With respect to any loan more than 60 calendar days delinquent, if the property is abandoned, this fact must be reported to the Secretary as required in § 36.4317(c)(10) and immediate action should be initiated by the servicer to terminate the loan once the abandonment has been confirmed.
(j)
Collection records.
The holder shall maintain individual file records of collection action on delinquent loans and make such records available to the Secretary for inspection on request. Such collection records shall show:
(1) The dates and content of letters and notices which were mailed to the borrower(s);
(2) Dated summaries of each personal servicing contact and the result of same;
(3) The indicated reason(s) for default; and
(4) The date and result of each property inspection.
(k)
Quality control procedures.
No later than 180 days after the effective date of this regulation, each loan holder shall establish internal controls to periodically assess the quality of the servicing performed on loans guaranteed by the Secretary and assure that all requirements of this section are being met. Those procedures must provide for a review of the holder's servicing activities at least annually and include an evaluation of delinquency and foreclosure rates on loans in its portfolio which are guaranteed by the Secretary. As part of its evaluation of delinquency and foreclosure rates, the holder shall:
(1) Collect and maintain appropriate data on delinquency and foreclosure rates to enable the holder to evaluate effectiveness of its collection efforts;
(2) Determine how its VA delinquency and foreclosure rates compare with rates in reports published by the industry, investors and others; and,
(3) Analyze significant variances between its foreclosure and delinquency rates and those found in available reports and publications and take appropriate corrective action.
(l)
Provision of Data.
Holders shall provide available statistical data on delinquency and foreclosure rates and their analysis of such data to the Secretary upon request.

[79 FR 2101, Jan. 13, 2014]
§ 36.4352
Authority to close loans on the automatic basis.
(a)
Supervised lender authority.
Supervised lenders of the classes described in 38 U.S.C. 3702(d)(1) and (2) are authorized by statute to process VA guaranteed home loans on the automatic basis. This category of lenders includes any Federal land bank, national bank, State bank, private bank, building and loan association, insurance company, credit union or mortgage and loan company that is subject to examination and supervision by an agency of the United States or of any State or by any State.
(b)
Non-supervised lender authority.
Non-supervised lenders of the class described in 38 U.S.C. 3702(d)(3) must apply to the Secretary for authority to process loans on the automatic basis. Each of the minimum requirements listed below must be met by applicant lenders.
(1)
Experience.
The applicant lender must meet one of the following experience requirements:
(i) The applicant lender must have been actively engaged in originating VA loans for at least two years, have a VA Lender ID number and have originated and closed a minimum of ten VA loans within the past two years, excluding interest rate reduction refinance loans (IRRRLs), that have been properly documented and submitted in compliance with VA requirements and procedures; or
(ii) The applicant lender must have a VA ID number and, if active for less than two years, have originated and closed at least 25 VA loans, excluding
IRRRLs, that have been properly documented and submitted in compliance with VA requirements and procedures; or
(iii) Each principal officer of the applicant lender, who is actively involved in managing origination functions, must have a minimum of two recent years' management experience in the origination of VA loans. This experience may be with the current or prior employer. For the purposes of this requirement, principal officer is defined as president or vice president; or
(iv) If the applicant lender has been operating as an agent for a non-supervised automatic lender (sponsoring lender), the firm must submit documentation confirming that it has a VA Lender ID number and has originated a minimum of ten VA loans, excluding IRRRLs, over the past two years. If active for less than two years, the agent must have originated at least 25 VA loans. The required documentation is a copy of the VA letter approving the applicant lender as an agent for the sponsoring lender; a copy of the corporate resolution, describing the functions the agent was to perform, submitted to VA by the sponsoring lender; and a letter from a senior officer of the sponsoring lender indicating the number of VA loans submitted by the agent each year and that the loans have been properly documented and submitted in compliance with VA requirements and procedures.
(2)
Underwriter.
A senior officer of the applicant lender must nominate a full-time qualified employee(s) to act in the applicant lender's behalf as underwriter(s) to personally review and make underwriting decisions on VA loans to be closed on the automatic basis.
(i) Nominees for underwriter must have a minimum of three years experience in processing, pre-underwriting or underwriting mortgage loans. At least one recent year of this experience must have included making underwriting decisions on VA loans. (Recent is defined as within the past three years.) A VA nomination and current resume, outlining the underwriter's specific experience with VA loans, must be submitted for each underwriter nominee.
(ii) Alternatively, if an underwriter does not have the experience outlined above, the underwriter must submit documentation verifying that he or she is a current Accredited Residential Underwriter (ARU) as designated by the Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA).
(iii) If an underwriter is not located in the lender's corporate office, then a senior officer must certify that the underwriter reports to and is supervised by an individual who is not a branch manager or other person with production responsibilities.
(iv) All VA-approved underwriters must attend a 1-day (eight-hour) training course on underwriter responsibilities, VA underwriting requirements, and VA administrative requirements, including the usage of VA forms, within 90 days of approval (if VA is unable to make such training available within 90 days, the underwriter must attend the first available training). Immediately upon approval of a VA underwriter, the office of jurisdiction will contact the underwriter to schedule this training at a VA regional office (VARO) of the underwriter's choice. This training is required for all newly approved VA underwriters, including those who qualified for approval based on an ARU designation, as well as VA-approved underwriters who have not underwritten VA-guaranteed loans in the past 24 months. Furthermore, and at the discretion of any VARO in whose jurisdiction the lender is originating VA loans, VA-approved underwriters who consistently approve loans that do not meet VA credit standards may be required to retake this training.
(3)
Underwriter certification.
The lender must certify that all underwriting decisions as to whether to accept or reject a VA loan will be made by a VA-approved underwriter. In addition each VA-approved underwriter will be required to certify on each VA loan that he or she approves that the loan has been personally reviewed and approved by the underwriter.
(4)
Financial requirements.
Each application must include the most recent annual financial statement audited and certified by a certified public accountant (CPA). If the date of the annual financial statement precedes that of the application by more than six months,
the lender must also attach a copy of its latest internal financial statement. Lenders are required to meet either the working capital or the minimum net worth financial requirement as defined below.
(i)
Working capital.
A minimum of $50,000 in working capital must be demonstrated.
(A) Working capital is a measure of an applicant lender's liquidity, or the ability to pay its short-term debts. Working capital is defined as the excess of current assets over current liabilities. Current assets are defined as cash or other liquid assets convertible into cash within a 1-year period. Current liabilities are defined as debts that must be paid within the same 1-year time frame.
(B) The VA determination of whether a lender has the required minimum working capital is based on the balance sheet of the lender's annual audited financial statement. Therefore, either the balance sheet must be classified to distinguish between current and fixed assets and between current and long-term liabilities or the information must be provided in a footnote to the statement.
(ii)
Net worth.
Lenders must show evidence of a minimum of $ 250,000 in adjusted net worth. Net worth is a measure of an applicant lender's solvency, or its ability to exist in the long run, quantified by the payment of long-term debts. Net worth as defined by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) is total assets minus total liabilities. Adjusted net worth for VA purposes is the same as the adjusted net worth required by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), net worth less certain unacceptable assets including:
(A) Any assets of the lender pledged to secure obligations of another person or entity.
(B) Any asset due from either officers or stockholders of the lender or related entities, in which the lender's officers or stockholders have a personal interest, unrelated to their position as an officer or stockholder.
(C) Any investment in related entities in which the lender's officers or stockholders have a personal interest unrelated to their position as an officer or stockholder.
(D) That portion of an investment in joint ventures, subsidiaries, affiliates and/or other related entities which is carried at a value greater than equity, as adjusted. “Equity as adjusted” means the book value of the related entity reduced by the amount of unacceptable assets carried by the related entity.
(E) All intangibles, such as goodwill, covenants not to compete, franchisee fees, organization costs, etc., except unamortized servicing costs carried at a value established by an arm's-length transaction and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
(F) That portion of an asset not readily marketable and for which appraised values are very subjective, carried at a value in excess of a substantially discounted appraised value. Assets such as antiques, art work and gemstones are subject to this provision and should be carried at the lower of cost or market.
(G) Any asset that is principally used for the personal enjoyment of an officer or stockholder and not for normal business purposes. Adjusted net worth must be calculated by a CPA using an audited and certified balance sheet from the lender's latest financial statements. “Personal interest” as used in this section indicates a relationship between the lender and a person or entity in which that specified person (e.g., spouse, parent, grandparent, child, brother, sister, aunt, uncle or in-law) has a financial interest in or is employed in a management position by the lender.
(5)
Lines of credit.
The lender applicant must have one or more lines of credit aggregating at least $ 1 million. The identity of the source(s) of warehouse lines of credit must be submitted to VA and the applicant must agree that VA may contact the named source(s) for the purpose of verifying the information. A line of credit must be unrestricted, that is, funds are available upon demand to close loans and are not dependent on prior investor approval. A letter from the company(ies) verifying the unrestricted line(s) of credit must be submitted
with the application for automatic authority.
(6)
Permanent investors.
If the lender customarily sells loans it originates, it must have a minimum of two permanent investors. The names, addresses and telephone numbers of the permanent investors must be submitted with the application.
(7)
Liaison.
The lender applicant must designate an employee and an alternate to be the primary liaison with VA. The liaison officers should be thoroughly familiar with the lender's entire operation and be able to respond to any query from VA concerning a particular VA loan or the firm's automatic authority.
(8)
Other considerations.
All applications will also be reviewed in light of the following considerations:
(i) There must be no factors that indicate that the firm would not exercise the care and diligence required of a lender originating and closing VA loans on the automatic basis; and
(ii) In the event the applicant lender, any member of the board of directors, or any principal officer has ever been debarred or suspended by any Federal agency or department, or any of its directors or officers has been a director or officer of any other lender or corporation that was so debarred or suspended, or if the lender applicant ever had a servicing contract with an investor terminated for cause, a statement of the facts must be submitted with the application for automatic authority.
(9)
Quality control system.
In order to be approved as a non-supervised lender for automatic-processing authority, the lender must implement a written quality control system which ensures compliance with VA requirements. The lender must agree to furnish findings under its systems to VA on demand. The elements of the quality control system must include the following:
(i)
Underwriting policies.
Each office of the lender shall maintain copies of VA credit standards and all available VA underwriting guidelines.
(ii)
Corrective measures.
The system should ensure that effective corrective measures are taken promptly when deficiencies in loan originations are identified by either the lender or VA. Any cases involving major discrepancies which are discovered under the system must be reported to VA.
(iii)
System integrity.
The quality control system should be independent of the mortgage loan production function.
(iv)
Scope.
The review of underwriting decisions and certifications must include compliance with VA underwriting requirements, sufficiency of documentation and soundness of underwriting judgments.
(v)
Appraisal quality.
For lenders approved for the Lender Appraisal Processing Program (LAPP), the quality control system must specifically contain provisions concerning the adequacy and quality of real property appraisals. While the lender's quality control personnel need not be appraisers, they should have basic familiarity with appraisal theory and techniques so that they can select appropriate cases for review if discretionary sampling is used, and prescribe appropriate corrective action(s) in the appraisal review process when discrepancies or problems are identified. Copies of the lender's quality control plan or self-policing system evidencing appraisal related matters must be provided to the VA office of jurisdiction.
(10)
Courtesy closing.
The lender applicant must certify to VA that it will not close loans on an automatic basis as a courtesy or accommodation for other mortgage lenders, whether or not such lenders are themselves approved to close on an automatic basis without the express approval of VA. However, a lender with automatic authority may close loans for which information and supporting credit data have been developed on its behalf by a duly authorized agent.
(11)
Probation.
Lenders meeting these requirements will be approved to close VA loans on an automatic basis for a 1-year period. At the end of this period, the lender's quality of underwriting, the completeness of loan submissions, compliance with VA requirements and procedures, and the delinquency and foreclosure rates will be reviewed.
(12)
Extensions of automatic authority.
When a lender wants its automatic authority extended to another State, the request must be submitted, with the fee designated in paragraph (e)(5) of this section, to the VA regional office
having jurisdiction in the State where the lender's corporate office is located.
(i) When a lender wants its automatic authority to include loans involving a real estate brokerage and/or a residential builder or developer in which it has a financial interest, owns, is owned by, or with which it is affiliated, the following documentation must be submitted:
(A) A corporate resolution from the lender and each affiliate indicating that they are separate entities operating independently of each other. The lender's corporate resolution must indicate that it will not give more favorable underwriting consideration to its affiliate's loans, and the affiliate's corporate resolution must indicate that it will not seek to influence the lender to give their loans more favorable underwriting consideration.
(B) Letters from permanent investors indicating the percentage of all VA loans based on the affiliate's production originated by the lender over a 1-year period that are past due 90 days or more. This delinquency ratio must be no higher than the national average for the same period for all mortgage loans.
(ii) When a lender wants its automatic authority extended to additional States, the lender must indicate how it plans to originate VA loans in those States. Unless a lender proposes a telemarketing plan, VA requires that a lender have a presence in the State, that is, a branch office, an agent relationship, or that it is a reasonable distance from one of its offices in an adjacent State,
i.e.
, 50 miles. If the request is based on an agency relationship, the documentation outlined in paragraph (b)(13) must be submitted with the request for extension.
(13)
Use of agents.
A lender using an agent to perform a portion of the work involved in originating and closing a VA-guaranteed loan on an automatic basis must take full responsibility by certification for all acts, errors and omissions of the agent or other entity and its employees for the work performed. Any such acts, errors or omissions will be treated as those of the lender and appropriate sanctions may be imposed against the lender and its agent. Lenders requesting an agent must submit the following documentation to the VA regional office having jurisdiction for the lender's corporate office:
(i) A corporate resolution certifying that the lender takes full responsibility for all acts, errors and omissions of the agent that it is requesting. The corporate resolution must also identify the agent's name and address, and the geographic area in which the agent will be originating and/or closing VA loans; whether the agent is authorized to issue interest rate lock-in agreements on behalf of the lender; and outline the functions the agent is to perform. Alternatively, the lender may submit a blanket corporate resolution which sets forth the functions of any and all agents and identifies individual agents by name, address, and geographic area in separate letters which refer to the blanket resolution.
(ii) When the VA regional office having jurisdiction for the lender's corporate office acknowledges receipt of the lender's request in writing, the agent is thereby authorized to originate VA loans on the lender's behalf.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 501(a), 3702(d))
(c)
Reporting responsibility.
A lender approved to close loans on the automatic basis who subsequently fails to meet the requirements of this section must report to VA the circumstances surrounding the deficiency and the remedial action to be taken to cure it. Failure to advise VA in a timely manner could result in a lender's loss of its approval to close VA loans on the automatic basis.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 501(a), 3702(d))
(d)
Annual recertification.
Non-supervised lenders of the class described in 38 U.S.C. 3702(d)(3) must be recertified annually for authority to process loans on the automatic basis. The following minimum annual recertification requirements must be met by each lender approved for automatic authority:
(1)
Financial requirements.
A lender must submit, within 120 days following the end of its fiscal year, an audited and certified financial statement with a classified balance sheet or a separate footnote for adjusted net worth to VA Central Office (264) for review. The same minimum financial requirements
described in § 36.4352(b)(5) must be maintained and verified annually in order to be recertified for automatic authority.
(2)
Processing annual lender data.
The VA regional office having jurisdiction for the lender's corporate office will mail an annual notice to the lender requesting current information on the lender's personnel and operation. The lender is required to complete the form and return it with the appropriate annual renewal fees to the VA regional office.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 501(a), 3702(d))
(e)
Lender fees.
To participate as a VA automatic lender, non-supervised lenders of the class described in 38 U.S.C. 3702(d)(3) shall pay fees as follows:
(1) $500 for new applications;
(2) $200 for reinstatement of lapsed or terminated automatic authority;
(3) $100 for each underwriter approval;
(4) $100 for each agent approval;
(5) A minimum fee of $100 for any other VA administrative action pertaining to a lender's status as an automatic lender;
(6) $200 annually for certification of home offices; and
(7) $100 annually for each agent renewal.
(f)
Supervised lender fees.
Supervised lenders of the classes described in paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of 38 U.S. Code 3702 participating in VA's Loan Guaranty Program shall pay fees as follows:
(1) $100 fee for each agent approval; and
(2) $100 annually for each agent renewal.
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 501(a) and 3703(c)(1))
(g)
LAPP fees.
Lenders participating in VA's Lender Appraisal Processing Program shall pay a fee of $100 for approval of each staff appraisal reviewer.

[73 FR 6310, Feb. 1, 2008. Redesignated at 75 FR 33705, June 15, 2010, as amended at 80 FR 34319, June 16, 2015]
§ 36.4353
Withdrawal of authority to close loans on the automatic basis.
(a)(1) As provided in 38 U.S.C. 3702(e), the authority of any lender to close loans on the automatic basis may be withdrawn by the Secretary at any time upon 30 days notice. The automatic processing authority of both supervised and non-supervised lenders may be withdrawn for engaging in practices which are imprudent from a lending standpoint or which are prejudicial to the interests of veterans or the Government but are of a lesser degree than would warrant complete suspension or debarment of the lender from participation in the program.
(2) Automatic-processing authority may be withdrawn at any time for failure to meet basic qualifying and/or annual recertification criteria.
(i)
Non-supervised lenders.
(A) Automatic authority may be withdrawn for lack of a VA-approved underwriter, failure to maintain $50,000 in working capital or $250,000 in adjusted net worth, or failure to file required financial information.
(B) During the 1-year probationary period for newly approved lenders, automatic authority may be temporarily or permanently withdrawn for any of the reasons set forth in this section regardless of whether deficiencies previously have been brought to the attention of the probationary lender.
(ii)
Supervised lenders.
Automatic authority will be withdrawn for loss of status as an entity subject to examination and supervision by a Federal or State supervisory agency as required by 38 U.S.C. 3702(d).
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3702(d))
(3) Automatic processing authority may also be withdrawn for any of the causes for debarment set forth in 2 CFR parts 180 and 801.
(b) Authority to close loans on the automatic basis may also be temporarily withdrawn for a period of time under the following schedule.
(1) Withdrawal for 60 days may occur when:
(i) Automatic loan submissions show deficiencies in credit underwriting, such as use of unstable sources of income to qualify the borrower, ignoring significant adverse credit items affecting the applicant's creditworthiness, etc., after such deficiencies have been repeatedly called to the lender's attention;
(ii) Employment or deposit verifications are handcarried by applicants or otherwise improperly permitted to pass through the hands of a third party;
(iii) Automatic loan submissions are consistently incomplete after such deficiencies have been repeatedly called to the lender's attention by VA; or
(iv) There are continued instances of disregard of VA requirements after they have been called to the lender's attention.
(2) Withdrawal for 180 days may occur when:
(i) Loans are closed automatically which conflict with VA credit standards and which would not have been made by a lender acting prudently;
(ii) The lender fails to disclose to VA significant obligations or other information so material to the veteran's ability to repay the loan that undue risk to the Government results;
(iii) Employment or deposit verifications are allowed to be handcarried by applicant or otherwise mishandled, resulting in the submission of significant misinformation to VA;
(iv) Substantiated complaints are received that the lender misrepresented VA requirements to veterans to the detriment of their interests (e.g., veteran was dissuaded from seeking a lower interest rate based on lender's incorrect advice that such options were precluded by VA requirements);
(v) Closing documentation shows instances of improper charges to the veteran after the impropriety of such charges has been called to the lender's attention by VA, or refusal to refund such charges after notification by VA; or
(vi) There are other instances of lender actions which are prejudicial to the interests of veterans such as deliberate delays in scheduling loan closings.
(3) Withdrawal for a period of from one year to three years may occur when:
(i) The lender fails to properly disburse loans (e.g., loan disbursement checks returned due to insufficient funds);
(ii) There is involvement by the lender in the improper use of a veteran's entitlement (e.g., knowingly permitting the veteran to violate occupancy requirements, lender involvement in sale of veteran's entitlement, etc.).
(4) A continuation of actions that have led to previous withdrawal of automatic authority justifies withdrawal of automatic authority for the next longer period of time.
(5) Withdrawal of automatic processing authority does not prevent a lender from processing VA guaranteed loans on the prior approval basis.
(6) Action by VA to remove a lender's automatic authority does not prevent VA from also taking debarment or suspension action based on the same conduct by the lender.
(7) VA field facilities are authorized to withdraw automatic privileges for 60 days, based on any of the violations set forth in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(3) of this section, for non-supervised lenders without operations in other stations' jurisdictions. All determinations regarding withdrawal of automatic authority for longer periods of time or multi-jurisdictional lenders must be made in Central Office.
(c) VA will provide 30 days notice of a withdrawal of automatic authority in order to enable the lender to either close or obtain prior approval for a loan on which processing has begun. There is no right to a formal hearing to contest the withdrawal of automatic processing privileges. However, if within 15 days after receiving notice the lender requests an opportunity to contest the withdrawal, the lender may submit in person, in writing, or through a representative, information and argument in opposition to the withdrawal.
(d) If the lender's submission in opposition raises a dispute over facts material to the withdrawal of automatic authority, the lender will be afforded an opportunity to appear with a representative, submit documentary evidence, present witnesses, and confront any witnesses VA presents. The Under Secretary for Benefits will appoint a hearing officer or panel to conduct the hearing.
(e) A transcribed record of the proceedings shall be made available at cost to the lender, upon request, unless the requirement for a transcript is waived by mutual agreement.
(f) In actions based upon a conviction or civil judgment, or in which there is no genuine dispute over material facts, the Under Secretary for Benefits shall make a decision on the basis of all the information in the administrative record, including any submission made by the lender.
(g) In actions in which additional proceedings are necessary to determine disputed material facts, written findings of fact will be prepared by the hearing officer or panel. The Under Secretary for Benefits shall base the decision on the facts as found, together with any information and argument submitted by the lender and any other information in the administrative record.

(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3703(c)(1))
§ 36.4354
Estate of veteran in real property.
(a) The title of the estate in the realty acquired by the veteran, wholly or partly with the proceeds of a guaranteed or insured loan, or owned by him and on which construction, or repairs, or alterations or improvements are to be made, shall be such as is acceptable to informed buyers, title companies, and attorneys, generally, in the community in which the property is situated, except as modified by paragraph (b) of this section. Such estate shall be not less than:
(1) A fee simple estate therein, legal or equitable; or
(2) A leasehold estate running or renewable at the option of the lessee for a period of not less than 14 years from the maturity of the loan, or to any earlier date at which the fee simple title will vest in the lessee, which is assignable or transferable, if the same be subjected to the lien; however, a leasehold estate which is not freely assignable and transferable will be considered an acceptable estate if it is determined by the Under Secretary for Benefits, or the Executive Director, Loan Guaranty Service:
(i) That such type of leasehold is customary in the area where the property is located,
(ii) That a veteran or veterans will be prejudiced if the requirement for free assignability is adhered to; and

(A) An owner elects to sell;
(B) The option price is not less than the price at which the then owner is willing to sell to another; and
(C) Exercised within 30 days after notice is mailed by registered mail to the address of optionee last known to the then owner of the then owner's election to sell, stating the price and the identity of the proposed vendee;
(ii) A condominium estate established by the filing for record of the Master Deed, or other enabling document before December 1, 1976 will not fail to comply with the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section by reason of:

) If the property is resold within a time period as established by local law or ordinance after the purchaser acquires title, a governmental agency may specify a maximum price which the veteran may receive for the property upon resale; or
(
3
) Such other restriction approved by the Secretary designed to insure either that a property acquired under such program again be made available to low-or moderate-income purchasers, or to prevent a private purchaser from obtaining a windfall profit on the resale of such property, while assuring that the purchaser has a reasonable opportunity to dispose of the property without undue difficulty at a reasonable price.
(
4
) The sale price of a property under any of the restrictions of paragraph (b)(5)(iv)(A) of this section shall not be less than the lowest of the following: The price designated by the owner as the asking price; the appraised value of the property; or the original purchase price of the property, increased by a factor reflecting all or a reasonable portion of the increased costs of housing or the percentage increase in median income in the area between the date of original purchase and resale, plus the reasonable value or actual costs of any capital improvements made by the owner plus a reasonable real estate commission less the cost of necessary repairs required to place the property in saleable condition; or other reasonable formula approved by the Secretary.

Provided
, That the limitations on the quantum or quality of the estate or property that are indicated in this paragraph, insofar as they may materially affect the value of the property for the purpose for which it is used, are taken into account in the appraisal of reasonable value required by 38 U.S.C. chapter 37.
(c) The following limitations on the quantum or quality of the estate or property shall be deemed for the purposes of paragraph (b) of this section to have been taken into account in the appraisal of residential property and determined by the Secretary as not materially affecting the reasonable value of such property:

§ 36.4356
Tax, special assessment and other liens.
Tax liens, special assessment liens, and ground rents shall be disregarded with respect to any requirement that loans shall be secured by a lien of specified dignity. With the prior approval of the Secretary, Under Secretary for Benefits, or Executive Director, Loan Guaranty Service, liens retained by nongovernmental entities to secure assessments or charges for municipal type services and facilities clearly within the public purpose doctrine may be disregarded. In determining whether a loan for the purchase or construction of a home is secured by a first lien the Secretary may also disregard a superior lien created by a duly recorded covenant running with the realty in favor of a private entity to secure an obligation to such entity for the homeowner's share of the costs of the management, operation, or maintenance of property, services or programs within and for the benefit of the development or community in which the veteran's realty is located, if the Secretary determines that the interests of the veteran-borrower and of the Government will not be prejudiced by the operation of such covenant. In respect to any such superior lien to be created after June 6, 1969, the Secretary's determination must have been made prior to the recordation of the covenant.

Supplemental loans.
(a) Any loan for the alteration, repair, improvement, extension, replacement, or expansion of a home, with respect to which a guaranteed or insured obligation of the borrower is currently outstanding, may be reported for guaranty or insurance coverage, if such loan is made by the holder of the currently outstanding obligation, notwithstanding the fact no guaranty entitlement remains available to the borrower;
Provided
, that if no entitlement remains available the maximum amount payable on the revised guaranty shall not exceed the amount payable on the original guaranty on the date of closing the supplemental loan, and the percentage of guaranty shall be based upon the proportion the said maximum amount bears to the aggregate indebtedness, or, in the case of an insured loan, no additional credit to the holder's insurance account may be made:
Provided
further, that the prior approval of the Secretary shall be required if:
(1) The loan will be made by a lender who is not the holder of the currently guaranteed or insured obligation; or
(2) The loan will be made by a lender not of a class specified in 38 U.S.C. 3702(d); or
(3) An obligor liable on the currently outstanding obligation will be released from personal liability.
(b) In any case in which the unpaid balance of the prior loan currently outstanding is combined or consolidated with the amount of the supplemental loan, the entire aggregate indebtedness shall be repayable in full within the maximum maturity currently prescribed by statute for the original loan. No supplemental loan for the repair, alteration, or improvement of residential property will be eligible for guaranty or insurance unless such repair, alteration, or improvement substantially protects or improves the basic livability or utility of the property involved.
(c) Such loans shall be secured as required in § 36.4355:
Provided
, that a lien of lesser dignity than therein specified will suffice if the lien obtained is immediately junior to the lien of the original guaranteed or insured obligation:
Provided further
, that the liens of successive supplemental loans may be of lesser dignity so long as they are immediately junior to the lien of the last previous guaranteed or insured obligation having a lien of required dignity.
(d) Upon providing or extending guaranty or insurance coverage in respect to any such supplemental loan, the rights of the Secretary to the proceeds of the sale of security shall be subordinate to the right of the holder to satisfy therefrom the indebtedness outstanding on the original and supplemental loans.

Under the applicable provisions of the declaration or such other legally enforceable and binding document, the development of the required portion of the condominium must be consistent with the overall plan, except that the declarant may reserve the right to change the overall plan or decide not to construct planned units or improvements to the common elements if the declaration sets forth the conditions required to be satisfied prior to the exercise of that right the time within which the right may be exercised, and any other limitations and criteria that would be necessary or appropriate under the particular circumstances. Such conditions, time restraints and other limitations must be reasonable in light of the overall plan for the condominium. In an expandable project, additional phases which are not required to be built may be described in the development plan in very general terms, or the declaration may provide that the declarant makes no assurances concerning the construction, building types, architectural style and size of the units, etc. of these phases. However, the minimum number of units to be built should be that which would be adequate to reasonably support the common elements. (See § 36.4364(a)(6).)

A provision may be made in the declaration or bylaws for allocation of responsibility for damages resulting from the exercise of any of the above rights.
(4)
Assessments
—(i)
Levy and collection.
The declaration or its equivalent shall describe the authority of the owners' association to levy and enforce the collection of general and special assessments for common expenses and shall describe adequate remedies for failure to pay such common expenses. The common expenses assessed against any unit, with interest, late charges, costs and a reasonable attorney's fee shall be a lien upon such unit in accordance with applicable law. Each such assessment, together with interest, late charges, costs, and attorney's fee, shall also be the personal obligation of the person who was the owner of such unit at the time the assessment fell due. The personal obligation for delinquent assessments shall not pass to successors in title or interest unless assumed by them, or required by applicable law. Common expenses as used in this subdivision shall mean expenditures made or liabilities incurred by or on behalf of the owners' association, together with any assessments for the creation and maintenance of reserves.

Voting rights.
The declaration or equivalent document shall allocate a portion of the votes in the association to each unit. Such portion may be allocated equally to each unit, may be proportionate to that unit's common expense liability, common element interest, relative size or value, or may be allocated according to any other specified criteria provided that the method is equitable and reasonable for that condominium. The declaration may provide different criteria for allocations of votes to the units on particular specified matters and may also provide different percentages of required unit owner approvals for such particular specified matters.
(3)
Ingress and egress of unit owners.
There may not be any restriction upon any unit owner's right of ingress and egress to his or her unit.

Easements for encroachments.
In the event any portion of the common elements encroaches upon any unit or any unit encroaches upon the common elements or another unit as a result of the construction, reconstruction, repair, shifting, settlement, or movement of any portion of the improvements, a valid easement for the encroachment and for the maintenance of the same shall exist so long as the encroachment exists. The declaration may provide, however, reasonable limits on the extent of any easement created by the overlap of units, common elements, and limited common elements resulting from such encroachments; or
(ii)
Monuments as boundaries.
If permitted by the governing law within the jurisdiction where the project is located, the existing physical boundaries of a unit or a common element or the physical boundaries of a unit or a common element reconstructed in substantial accordance with the original plats and plans thereof become its boundaries rather than the metes and bounds expressed in the deed, plat or plan, regardless of settling or lateral movement of the building, or minor variance between boundaries shown on the plats, plans or in the deed and those of the building. The declaration should provide reasonable limits on the extent of any such revised boundary(ies) created by the overlap of units, common elements, and limited common elements resulting from such encroachments.
(5)
Right of first refusal.
The right of a unit owner to sell, transfer, or otherwise convey his or her unit in a condominium shall not be subject to any right of first refusal or similar restriction if the declaration or similar document is recorded on or after December 1, 1976. If the declaration was recorded prior to December 1, 1976, the right of first refusal must comply with § 36.4354(b)(5)(ii); Provided, however, restrictions on the basis of age or restrictions established by a State, Territorial, or local government agency as part of a program for providing assistance to low- and moderate-income purchasers shall be governed by § 36.4354(b)(5)(iv).
(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3703(c))
(6)
Leasing restrictions.
Except as provided in this paragraph, there shall be no prohibition or restriction on a condominium unit owner's right to lease his or her unit. The following restrictions are acceptable:
(i) A requirement that leases have a minimum initial term of up to 1 year; or
(ii) Age restrictions or restrictions imposed by State or local housing authorities which are allowable under § 36.4309(e) or § 36.4354(b)(5)(iv).
(d)
Rights of action.
The owners' association and any aggrieved unit owner should be granted a right of action against unit owners for failure to comply with the provisions of the declaration, bylaws, or equivalent documents, or with decisions of the owners' association which are made pursuant to authority granted the owners' association in such documents. Unit owners should have similar rights of action against the owners' association.

§ 36.4363
Miscellaneous legal requirements.
(a)
Declarant transfer of control of owners' association
—(1)
Standards for transfer of control.
The declarant shall relinquish all special rights, expressed or implied, through which the declarant may directly or indirectly control, direct, modify, or veto any action of the owners' association, its executive board, or a majority of unit owners, and control of the owners' association shall pass to the owners of units within the project, not later than the earlier of the following:
(i) 120 days after the date by which 75 percent of the units have been conveyed to unit purchasers,
(ii) The last date of a specified period of time following the first conveyance to a unit purchaser; such period of time is to be reasonable for the particular project. The maximum acceptable period usually will be from 3 to 5 years for single-phased condominium regimes and 5 to 7 years for expandable condominiums, or
(iii) On a case basis, modifications or variations of the requirements of paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section will be acceptable, particularly in circumstances involving very large condominium developments.
(2)
Declarant's unit votes after transfer of control.
The requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall not affect the declarant's rights, as a unit owner, to exercise the votes allocated to units which the declarant owns.
(3)
Unit owners' participation in management.
Declarant should provide for and foster early participation of unit owners in the management of the project.
(b)
Taxes.
Unless otherwise provided by State law, real estate taxes must be assessed and be lienable only against the individual units, together with their undivided interests in the common elements, and not against the multifamily structure. The owners' association usually owns no real estate, so it has no obligation concerning ad valorem taxes. Unless taxes are assessed only against the individual units, a tax lien could amount to more than the value of any particular unit in the structure.
(c) [Reserved]
(d)
Policies for bylaws.
The bylaws of the condominium should be sufficiently detailed for the successful governance of the condominium by unit owners. Among other things, such documents should contain adequate provisions for the election and removal of directors and officers.
(e)
Insurance and related requirements
—(1)
Insurance.
The holder shall require hazard and flood insurance policies to be procured and maintained in accordance with § 36.4329. Because of the nature of condominiums, additional types of insurance coverages—such as tort liability insurance for injuries sustained on the premises, personal liability insurance for directors and officers managing association affairs, boiler insurance, etc.—should be considered in appropriate circumstances.
(2)
Fidelity bond coverage.
The securing of appropriate fidelity bond coverage is recommended but not required, for any person or entity handling funds of the owners' association, including, but not limited to, employees of the professional managers. Such fidelity bonds should name the association as an obligee, and be written in an amount equal to at least the estimated maximum of funds, including reserve funds, in the custody of the owners' association or the management agent at any given time during the term of the fidelity bond. However, the bond should not be less than a sum equal to 3 months' aggregate assessments on all units plus reserve funds.

§ 36.4364
Documentation and related requirements—flexible condominiums and condominiums with offsite facilities.
(a)
Expandable condominiums.
The following policies apply to condominium regimes which may be increased in size by the declarant:
(1) The declarant's right to expand the regime must be fully described in the declaration. The declaration must contain provisions adequate to ensure that future improvements to the condominium will be consistent with initial improvements in terms of quality of construction. The declarant must build each phase in accordance with an approved general plan for the total development (§ 36.4361(d)(2)) supported by detailed plats and plans of each phase prior to the construction of the particular phase.
(2) The reservation of a right to expand the condominium regime, the method of expansion and the result of an expansion must not affect the statutory validity of the condominium regime or the validity of title to the units.
(3) The declaration or equivalent document must contain a covenant that the condominium regime may not be amended or merged with a successor condominium regime without prior written approval of the Secretary. The declarant may have the proposed legal documentation to accomplish the merger reviewed prior to recordation. However, the Secretary's final approval of the merger will not be granted until the successor condominium has been
legally established and construction completed. The declarant may add phases to an expandable condominium regime without the prior approval of the Secretary if the phasing implements a previously approved general plan for the total development. A copy of the amendment to the declaration or other annexation document which adds each phase must be submitted to the Secretary in accordance with § 36.4365(b)(6).
(4) Liens arising in connection with the declarant's ownership of, and construction of improvements upon, the property to be added must not adversely affect the rights of existing unit owners, or the priority of first mortgages on units in the existing condominium property. All taxes, assessments, mechanic's liens, and other charges affecting such property, covering any period prior to the addition of the property, must be paid or otherwise satisfactorily provided for by the declarant.
(5) The declarant must purchase (at declarant's own expense) a general liability insurance policy in an amount not less than $1 million for each occurrence, to cover any liability which owners of previously sold units are exposed to as a result of further condominium project development.
(6) Each expandable project shall have a specified maximum number of units which will give each unit owner a minimum percentage of interest in the common elements. Each project shall also have a specified minimum number of units which will give each unit owner a maximum percentage of interest in the common elements. The minimum number of units to be built should be that which would be adequate to reasonably support the common elements. The maximum number of units to be built should be that which would not overload the capacity of the common facilities. The maximum possible percentage(s) and the minimum possible percentage(s) of undivided interest in the common elements for each type of unit must be stated in the declaration or equivalent document.
(7) The declaration or equivalent document shall set forth clearly the basis for reallocation of unit owner's ownership interests, common expense liabilities and voting rights in the event the number of units in the condominium is increased. Such reallocation shall be according to the applicable criteria set forth in §§ 36.4361(b) and 36.4362(c)(1) and (2).
(8) The declarant's right to expand the condominium must be for a reasonable period of time with a specific ending date. The maximum acceptable period will usually be from 5 to 7 years after the date of recording the declaration. On a case basic, longer periods of expansion rights will be acceptable, particularly in circumstances involving sizable condominium developments.
(b)
Series projects.
(1) Each phase in the series approach is to be considered as a separate project. A separate set of legal documents must be filed for each phase or project that relates to the condominium within its own boundary. The declaration for each phase must describe the particular project as a part of the whole development area, but subject only the one phase to the condominium regime. A separate unit ratio must be established that would relate each unit to all units of the particular condominium for purposes of ownership in the common areas, voting rights and assessment liability. A separate association may be created to govern the affairs of each condominium. Each phase is subject to a separate presale requirement.
(2) In the case of proposed projects, or projects under construction, the declaration should state the number of total units that the developer intends to build on other sections of the development area.
(c)
Other flexible condominiums.
Condominiums containing withdrawable real estate (contractable condominiums) and condominiums containing convertible real estate (portions of the condominium within which additional units or limited common elements, or both, may be created) will be considered acceptable provided the flexible
condominium complies with the § 36.4300 series.

§ 36.4365
Appraisal requirements.
(a)
Existing resale condominiums.
Upon acceptance by the local office of the organizational documents, the project and unit(s) proposed as security for guaranteed financing shall be appraised to ensure that they meet MPRs (Minimum Property Requirements) and are safe, sanitary, and structurally sound. The Department of Veterans Affairs MPRs for existing construction apply to all existing resale condominiums including conversions, except that water, heating, ventilating, air conditioning and sewer service may be supplied from a central source.
