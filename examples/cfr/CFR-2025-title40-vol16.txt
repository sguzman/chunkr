refers to title 40, part 63, section 8980.

# Explanation
The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.
Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:
Title 1 through Title 16
as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27
as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41
as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50
as of October 1
The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.

# LEGAL STATUS
The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

# HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS
The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, July 1, 2025), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

# EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES
Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.

# OMB CONTROL NUMBERS
The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request.
Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.

# PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE
Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.

# “[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY
The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not dropped in error.

# INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE
What is incorporation by reference?
Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.
What is a proper incorporation by reference?
The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:
(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.
(b) The matter incorporated is adequately summarized in the preamble of the final rule and is available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.
(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?
If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or email fr.inspection@nara.gov.

# CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES
A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR
Index and Finding Aids.
This volume contains the Parallel Table of Authorities and Rules. A list of CFR titles, chapters, subchapters, and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in this volume.
An index to the text of “Title 3—The President” is carried within that volume.
The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. This index is based on a consolidation of the “Contents” entries in the daily Federal Register.
A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

# REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL
There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing in the Code of Federal Regulations.

# INQUIRIES
For a legal interpretation or explanation of any regulation in this volume, contact the issuing agency. The issuing agency's name appears at the top of odd-numbered pages.

§ 63.8980
What is the purpose of this subpart?
This subpart establishes national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants (NESHAP) and work practice standards for hazardous air pollutants (HAP) emitted from hydrochloric acid (HCl) production. This subpart also establishes requirements to demonstrate initial and continuous compliance with the emission limitations and work practice standards.
§ 63.8985
Am I subject to this subpart?
(a) You are subject to this subpart if you own or operate an HCl production facility that produces a liquid HCl product at a concentration of 30 weight percent or greater during its normal operations and is located at, or is part of, a major source of HAP. This does not include HCl production facilities that only produce occasionally liquid HCl product at a concentration of 30 weight percent or greater.
(1) An HCl production facility is the collection of unit operations and equipment associated with the production of liquid HCl product. The HCl production facility begins at the point where a gaseous stream containing HCl enters the HCl production unit. The HCl production facility includes all HCl storage tanks that contain liquid HCl product that is produced in the HCl production unit, with the exceptions noted in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. The HCl production facility also includes all HCl transfer operations that load
HCl product produced in the HCl production unit into a tank truck, rail car, ship, or barge, along with the piping and other equipment in HCl service used to transfer liquid HCl product from the HCl production unit to the HCl storage tanks and/or HCl transfer operations. The HCl production facility ends at the point that the liquid HCl product produced in the HCl production unit is loaded into a tank truck, rail car, ship, or barge, at the point the HCl product enters another process on the plant site, or at the point the HCl product leaves the plant site via pipeline.
(2) Storage tanks that are dedicated feedstock tanks for another process and storage tanks that store HCl dedicated for use in wastewater treatment are not considered part of an HCl production facility.
(3) A major source of HAP emissions is any stationary source or group of stationary sources within a contiguous area under common control that emits or has the potential to emit any single HAP at a rate of 9.07 megagrams (10 tons) or more per year or any combination of HAP at a rate of 22.68 megagrams (25 tons) or more per year.
(b) An HCl production facility is not subject to this subpart if it is also subject to NESHAP under one of the subparts listed in paragraphs (b)(1) through (5) of this section.
(1) 40 CFR part 63, subpart S, National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants from the Pulp and Paper Industry.
(2) 40 CFR part 63, subpart CCC, National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for Steel Pickling—HCl Process Facilities and Hydrochloric Acid Regeneration Plants.

(5) 40 CFR part 63, subpart GGG, National Emission Standards for Pharmaceuticals Production.
(c) An HCl production facility is not subject to this subpart if it is located following the incineration of chlorinated waste gas streams, waste liquids, or solid wastes, and the emissions from the HCl production facility are subject to section 63.113(c), subpart G, National Emission Standards for Organic Hazardous Air Pollutants from the Synthetic Organic Chemical Manufacturing Industry for Process Vents, Storage Vessels, Transfer Operations, and Wastewater.
(d) An HCl production facility is not subject to this subpart if it produces HCl through the direct synthesis of hydrogen and chlorine and is part of a chlor-alkali facility.
(e) An HCl production facility is not subject to this subpart if it is a research and development facility.
(f) An HCl production facility is not subject to this subpart if all of the gaseous streams containing HCl and chlorine (Cl
2
) from HCl process vents, HCl storage tanks, and HCl transfer operations are recycled or routed to another process for process purpose, prior to being discharged to the atmosphere.
[68 FR 19090, Apr. 17, 2003, as amended at 71 FR 17745, Apr. 7, 2006; 85 FR 20867, Apr. 15, 2020]
§ 63.8990
What parts of my plant does this subpart cover?
(a) This subpart applies to each new, reconstructed, or existing affected source at an HCl production facility.
(b) The affected source is the group of one or more HCl production facilities at a plant site that are subject to this subpart, and all associated wastewater operations, which contain the collection of emission streams listed in paragraphs (b)(1) through (5) of this section.

# Subpart PPPPP—National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for Engine Test Cells/Stands

# Source:
68 FR 28785, May 27, 2003, unless otherwise noted.

# What This Subpart Covers
§ 63.9280
What is the purpose of subpart PPPPP?
This subpart PPPPP establishes national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants (NESHAP) for engine test cells/stands located at major sources of hazardous air pollutants (HAP) emissions. This subpart also establishes requirements to demonstrate initial and continuous compliance with the emission limitations contained in this NESHAP.
§ 63.9285
Am I subject to this subpart?
You are subject to this subpart if you own or operate an engine test cell/stand that is located at a major source of HAP emissions.
(a) An engine test cell/stand is any apparatus used for testing uninstalled stationary or uninstalled mobile (motive) engines.
(b) An uninstalled engine is an engine that is not installed in, or an integrated part of, the final product.
(c) A major source of HAP emissions is a plant site that emits or has the potential to emit any single HAP at a rate of 10 tons (9.07 megagrams) or more per year or any combination of HAP at a rate of 25 tons (22.68 megagrams) or more per year.
§ 63.9290
What parts of my plant does this subpart cover?
This subpart applies to each new, reconstructed, or existing affected source.
(a)
Affected source.
An affected source is the collection of all equipment and activities associated with engine test cells/stands used for testing uninstalled stationary or uninstalled mobile (motive) engines located at a major source of HAP emissions.
(1)
Existing affected source.
An affected source is existing if you commenced construction or reconstruction of the affected source on or before May 14, 2002. A change in ownership of an existing affected source does not make that affected source a new or reconstructed affected source.
(2)
New affected source.
An affected source is new if you commenced construction of the affected source after May 14, 2002.
(3)
Reconstructed affected source.
An affected source is reconstructed if you meet the definition of reconstruction in § 63.2 of subpart A of this part and reconstruction is commenced after May 14, 2002. Changes made to an existing affected source primarily for the purpose of complying with revisions to engine testing requirements under 40 CFR parts 80, 86, 89, 90, 91, or 92 are not considered a modification or reconstruction. In addition, passive measurement and control instrumentation and electronics are not included as part of any affected source reconstruction evaluation.
(b) Existing affected sources do not have to meet the requirements of this subpart and of subpart A of this part.
(c) Any portion of a new or reconstructed affected source located at a major source that is used exclusively for testing internal combustion engines with rated power of less than 25 horsepower (hp) (19 kilowatts(kW)) does not have to meet the requirements of this subpart and of subpart A of this part except for the initial notification requirements of § 63.9345(b).
(d) Any portion of a new or reconstructed affected source located at a major source that meets any of the criteria specified in paragraphs (d)(1) through (4) of this section does not have to meet the requirements of this subpart and of subpart A of this part.
(1) Any portion of the affected source used exclusively for testing combustion turbine engines.
(2) Any portion of the affected source used exclusively for testing rocket engines.
(3) Any portion of the affected source used in research and teaching activities at facilities that are not engaged
in the development of engines or engine test services for commercial purposes.
(4) Any portion of the affected source operated to test or evaluate fuels (such as knock engines), transmissions, or electronics.
§ 63.9295
When do I have to comply with this subpart?
(a)
Affected sources.
(1) If you start up your new or reconstructed affected source before May 27, 2003, you must comply with the emission limitations in this subpart no later than May 27, 2003; except that the compliance date for the requirements promulgated at §§ 63.9295, 63.9305, 63.9340, 63.9350, 63.9355, 63.9375, and Table 7 of 40 CFR part 63, subpart PPPPP, revised on June 3, 2020 is December 1, 2020.
(2) If you start up your new or reconstructed affected source on or after May 27, 2003, you must comply with the emission limitations in this subpart upon startup; except that if the initial startup of your new or reconstructed affected source occurs after May 27, 2003, but on or before May 8, 2019, the compliance date for the requirements promulgated at §§ 63.9295, 63.9305, 63.9340, 63.9350, 63.9355, 63.9375, and Table 7 of this subpart as revised on June 3, 2020 is December 1, 2020.

(b)
Area sources that become major sources.
If your new or reconstructed affected source is located at an area source that increases its emissions or its potential to emit such that it becomes a major source of HAP, your new or reconstructed affected source must be in compliance with this subpart when the area source becomes a major source.
(c) You must meet the notification requirements in § 63.9345 and in 40 CFR part 63, subpart A.
[68 FR 28785, May 27, 2003, as amended at 85 FR 34345, June 3, 2020]

# Emission Limitations
§ 63.9300
What emission limitations must I meet?
For each new or reconstructed affected source that is used in whole or in part for testing internal combustion engines with rated power of 25 hp (19 kW) or more and that is located at a major source, you must comply with the emission limitations in Table 1 to this subpart. (Tables are found at the end of this subpart.)
§ 63.9301
What are my options for meeting the emission limits?
You may use either a continuous parameter monitoring system (CPMS) or a continuous emission monitoring system (CEMS) to demonstrate compliance with the emission limitations. Continuous monitoring systems must meet the requirements in § 63.9306 (CPMS) and § 63.9307 (CEMS).
§ 63.9302
What operating limits must I meet?
(a) For any new or reconstructed affected source on which you use add-on controls, you must meet the operating limits specified in Table 2 to this subpart. These operating limits must be established during the performance test according to the requirements in § 63.9324. You must meet the operating limits at all times after you establish them.
(b) If you use an add-on control device other than those listed in Table 2 to this subpart, or wish to monitor an alternative parameter and comply with a different operating limit, you must apply to the Administrator for approval of alternative monitoring under § 63.8(f).

# General Compliane Requirements
§ 63.9305
What are my general requirements for complying with this subpart?
(a) Prior to December 1, 2020, you must be in compliance with the emission limitation that applies to you at all times, except during periods of startup, shutdown, or malfunction (SSM) of your control device or associated monitoring equipment. On and after December 1, 2020, you must be in
compliance with the applicable emission limitation at all times.
(b) If you must comply with the emission limitation, you must operate and maintain your engine test cell/stand, air pollution control equipment, and monitoring equipment in a manner consistent with safety and good air pollution control practices for minimizing emissions at all times. The general duty to minimize emissions does not require the owner or operator to make any further efforts to reduce emissions if levels required by the applicable standard have been achieved. Determination of whether a source is operating in compliance with operation and maintenance requirements will be based on information available to the Administrator that may include, but is not limited to, monitoring results, review of operation and maintenance procedures, review of operation and maintenance records, and inspection of the affected source.
(c) For affected sources prior to December 1, 2020, you must develop a written SSM plan (SSMP) for emission control devices and associated monitoring equipment according to the provisions in § 63.6(e)(3). The plan will apply only to emission control devices, and not to engine test cells/stands.
[85 FR 34345, June 3, 2020]
§ 63.9306
What are my continuous parameter monitoring system (CPMS) installation, operation, and maintenance requirements?
(a)
General.
You must install, operate, and maintain each CPMS specified in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section according to paragraphs (a)(1) through (7) of this section. You must install, operate, and maintain each CPMS specified in paragraph (b) of this section according to paragraphs (a)(3) through (5) of this section.
(1) The CPMS must complete a minimum of one cycle of operation for each successive 15-minute period. You must have a minimum of four equally spaced successive cycles of CPMS operation in 1 hour.
(2) You must determine the average of all recorded readings for each successive 3-hour period of the emission capture system and add-on control device operation.
(3) You must record the results of each inspection, calibration, and validation check of the CPMS.
(4) You must maintain the CPMS at all times and have available necessary parts for routine repairs of the monitoring equipment.
(5) You must operate the CPMS and collect emission capture system and add-on control device parameter data at all times that an engine test cell/stand is operating, except during monitoring malfunctions, associated repairs, and required quality assurance or control activities (including, if applicable, calibration checks and required zero and span adjustments).
(6) You must not use emission capture system or add-on control device parameter data recorded during monitoring malfunctions, associated repairs, out-of-control periods, or required quality assurance or control activities when calculating data averages. You must use all the data collected during all other periods in calculating the data averages for determining compliance with the emission capture system and add-on control device operating limits.
(7) A monitoring malfunction is any sudden, infrequent, not reasonably preventable failure of the CPMS to provide valid data. Monitoring failures that are caused in part by poor maintenance or careless operation are not malfunctions. Any period for which the monitoring system is out-of-control and data are not available for required calculations is a deviation from the monitoring requirements.
(b)
Capture system bypass line.
You must meet the requirements of paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section for each emission capture system that contains bypass lines that could divert emissions away from the add-on control device to the atmosphere.
(1) You must monitor or secure the valve or closure mechanism controlling the bypass line in a nondiverting position in such a way that the valve or closure mechanism cannot be opened without creating a record that the valve was opened. The method used to monitor or secure the valve or closure mechanism must meet one of the requirements specified in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section.
(i)
Flow control position indicator.
Install, calibrate, maintain, and operate according to the manufacturer's specifications a flow control position indicator that takes a reading at least once every 15 minutes and provides a record indicating whether the emissions are directed to the add-on control device or diverted from the add-on control device. The time of occurrence and flow control position must be recorded, as well as every time the flow direction is changed. The flow control position indicator must be installed at the entrance to any bypass line that could divert the emissions away from the add-on control device to the atmosphere.
(ii)
Car-seal or lock-and-key valve closures.
Secure any bypass line valve in the closed position with a car-seal or a lock-and-key type configuration. You must visually inspect the seal or closure mechanism at least once every month to ensure that the valve is maintained in the closed position, and the emissions are not diverted away from the add-on control device to the atmosphere.
(iii)
Valve closure monitoring.
Ensure that any bypass line valve is in the closed (nondiverting) position through monitoring of valve position at least once every 15 minutes. You must inspect the monitoring system at least once every month to verify that the monitor will indicate valve position.
(iv)
Automatic shutdown system.
Use an automatic shutdown system in which the engine testing operation is stopped when flow is diverted by the bypass line away from the add-on control device to the atmosphere when an engine test cell/stand is operating. You must inspect the automatic shutdown system at least once every month to verify that it will detect diversions of flow and shut down the engine test cell/stand in operation.
(2) If any bypass line is opened, you must include a description of why the bypass line was opened and the length of time it remained open in the semiannual compliance reports required in § 63.9350.
(c)
Thermal oxidizers and catalytic oxidizers.
If you are using a thermal oxidizer or catalytic oxidizer as an add-on control device, you must comply with the requirements in paragraphs (c)(1) through (3) of this section.
(1) For a thermal oxidizer, install a gas temperature monitor in the firebox of the thermal oxidizer or in the duct immediately downstream of the firebox before any substantial heat exchange occurs.
(2) For a catalytic oxidizer, you must install a gas temperature monitor in the gas stream immediately before the catalyst bed, and if you established operating limits according to § 63.9324(b)(1) and (2), also install a gas temperature monitor in the gas stream immediately after the catalyst bed.
(i) If you establish operating limits according to § 63.9324(b)(1) and (2), then you must install the gas temperature monitors both upstream and downstream of the catalyst bed. The temperature monitors must be in the gas stream immediately before and after the catalyst bed to measure the temperature difference across the bed.
(ii) If you establish operating limits according to § 63.9324(b)(3) and (4), then you must install a gas temperature monitor upstream of the catalyst bed. The temperature monitor must be in the gas stream immediately before the catalyst bed to measure the temperature.
(3) For all thermal oxidizers and catalytic oxidizers, you must meet the requirements in paragraphs (a) and (c)(3)(i) through (vii) of this section for each gas temperature monitoring device.
(i) Locate the temperature sensor in a position that provides a representative temperature.
(ii) Use a temperature sensor with a measurement sensitivity of 4 degrees Fahrenheit or 0.75 percent of the temperature value, whichever is larger.
(iii) Shield the temperature sensor system from electromagnetic interference and chemical contaminants.
(iv) If a gas temperature chart recorder is used, it must have a measurement sensitivity in the minor division of at least 20 degrees Fahrenheit.
(v) Perform an electronic calibration at least semiannually according to the procedures in the manufacturer's owner's manual. Following the electronic calibration, you must conduct a temperature sensor validation check in
which a second or redundant temperature sensor placed near the process temperature sensor must yield a reading within 30 degrees Fahrenheit of the process temperature sensor reading.
(vi) Conduct calibration and validation checks anytime the sensor exceeds the manufacturer's specified maximum operating temperature range or install a new temperature sensor.
(vii) At least monthly, inspect components for integrity and electrical connections for continuity, oxidation, and galvanic corrosion.
(d) Emission capture systems. The capture system monitoring system must comply with the applicable requirements in paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section.
(1) For each flow measurement device, you must meet the requirements in paragraphs (a) and (d)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section.
(i) Locate a flow sensor in a position that provides a representative flow measurement in the duct from each capture device in the emission capture system to the add-on control device.
(ii) Reduce swirling flow or abnormal velocity distributions due to upstream and downstream disturbances.

§ 63.9307
What are my continuous emissions monitoring system installation, operation, and maintenance requirements?
(a) You must install, operate, and maintain each CEMS to monitor carbon monoxide (CO) or total hydrocarbons (THC) and oxygen (O
2
) at the outlet of the exhaust system of the engine test cell/stand or at the outlet of the emission control device.
(b) To comply with the CO or THC percent reduction emission limitation, you may install, operate, and maintain a CEMS to monitor CO or THC and O
2
at both the inlet and the outlet of the emission control device.
(c) To comply with either emission limitations, the CEMS must be installed and operated according to the requirements described in paragraphs (c)(1) through (4) of this section.
(1) You must install, operate, and maintain each CEMS according to the applicable Performance Specification (PS) of 40 CFR part 60, appendix B (PS- 3, PS-4A, or PS-8).
(2) You must conduct a performance evaluation of each CEMS according to the requirements in 40 CFR 63.8 and according to PS-3 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix B, using Reference Method 3A or 3B for the O
2
CEMS, and according to PS-4A of 40 CFR part 60, appendix B, using Reference Method 10 or 10B for the CO CEMS, and according to PS-8 of CFR part 60, appendix B, using Reference Method 25A for the THC CEMS. If the fuel used in the engines being tested is natural gas, you may use ASTM D 6522-00, Standard Test Method for Determination of Nitrogen Oxides, Carbon Monoxide and Oxygen Concentrations in Emissions from Natural Gas Fired Reciprocating Engines, Combustion Turbines, Boilers, and Process Heaters Using Portable Analyzers (incorporated by reference, see § 63.14). As an alternative to Method 3B, you may use ANSI/ASME PTC 19.10-1981, “Flue
and Exhaust Gas Analyses [Part 10, Instruments and Apparatus],” (incorporated by reference, see § 63.14).
(3) As specified in § 63.8(c)(4)(ii), each CEMS must complete a minimum of one cycle of operation (sampling, analyzing, and data recording) for each successive 15-minute period. You must have at least two data points, each representing a different 15-minute period within the same hour, to have a valid hour of data.
(4) All CEMS data must be reduced as specified in § 63.8(g)(2) and recorded as CO or THC as carbon concentration in parts per million by volume, dry basis (ppmvd), corrected to 15 percent O
2
content.
(d) If you have CEMS that are subject to paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, you must properly maintain and operate the monitors continuously according to the requirements described in paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section.
(1)
Proper maintenance.
You must maintain the monitoring equipment at all times that the engine test cell/stand is operating, including but not limited to, maintaining necessary parts for routine repairs of the monitoring equipment.
(2)
Continued operation.
You must operate your CEMS according to paragraphs (d)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section.
(i) You must conduct all monitoring in continuous operation at all times that the engine test cell/stand is operating, except for, as applicable, monitoring malfunctions, associated repairs, and required quality assurance or control activities (including, as applicable, calibration drift checks and required zero and high-level adjustments). Quality assurance or control activities must be performed according to procedure 1 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix F.
(ii) Data recorded during monitoring malfunctions, associated repairs, out-of-control periods, and required quality assurance or control activities must not be used for purposes of calculating data averages. You must use all of the data collected from all other periods in assessing compliance. A monitoring malfunction is any sudden, infrequent, not reasonably preventable failure of the monitoring equipment to provide valid data. Monitoring failures that are caused in part by poor maintenance or careless operation are not malfunctions. Any period for which the monitoring system is out-of-control and data are not available for required calculations constitutes a deviation from the monitoring requirements.

§ 63.9321
What are the general requirements for performance tests?
(a) You must conduct each performance test required by § 63.9310 under the conditions in this section unless you obtain a waiver of the performance test according to the provisions in § 63.7(h). Prior to December 1, 2020, the performance test must also be conducted according to the requirements in § 63.7(e)(1).
(1)
Representative engine testing conditions.
You must conduct the performance test under representative operating conditions for the test cell/stand. Operations during periods of SSM, and during periods of nonoperation do not constitute representative conditions. You must record the process information that is necessary to document operating conditions during the test and explain why the conditions represent normal operation.
(2)
Representative emission capture system and add-on control device operating conditions.
You must conduct the performance test when the emission capture system and add-on control device are operating at a representative flow rate, and the add-on control device is operating at a representative inlet concentration. You must record information that is necessary to document emission capture system and add-on control device operating conditions during the test and explain why the conditions represent normal operation.
(b) You must conduct each performance test of an emission capture system according to the requirements in § 63.9322. You must conduct each performance test of an add-on control device according to the requirements in § 63.9323.
[68 FR 28785, May 27, 2003, as amended at 85 FR 34346, June 3, 2020]
§ 63.9322
How do I determine the emission capture system efficiency?
You must use the procedures and test methods in this section to determine capture efficiency as part of the performance test required by § 63.9310.
(a)
Assuming 100 percent capture efficiency.
You may assume the capture system efficiency is 100 percent if both conditions in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section are met:
(1) The capture system meets the criteria in method 204 of appendix M to 40 CFR part 51 for a permanent total enclosure (PE) and directs all the exhaust gases from the enclosure to an add-on control device.
(2) All engine test operations creating exhaust gases for which the test is applicable are conducted within the capture system.
(b)
Measuring capture efficiency.
If the capture system does not meet the criteria in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section, then you must use one of the two protocols described in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section to measure capture efficiency. The capture efficiency measurements use total volatile hydrocarbon (TVH) capture efficiency as a surrogate for organic HAP capture efficiency. For the protocol in paragraph (c) of this section, the capture efficiency measurement must consist of three test runs. Each test run must be at least 3 hours in duration or the length of a production run, whichever is longer, up to 8 hours. For the purposes of this test, a production run means the time required for a single engine test to go from the beginning to the end.
(c)
Gas-to-gas protocol using a temporary total enclosure or a building enclosure.
The gas-to-gas protocol compares the mass of TVH emissions captured by the emission capture system to the mass of TVH emissions not captured. Use a temporary total enclosure or a building enclosure and the procedures in paragraphs (c)(1) through (5) of this section to measure emission capture system efficiency using the gas-to-gas protocol.
(1) Either use a building enclosure or construct an enclosure around the engine test cell/stand and all areas where emissions from the engine testing subsequently occur. The enclosure must meet the applicable definition of a temporary total enclosure or building enclosure in Method 204 of appendix M to 40 CFR part 51.
(2) Use Method 204B or 204C of appendix M to 40 CFR part 51 to measure the total mass, kg, of TVH emissions captured by the emission capture system during each capture efficiency test run as measured at the inlet to the add-on control device. To make the measurement, substitute TVH for each occurrence of the term VOC in the methods.
(i) The sampling points for the Method 204B or 204C of appendix M to 40 CFR part 51 measurement must be upstream from the add-on control device and must represent total emissions routed from the capture system and entering the add-on control device.
(ii) If multiple emission streams from the capture system enter the add-on control device without a single common duct, then the emissions entering the add-on control device must be simultaneously measured in each duct, and the total emissions entering the add-on control device must be determined.
(3) Use Method 204D or 204E of appendix M to 40 CFR part 51 to measure the total mass, kg, of TVH emissions that are not captured by the emission capture system; they are measured as they exit the temporary total enclosure or building enclosure during each capture efficiency test run. To make the measurement, substitute TVH for each occurrence of the term VOC in the methods.
(i) Use Method 204D of appendix M to 40 CFR part 51 if the enclosure is a temporary total enclosure.
(ii) Use Method 204E of appendix M to 40 CFR part 51 if the enclosure is a building enclosure. During the capture efficiency measurement, all organic compound emitting operations inside the building enclosure, other than the engine test cell/stand operation for which capture efficiency is being determined, must be shut down, but all fans and blowers must be operating normally.
(4) For each capture efficiency test run, determine the percent capture efficiency of the emission capture system using Equation 1 of this section:
ER27MY03.004
Where:
CE = capture efficiency of the emission capture system vented to the add-on control device, percent
TVH
captured
= total mass of TVH captured by the emission capture system as measured at the inlet to the add-on control device during the emission capture efficiency test run, kg, determined according to paragraph (c)(2) of this section
TVH
uncaptured
= total mass of TVH that is not captured by the emission capture system and that exits from the temporary total enclosure or building enclosure during the capture efficiency test run, kg, determined according to paragraph (c)(3) of this section.
(5) Determine the capture efficiency the emission capture system as the average of the capture efficiencies measured in the three test runs.
(d)
Alternative capture efficiency protocol.
As an alternative to the procedure specified in paragraph (c) of this section, you may determine capture efficiency using any other capture efficiency protocol and test methods that satisfy the criteria of either the data quality objective or lower control limit approach as described in appendix A to subpart KK of this part.
[68 FR 28785, May 27, 2003, as amended at 88 FR 18415, Mar. 29, 2023]
§ 63.9323
How do I determine the add-on control device emission destruction or removal efficiency?
You must use the procedures and test methods in this section to determine the add-on control device emission destruction or removal efficiency as part of the performance test required by § 63.9310. You must conduct three test runs as specified in § 63.7(e)(3), and each test run must last at least 1 hour.
(a) For all types of add-on control devices, use the test methods specified in paragraphs (a)(1) through (5) of this section.
(1) Use Method 1 or 1A of appendix A to 40 CFR part 60, as appropriate, to select sampling sites and velocity traverse points.
(2) Use Method 2, 2A, 2C, 2D, 2F, or 2G of appendix A to 40 CFR part 60, as appropriate, to measure gas volumetric flow rate.
(3) Use Method 3, 3A, or 3B of appendix A to 40 CFR part 60, as appropriate, for gas analysis to determine dry molecular weight. The ANSI/ASME PTC 19.10-1981 Part 10 is an acceptable alternative to Method 3B (incorporated by reference, see § 63.14).
(4) Use Method 4 of appendix A to 40 CFR part 60, to determine stack gas moisture.
(5) Methods for determining gas volumetric flow rate, dry molecular weight, and stack gas moisture must be performed, as applicable, during each test run.
(b) Measure total gaseous organic mass emissions as carbon at the inlet and outlet of the add-on control device simultaneously, using either Method 25 or 25A of appendix A to 40 CFR part 60, as specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (3) of this section. You must use the same method for both the inlet and outlet measurements.
(1) Use Method 25 of appendix A to 40 CFR part 60 if the add-on control device is an oxidizer, and you expect the total gaseous organic concentration as carbon to be more than 50 parts per million at the control device outlet.
(2) Use Method 25A of appendix A to 40 CFR part 60 if the add-on control device is an oxidizer, and you expect the total gaseous organic concentration as carbon to be 50 ppm or less at the control device outlet.
(c) For each test run, determine the total gaseous organic emissions mass flow rates for the inlet and the outlet of the add-on control device, using Equation 1 of this section. If there is more than one inlet or outlet to the add-on control device, you must calculate the total gaseous organic mass flow rate using Equation 1 of this section for each inlet and each outlet and then total all of the inlet emissions and total all of the outlet emissions.
ER27MY03.005
Where:
M
f
= total gaseous organic emissions mass flow rate, kg/hour (kg/h)
C
c
= concentration of organic compounds as carbon in the vent gas, as determined by Method 25 or Method 25A, parts per million by volume (ppmv), dry basis
Q
sd
= volumetric flow rate of gases entering or exiting the add-on control device, as determined by Method 2, 2A, 2C, 2D, 2F, or 2G, dry standard cubic meters/hour (dscm/h)
0.0416 = conversion factor for molar volume, kg-moles per cubic meter (mol/m
3
) (@ 293 Kelvin [K] and 760 millimeters of mercury [mmHg]).
(d) For each test run, determine the add-on control device organic emissions destruction or removal efficiency, using Equation 2 of this section:
ER27MY03.006
Where:
DRE = organic emissions destruction or removal efficiency of the add-on control device, percent
M
fi
= total gaseous organic emissions mass flow rate at the inlet(s) to the add-on control device, using Equation 1 of this section, kg/h
M
fo
= total gaseous organic emissions mass flow rate at the outlet(s) of the add-on control device, using Equation 1 of this section, kg/h.
(e) Determine the emission destruction or removal efficiency of the add-on control device as the average of the efficiencies determined in the three test runs and calculated in Equation 2 of this section.
§ 63.9324
How do I establish the emission capture system and add-on control device operating limits during the performance test?
During the performance test required by § 63.9310, you must establish the operating limits required by § 63.9302 according to this section, unless you have received approval for alternative monitoring and operating limits under § 63.8(f) as specified in § 63.9302.
(a)
Thermal oxidizers.
If your add-on control device is a thermal oxidizer, establish the operating limits according to paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section.
(1) During the performance test, you must monitor and record the combustion temperature at least once every 15 minutes during each of the three test runs. You must monitor the temperature in the firebox of the thermal oxidizer or immediately downstream of the firebox before any substantial heat exchange occurs.
(2) Use the data collected during the performance test to calculate and record the average combustion temperature maintained during the performance test. This average combustion temperature is the minimum operating limit for your thermal oxidizer.
(b)
Catalytic oxidizers.
If your add-on control device is a catalytic oxidizer, establish the operating limits according to either paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) or paragraphs (b)(3) and (4) of this section.
(1) During the performance test, you must monitor and record the temperature just before the catalyst bed and the temperature difference across the catalyst bed at least once every 15 minutes during each of the three test runs.
(2) Use the data collected during the performance test to calculate and record the average temperature just before the catalyst bed and the average temperature difference across the catalyst bed maintained during the performance test. These are the minimum operating limits for your catalytic oxidizer.
(3) As an alternative to monitoring the temperature difference across the catalyst bed, you may monitor the temperature at the inlet to the catalyst bed and implement a site-specific inspection and maintenance plan for your catalytic oxidizer as specified in paragraph (b)(4) of this section. During the performance test, you must monitor and record the temperature just before the catalyst bed at least once every 15 minutes during each of the three test runs. Use the data collected during the performance test to calculate and record the average temperature just before the catalyst bed during the performance test. This is the minimum operating limit for your catalytic oxidizer.
(4) You must develop and implement an inspection and maintenance plan for your catalytic oxidizer(s) for which you elect to monitor according to paragraph (b)(3) of this section. The plan
must address, at a minimum, the elements specified in paragraphs (b)(4)(i) through (iii) of this section.
(i) Annual sampling and analysis of the catalyst activity (i.e., conversion efficiency) following the manufacturer's or catalyst supplier's recommended procedures.
(ii) Monthly inspection of the oxidizer system, including the burner assembly and fuel supply lines for problems and, as necessary, adjust the equipment to assure proper air-to-fuel mixtures.
(iii) Annual internal and monthly external visual inspection of the catalyst bed to check for channeling, abrasion, and settling. If problems are found, you must take corrective action consistent with the manufacturer's recommendation and conduct a new performance test to determine destruction efficiency according to § 63.9323.
(c)
Emission capture system.
For each capture device that is not part of a PTE that meets the criteria of § 63.9322(a), establish an operating limit for either the gas volumetric flow rate or duct static pressure, as specified in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section. The operating limit for a PTE is specified in Table 3 to this subpart.
(1) During the capture efficiency determination required by § 63.9310, you must monitor and record either the gas volumetric flow rate or the duct static pressure for each separate capture device in your emission capture system at least once every 15 minutes during each of the three test runs at a point in the duct between the capture device and the add-on control device inlet.
(2) Calculate and record the average gas volumetric flow rate or duct static pressure for the three test runs for each capture device. This average gas volumetric flow rate or duct static pressure is the minimum operating limit for that specific capture device.
§ 63.9330
How do I demonstrate initial compliance with the emission limitation?
(a) You must demonstrate initial compliance with the emission limitation that applies to you according to Table 4 to this subpart.
(b) You must submit the Notification of Compliance Status containing results of the initial compliance demonstration according to the requirements in § 63.9345(c).

§ 63.9490
What parts of my plant does this subpart cover?
(a) This subpart applies to each new, reconstructed, or existing affected source at your friction materials manufacturing facility.
(b) The affected source covered by this subpart is each new, reconstructed, or existing solvent mixer (as defined in § 63.9565) at your friction materials manufacturing facility.
(c) A solvent mixer at your friction materials manufacturing facility is new if you commence construction of the solvent mixer after October 18, 2002. An affected source is reconstructed if it meets the definition of
“reconstruction” in § 63.2, and reconstruction is commenced after October 18, 2002.
(d) A solvent mixer at your friction materials manufacturing facility is existing if it is not new or reconstructed.
§ 63.9495
When do I have to comply with this subpart?
(a) If you have an existing solvent mixer, you must comply with each of the requirements for existing sources no later than October 18, 2005, except as otherwise specified at this section and §§ 63.9505, 63.9530, 63.9540, 63.9545, and Table 1 to this subpart.
(b) If you have a new or reconstructed solvent mixer for which construction or reconstruction commenced after October 18, 2002, but before May 4, 2018, you must comply with the requirements for new and reconstructed sources upon initial startup, except as otherwise specified at this section and §§ 63.9505, 63.9530, 63.9540, 63.9545, and Table 1 to this subpart.
(c) If your friction materials manufacturing facility is an area source that increases its emissions or its potential to emit such that it becomes a (or part of a) major source of HAP emissions, then paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section apply.
(1) For any portion of the area source that becomes a new or reconstructed affected source, you must comply with the requirements for new and reconstructed sources upon startup or no later than October 18, 2002, whichever is later.
(2) For any portion of the area source that becomes an existing affected source, you must comply with the requirements for existing sources no later than 1 year after the area source becomes a major source or no later than October 18, 2005, whichever is later.
(d) You must meet the notification and schedule requirements in § 63.9535. Several of the notifications must be submitted before the compliance date for your affected source.
(e) Solvent mixers constructed or reconstructed after May 3, 2018, must be in compliance with this subpart at startup or by February 8, 2019, whichever is later.
[67 FR 64506, Oct. 18, 2002, as amended at 84 FR 2750, Feb. 8, 2019]

# Emission Limitations
§ 63.9500
What emission limitations must I meet?
(a) For each new, reconstructed, or existing large solvent mixer at your friction materials manufacturing facility, you must limit HAP solvent emissions to the atmosphere to no more than 30 percent of that which would otherwise be emitted in the absence of solvent recovery and/or solvent substitution, based on a 7-day block average.
(b) For each new, reconstructed, or existing small solvent mixer at your friction materials manufacturing facility, you must limit HAP solvent emissions to the atmosphere to no more than 15 percent of that which would otherwise be emitted in the absence of solvent recovery and/or solvent substitution, based on a 7-day block average.

# General Compliance Requirements
§ 63.9505
What are my general requirements for complying with this subpart?
(a) Before August 7, 2019, for each existing source and each new or reconstructed source for which construction or reconstruction commenced after October 18, 2002, but before May 4, 2018, you must be in compliance with the emission limitations in this subpart at all times, except during periods of startup, shutdown, or malfunction. On and after August 7, 2019, for each such source you must be in compliance with the emission limitations in this subpart at all times. For new and reconstructed sources for which construction or reconstruction commenced after May 3, 2018, you must be in compliance with the emissions limitations in this subpart at all times.
(b) Before August 7, 2019, for each existing source, and for each new or reconstructed source for which construction or reconstruction commenced after October 18, 2002, but before May 4, 2018, you must always operate and
maintain your affected source, including air pollution control and monitoring equipment, according to the provisions in § 63.6(e)(1)(i). On and after August 7, 2019 for each such source, and after February 8, 2019 for new and reconstructed sources for which construction or reconstruction commenced after May 3, 2018, at all times you must operate and maintain any affected source, including associated air pollution control equipment and monitoring equipment, in a manner consistent with safety and good air pollution control practices for minimizing emissions. The general duty to minimize emissions does not require you to make any further efforts to reduce emissions if levels required by the applicable standard have been achieved. Determination of whether a source is operating in compliance with operation and maintenance requirements will be based on information available to the Administrator which may include, but is not limited to, monitoring results, review of operation and maintenance procedures, review of operation and maintenance records, and inspection of the source.
(c) Before August 7, 2019, for each existing source, and for each new or reconstructed source for which construction commenced after October 18, 2002, but before May 4, 2018, you must develop a written startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan according to the provisions in § 63.6(e)(3). For each such source, a startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan is not required on and after August 7, 2019. No startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan is required for any new or reconstructed source for which construction or reconstruction commenced after May 3, 2018.
[84 FR 2750, Feb. 8, 2019]

# Initial Compliance Demonstration Requirements

(1) Record the date and time of each mix batch.
(2) Record the identity of each mix batch using a unique batch ID, as defined in § 63.9565.
(3) Measure and record the weight of HAP solvent loaded into the solvent mixer for each mix batch.
(4) Measure and record the weight of HAP solvent recovered for each mix batch.
(5) If you use a solvent recovery system, you must determine the percent of HAP solvent discharged to the atmosphere for each mix batch according to Equation 1 of this section as follows:
(Eq. 1)
ER18OC02.002
Where:
P
b
= Percent of HAP solvent discharged to the atmosphere for each mix batch, percent;
S
rec
= Weight of HAP solvent recovered for each mix batch, lb;
S
mix
= Weight of HAP solvent loaded into the solvent mixer for each mix batch, lb.
(6) If you use solvent substitution for a mix batch, you must record the use of a non-HAP material as a substitute for a HAP solvent for that mix batch and assign a value of 0 percent to the percent of HAP solvent discharged to the atmosphere for that mix batch (Pb).
(7) Determine the 7-day block average percent of HAP solvent discharged to the atmosphere according to Equation 2 of this section as follows:
ER18OC02.003
Where:
%P
7
= 7-day block average percent of HAP solvent discharged to the atmosphere, percent;
i = mix batch;
n = number of mix batches in 7-day block average.
(8) Have valid data for at least 90 percent of the mix batches over the 7-day averaging period.
(b) If you use a control technique other than a solvent recovery system and/or solvent substitution, you may apply to EPA for approval to use an alternative method of demonstrating compliance with the emission limitations for solvent mixers in § 63.9500(a) and (b), as provided in § 63.9570.
§ 63.9525
What are the installation, operation, and maintenance requirements for my weight measurement device?
(a) If you use a solvent recovery system, you must install, operate, and maintain a weight measurement device to measure the weight of HAP solvent loaded into the solvent mixer and the weight of HAP solvent recovered for each mix batch.
(b) For each weight measurement device required by this section, you must develop and submit for approval a site-specific monitoring plan that addresses the requirements of paragraphs (b)(1) through (6) of this section:
(1) Procedures for installing the weight measurement device;
(2) The minimum accuracy of the weight measurement device in pounds and as a percent of the average weight of solvent to be loaded into the solvent mixer;
(3) Site-specific procedures for how the measurements will be made;
(4) How the measurement data will be recorded, reduced, and stored;
(5) Procedures and acceptance criteria for calibration of the weight measurement device; and
(6) How the measurement device will be maintained, including a routine maintenance schedule and spare parts inventory list.
(c) The site-specific monitoring plan required in paragraph (b) of this section must include, at a minimum, the requirements of paragraphs (c)(1) through (3) of this section:
(1) The weight measurement device must have a minimum accuracy of ±0.05 kilograms (±0.1 pounds) or ±1 percent of the average weight of solvent to be loaded into the solvent mixer, whichever is greater.
(2) An initial multi-point calibration of the weight measurement device must be made using 5 points spanning the expected range of weight measurements before the weight measurement device can be used. The manufacturer's calibration results can be used to meet this requirement.
(3) Once per day, an accuracy audit must be made using a single Class F calibration weight that corresponds to 20 to 80 percent of the average weight of solvent to be loaded into the solvent mixer. If the weight measurement device cannot reproduce the value of the calibration weight within ±0.05 kilograms (0.1 pounds) or ±1 percent of the average weight of solvent to be loaded into the solvent mixer, whichever is
greater, the scale must be recalibrated before being used again. The recalibration must be performed with at least five Class F calibration weights spanning the expected range of weight measurements.
(d) You must operate and maintain the weight measurement device according to the site-specific monitoring plan.
(e) You must maintain records of all maintenance activities, calibrations, and calibration audits.

After January 25, 2021, for affected sources that commenced construction or reconstruction on or before September 25, 2019, and after July 28, 2020, or upon start-up, which ever date is later, for affected sources that commenced construction or reconstruction after September 25, 2019, at all times, you must always operate and maintain any affected source, including associated air pollution control equipment and monitoring equipment, in a manner consistent with safety and good air pollution control practices for minimizing emissions. The general duty to minimize emissions does not require the owner or operator to make any further efforts to reduce emissions if levels required by the applicable standard have been achieved. Determination of whether such operation and maintenance procedures are being used will be based on information available to the Administrator which may include, but is not limited to, monitoring results, review of operation and maintenance procedures, review of operation and maintenance records, and inspection of the source.
(b) You must prepare, and at all times, operate according to, a written
operation and maintenance plan for each control device applied to meet any particulate matter emission limit in table 1 to this subpart, mercury emission limit in table 2 to this subpart, hydrogen chloride and hydrogen fluoride emission limit in table 3 to this subpart, and to meet the requirement of each indurating furnace subject to good combustion practices (GCP). Each site-specific operation and maintenance plan must be submitted to the Administrator on or before the compliance date that is specified in § 63.9583 for your affected source. The plan you submit must explain why the chosen practices (
i.e.,
quantified objectives) are effective in performing corrective actions or GCP in minimizing the formation of formaldehyde (and other products of incomplete combustion). The Administrator will review the adequacy of the site-specific practices and objectives you will follow and the records you will keep to demonstrate compliance with your Plan. If the Administrator determines that any portion of your operation and maintenance plan is not adequate, we can reject those portions of the plan, and request that you provide additional information addressing the relevant issues. In the interim of this process, you will continue to follow your current site-specific practices and objectives, as submitted, until your revisions are accepted as adequate by the Administrator. You must maintain a current copy of the operation and maintenance plan onsite, and it must be available for inspection upon request. You must keep the plan for the life of the affected source or until the affected source is no longer subject to the requirements of this subpart. Each operation and maintenance plan must address the elements in paragraphs (b)(1) through (4) of this section.

Corrective actions may include, but are not limited to, the actions listed in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through (vi) of this section. After January 25, 2021, for affected sources that commenced construction or reconstruction on or before September 25, 2019, and after July 28, 2020, or upon start-up, which ever date is later, for affected sources that commenced construction or reconstruction after September 25, 2019, in the event a bag leak detection system alarm is triggered, you must initiate corrective action to determine the cause of the alarm within 1 hour of the alarm, initiate corrective action to correct the cause of the problem within 24 hours of the alarm, and complete the corrective action as soon as practicable. If the alarm sounds more than 5 percent of the operating time during a 6-month period as determined according to § 63.9634(d)(3), it is considered an operating parameter deviation. Corrective actions may include, but are not limited to, the actions listed in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through (vi) of this section.
(i) Inspecting the baghouse for air leaks, torn or broken bags or filter media, or any other condition that may cause an increase in emissions.

The weight of taconite pellets produced must be determined by measurement using weigh hoppers, belt weigh feeders, or weighed quantities in shipments, or calculated using the bulk density and volume measurements. If any measurement result for any pollutant is reported as below the method detection limit, use the method detection limit as the measured emissions level for that pollutant when calculating the emission rate. If the furnace has more than one stack, calculate the total emissions rate for each test run by summing the emissions across all stacks, as shown in Equation 4.

Submitting compliance reports electronically.
Beginning on January 25, 2021, submit all subsequent compliance reports to the EPA via CEDRI, which can be accessed through the EPA's Central Data Exchange (CDX) (
https://cdx.epa.gov/
). The EPA will make all the information submitted through CEDRI available to the public without further notice to you. Do not use CEDRI to submit information you claim as confidential business information (CBI). Anything submitted using CEDRI cannot later be claimed to be CBI. You must use the appropriate electronic report template on the CEDRI website (
https://www.epa.gov/electronic-reporting-air-emissions/compliance-and-emissions-data-reporting-interface-cedri
) for this subpart. The report must be submitted by the deadline specified in this subpart, regardless of the method in which the report is submitted. Although we do not expect persons to assert a claim of CBI, if persons wish to assert a CBI claim, submit a complete report, including information claimed to be CBI, to the EPA. The report must be generated using the appropriate form on the CEDRI website. Clearly mark the part or all of the information that you claim to be CBI. Information not marked as CBI may be authorized for public release without prior notice. Information marked as CBI will not be disclosed except in accordance with procedures set forth in 40 CFR part 2. Submit the file following the procedures in paragraph (c)(1) or (2) of this section. The same file with the CBI omitted must be submitted to the EPA via the EPA's CDX as described earlier in this paragraph (c). All CBI claims must be asserted at the time of submission. Furthermore, under CAA section 114(c) emissions data is not entitled to confidential treatment, and EPA is required to make emissions data available to the public. Thus, emissions data will not be protected as CBI and will be made publicly available. On or before January 25, 2021, for affected sources that commenced construction or reconstruction on or before September 25, 2019, if you had a startup, shutdown, or malfunction during the reporting period that is not consistent with your startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan you must submit an immediate startup, shutdown and malfunction report according to the requirements in § 63.10(d)(5)(ii). After January 25, 2021, for affected sources that commenced construction or reconstruction on or before September 25, 2019, and after July 28, 2020, or upon start-up, which ever date is later, for affected sources that commenced construction or reconstruction after September 25, 2019, an immediate startup, shutdown, and malfunction report is not required.
(1) The preferred method to receive CBI is for it to be transmitted electronically using email attachments, File Transfer Protocol, or other online file sharing services. Electronic submissions must be transmitted directly to the OAQPS CBI Office at the email address
oaqpscbi@epa.gov,

What definitions apply to this subpart?
Terms used in this subpart are defined in the Clean Air Act, in § 63.2, and in this section as follows.
Activated carbon injection (ACI) system
means an add-on air pollution control system in which activated carbon or brominated activated carbon is injected into the flue gas steam upstream of a particulate matter control device to adsorb mercury in the exhaust stream. The absorbed mercury remains absorbed to the activated carbon and is collected in a primary or secondary particulate matter control device.
Affected source
means each new or existing ore crushing and handling operation, ore dryer, indurating furnace, or finished pellet handling operation, at your taconite iron ore processing plant.
Bag leak detection system
means a system that is capable of continuously monitoring relative particulate matter (dust) loadings in the exhaust of a baghouse to detect bag leaks and other upset conditions. A bag leak detection system includes, but is not limited to, an instrument that operates on triboelectric, light scattering, light transmittance, or other effect to continuously monitor relative particulate matter loadings.
Crusher
means a machine used to crush taconite ore and includes feeders or conveyors located immediately below the crushing surfaces. Crushers include, but are not limited to, gyratory crushers and cone crushers.
Deviation
means any instance in which an affected source subject to this subpart, or an owner or operator of such a source:
(1) Fails to meet any requirement or obligation established by this subpart, including but not limited to any emission limitation (including operating limits) or operation and maintenance requirement; or
(2) Fails to meet any term or condition that is adopted to implement an applicable requirement in this subpart and that is included in the operating permit for any affected source required to obtain such a permit.
Dry sorbent injection (DSI) system
means an add-on air pollution control system that injects dry alkaline sorbent (dry injection) or sprays an alkaline sorbent (spray dryer) to react with and neutralize acid gas in the exhaust stream forming a dry powder material that is collected by a primary or secondary particulate matter control device.
Dynamic wet scrubber
means an air emissions control device which utilizes a mechanically powered fan to cause contact between the process exhaust gas stream and the scrubbing liquid which are introduced concurrently into the fan inlet.
Electrostatic Precipitator (ESP)
means a device that removes suspended particulate matter from flue exhaust by applying a high-voltage electrostatic charge to the particles, which are then attracted to and collected on a grounded plate. In a dry ESP, the particles are dislodged from the plate by rapping and are collected in a hopper positioned below the plate. In a wet ESP, particulates are removed from the plate by washing with water.
Emission limitation
means any emission limit, opacity limit, or operating limit.
Finished pellet handling
means the transfer of fired taconite pellets from the indurating furnace to the finished pellet stockpiles at the plant. Finished pellet handling includes, but is not limited to, furnace discharge or grate discharge, and finished pellet screening, transfer, and storage.

means a stationary source from which particles are discharged to the atmosphere due to wind or mechanical inducement such as vehicle traffic. Fugitive dust sources include, but are not limited to:
(1) Stockpiles (includes, but is not limited to, stockpiles of uncrushed ore, crushed ore, or finished pellets);
(2) Material transfer points;
(3) Plant roadways;
(4) Tailings basins;
(5) Pellet loading areas; and
(6) Yard areas.
Grate feed
means the transfer of unfired taconite pellets from the pelletizer into the indurating furnace.
Grate kiln indurating furnace
means a furnace system that consists of a traveling grate, a rotary kiln, and an annular cooler. The grate kiln indurating furnace begins at the point where the grate feed conveyor discharges the green balls onto the furnace traveling grate and ends where the hardened pellets exit the cooler. The atmospheric pellet cooler vent stack is not included as part of the grate kiln indurating furnace.
Indurating
means the process whereby unfired taconite pellets, called green balls, are hardened at high temperature in an indurating furnace. Types of indurating furnaces include straight grate indurating furnaces and grate kiln indurating furnaces.
Ore crushing and handling
means the process whereby dry taconite ore is crushed and screened. Ore crushing and handling includes, but is not limited to, all dry crushing operations (e.g., primary, secondary, and tertiary crushing), dry ore conveyance and transfer points, dry ore classification and screening, dry ore storage and stockpiling, dry milling, dry cobbing (i.e., dry magnetic separation), and the grate feed. Ore crushing and handling specifically excludes any operations where the dry crushed ore is saturated with water, such as wet milling and wet magnetic separation.
Ore dryer
means a rotary dryer that repeatedly tumbles wet taconite ore concentrate through a heated air stream to reduce the amount of entrained moisture in the taconite ore concentrate.
Pellet cooler vent stacks
means atmospheric vents in the cooler section of the grate kiln indurating furnace that exhaust cooling air that is not returned for recuperation. Pellet cooler vent stacks are not to be confused with the cooler discharge stack, which is in the pellet loadout or dumping area.

Storage bin
means a facility for storage (including surge bins and hoppers) of taconite ore or taconite pellets prior to further processing or loading.
Straight grate indurating furnace
means a furnace system that consists of a traveling grate that carries the taconite pellets through different furnace temperature zones. In the straight grate indurating furnace a layer of fired pellets, called the hearth layer, is placed on the traveling grate prior to the addition of unfired pellets. The straight grate indurating furnace begins at the point where the grate feed conveyor discharges the green balls onto the furnace traveling grate and ends where the hardened pellets drop off of the traveling grate.
Taconite iron ore processing
means the separation and concentration of iron ore from taconite, a low-grade iron ore, to produce taconite pellets.
Taconite ore
means a low-grade iron ore suitable for concentration of magnetite or hematite by fine grinding and magnetic or flotation treatment, from which pellets containing iron can be produced.
Tailings basin
means a natural or artificial impoundment in which gangue or other refuse material resulting from the washing, concentration or treatment of ground taconite iron ore is confined.
Wet scrubber
means an air pollution control device that removes particulate matter and acid gases from the waste gas stream of stationary sources. The pollutants are removed primarily through the impaction, diffusion, interception and/or absorption of the pollutant onto droplets of liquid. Wet scrubbers include venturi scrubbers, marble bed scrubbers, or impingement scrubbers. For purposes of this subpart, wet scrubbers do not include dynamic wet scrubbers.

# Continuous Compliance Requirements
§ 63.9808
How do I monitor and collect data to demonstrate continuous compliance?
(a) You must monitor and collect data according to this section.
(b) At all times, you must maintain your monitoring systems in accordance with § 63.9792(b), including, but not limited to, keeping the necessary parts readily available for routine repairs of the monitoring equipment.
(c) Except for, as applicable, monitoring system malfunctions, associated repairs, and required quality assurance or quality control activities, you must monitor continuously whenever your affected process unit is operating. For purposes of calculating data averages, you must not use data recorded during monitoring system malfunctions, associated repairs, and required quality assurance or quality control activities. You must use all the data collected during all other periods in assessing compliance. A monitoring system malfunction is any sudden, infrequent, not reasonably preventable failure of the monitoring system to provide valid data. Monitoring system malfunctions include out of control continuous monitoring systems (CMS), such as a CPMS. Any averaging period for which you do not have valid monitoring data as a result of a monitoring system malfunction and for which such data are required constitutes a deviation, and you must notify the Administrator in accordance with § 63.9814(e). Monitoring system failures are different from monitoring system malfunctions in that they are caused in part by poor maintenance or careless operation. Any period for which there is a monitoring system failure and data are not available for required calculations constitutes a deviation and you must notify the Administrator in accordance with § 63.9814(e).

The organic HAP processing rate is a function of the amount of organic HAP contained in the resins, binders, and additives used in a refractory mix; the amounts of those resins, binders, and additives in the refractory mix; and the rate at which the refractory shapes formed from the refractory mix are processed in an affected thermal process unit. For continuous process units, the organic HAP processing rate is expressed in units of mass of organic HAP per unit of time (e.g., pounds per hour). For batch process units, the organic HAP processing rate is expressed in units of mass of organic HAP per unit
mass of refractory shapes processed during the batch process cycle (e.g., pounds per ton).

# General Compliance Requirements
§ 63.10000
What are my general requirements for complying with this subpart?
(a) You must be in compliance with the emission limits and operating limits in this subpart. These limits apply to you at all times except during periods of startup and shutdown; however, for coal-fired, liquid oil-fired, or solid oil-derived fuel-fired EGUs, you are required to meet the work practice requirements, items 3 and 4, in Table 3 to this subpart during periods of startup or shutdown.
(b) At all times you must operate and maintain any affected source, including associated air pollution control equipment and monitoring equipment, in a manner consistent with safety and good air pollution control practices for minimizing emissions. Determination of whether such operation and maintenance procedures are being used will be based on information available to the EPA Administrator which may include, but is not limited to, monitoring results, review of operation and maintenance procedures, review of operation and maintenance records, and inspection of the source.
(c)(1) For coal-fired units, IGCC units, and solid oil-derived fuel-fired units, initial performance testing is required for all pollutants, to demonstrate compliance with the applicable emission limits.
(i) For a coal-fired or solid oil-derived fuel-fired EGU or IGCC EGU, you may conduct initial performance testing in accordance with § 63.10005(h), to determine whether the EGU qualifies as a low emitting EGU (LEE) for one or more applicable emission limits, except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (c)(1)(i)(A) through (C) of this section:
(A) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(1)(i)(D) of this section, you may not pursue the LEE option if your coal-fired, IGCC, or solid oil-derived fuel-fired EGU is equipped with a main stack and a bypass stack or bypass duct configuration that allows the effluent to bypass any pollutant control device.
(B) You may not pursue the LEE option for Hg if your coal-fired, solid oil-derived fuel-fired EGU or IGCC EGU is new.
(C) On or after July 6, 2027, you may not pursue the LEE option for filterable PM, total non-Hg HAP metals, or individual non-Hg HAP metals for coal-fired and solid oil-derived fuel-fired EGUs.
(D) You may pursue the LEE option provided that:
(
1
) Your EGU's control device bypass emissions are measured in the bypass stack or duct or your control device bypass exhaust is routed through the EGU main stack so that emissions are measured during the bypass event; or
(
2
) Except for hours during which only clean fuel is combusted, you bypass your EGU control device only during emergency periods for no more than a total of 2 percent of your EGU's annual operating hours; you use clean fuels to the maximum extent possible during an emergency period; and you prepare and submit a report describing the emergency event, its cause, corrective action taken, and estimates of emissions released during the emergency event. You must include these emergency emissions along with performance test results in assessing whether your EGU maintains LEE status.
(ii) For a qualifying LEE for Hg emissions limits, you must conduct a 30-day performance test using Method 30B at least once every 12 calendar months to demonstrate continued LEE status.
(iii) For a qualifying LEE of any other applicable emissions limits, you must conduct a performance test at least once every 36 calendar months to demonstrate continued LEE status.
(iv)(A) Before July 6, 2027, if your coal-fired or solid oil derived fuel-fired EGU does not qualify as a LEE for total non-mercury HAP metals, individual non-mercury HAP metals, or filterable particulate matter (PM), you must demonstrate compliance through an initial performance test and you must monitor continuous performance
through either use of a particulate matter continuous parametric monitoring system (PM CPMS), a PM CEMS, or, for an existing EGU, compliance performance testing repeated quarterly.
(B) On and after July 6, 2027, you may not pursue or continue to use the LEE option for your coal-fired or solid oil derived fuel-fired EGU for filterable PM or for non-mercury HAP metals. You must demonstrate compliance through an initial performance test, and you must monitor continuous performance with the applicable filterable PM emissions limit through the use of a PM CEMS or HAP metals CMS.
(C) If your IGCC EGU does not qualify as a LEE for total non-mercury HAP metals, individual non-mercury HAP metals, or filterable PM, you must demonstrate compliance through an initial performance test and you must monitor continuous performance through either use of a PM CPMS, a PM CEMS, or, for an existing EGU, compliance performance testing repeated quarterly.
(v) If your coal-fired or solid oil-derived fuel-fired EGU does not qualify as a LEE for hydrogen chloride (HCl), you may demonstrate initial and continuous compliance through use of an HCl CEMS, installed and operated in accordance with Appendix B to this subpart. As an alternative to HCl CEMS, you may demonstrate initial and continuous compliance by conducting an initial and periodic quarterly performance stack test for HCl. If your EGU uses wet or dry flue gas desulfurization technology (this includes limestone injection into a fluidized bed combustion unit), you may apply a second alternative to HCl CEMS by installing and operating a sulfur dioxide (SO
2
) CEMS installed and operated in accordance with part 75 of this chapter to demonstrate compliance with the applicable SO
2
emissions limit.
(vi) If your coal-fired or solid oil-derived fuel-fired EGU does not qualify as a LEE for Hg, you must demonstrate initial and continuous compliance through use of a Hg CEMS or a sorbent trap monitoring system, in accordance with appendix A to this subpart.
(A) You may choose to use separate sorbent trap monitoring systems to comply with this subpart: One sorbent trap monitoring system to demonstrate compliance with the numeric mercury emissions limit during periods other than startup or shutdown and the other sorbent trap monitoring system to report average mercury concentration during startup periods or shutdown periods.
(B) You may choose to use one sorbent trap monitoring system to demonstrate compliance with the mercury emissions limit at all times (including startup periods and shutdown periods) and to report average mercury concentration. You must follow the startup or shutdown requirements that follow and as given in Table 3 to this subpart for each coal-fired, liquid oil-fired, or solid oil-derived fuel-fired EGU.
(2) For liquid oil-fired EGUs, except limited use liquid oil-fired EGUs, initial performance testing is required for all pollutants, to demonstrate compliance with the applicable emission limits.
(i) For an existing liquid oil-fired unit, you may conduct the performance testing in accordance with § 63.10005(h), to determine whether the unit qualifies as a LEE for one or more pollutants. For a qualifying LEE for Hg emissions limits, you must conduct a 30-day performance test using Method 30B at least once every 12 calendar months to demonstrate continued LEE status. For a qualifying LEE of any other applicable emissions limits, you must conduct a performance test at least once every 36 calendar months to demonstrate continued LEE status. On or after July 6, 2027, you may not pursue the LEE option for filterable PM, total non-Hg HAP metals, or individual non-Hg HAP metals.
(ii) Before July 6, 2027, if your liquid oil-fired unit does not qualify as a LEE for total HAP metals (including mercury), individual metals (including mercury), or filterable PM you must demonstrate compliance through an initial performance test and you must monitor continuous performance through either use of a PM CPMS, a PM CEMS, or, for an existing EGU, performance testing conducted quarterly. On and after July 6, 2027, you may not pursue or continue to use the LEE option for your liquid oil-fired
EGU for filterable PM or for non-mercury HAP metals. You must demonstrate compliance through an initial performance test, and you must monitor continuous performance with the applicable filterable PM emissions limit through the use of a PM CEMS or HAP metals CMS.
(iii) If your existing liquid oil-fired unit does not qualify as a LEE for hydrogen chloride (HCl) or for hydrogen fluoride (HF), you may demonstrate initial and continuous compliance through use of an HCl CEMS, an HF CEMS, or an HCl and HF CEMS, installed and operated in accordance with Appendix B to this rule. As an alternative to HCl CEMS, HF CEMS, or HCl and HF CEMS, you may demonstrate initial and continuous compliance through quarterly performance testing and parametric monitoring for HCl and HF. If you choose to use quarterly testing and parametric monitoring, then you must also develop a site-specific monitoring plan that identifies the CMS you will use to ensure that the operations of the EGU remains consistent with those during the performance test. As another alternative, you may measure or obtain, and keep records of, fuel moisture content; as long as fuel moisture does not exceed 1.0 percent by weight, you need not conduct other HCl or HF monitoring or testing.
(iv) If your unit qualifies as a limited-use liquid oil-fired as defined in § 63.10042, then you are not subject to the emission limits in Tables 1 and 2, but you must comply with the performance tune-up work practice requirements in Table 3.
(d)(1) If you demonstrate compliance with any applicable emissions limit through use of a continuous monitoring system (CMS), where a CMS includes a continuous parameter monitoring system (CPMS) as well as a continuous emissions monitoring system (CEMS), you must develop a site-specific monitoring plan and submit this site-specific monitoring plan, if requested, at least 60 days before your initial performance evaluation (where applicable) of your CMS. This requirement also applies to you if you petition the Administrator for alternative monitoring parameters under § 63.8(f). This requirement to develop and submit a site-specific monitoring plan does not apply to affected sources with existing monitoring plans that apply to CEMS and CPMS prepared under appendix B to part 60 or part 75 of this chapter, and that meet the requirements of § 63.10010. Using the process described in § 63.8(f)(4), you may request approval of monitoring system quality assurance and quality control procedures alternative to those specified in this paragraph of this section and, if approved, include those in your site-specific monitoring plan. The monitoring plan must address the provisions in paragraphs (d)(2) through (5) of this section.
(2) The site-specific monitoring plan shall include the information specified in paragraphs (d)(5)(i) through (d)(5)(vii) of this section. Alternatively, the requirements of paragraphs (d)(5)(i) through (d)(5)(vii) are considered to be met for a particular CMS or sorbent trap monitoring system if:
(i) The CMS or sorbent trap monitoring system is installed, certified, maintained, operated, and quality-assured either according to part 75 of this chapter, or appendix A or B to this subpart; and
(ii) The recordkeeping and reporting requirements of part 75 of this chapter, or appendix A or B to this subpart, that pertain to the CMS are met.
(3) If requested by the Administrator, you must submit the monitoring plan (or relevant portion of the plan) at least 60 days before the initial performance evaluation of a particular CMS, except where the CMS has already undergone a performance evaluation that meets the requirements of § 63.10010 (e.g., if the CMS was previously certified under another program).
(4) You must operate and maintain the CMS according to the site-specific monitoring plan.
(5) The provisions of the site-specific monitoring plan must address the following items:
(i) Installation of the CMS or sorbent trap monitoring system sampling probe or other interface at a measurement location relative to each affected process unit such that the measurement is representative of control of the exhaust emissions (
e.g.,
on or downstream of
the last control device). See § 63.10010(a) for further details. For PM CPMS installations (which with the exception of IGCC units, are only applicable before July 6, 2027), follow the procedures in § 63.10010(h).
(ii) Performance and equipment specifications for the sample interface, the pollutant concentration or parametric signal analyzer, and the data collection and reduction systems.
(iii) Schedule for conducting initial and periodic performance evaluations.
(iv) Performance evaluation procedures and acceptance criteria (e.g., calibrations), including the quality control program in accordance with the general requirements of § 63.8(d).
(v) On-going operation and maintenance procedures, in accordance with the general requirements of §§ 63.8(c)(1)(ii), (c)(3), and (c)(4)(ii).
(vi) Conditions that define a CMS that is out of control consistent with § 63.8(c)(7)(i) where appropriate, and for responding to out of control periods consistent with §§ 63.8(c)(7)(ii) and (c)(8).
(vii) On-going recordkeeping and reporting procedures, in accordance with the general requirements of §§ 63.10(c), (e)(1), and (e)(2)(i), or as specifically required under this subpart.
(e) As part of your demonstration of continuous compliance, you must perform periodic tune-ups of your EGU(s), according to § 63.10021(e).
(f) Except as provided under paragraph (n) of this section, you are subject to the requirements of this subpart for at least 6 months following the last date you met the definition of an EGU subject to this subpart (
e.g.,
6 months after a cogeneration unit provided more than one third of its potential electrical output capacity and more than 25 megawatts electrical output to any power distributions system for sale). You may opt to remain subject to the provisions of this subpart beyond 6 months after the last date you met the definition of an EGU subject to this subpart, unless your unit is a solid waste incineration unit subject to standards under CAA section 129 (
e.g.,
40 CFR part 60, subpart CCCC (New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) for Commercial and Industrial Solid Waste Incineration Units, or subpart DDDD (Emissions Guidelines (EG) for Existing Commercial and Industrial Solid Waste Incineration Units). Notwithstanding the provisions of this subpart, an EGU that starts combusting solid waste is immediately subject to standards under CAA section 129 and the EGU remains subject to those standards until the EGU no longer meets the definition of a solid waste incineration unit consistent with the provisions of the applicable CAA section 129 standards.
(g) Except as provided under paragraph (n) of this section, if your unit no longer meets the definition of an EGU subject to this subpart you must be in compliance with any newly applicable standards on the date you are no longer subject to this subpart.

# Testing and Initial Compliance Requirements
§ 63.10005
What are my initial compliance requirements and by what date must I conduct them?
(a)
General requirements.
For each of your affected EGUs, you must demonstrate initial compliance with each applicable emissions limit in Table 1 or 2 of this subpart through performance testing. Where two emissions limits are specified for a particular pollutant (
e.g.,
a heat input-based limit in lb/MMBtu and a gross output-based limit in lb/MWh), you may demonstrate compliance with either emission limit. For a particular compliance demonstration, you may be required to conduct one or more of the following activities in conjunction with performance testing: collection of data,
e.g.,
hourly gross output data (megawatts); establishment of operating limits according to § 63.10011 and Tables 4 and 7 to this subpart; and CMS performance evaluations. In all cases, you must demonstrate initial compliance no later than the date in paragraph (f) of this section for tune-up work practices for existing EGUs; the date that compliance must be demonstrated, as given in § 63.9984 for other requirements for existing EGUs; and in paragraph (g) of this section for all requirements for new EGUs.
(1) To demonstrate initial compliance with an applicable emissions limit in Table 1 or 2 to this subpart using stack testing, the initial performance test generally consists of three runs at specified process operating conditions using approved methods. Before July 6, 2027, if you are required to establish operating limits (see paragraph (d) of this section and Table 4 to this subpart), you must collect all applicable parametric data during the performance test period. On and after July 6, 2027, the requirements in Table 4 are not applicable, with the exception of IGCC units. Also, if you choose to comply with an electrical output-based emission limit, you must collect hourly electrical load data during the test period.
(2) To demonstrate initial compliance using either a CMS that measures HAP concentrations directly (
i.e.,
an Hg, HCl, or HF CEMS, or a sorbent trap monitoring system) or an SO
2
or PM CEMS, the initial performance test shall consist of 30- or, if applicable for Hg, 90-boiler operating days.If the CMS is certified prior to the compliance date (or, if applicable, the approved extended compliance date), the test shall begin with the first operating day on or after that date, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b) of this section. If the CMS is not certified prior to the compliance date, the test shall begin with the first operating day after certification testing is successfully completed. In all cases, the initial 30- or 90- operating day averaging period must be completed on or before the date that compliance must be demonstrated (
i.e.,
180 days after the applicable compliance date).
(i) The CMS performance test must demonstrate compliance with the applicable Hg, HCl, HF, PM, or SO
2
emissions limit in Table 1 or 2 to this subpart.
(ii) You must collect hourly data from auxiliary monitoring systems (
i.e.,
stack gas flow rate, CO
2
, O
2
, or moisture, as applicable) during the performance test period, in order to convert the pollutant concentrations to units of the standard. If you choose to comply with a gross output-based emission limit, you must also collect hourly gross output data during the performance test period.
(iii) For a group of affected units that are in the same subcategory, are subject to the same emission standards, and share a common stack, if you elect to demonstrate compliance by monitoring emissions at the common stack, startup and shutdown emissions (if any) that occur during the 30-(or, if applicable, 90-) boiler operating day performance test must either be excluded from or included in the compliance demonstration as follows:
(A) If one of the units that shares the stack either starts up or shuts down at a time when none of the other units is operating, you must exclude all pollutant emission rates measured during the startup or shutdown period, unless you are using a sorbent trap monitoring system to measure Hg emissions and have elected to include startup and shutdown emissions in the compliance demonstrations;
(B) If all units that are currently operating are in the startup or shutdown mode, you must exclude all pollutant emission rates measured during the startup or shutdown period, unless you are using a sorbent trap monitoring system to measure Hg emissions and have elected to include startup and shutdown emissions in the compliance demonstrations; or
(C) If any unit starts up or shuts down at a time when another unit is operating, and the other unit is not in the startup or shutdown mode, you must include all pollutant emission rates measured during the startup or shutdown period in the compliance demonstrations.
(b)
Performance testing requirements.
If you choose to use performance testing to demonstrate initial compliance with the applicable emissions limits in Tables 1 and 2 to this subpart for your EGUs, you must conduct the tests according to 40 CFR 63.10007 and Table 5 to this subpart. Notwithstanding these requirements, when Table 5 specifies the use of isokinetic EPA test Method 5, 5I, 5D, 26A, or 29 for a stack test, if concurrent measurement of the stack gas flow rate or moisture content is needed to convert the pollutant concentrations to units of the standard, separate determination of these parameters using EPA test Method 2 or EPA test Method 4 is not necessary. Instead, the stack gas flow rate and moisture content can be determined from data that are collected during the EPA test Method 5, 5I, 5D, 6, 26A, or 29 test (
e.g.,
pitot tube (delta P) readings, moisture collected in the impingers, etc.). For the purposes of the initial compliance demonstration, you may use test data and results from a performance test conducted prior to the date on which compliance is required as specified in 40 CFR 63.9984, provided that the following conditions are fully met:
(1) For a performance test based on stack test data, the test was conducted no more than 12 calendar months prior to the date on which compliance is required as specified in § 63.9984;
(2) For a performance test based on data from a certified CEMS or sorbent trap monitoring system, the test consists of all valid CMS data recorded in the 30 boiler operating days immediately preceding that date;
(3) The performance test was conducted in accordance with all applicable requirements in § 63.10007 and Table 5 to this subpart;
(4) A record of all parameters needed to convert pollutant concentrations to units of the emission standard (
e.g.,
stack flow rate, diluent gas concentrations, hourly gross outputs) is available for the entire performance test period; and
(5) For each performance test based on stack test data, you certify, and keep documentation demonstrating, that the EGU configuration, control devices, and fuel(s) have remained consistent with conditions since the prior performance test was conducted.
(6) For performance stack test data that are collected prior to the date that compliance must be demonstrated and are used to demonstrate initial compliance with applicable emissions limits, the interval for subsequent stack tests begins on the date that compliance must be demonstrated.
(c)
Operating limits.
In accordance with § 63.10010 and Table 4 to this subpart, you may be required to establish operating limits using PM CPMS and using site-specific monitoring for certain liquid oil-fired units as part of your initial compliance demonstration. With the exception of IGCC units, on and after July 6, 2027, you may not demonstrate compliance with applicable filterable PM emissions limits with the use of PM CPMS or quarterly stack testing, you may only use PM CEMS.
(d)
CMS requirements.
If, for a particular emission or operating limit, you are required to (or elect to) demonstrate initial compliance using a continuous monitoring system, the CMS must pass a performance evaluation prior to the initial compliance demonstration. If a CMS has been previously certified under another state or federal program and is continuing to meet the on-going quality-assurance (QA) requirements of that program, then, provided that the certification and QA provisions of that program meet the applicable requirements of §§ 63.10010(b) through (h), an additional performance evaluation of the CMS is not required under this subpart.
(1) For an affected coal-fired, solid oil-derived fuel-fired, or liquid oil-fired EGU, you may demonstrate initial compliance with the applicable SO
2
, HCl, or HF emissions limit in Table 1 or 2 to this subpart through use of an SO
2
, HCl, or HF CEMS installed and operated in accordance with part 75 of this chapter or appendix B to this subpart, as applicable. You may also demonstrate compliance with a filterable PM emission limit in Table 1 or 2 to this subpart through use of a PM CEMS installed, certified, and operated in accordance with § 63.10010(i). Initial compliance is achieved if the arithmetic average of 30-boiler operating days of quality-assured CEMS data, expressed in units of the standard (see § 63.10007(e)), meets the applicable SO
2
, PM, HCl, or HF emissions limit in Table 1 or 2 to this subpart. Use Equation 19-19 of Method 19 in appendix A-7 to part 60 of this chapter to calculate the 30-boiler operating day average emissions rate. (
Note:
For this calculation, the term E
hj
in Equation 19-19 must be in the same units of measure as the applicable HCl or HF emission limit in Table 1 or 2 to this subpart).
(2) For affected coal-fired or solid oil-derived fuel-fired EGUs that demonstrate compliance with the applicable emission limits for total non-mercury HAP metals, individual non-mercury HAP metals, total HAP metals, individual HAP metals, or filterable PM listed in Table 1 or 2 to this subpart using initial performance testing and continuous monitoring with PM CPMS (with the exception of IGCC units, the use of PM CPMS is only allowed before July 6, 2027):
(i) You must demonstrate initial compliance no later than the applicable date specified in § 63.9984(f) for existing EGUs and in paragraph (g) of this section for new EGUs.
(ii) You must demonstrate continuous compliance with the PM CPMS site-specific operating limit that corresponds to the results of the performance test demonstrating compliance with the emission limit with which you choose to comply.
(iii) You must repeat the performance test annually for the selected pollutant emissions limit and reassess and adjust the site-specific operating limit in accordance with the results of the performance test.
(3) For affected EGUs that are either required to or elect to demonstrate initial compliance with the applicable Hg emission limit in Table 1 or 2 of this subpart using Hg CEMS or sorbent trap monitoring systems, initial compliance must be demonstrated no later than the applicable date specified in § 63.9984(f) for existing EGUs and in paragraph (g) of this section for new EGUs. Initial compliance is achieved if the arithmetic average of 30- (or 90-) boiler operating days of quality-assured CEMS (or sorbent trap monitoring system) data, expressed in units of the standard (see section 6.2 of appendix A to this subpart), meets the
applicable Hg emission limit in Table 1 or 2 to this subpart.
(4) For affected liquid oil-fired EGUs that demonstrate compliance with the applicable emission limits for HCl or HF listed in Table 1 or 2 to this subpart using quarterly testing and continuous monitoring with a CMS:
(i) You must demonstrate initial compliance no later than the applicable date specified in § 63.9984(f) for existing EGUs and in paragraph (g) of this section for new EGUs.
(ii) You must demonstrate continuous compliance with the CMS site-specific operating limit that corresponds to the results of the performance test demonstrating compliance with the HCl or HF emissions limit.
(iii) You must repeat the performance test annually for the HCl or HF emissions limit and reassess and adjust the site-specific operating limit in accordance with the results of the performance test.
(e)
Tune-ups.
All affected EGUs are subject to the work practice standards in Table 3 of this subpart. As part of your initial compliance demonstration, you must conduct a performance tune-up of your EGU according to § 63.10021(e).
(f) For an existing EGU without a neural network, a tune-up, following the procedures in § 63.10021(e), must occur within 6 months (180 days) after April 16, 2015. For an existing EGU with a neural network, a tune-up must occur within 18 months (545 days) after April 16, 2016. If a tune-up occurs prior to April 16, 2015, you must keep records showing that the tune-up met all rule requirements.
(g) If your new or reconstructed affected source commenced construction or reconstruction between May 3, 2011, and July 2, 2011, you must demonstrate initial compliance with either the proposed emission limits or the promulgated emission limits no later than 180 days after April 16, 2012 or within 180 days after startup of the source, whichever is later, according to § 63.7(a)(2)(ix).
(1) For the new or reconstructed affected source described in this paragraph (g), if you choose to comply with the proposed emission limits when demonstrating initial compliance, you must conduct a second compliance demonstration for the promulgated emission limits within 3 years after April 16, 2012 or within 3 years after startup of the affected source, whichever is later.
(2) If your new or reconstructed affected source commences construction or reconstruction after April 16, 2012, you must demonstrate initial compliance with the promulgated emission limits no later than 180 days after startup of the source.
(h)
Low emitting EGUs.
The provisions of this paragraph (h) apply to pollutants with emissions limits from new EGUs except Hg and to all pollutants with emissions limits from existing EGUs. With the exception of IGCC units, on or after July 6, 2027 you may not pursue the LEE option for filterable PM. You may pursue this compliance option unless prohibited pursuant to § 63.10000(c)(1)(i).
(1) An EGU may qualify for low emitting EGU (LEE) status for Hg, HCl, HF, filterable PM, total non-Hg HAP metals, or individual non-Hg HAP metals (or total HAP metals or individual HAP metals, for liquid oil-fired EGUs) if you collect performance test data that meet the requirements of this paragraph (h) with the exception that on or after July 6, 2027, you may not pursue the LEE option for filterable PM, total non-Hg HAP metals, or individual non-Hg HAP metals for any existing, new or reconstructed EGUs (this does not apply to IGCC units), and if those data demonstrate:
(i) For all pollutants except Hg, performance test emissions results less than 50 percent of the applicable emissions limits in Table 1 or 2 to this subpart for all required testing for 3 consecutive years; or
(ii) For Hg emissions from an existing EGU, either:
(A) Average emissions less than 10 percent of the applicable Hg emissions limit in Table 2 to this subpart (expressed either in units of lb/TBtu or lb/GWh); or
(B) Potential Hg mass emissions of 29.0 or fewer pounds per year and compliance with the applicable Hg emission limit in Table 2 to this subpart (expressed either in units of lb/TBtu or lb/GWh).
(2) For all pollutants except Hg, you must conduct all required performance tests described in § 63.10007 to demonstrate that a unit qualifies for LEE status.
(i) When conducting emissions testing to demonstrate LEE status, you must increase the minimum sample volume specified in Table 1 or 2 nominally by a factor of two.
(ii) Follow the instructions in § 63.10007(e) and Table 5 to this subpart to convert the test data to the units of the applicable standard.
(3) For Hg, you must conduct a 30- (or 90-) boiler operating day performance test using Method 30B in appendix A-8 to part 60 of this chapter to determine whether a unit qualifies for LEE status. Locate the Method 30B sampling probe tip at a point within 10 percent of the duct area centered about the duct's centroid at a location that meets Method 1 in appendix A-1 to part 60 of this chapter and conduct at least three nominally equal length test runs over the 30- (or 90-) boiler operating day test period. You may use a pair of sorbent traps to sample the stack gas for a period consistent with that given in section 5.2.1 of appendix A to this subpart. Collect Hg emissions data continuously over the entire test period (except when changing sorbent traps or performing required reference method QA procedures). As an alternative to constant rate sampling per Method 30B, you may use proportional sampling per section 8.2.2 of Performance Specification 12 B in appendix B to part 60 of this chapter.
(i) Depending on whether you intend to assess LEE status for Hg in terms of the lb/TBtu or lb/GWh emission limit in Table 2 to this subpart or in terms of the annual Hg mass emissions limit of 29.0 lb/year, you will have to collect some or all of the following data during the 30-boiler operating day test period (see paragraph (h)(3)(iii) of this section):
(A) Diluent gas (CO
2
or O
2
) data, using either Method 3A in appendix A-3 to part 60 of this chapter or a diluent gas monitor that has been certified according to part 75 of this chapter.
(B) Stack gas flow rate data, using either Method 2, 2F, or 2G in appendices A-1 and A-2 to part 60 of this chapter, or a flow rate monitor that has been certified according to part 75 of this chapter.
(C) Stack gas moisture content data, using either Method 4 in appendix A-1 to part 60 of this chapter, or a moisture monitoring system that has been certified according to part 75 of this chapter. Alternatively, an appropriate fuel-specific default moisture value from § 75.11(b) of this chapter may be used in the calculations or you may petition the Administrator under § 75.66 of this chapter for use of a default moisture value for non-coal-fired units.
(D) Hourly gross output data (megawatts), from facility records.
(ii) If you use CEMS to measure CO
2
(or O
2
) concentration, and/or flow rate, and/or moisture, record hourly average values of each parameter throughout the 30-boiler operating day test period. If you opt to use EPA reference methods rather than CEMS for any parameter, you must perform at least one representative test run on each operating day of the test period, using the applicable reference method.
(iii) Calculate the average Hg concentration, in µg/m
3
(dry basis), for each of LEE test runs comprising the 30- (or 90-) boiler operating day performance test, as the arithmetic average of all Method 30B sorbent trap results from the LEE test period. Also calculate, as applicable, the average values of CO
2
or O
2
concentration, stack gas flow rate, stack gas moisture content, and gross output for the LEE test period. Then:
(A) To express the test results in units of lb/TBtu, follow the procedures in § 63.10007(e). Use the average Hg concentration and diluent gas values in the calculations.
(B) To express the test results in units of lb/GWh, use Equations A-3 and A-4 in section 6.2.2 of appendix A to this subpart, replacing the hourly values “C
h
”, “Q
h
”, “B
ws
” and “(MW)
h
” with the average values of these parameters from the performance test.
(C) To calculate pounds of Hg per year, use one of the following methods:
(
1
) Multiply the average lb/TBtu Hg emission rate (determined according to paragraph (h)(3)(iii)(A) of this section) by the maximum potential annual heat input to the unit (TBtu), which is equal
to the maximum rated unit heat input (TBtu/hr) times 8,760 hours. If the maximum rated heat input value is expressed in units of MMBtu/hr, multiply it by 10
−6
to convert it to TBtu/hr; or
(
2
) Multiply the average lb/GWh Hg emission rate (determined according to paragraph (h)(3)(iii)(B) of this section) by the maximum potential annual electricity generation (GWh), which is equal to the maximum rated electrical output of the unit (GW) times 8,760 hours. If the maximum rated electrical output value is expressed in units of MW, multiply it by 10
−3
to convert it to GW; or
(
3
) If an EGU has a federally-enforceable permit limit on either the annual heat input or the number of annual operating hours, you may modify the calculations in paragraph (h)(3)(iii)(C)(1) of this section by replacing the maximum potential annual heat input or 8,760 unit operating hours with the permit limit on annual heat input or operating hours (as applicable).
(4) For a group of affected units that vent to a common stack, you may either assess LEE status for the units individually by performing a separate emission test of each unit in the duct leading from the unit to the common stack, or you may perform a single emission test in the common stack. If you choose the common stack testing option, the units in the configuration qualify for LEE status if:
(i) The emission rate measured at the common stack is less than 50 percent (10 percent for Hg) of the applicable emission limit in Table 1 or 2 to this subpart; or
(ii) For Hg from an existing EGU, the applicable Hg emission limit in Table 2 to this subpart is met and the potential annual mass emissions, calculated according to paragraph (h)(3)(iii) of this section (with some modifications), are less than or equal to 29.0 pounds times the number of units sharing the common stack. Base your calculations on the combined heat input capacity of all units sharing the stack (
i.e.
, either the combined maximum rated value or, if applicable, a lower combined value restricted by permit conditions or operating hours).
(5) For an affected unit with a multiple stack or duct configuration in which the exhaust stacks or ducts are downstream of all emission control devices, you must perform a separate emission test in each stack or duct. The unit qualifies for LEE status if:
(i) The emission rate, based on all test runs performed at all of the stacks or ducts, is less than 50 percent (10 percent for Hg) of the applicable emission limit in Table 1 or 2 to this subpart; or
(ii) For Hg from an existing EGU, the applicable Hg emission limit in Table 2 to this subpart is met and the potential annual mass emissions, calculated according to paragraph (h)(3)(iii) of this section, are less than or equal to 29.0 pounds. Use the average Hg emission rate from paragraph (h)(5)(i) of this section in your calculations.
(i)
Liquid-oil fuel moisture measurement.
If your EGU combusts liquid fuels, if your fuel moisture content is no greater than 1.0 percent by weight, and if you would like to demonstrate initial and ongoing compliance with HCl and HF emissions limits, you must meet the requirements of paragraphs (i)(1) through (5) of this section.
(1) Measure fuel moisture content of each shipment of fuel if your fuel arrives on a batch basis; or
(2) Measure fuel moisture content daily if your fuel arrives on a continuous basis; or
(3) Obtain and maintain a fuel moisture certification from your fuel supplier.
(4) Use one of the following methods to determine fuel moisture content:
(i) ASTM D95-05 (Reapproved 2010), “Standard Test Method for Water in Petroleum Products and Bituminous Materials by Distillation,” or
(ii) ASTM D4006-11, “Standard Test Method for Water in Crude Oil by Distillation,” including Annex A1 and Appendix A1.
(5) Use one of the following methods to obtain fuel moisture samples:
(i) ASTM D4177-95 (Reapproved 2010), “Standard Practice for Automatic Sampling of Petroleum and Petroleum Products,” including Annexes A1 through A6 and Appendices X1 and X2, or
(ii) ASTM D4057-06 (Reapproved 2011), “Standard Practice for Manual Sampling of Petroleum and Petroleum Products,” including Annex A1.
(6) Should the moisture in your liquid fuel be more than 1.0 percent by weight, you must
(i) Conduct HCl and HF emissions testing quarterly (and monitor site-specific operating parameters as provided in § 63.10000(c)(2)(iii) or
(ii) Use an HCl CEMS and/or HF CEMS.
(j) Startup and shutdown for coal-fired or solid oil derived-fired units. You must follow the requirements given in Table 3 to this subpart.
(k) You must submit a Notification of Compliance Status summarizing the results of your initial compliance demonstration, as provided in § 63.10030.
[77 FR 9464, Feb. 16, 2012, as amended at 77 FR 23403, Apr. 19, 2012; 78 FR 24084, Apr. 24, 2013; 79 FR 68789, Nov. 19, 2014; 81 FR 20181, Apr. 6, 2016; 85 FR 55757, Sept. 9, 2020; 89 FR 38565, May 7, 2024]
§ 63.10006
When must I conduct subsequent performance tests or tune-ups?
(a) For liquid oil-fired, solid oil-derived fuel-fired and coal-fired EGUs and IGCC units using PM CPMS before July 6, 2027 to monitor continuous performance with an applicable emission limit as provided for under § 63.10000(c), you must conduct all applicable performance tests according to Table 5 to this subpart and § 63.10007 at least every year. On or after July 6, 2027 you may not use PM CPMS to demonstrate compliance for liquid oil-fired, solid oil-derived fuel-fired and coal-fired EGUs. This prohibition against the use of PM CPMS does not apply to IGCC units.
(b) For affected units meeting the LEE requirements of § 63.10005(h), you must repeat the performance test once every 3 years (once every year for Hg) according to Table 5 and § 63.10007. Should subsequent emissions testing results show the unit does not meet the LEE eligibility requirements, LEE status is lost. If this should occur:
(1) For all pollutant emission limits except for Hg, you must conduct emissions testing quarterly, except as otherwise provided in § 63.10021(d)(1).
(2) For Hg, you must install, certify, maintain, and operate a Hg CEMS or a sorbent trap monitoring system in accordance with appendix A to this subpart, within 6 calendar months of losing LEE eligibility. Until the Hg CEMS or sorbent trap monitoring system is installed, certified, and operating, you must conduct Hg emissions testing quarterly, except as otherwise provided in § 63.10021(d)(1). You must have 3 calendar years of testing and CEMS or sorbent trap monitoring system data that satisfy the LEE emissions criteria to reestablish LEE status.
(c) Except where paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section apply, or where you install, certify, and operate a PM CEMS to demonstrate compliance with a filterable PM emissions limit, for liquid oil-, solid oil-derived fuel-, coal-fired and IGCC EGUs, you must conduct all applicable periodic emissions tests for filterable PM, individual, or total HAP metals emissions according to Table 5 to this subpart, § 63.10007, and § 63.10000(c), except as otherwise provided in § 63.10021(d)(1).
(d) Except where paragraph (b) of this section applies, for solid oil-derived fuel- and coal-fired EGUs that do not use either an HCl CEMS to monitor compliance with the HCl limit or an SO
2
CEMS to monitor compliance with the alternate equivalent SO
2
emission limit, you must conduct all applicable periodic HCl emissions tests according to Table 5 to this subpart and § 63.10007 at least quarterly, except as otherwise provided in § 63.10021(d)(1).
(e) Except where paragraph (b) of this section applies, for liquid oil-fired EGUs without HCl CEMS, HF CEMS, or HCl and HF CEMS, you must conduct all applicable emissions tests for HCl, HF, or HCl and HF emissions according to Table 5 to this subpart and § 63.10007 at least quarterly, except as otherwise provided in § 63.10021(d)(1), and conduct site-specific monitoring under a plan as provided for in § 63.10000(c)(2)(iii).
(f)
Time between performance tests.
(1) Notwithstanding the provisions of § 63.10021(d)(1), the requirements listed in paragraphs (g) and (h) of this section, and the requirements of paragraph (f)(3) of this section, you must complete performance tests for your EGU as follows:
(i) At least 45 calendar days, measured from the test's end date, must separate performance tests conducted every quarter;
(ii) For annual testing:
(A) At least 320 calendar days, measured from the test's end date, must separate performance tests;
(B) At least 320 calendar days, measured from the test's end date, must separate annual sorbent trap mercury testing for 30-boiler operating day LEE tests;
(C) At least 230 calendar days, measured from the test's end date, must separate annual sorbent trap mercury testing for 90-boiler operating day LEE tests; and
(iii) At least 1,050 calendar days, measured from the test's end date, must separate performance tests conducted every 3 years.
(2) For units demonstrating compliance through quarterly emission testing, you must conduct a performance test in the 4th quarter of a calendar year if your EGU has skipped performance tests in the first 3 quarters of the calendar year.
(3) If your EGU misses a performance test deadline due to being inoperative and if 168 or more boiler operating hours occur in the next test period, you must complete an additional performance test in that period as follows:
(i) At least 15 calendar days must separate two performance tests conducted in the same quarter.
(ii) At least 107 calendar days must separate two performance tests conducted in the same calendar year.
(iii) At least 350 calendar days must separate two performance tests conducted in the same 3 year period.
(g) If you elect to demonstrate compliance using emissions averaging under § 63.10009, you must continue to conduct performance stack tests at the appropriate frequency given in section (c) through (f) of this section.
(h) If a performance test on a non-mercury LEE shows emissions in excess of 50 percent of the emission limit and if you choose to reapply for LEE status, you must conduct performance tests at the appropriate frequency given in section (c) through (e) of this section for that pollutant until all performance tests over a consecutive 3-year period show compliance with the LEE criteria.
(i) If you are required to meet an applicable tune-up work practice standard, you must conduct a performance tune-up according to § 63.10021(e).
(1) For EGUs not employing neural network combustion optimization during normal operation, each performance tune-up specified in § 63.10021(e) must be no more than 36 calendar months after the previous performance tune-up.
(2) For EGUs employing neural network combustion optimization systems during normal operation, each performance tune-up specified in § 63.10021(e) must be no more than 48 calendar months after the previous performance tune-up.
[77 FR 9464, Feb. 16, 2012, as amended at 77 FR 23403, Apr. 19, 2012; 78 FR 24085, Apr. 24, 2013; 81 FR 20182, Apr. 6, 2016; 89 FR 38565, May 7, 2024]
§ 63.10007
What methods and other procedures must I use for the performance tests?
(a) Except as otherwise provided in this section, you must conduct all required performance tests according to § 63.7(d), (e), (f), and (h). You must also develop a site-specific test plan according to the requirements in § 63.7(c).
(1) If you use CEMS (Hg, HCl, SO
2
, or other) to determine compliance with a 30- (or, if applicable, 90-) boiler operating day rolling average emission limit, you must collect quality- assured CEMS data for all unit operating conditions, including startup and shutdown (see § 63.10011(g) and Table 3 to this subpart), except as otherwise provided in § 63.10020(b). Emission rates determined during startup periods and shutdown periods (as defined in § 63.10042) are not to be included in the compliance determinations, except as otherwise provided in §§ 63.10000(c)(1)(vi)(B) and 63.10005(a)(2)(iii).
(2) If you conduct performance testing with test methods in lieu of continuous monitoring, operate the unit at maximum normal operating load conditions during each periodic (e.g., quarterly) performance test. Maximum normal operating load will be generally between 90 and 110 percent of design capacity but should be representative of site specific normal operations during each test run.
(3) For establishing operating limits with particulate matter continuous parametric monitoring system (PM CPMS) to demonstrate compliance with a PM or non-Hg metals emissions limit (the use of PM CPMS is only allowed before July 6, 2027 with the exception of IGCC units), operate the unit at maximum normal operating load conditions during the performance test period. Maximum normal operating load will be generally between 90 and 110 percent of design capacity but should be representative of site specific normal operations during each test run.
(b) You must conduct each performance test (including traditional 3-run stack tests, 30-boiler operating day tests based on CEMS data (or sorbent trap monitoring system data), and 30-boiler operating day Hg emission tests for LEE qualification) according to the requirements in Table 5 to this subpart.
(c) If you choose the filterable PM method to comply with the PM emission limit and demonstrate continuous performance using a PM CPMS as provided for in § 63.10000(c), you must also establish an operating limit according to § 63.10011(b), § 63.10023, and Tables 4 and 6 to this subpart. Should you desire to have operating limits that correspond to loads other than maximum normal operating load, you must conduct testing at those other loads to determine the additional operating limits. On and after July 6, 2027, you must demonstrate continuous compliance with the applicable filterable PM emission standard through the use of a PM CEMS (with the exception that IGCC units are not required to use PM CEMS and may continue to use PM CPMS). Alternatively, you may demonstrate continuous compliance with the non-Hg metals emission standard if you request and receive approval for the use of a HAP metals CMS under § 63.7(f).
(d) Except for a 30-boiler operating day performance test based on CEMS (or sorbent trap monitoring system) data, where the concept of test runs does not apply, you must conduct a minimum of three separate test runs for each performance test, as specified in § 63.7(e)(3). Each test run must comply with the minimum applicable sampling time or volume specified in Table 1 or 2 to this subpart. Sections 63.10005(d) and (h), respectively, provide special instructions for conducting performance tests based on CEMS or sorbent trap monitoring systems, and for conducting emission tests for LEE qualification.
(e) To use the results of performance testing to determine compliance with the applicable emission limits in Table 1 or 2 to this subpart, proceed as follows:
(1) Except for a 30-boiler operating day performance test based on CEMS (or sorbent trap monitoring system) data, if measurement results for any pollutant are reported as below the method detection level (e.g., laboratory analytical results for one or more sample components are below the method defined analytical detection level), you must use the method detection level as the measured emissions level for that pollutant in calculating compliance. The measured result for a multiple component analysis (e.g., analytical values for multiple Method 29 fractions both for individual HAP metals and for total HAP metals) may include a combination of method detection level data and analytical data reported above the method detection level.
(2) If the limits are expressed in lb/MMBtu or lb/TBtu, you must use the F-factor methodology and equations in sections 12.2 and 12.3 of EPA Method 19 in appendix A-7 to part 60 of this chapter. In cases where an appropriate F-factor is not listed in Table 19-2 of Method 19, you may use F-factors from Table 1 in section 3.3.5 of appendix F to part 75 of this chapter, or F-factors derived using the procedures in section 3.3.6 of appendix to part 75 of this chapter. Use the following factors to convert the pollutant concentrations measured during the initial performance tests to units of lb/scf, for use in the applicable Method 19 equations:
(i) Multiply SO
2
ppm by 1.66 × 10
−7
;
(ii) Multiply HCl ppm by 9.43 × 10
−8
;
(iii) Multiply HF ppm by 5.18 × 10
−8
;
(iv) Multiply HAP metals concentrations (mg/dscm) by 6.24 × 10
−8
; and
(v) Multiply Hg concentrations (µg/scm) by 6.24 × 10
−11
.
(3) To determine compliance with emission limits expressed in lb/MWh or lb/GWh, you must first calculate the pollutant mass emission rate during the performance test, in units of lb/h. For Hg, if a CEMS or sorbent trap monitoring system is used, use Equation A-2 or A-3 in appendix A to this subpart (as applicable). In all other cases, use an equation that has the general form of Equation A-2 or A-3, replacing the value of K with 1.66 × 10
−7
lb/scf-ppm for SO
2
, 9.43 × 10
−8
lb/scf-ppm for HCl (if an HCl CEMS is used), 5.18 × 10
−8
lb/scf-ppm for HF (if an HF CEMS is used), or 6.24 × 10
−8
lb-scm/mg-scf for HAP metals and for HCl and HF (when performance stack testing is used), and defining C
h
as the average SO
2
, HCl, or HF concentration in ppm, or the average HAP metals concentration in mg/dscm. This calculation requires stack gas volumetric flow rate (scfh) and (in some cases) moisture content data (see §§ 63.10005(h)(3) and 63.10010). Then, if the applicable emission limit is in units of lb/GWh, use Equation A-4 in appendix A to this subpart to calculate the pollutant emission rate in lb/GWh. In this calculation, define (M)
h
as the calculated pollutant mass emission rate for the performance test (lb/h), and define (MW)
h
as the average electrical load during the performance test (megawatts). If the applicable emission limit is in lb/MWh rather than lb/GWh, omit the 10
3
term from Equation A-4 to determine the pollutant emission rate in lb/MWh.
(f) If you elect to (or are required to) use CEMS to continuously monitor Hg, HCl, HF, SO
2
, or PM emissions (or, if applicable, sorbent trap monitoring systems to continuously collect Hg emissions data), the following default values are available for use in the emission rate calculations during startup periods or shutdown periods (as defined in § 63.10042). For the purposes of this subpart, these default values are not considered to be substitute data.
(1)
Diluent cap values.
If you use CEMS (or, if applicable, sorbent trap monitoring systems) to comply with a heat input-based emission rate limit, you may use the following diluent cap values for a startup or shutdown hour in which the measured CO
2
concentration is below the cap value or the measured O
2
concentration is above the cap value:
(i) For an IGCC EGU, you may use 1% for CO
2
or 19% for O
2
.
(ii) For all other EGUs, you may use 5% for CO
2
or 14% for O
2
.
(2)
Default gross output.
If you use CEMS to continuously monitor Hg, HCl, HF, SO
2
, or PM emissions (or, if applicable, sorbent trap monitoring systems to continuously collect Hg emissions data), the following default value is available for use in the emission rate calculations during startup periods or shutdown periods (as defined in § 63.10042). For the purposes of this subpart, this default value is not considered to be substitute data. For a startup or shutdown hour in which there is heat input to an affected EGU but zero gross output, you must calculate the pollutant emission rate using a value equivalent to 5% of the maximum sustainable gross output, expressed in megawatts, as defined in section 6.5.2.1(a)(1) of appendix A to part 75 of this chapter. This default gross output is either the nameplate capacity of the EGU or the highest gross output observed in at least four representative quarters of EGU operation. For a monitored common stack, the default gross output is used only when all EGUs are operating (
i.e.,
combusting fuel) are in startup or shutdown mode, and have zero electrical generation. Under those conditions, a default gross output equal to 5% of the combined maximum sustainable gross output of the EGUs that are operating but have a total of zero gross output must be used to calculate the hourly gross output-based pollutant emissions rate.
(g) Upon request, you shall make available to the EPA Administrator such records as may be necessary to determine whether the performance tests have been done according to the requirements of this section.

§ 63.10008
[Reserved]
§ 63.10009
May I use emissions averaging to comply with this subpart?
(a)
General eligibility.
(1) You may use emissions averaging as described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section as an alternative to meeting the requirements of § 63.9991 for filterable PM, SO
2
, HF, HCl, non-Hg HAP metals, or Hg on an EGU-specific basis if:
(i) You have more than one existing EGU in the same subcategory located at one or more contiguous properties, belonging to a single major industrial grouping, which are under common control of the same person (or persons under common control); and
(ii) You use CEMS (or sorbent trap monitoring systems for determining Hg emissions) or quarterly emissions testing for demonstrating compliance.
(2) You may demonstrate compliance by emissions averaging among the existing EGUs in the same subcategory, if your averaged Hg emissions for EGUs in the “unit designed for coal ≥8,300 Btu/lb” subcategory are equal to or less than 1.2 lb/TBtu or 1.3E-2 lb/GWh on a 30-boiler operating day basis or if your averaged emissions of individual, other pollutants from other subcategories of such EGUs are equal to or less than the applicable emissions limit in Table 2 to this subpart, according to the procedures in this section. Note that except for the alternate Hg emissions limit from EGUs in the “unit designed for coal ≥ 8,300 Btu/lb” subcategory, the averaging time for emissions averaging for pollutants is 30-group boiler operating days (rolling daily) using data from CEMS and sorbent trap monitoring (for Hg), or a combination of data from CEMS and emissions testing (for other pollutants). The averaging time for emissions averaging for the alternate Hg limit (equal to or less than 1.0 lb/TBtu or 1.1E-2 lb/GWh) from EGUs in the “unit designed for coal ≥ 8,300 Btu/lb” subcategory is 90-group boiler operating days (rolling daily) using data from CEMS, sorbent trap monitoring, or a combination of data from CEMS and sorbent trap monitoring. For the purposes of this paragraph, 30- (or 90-) group boiler operating days is defined as a period during which at least one unit in the emissions averaging group operates on each of the 30 or 90 days. You must calculate the weighted average emissions rate for the group in accordance with the procedures in this paragraph using the data from all units in the group including any that operate fewer than 30 (or 90) of the preceding 30- (or 90-) group boiler operating days.
(i) You may choose to have your EGU emissions averaging group meet either the heat input basis (MMBtu or TBtu, as appropriate for the pollutant) or gross output basis (MWh or GWh, as appropriate for the pollutant).
(ii) You may not mix bases within your EGU emissions averaging group.
(iii) You may use emissions averaging for affected units in different subcategories if the units vent to the atmosphere through a common stack (see paragraph (m) of this section).

(c)
Separate stack requirements.
For a group of two or more existing EGUs in the same subcategory that each vent to a separate stack, you may average filterable PM, SO
2
, HF, HCl, non-Hg HAP metals, or Hg emissions to demonstrate compliance with the limits in Table 2 to this subpart if you satisfy the requirements in paragraphs (d) through (j) of this section.
(d) For each existing EGU in the averaging group:
(1) The emissions rate achieved during the initial performance test for the HAP being averaged must not exceed the emissions level that was being achieved 180 days after April 16, 2015, or the date on which emissions testing done to support your emissions averaging plan is complete (if the Administrator does not require submission and approval of your emissions averaging
plan), or the date that you begin emissions averaging, whichever is earlier; or
(2) The control technology employed during the initial performance test must not be less than the design efficiency of the emissions control technology employed 180 days after April 16, 2015 or the date that you begin emissions averaging, whichever is earlier.
(e) The weighted-average emissions rate from the existing EGUs participating in the emissions averaging option must be in compliance with the limits in Table 2 to this subpart at all times following the date that you begin emissions averaging.
(f) Emissions averaging group eligibility demonstration. You must demonstrate the ability for the EGUs included in the emissions averaging group to demonstrate initial compliance according to paragraph (f)(1) or (2) of this section using the maximum rated heat input or gross output over a 30- (or 90-) boiler operating day period of each EGU and the results of the initial performance tests. For this demonstration and prior to preparing your emissions averaging plan, you must conduct required emissions monitoring for 30- (or 90-) days of boiler operation and any required manual performance testing to calculate maximum weighted average emissions rate in accordance with this section. If, before the start of your initial compliance demonstration, the Administrator becomes aware that you intend to use emissions averaging for that demonstration, or if your initial Notification of Compliance Status (NOCS) indicates that you intend to implement emissions averaging at a future date, the Administrator may require you to submit your proposed emissions averaging plan and supporting data for approval. If the Administrator requires approval of your plan, you may not begin using emissions averaging until the Administrator approves your plan.
(1) You must use Equation 1a in paragraph (b) of this section to demonstrate that the maximum weighted average emissions rates of filterable PM, HF, SO
2
, HCl, non-Hg HAP metals, or Hg emissions from the existing units participating in the emissions averaging option do not exceed the emissions limits in Table 2 to this subpart.
(2) If you are not capable of monitoring heat input or gross output, and the EGU generates steam for purposes other than generating electricity, you may use Equation 1b of paragraph (b) of this section as an alternative to using Equation 1a of paragraph (b) of this section to demonstrate that the maximum weighted average emissions rates of filterable PM, HF, SO
2
, HCl, non-Hg HAP metals, or Hg emissions from the existing units participating in the emissions averaging group do not exceed the emission limits in Table 2 to this subpart.
(g) You must determine the weighted average emissions rate in units of the applicable emissions limit on a 30 group boiler operating day rolling average basis (or, if applicable, on a 90 group boiler operating day rolling average basis for Hg) according to paragraphs (g)(1) and (2) of this section. The first averaging period ends on the 30th (or, if applicable, 90th for the alternate Hg emission limit) group boiler operating day after the date that you begin emissions averaging.
(1) You must use Equation 2a or 3a of paragraph (b) of this section to calculate the weighted average emissions rate using the actual heat input or gross output for each existing unit participating in the emissions averaging option.
(2) If you are not capable of monitoring heat input or gross output, you may use Equation 2b or 3b of paragraph (b) of this section as an alternative to using Equation 2a of paragraph (b) of this section to calculate the average weighted emission rate using the actual steam generation from the units participating in the emissions averaging option.
(h)
CEMS (or sorbent trap monitoring) use.
If an EGU in your emissions averaging group uses CEMS (or a sorbent trap monitor for Hg emissions) to demonstrate compliance, you must use those data to determine the 30 (or 90) group boiler operating day rolling average emissions rate.
(i)
Emissions testing.
If you use manual emissions testing to demonstrate compliance for one or more EGUs in your emissions averaging group, you
must use the results from the most recent performance test to determine the 30 (or 90) day rolling average. You may use CEMS or sorbent trap data in combination with data from the most recent manual performance test in calculating the 30 (or 90) group boiler operating day rolling average emissions rate.
(j)
Emissions averaging plan.
You must develop an implementation plan for emissions averaging according to the following procedures and requirements in paragraphs (j)(1) and (2) of this section.
(1) You must include the information contained in paragraphs (j)(1)(i) through (v) of this section in your implementation plan for all the emissions units included in an emissions averaging:
(i) The identification of all existing EGUs in the emissions averaging group, including for each either the applicable HAP emission level or the control technology installed as of 180 days after February 16, 2015, or the date on which you complete the emissions measurements used to support your emissions averaging plan (if the Administrator does not require submission and approval of your emissions averaging plan), or the date that you begin emissions averaging, whichever is earlier; and the date on which you are requesting emissions averaging to commence;
(ii) The process weighting parameter (heat input, gross output, or steam generated) that will be monitored for each averaging group;
(iii) The specific control technology or pollution prevention measure to be used for each emission EGU in the averaging group and the date of its installation or application. If the pollution prevention measure reduces or eliminates emissions from multiple EGUs, you must identify each EGU;
(iv) The means of measurement (e.g., CEMS, sorbent trap monitoring, manual performance test) of filterable PM, SO
2
, HF, HCl, individual or total non-Hg HAP metals, or Hg emissions in accordance with the requirements in § 63.10007 and to be used in the emissions averaging calculations; and
(v) A demonstration that emissions averaging can produce compliance with each of the applicable emission limit(s) in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
(2) If, as described in paragraph (f) of this section, the Administrator requests you to submit the averaging plan for review and approval, you must receive approval before initiating emissions averaging.
(i) The Administrator shall use following criteria in reviewing and approving or disapproving the plan:
(A) Whether the content of the plan includes all of the information specified in paragraph (j)(1) of this section; and
(B) Whether the plan presents information sufficient to determine that compliance will be achieved and maintained.
(ii) The Administrator shall not approve an emissions averaging implementation plan containing any of the following provisions:
(A) Any averaging between emissions of different pollutants or between units located at different facilities; or
(B) The inclusion of any emissions unit other than an existing unit in the same subcategory.
(k)
Common stack requirements.
For a group of two or more existing affected units, each of which vents through a single common stack, you may average emissions to demonstrate compliance with the limits in Table 2 to this subpart if you satisfy the requirements in paragraph (l) or (m) of this section.
(l) For a group of two or more existing units in the same subcategory and which vent through a common emissions control system to a common stack that does not receive emissions from units in other subcategories or categories, you may treat such averaging group as a single existing unit for purposes of this subpart and comply with the requirements of this subpart as if the group were a single unit.
(m) For all other groups of units subject to paragraph (k) of this section, you may elect to conduct manual performance tests according to procedures specified in § 63.10007 in the common stack. If emissions from affected units included in the emissions averaging and from other units not included in
the emissions averaging (e.g., in a different subcategory) or other nonaffected units all vent to the common stack, you must shut down the units not included in the emissions averaging and the nonaffected units or vent their emissions to a different stack during the performance test. Alternatively, you may conduct a performance test of the combined emissions in the common stack with all units operating and show that the combined emissions meet the most stringent emissions limit. You may also use a CEMS or sorbent trap monitoring to apply this latter alternative to demonstrate that the combined emissions comply with the most stringent emissions limit on a continuous basis.
(n) Combination requirements. The common stack of a group of two or more existing EGUs in the same subcategory subject to paragraph (k) of this section may be treated as a single stack for purposes of paragraph (c) of this section and included in an emissions averaging group subject to paragraph (c) of this section.

§ 63.10010
What are my monitoring, installation, operation, and maintenance requirements?
(a) Flue gases from the affected units under this subpart exhaust to the atmosphere through a variety of different configurations, including but not limited to individual stacks, a common stack configuration or a main stack plus a bypass stack. For the CEMS, PM CPMS (which on or after July 6, 2027 you may not use PM CPMS for filterable PM compliance demonstrations unless it is for an IGCC unit), and sorbent trap monitoring systems used to provide data under this subpart, the continuous monitoring system installation requirements for these exhaust configurations are as follows:
(1)
Single unit-single stack configurations.
For an affected unit that exhausts to the atmosphere through a single, dedicated stack, you shall either install the required CEMS, PM CPMS, and sorbent trap monitoring systems in the stack or at a location in the ductwork downstream of all emissions control devices, where the pollutant and diluents concentrations are representative of the emissions that exit to the atmosphere.
(2)
Unit utilizing common stack with other affected unit(s).
When an affected unit utilizes a common stack with one or more other affected units, but no non-affected units, you shall either:
(i) Install the required CEMS, PM CPMS, and sorbent trap monitoring systems in the duct leading to the common stack from each unit; or
(ii) Install the required CEMS, PM CPMS, and sorbent trap monitoring systems in the common stack.
(3)
Unit(s) utilizing common stack with non-affected unit(s).
(i) When one or more affected units shares a common stack with one or more non-affected units, you shall either:
(A) Install the required CEMS, PM CPMS, and sorbent trap monitoring systems in the ducts leading to the common stack from each affected unit; or
(B) Install the required CEMS, PM CPMS, and sorbent trap monitoring systems described in this section in the common stack and attribute all of the emissions measured at the common stack to the affected unit(s).
(ii) If you choose the common stack monitoring option:
(A) For each hour in which valid data are obtained for all parameters, you must calculate the pollutant emission rate and
(B) You must assign the calculated pollutant emission rate to each unit that shares the common stack.
(4)
Unit with a main stack and a bypass stack that exhausts to the atmosphere independent of the main stack.
If the exhaust configuration of an affected unit consists of a main stack and a bypass stack, you shall install CEMS on both the main stack and the bypass stack. If it is not feasible to certify and quality-assure the data from a monitoring system on the bypass stack, you shall:
(i) Route the exhaust from the bypass through the main stack and its monitoring so that bypass emissions are measured; or
(ii) Install a CEMS only on the main stack and count hours that the bypass
stack is in use as hours of deviation from the monitoring requirements.
(5)
Unit with a common control device with multiple stack or duct configuration.
If the flue gases from an affected unit, which is configured such that emissions are controlled with a common control device or series of control devices, are discharged to the atmosphere through more than one stack or are fed into a single stack through two or more ducts, you may:
(i) Install required CEMS, PM CPMS, and sorbent trap monitoring systems in each of the multiple stacks;
(ii) Install required CEMS, PM CPMS, and sorbent trap monitoring systems in each of the ducts that feed into the stack;
(iii) Install required CEMS, PM CPMS, and sorbent trap monitoring systems in one of the multiple stacks or ducts and monitor the flows and dilution rates in all multiple stacks or ducts in order to determine total exhaust gas flow rate and pollutant mass emissions rate in accordance with the applicable limit; or
(iv) In the case of multiple ducts feeding into a single stack, install CEMS, PM CPMS, and sorbent trap monitoring systems in the single stack as described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
(6)
Unit with multiple parallel control devices with multiple stacks.
If the flue gases from an affected unit, which is configured such that emissions are controlled with multiple parallel control devices or multiple series of control devices are discharged to the atmosphere through more than one stack, you shall install the required CEMS, PM CPMS, and sorbent trap monitoring systems described in each of the multiple stacks. You shall calculate hourly flow-weighted average pollutant emission rates for the unit as follows:
(i) Calculate the pollutant emission rate at each stack or duct for each hour in which valid data are obtained for all parameters;
(ii) Multiply each calculated hourly pollutant emission rate at each stack or duct by the corresponding hourly stack gas flow rate at that stack or duct;
(iii) Sum the products determined under paragraph (a)(6)(ii) of this section; and
(iv) Divide the result obtained in paragraph (a)(6)(iii) of this section by the total hourly stack gas flow rate for the unit, summed across all of the stacks or ducts.
(b) If you use an oxygen (O
2
) or carbon dioxide (CO
2
) CEMS to convert measured pollutant concentrations to the units of the applicable emissions limit, the O
2
or CO
2
concentrations shall be monitored at a location that represents emissions to the atmosphere,
i.e.,
at the outlet of the EGU, downstream of all emission control devices. You must install, certify, maintain, and operate the CEMS according to part 75 of this chapter. Use only quality-assured O
2
or CO
2
data in the emissions calculations; do not use part 75 substitute data values.
(c) If you are required to use a stack gas flow rate monitor, either for routine operation of a sorbent trap monitoring system or to convert pollutant concentrations to units of an electrical output-based emission standard in Table 1 or 2 to this subpart, you must install, certify, operate, and maintain the monitoring system and conduct on-going quality-assurance testing of the system according to part 75 of this chapter. Use only unadjusted, quality-assured flow rate data in the emissions calculations. Do not apply bias adjustment factors to the flow rate data and do not use substitute flow rate data in the calculations.
(d) If you are required to make corrections for stack gas moisture content when converting pollutant concentrations to the units of an emission standard in Table 1 of 2 to this subpart, you must install, certify, operate, and maintain a moisture monitoring system in accordance with part 75 of this chapter. Alternatively, for coal-fired units, you may use appropriate fuel-specific default moisture values from § 75.11(b) of this chapter to estimate the moisture content of the stack gas or you may petition the Administrator under § 75.66 of this chapter for use of a default moisture value for non-coal-fired units. If you install and operate a moisture monitoring system, do not
use substitute moisture data in the emissions calculations.
(e) If you use an HCl and/or HF CEMS, you must install, certify, operate, maintain, and quality-assure the data from the monitoring system in accordance with appendix B to this subpart. Calculate and record a 30-boiler operating day rolling average HCl or HF emission rate in the units of the standard, updated after each new boiler operating day. Each 30-boiler operating day rolling average emission rate is the average of all the valid hourly HCl or HF emission rates in the preceding 30 boiler operating days (see section 9.4 of appendix B to this subpart).
(f)(1) If you use an SO
2
CEMS, you must install the monitor at the outlet of the EGU, downstream of all emission control devices, and you must certify, operate, and maintain the CEMS according to part 75 of this chapter.
(2) For on-going QA, the SO
2
CEMS must meet the applicable daily, quarterly, and semiannual or annual requirements in sections 2.1 through 2.3 of appendix B to part 75 of this chapter, with the following addition: You must perform the linearity checks required in section 2.2 of appendix B to part 75 of this chapter if the SO
2
CEMS has a span value of 30 ppm or less.
(3) Calculate and record a 30-boiler operating day rolling average SO
2
emission rate in the units of the standard, updated after each new boiler operating day. Each 30-boiler operating day rolling average emission rate is the average of all of the valid hourly SO
2
emission rates in the 30 boiler operating day period.
(4) Use only unadjusted, quality-assured SO
2

2
data and do not use part 75 substitute data values. For startup or shutdown hours (as defined in § 63.10042) the default gross output and the diluent cap are available for use in the hourly SO
2
emission rate calculations, as described in § 63.10007(f). Use a flag to identify each startup or shutdown hour and report a special code if the diluent cap or default gross output is used to calculate the SO
2

§ 63.10011
How do I demonstrate initial compliance with the emissions limits and work practice standards?
(a) You must demonstrate initial compliance with each emissions limit that applies to you by conducting performance testing.
(b) If you are subject to an operating limit in Table 4 to this subpart, you demonstrate initial compliance with HAP metals or filterable PM emission limit(s) through performance stack tests and you elect to use a PM CPMS to demonstrate continuous performance (with the exception of existing IGCC units, on or after July 6, 2027 you may not use PM CPMS for compliance demonstrations with the applicable filterable PM limits and the Table 4 p.m. CPMS operating limits do not apply), or if, for an IGCC unit, and you use quarterly stack testing for HCl and HF plus site-specific parameter monitoring to demonstrate continuous performance, you must also establish a site-specific operating limit, in accordance with § 63.10007 and Table 6 to this subpart. You may use only the parametric data recorded during successful performance tests (
i.e.,
tests that demonstrate compliance with the applicable emissions limits) to establish an operating limit. On or after July 6, 2027 you may not use PM CPMS for compliance demonstrations with the applicable filterable PM limits and the Table 6 procedures for establishing PM CPMS operating limits do not apply unless it is an IGCC unit.
(c)(1) If you use CEMS or sorbent trap monitoring systems to measure a HAP (
e.g.,
Hg or HCl) directly, the initial performance test, shall consist of a 30-boiler operating day (or, for certain coal-fired, existing EGUs that use emissions averaging for Hg, a 90-boiler operating day) rolling average emissions rate obtained with a certified CEMS or sorbent trap system, expressed in units of the standard. If the monitoring system is certified prior to the applicable compliance date, the initial averaging period shall either begin with: The first boiler operating day on or after the compliance date; or 30 (or, if applicable, 90) boiler operating days prior to that date, as described in § 63.10005(b). In all cases, the initial 30- or 90-boiler operating day averaging period must be completed on or before the date that compliance must be demonstrated, in accordance with § 63.9984(f). Initial compliance is demonstrated if the results of the performance test meet the applicable emission limit in Table 1 or 2 to this subpart.
(2) For an EGU that uses a CEMS to measure SO
2
or PM emissions for initial compliance, the initial performance test shall consist of a 30-boiler operating day average emission rate obtained with certified CEMS, expressed in units of the standard. If the monitoring system is certified prior to the applicable compliance date, the initial averaging period shall either begin with: The first boiler operating day on or after the compliance date; or 30 boiler operating days prior to that date, as described in § 63.10005(b). In all cases, the initial 30- boiler operating day
averaging period must be completed on or before the date that compliance must be demonstrated, in accordance with § 63.9984(f). Initial compliance is demonstrated if the results of the performance test meet the applicable SO
2
or PM emission limit in Table 1 or 2 to this subpart.
(d) For candidate LEE units, use the results of the performance testing described in § 63.10005(h) to determine initial compliance with the applicable emission limit(s) in Table 1 or 2 to this subpart and to determine whether the unit qualifies for LEE status.
(e) You must submit a Notification of Compliance Status in accordance with 40 CFR 63.10031(f)(4) or (h), as applicable, containing the results of the initial compliance demonstration, as specified in 40 CFR 63.10030(e).
(f)(1) You must determine the fuel whose combustion produces the least uncontrolled emissions,
i.e.
, the cleanest fuel, either natural gas or distillate oil, that is available on site or accessible nearby for use during periods of startup or shutdown.
(2) Your cleanest fuel, either natural gas or distillate oil, for use during periods of startup or shutdown determination may take safety considerations into account.
(g) You must follow the startup or shutdown requirements as established in Table 3 to this subpart for each coal-fired, liquid oil-fired, or solid oil-derived fuel-fired EGU.
(1) You may use the diluent cap and default gross output values, as described in § 63.10007(f), during startup periods or shutdown periods.
(2) You must operate all CMS, collect data, calculate pollutant emission rates, and record data during startup periods or shutdown periods.
(3) You must report the emissions data recorded during startup and shutdown. If you are relying on paragraph (2) of the definition of startup in 40 CFR 63.10042 (only allowed before January 2, 2025), then for startup and shutdown incidents that occur on or prior to December 31, 2023, you must also report the applicable supplementary information in 40 CFR 63.10031(c)(5) in the semiannual compliance report. For startup and shutdown incidents that occur on or after January 1, 2024, you must provide the applicable information in 40 CFR 63.10031(c)(5)(ii) and 40 CFR 63.10020(e) quarterly, in PDF files, in accordance with 40 CFR 63.10031(i).
(4) If you choose to use paragraph (2) of the definition of “startup” in § 63.10042 (only allowed before January 2, 2025), and you find that you are unable to safely engage and operate your particulate matter (PM) control(s) within 1 hour of first firing of coal, residual oil, or solid oil-derived fuel, you may choose to rely on paragraph (1) of definition of “startup” in § 63.10042 or you may submit a request to use an alternative non-opacity emissions standard, as described below.
(i) As mentioned in § 63.6(g)(1), your request will be published in the
Federal Register
for notice and comment rulemaking. Until promulgation in the
Federal Register
of the final alternative non-opacity emission standard, you shall comply with paragraph (1) of the definition of “startup” in § 63.10042. You shall not implement the alternative non-opacity emissions standard until promulgation in the
Federal Register
of the final alternative non-opacity emission standard.

# Continuous Compliance Requirements
§ 63.10020
How do I monitor and collect data to demonstrate continuous compliance?
(a) You must monitor and collect data according to this section and the site-specific monitoring plan required by § 63.10000(d).
(b) You must operate the monitoring system and collect data at all required intervals at all times that the affected EGU is operating, except for required monitoring system quality assurance or quality control activities, including, as applicable, calibration checks and required zero and span adjustments, and any scheduled maintenance as defined in your site-specific monitoring plan. You are required to affect monitoring system repairs in response to monitoring system malfunctions and to return the monitoring system to operation as expeditiously as practicable.
(c) You may not use data recorded during EGU startup or shutdown in calculations used to report emissions, except as otherwise provided in §§ 63.10000(c)(1)(vi)(B) and 63.10005(a)(2)(iii).

(3) For PM or non-mercury HAP metals work practice monitoring during startup periods, you must monitor and collect data according to this section
and the site-specific monitoring plan required by § 63.10010(l).
(i) Except for an EGU that uses PM CEMS or PM CPMS to demonstrate compliance with the PM emissions limit, or that has LEE status for filterable PM or total non-Hg HAP metals for non- liquid oil-fired EGUs (or HAP metals emissions for liquid oil-fired EGUs), or individual non-mercury metals CMS (except that unless it is for an IGCC unit, on or after July 6, 2027 you may not use PM CPMS for compliance demonstrations with the applicable filterable PM emissions limits, and you may not purse or continue to use the LEE option for filterable PM, total non-Hg HAP metals, or individual non-Hg HAP metals), you must:
(A) Record temperature and combustion air flow or calculated flow as determined from combustion equations of post-combustion (exhaust) gas, as well as amperage of forced draft fan(s), upstream of the filterable PM control devices during each hour of startup.
(B) Record temperature and flow of exhaust gas, as well as amperage of any induced draft fan(s), downstream of the filterable PM control devices during each hour of startup.

§ 63.10021
How do I demonstrate continuous compliance with the emission limitations, operating limits, and work practice standards?
(a) You must demonstrate continuous compliance with each emissions limit, operating limit, and work practice standard in Tables 1 through 4 to this subpart that applies to you, according to the monitoring specified in Tables 6 and 7 to this subpart and paragraphs (b) through (g) of this section.
(b) Except as otherwise provided in § 63.10020(c), if you use a CEMS to measure SO
2
, PM, HCl, HF, or Hg emissions, or using a sorbent trap monitoring system to measure Hg emissions, you must demonstrate continuous compliance by using all quality-assured hourly data recorded by the CEMS (or sorbent trap monitoring system) and the other required monitoring systems (e.g., flow rate, CO
2
, O
2
, or moisture systems) to calculate the arithmetic average emissions rate in units of the standard on a continuous 30-boiler operating day (or, if alternate emissions averaging is used for Hg, 90-boiler operating day) rolling average basis, updated at the end of each new boiler operating day. Use Equation 8 to determine the 30- (or, if applicable, 90-) boiler operating day rolling average.
ER19AP12.002
Where:
Her
i
is the hourly emissions rate for hour i and n is the number of hourly emissions rate values collected over 30- (or, if applicable, 90-) boiler operating days.
(c) If you use PM CPMS data (only allowed before July 6, 2027 unless it is for an IGCC unit) to measure compliance with an operating limit in Table 4 to this subpart, you must record the PM CPMS output data for all periods when the process is operating and the PM CPMS is not out-of-control. You must demonstrate continuous compliance by using all quality-assured hourly average data collected by the PM
CPMS for all operating hours to calculate the arithmetic average operating parameter in units of the operating limit (
e.g.,
milliamps, PM concentration, raw data signal) on a 30 operating day rolling average basis, updated at the end of each new boiler operating day. Use Equation 9 to determine the 30 boiler operating day average. On or after July 6, 2027 you may not use PM CPMS for compliance demonstrations unless it is for an IGCC unit.
ER07MY24.079
Where:
Hpv
i
is the hourly parameter value for hour i and n is the number of valid hourly parameter values collected over 30 boiler operating days.
(1) For any exceedance of the 30-boiler operating day PM CPMS average value from the established operating parameter limit for an EGU subject to the emissions limits in Table 1 to this subpart, you must:
(i) Within 48 hours of the exceedance, visually inspect the air pollution control device (APCD);
(ii) If the inspection of the APCD identifies the cause of the exceedance, take corrective action as soon as possible, and return the PM CPMS measurement to within the established value; and
(iii) Within 45 days of the exceedance or at the time of the annual compliance test, whichever comes first, conduct a PM emissions compliance test to determine compliance with the PM emissions limit and to verify or re-establish the CPMS operating limit. You are not required to conduct any additional testing for any exceedances that occur between the time of the original exceedance and the PM emissions compliance test required under this paragraph.
(2) PM CPMS exceedances of the operating limit for an EGU subject to the emissions limits in Table 1 of this subpart leading to more than four required performance tests in a 12-month period (rolling monthly) constitute a separate violation of this subpart.
(d) If you use quarterly performance testing to demonstrate compliance with one or more applicable emissions limits in Table 1 or 2 to this subpart, you
(1) May skip performance testing in those quarters during which less than 168 boiler operating hours occur, except that a performance test must be conducted at least once every calendar year.
(2) Must conduct the performance test as defined in Table 5 to this subpart and calculate the results of the testing in units of the applicable emissions standard; and
(3) Must conduct site-specific monitoring using CMS to demonstrate compliance with the site-specific monitoring requirements in Table 7 to this subpart pertaining to HCl and HF emissions from a liquid oil-fired EGU to ensure compliance with the HCl and HF emission limits in Tables 1 and 2 to this subpart, in accordance with the requirements of § 63.10000(c)(2)(iii). The monitoring must meet the general operating requirements provided in § 63.10020.
(e) Conduct periodic performance tune-ups of your EGU(s), as specified in paragraphs (e)(1) through (9) of this section. For your first tune-up, you may perform the burner inspection any time prior to the tune-up or you may delay the first burner inspection until the next scheduled EGU outage provided you meet the requirements of § 63.10005. Subsequently, you must perform an inspection of the burner at least once every 36 calendar months unless your EGU employs neural network combustion optimization during normal operations in which case you must perform an inspection of the burner and combustion controls at least once every 48 calendar months. If
your EGU is offline when a deadline to perform the tune-up passes, you shall perform the tune-up work practice requirements within 30 days after the re-start of the affected unit.
(1) As applicable, inspect the burner and combustion controls, and clean or replace any components of the burner or combustion controls as necessary upon initiation of the work practice program and at least once every required inspection period. Repair of a burner or combustion control component requiring special order parts may be scheduled as follows:
(i) Burner or combustion control component parts needing replacement that affect the ability to optimize NO
X
and CO must be installed within 3 calendar months after the burner inspection,
(ii) Burner or combustion control component parts that do not affect the ability to optimize NO
X
and CO may be installed on a schedule determined by the operator;
(2) As applicable, inspect the flame pattern and make any adjustments to the burner or combustion controls necessary to optimize the flame pattern. The adjustment should be consistent with the manufacturer's specifications, if available, or in accordance with best combustion engineering practice for that burner type;
(3) As applicable, observe the damper operations as a function of mill and/or cyclone loadings, cyclone and pulverizer coal feeder loadings, or other pulverizer and coal mill performance parameters, making adjustments and effecting repair to dampers, controls, mills, pulverizers, cyclones, and sensors;
(4) As applicable, evaluate windbox pressures and air proportions, making adjustments and effecting repair to dampers, actuators, controls, and sensors;
(5) Inspect the system controlling the air-to-fuel ratio and ensure that it is correctly calibrated and functioning properly. Such inspection may include calibrating excess O
2
probes and/or sensors, adjusting overfire air systems, changing software parameters, and calibrating associated actuators and dampers to ensure that the systems are operated as designed. Any component out of calibration, in or near failure, or in a state that is likely to negate combustion optimization efforts prior to the next tune-up, should be corrected or repaired as necessary;
(6) Optimize combustion to minimize generation of CO and NO
X
. This optimization should be consistent with the manufacturer's specifications, if available, or best combustion engineering practice for the applicable burner type. NO
X
optimization includes burners, overfire air controls, concentric firing system improvements, neural network or combustion efficiency software, control systems calibrations, adjusting combustion zone temperature profiles, and add-on controls such as SCR and SNCR; CO optimization includes burners, overfire air controls, concentric firing system improvements, neural network or combustion efficiency software, control systems calibrations, and adjusting combustion zone temperature profiles;
(7) While operating at full load or the predominantly operated load, measure the concentration in the effluent stream of CO and NO
X
in ppm, by volume, and oxygen in volume percent, before and after the tune-up adjustments are made (measurements may be either on a dry or wet basis, as long as it is the same basis before and after the adjustments are made). You may use portable CO, NO
X
and O
2
monitors for this measurement. EGU's employing neural network optimization systems need only provide a single pre- and post-tune-up value rather than continual values before and after each optimization adjustment made by the system;
(8) Maintain on-site and submit, if requested by the Administrator, an annual report containing the information in paragraphs (e)(1) through (e)(9) of this section including:
(i) The concentrations of CO and NO
X
in the effluent stream in ppm by volume, and oxygen in volume percent, measured before and after an adjustment of the EGU combustion systems;
(ii) A description of any corrective actions taken as a part of the combustion adjustment; and
(iii) The type(s) and amount(s) of fuel used over the 12 calendar months prior to an adjustment, but only if the unit
was physically and legally capable of using more than one type of fuel during that period; and
(9) Prior to January 1, 2024, report the tune-up date electronically, in a PDF file, in your semiannual compliance report, as specified in 40 CFR 63.10031(f)(4) and (6) and, if requested by the Administrator, in hard copy, as specified in 40 CFR 63.10031(f)(5). On and after January 1, 2024, report the tune-up date electronically in your quarterly compliance report, in accordance with 40 CFR 63.10031(g) and section 10.2 of appendix E to this subpart. The tune-up report date is the date when tune-up requirements in paragraphs (e)(6) and (7) of this section are completed.
(f) You must submit the applicable reports and notifications required under 40 CFR 63.10031(a) through (k) to the Administrator electronically, using EPA's Emissions Collection and Monitoring Plan System (ECMPS) Client Tool. If the final date of any time period (or any deadline) for any of these submissions falls on a weekend or a Federal holiday, the time period shall be extended to the next business day. Moreover, if the EPA Host System supporting the ECMPS Client Tool is offline and unavailable for submission of reports for any part of a day when a report would otherwise be due, the deadline for reporting is automatically extended until the first business day on which the system becomes available following the outage. Use of the ECMPS Client Tool to submit a report or notification required under this subpart satisfies any requirement under subpart A of this part to submit that same report or notification (or the information contained in it) to the appropriate EPA Regional office or state agency whose delegation request has been approved.
(g) You must report each instance in which you did not meet an applicable emissions limit or operating limit in Tables 1 through 4 to this subpart or failed to conduct a required tune-up. These instances are deviations from the requirements of this subpart. These deviations must be reported according to § 63.10031.
(h) You must follow the startup or shutdown requirements as given in Table 3 to this subpart for each coal-fired, liquid oil-fired, or solid oil-derived fuel-fired EGU.
(1) You may use the diluent cap and default gross output values, as described in § 63.10007(f), during startup periods or shutdown periods.
(2) You must operate all CMS, collect data, calculate pollutant emission rates, and record data during startup periods or shutdown periods.
(3) [Reserved]
(4) You may choose to submit an alternative non-opacity emission standard, in accordance with the requirements contained in § 63.10011(g)(4). Until promulgation in the
Federal Register
of the final alternative non-opacity emission standard, you shall comply with paragraph (1) of the definition of “startup” in § 63.10042.
(i) Before January 2, 2025, if you are relying on paragraph 2 of the definition of startup in 40 CFR 63.10042, you must provide reports concerning activities and periods of startup and shutdown that occur on or prior to January 1, 2024, in accordance with 40 CFR 63.10031(c)(5), in your semiannual compliance report. For startup and shutdown incidents that occur on and after January 1, 2024, you must provide the applicable information referenced in 40 CFR 63.10031(c)(5)(ii) and 40 CFR 63.10020(e) quarterly, in PDF files, in accordance with 40 CFR 63.10031(i). On or after January 2, 2025 you may not use paragraph 2 of the definition of startup in 40 CFR 63.10042.

§ 63.10022
How do I demonstrate continuous compliance under the emissions averaging provision?
(a) Following the compliance date, the owner or operator must demonstrate compliance with this subpart on a continuous basis by meeting the requirements of paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section.
(1) For each 30- (or 90-) day rolling average period, demonstrate compliance with the average weighted emissions limit for the existing units participating in the emissions averaging option as determined in § 63.10009(f) and (g);
(2) For each existing unit participating in the emissions averaging option that is equipped with PM CPMS, maintain the average parameter value at or below the operating limit established during the most recent performance test. On or after July 6, 2027 you may not use PM CPMS for filterable PM compliance demonstrations unless it is for an IGCC unit;
(3) For each existing unit participating in the emissions averaging option venting to a common stack configuration containing affected units from other subcategories, maintain the appropriate operating limit for each unit as specified in Table 4 to this subpart that applies. Since on or after July 6, 2027 you may not use PM CPMS, unless it is for an IGCC unit, for compliance demonstrations with the applicable filterable PM limits, the Table 4 p.m. CPMS operating limits do not apply.
(4) For each existing EGU participating in the emissions averaging option, operate in accordance with the startup or shutdown work practice requirements given in Table 3 to this subpart.
(b) Any instance where the owner or operator fails to comply with the continuous monitoring requirements in paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this section is a deviation.
[77 FR 9464, Feb. 16, 2012, as amended at 77 FR 23404, Apr. 19, 2012; 79 FR 68791, Nov. 19, 2014; 89 FR 38567, May 7, 2024]
§ 63.10023
How do I establish my PM CPMS operating limit and determine compliance with it?
The provisions of this section § 63.10023 are only applicable before July 6, 2027 unless it is for an IGCC unit. On or after July 6, 2027 you may not use PM CPMS, unless it is an IGCC unit, for demonstrating compliance with the filterable PM emissions limits of this subpart.
(a) During the initial performance test or any such subsequent performance test that demonstrates compliance with the filterable PM, individual non-mercury HAP metals, or total non-mercury HAP metals limit (or for liquid oil-fired units, individual HAP metals or total HAP metals limit, including Hg) in Table 1 or 2, record all hourly average output values (e.g., milliamps, stack concentration, or other raw data signal) from the PM CPMS for the periods corresponding to the test runs (e.g., nine 1-hour average PM CPMS output values for three 3-hour test runs).
(b) Determine your operating limit as provided in paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section. You must verify an existing or establish a new operating limit after each repeated performance test.
(1) [Reserved]
(2) Determine your operating limit as follows:
(i) If your PM performance test demonstrates your PM emissions do not exceed 75 percent of your emissions limit, you will use the average PM CPMS value recorded during the PM compliance test, the milliamp equivalent of zero output from your PM CPMS, and the average PM result of your compliance test to establish your operating limit. Calculate the operating limit by establishing a relationship of PM CPMS signal to PM concentration using the PM CPMS instrument zero, the average PM CPMS values corresponding to the three compliance test runs, and the average PM concentration from the Method 5 compliance test with the procedures in (b)(2)(i)(A) through (D) of this section.
(A) Determine your PM CPMS instrument zero output with one of the following procedures.
(
1
) Zero point data for in-situ instruments should be obtained by removing the instrument from the stack and monitoring ambient air on a test bench.
(
2
) Zero point data for extractive instruments should be obtained by removing the extractive probe from the stack and drawing in clean ambient air.
(
3
) The zero point can also can be obtained by performing manual reference method measurements when the flue gas is free of PM emissions or contains very low PM concentrations (e.g., when
your process is not operating, but the fans are operating or your source is combusting only natural gas) and plotting these with the compliance data to find the zero intercept.
(
4
) If none of the steps in paragraphs (A)(
1
) through (
3
) of this section are possible, you must use a zero output value provided by the manufacturer.
(B) Determine your PM CPMS instrument average (
x
) in milliamps, and the average of your corresponding three PM compliance test runs (
y
), using equation 10.
ER24AP13.010
Where:
X
i
= the PM CPMS data points for run i of the performance test,
Y
i
= the PM emissions value (in lb/MWh) for run i of the performance test, and
n = the number of data points.
(C) With your PM CPMS instrument zero expressed in milliamps, your three run average PM CPMS milliamp value, and your three run average PM emissions value (in lb/MWh) from your compliance runs, determine a relationship of PM lb/MWh per milliamp with equation 11.
ER24AP13.011
Where:
R = the relative PM lb/MWh per milliamp for your PM CPMS,
y
= the three run average PM lb/MWh,
y
x
= the three run average milliamp output from your PM CPMS, and
z = the milliamp equivalent of your instrument zero determined from (b)(2)(i)(A) of this section.
(D) Determine your source specific 30-day rolling average operating limit using the PM lb/MWh per milliamp value from equation 11 in equation 12, below. This sets your operating limit at the PM CPMS output value corresponding to 75 percent of your emission limit.
ER24AP13.012
Where:
O
L
= the operating limit for your PM CPMS on a 30-day rolling average, in milliamps,
L = your source PM emissions limit in lb/MWh,
z = your instrument zero in milliamps, determined from (b)(2)(i)(A) of this section, and
R = the relative PM lb/MWh per milliamp for your PM CPMS, from equation 11.
(ii) If your PM compliance test demonstrates your PM emissions exceed 75 percent of your emissions limit, you will use the average PM CPMS value recorded during the PM compliance test demonstrating compliance with the PM limit to establish your operating limit.
(A) Determine your operating limit by averaging the PM CPMS milliamp
output corresponding to your three PM performance test runs that demonstrate compliance with the emission limit using equation 13.
ER24AP13.013
Where:
X
i
= the PM CPMS data points for all runs i,
n = the number of data points, and
O
h
= your site specific operating limit, in milliamps.
(iii) Your PM CPMS must provide a 4-20 milliamp output and the establishment of its relationship to manual reference method measurements must be determined in units of milliamps.
(iv) Your PM CPMS operating range must be capable of reading PM concentrations from zero to a level equivalent to two times your allowable emission limit. If your PM CPMS is an auto-ranging instrument capable of multiple scales, the primary range of the instrument must be capable of reading PM concentration from zero to a level equivalent to two times your allowable emission limit.
(v) During the initial performance test or any such subsequent performance test that demonstrates compliance with the PM limit, record and average all milliamp output values from the PM CPMS for the periods corresponding to the compliance test runs.
(vi) For PM performance test reports used to set a PM CPMS operating limit, the electronic submission of the test report must also include the make and model of the PM CPMS instrument, serial number of the instrument, analytical principle of the instrument (e.g. beta attenuation), span of the instruments primary analytical range, milliamp value equivalent to the instrument zero output, technique by which this zero value was determined, and the average milliamp signal corresponding to each PM compliance test run.
(c) You must operate and maintain your process and control equipment such that the 30 operating day average PM CPMS output does not exceed the operating limit determined in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.

(8) A certification.
(9) If you have a deviation from any emission limit, work practice standard, or operating limit, you must also submit a brief description of the deviation, the duration of the deviation, emissions point identification, and the cause of the deviation.
(10) If you had any process or control equipment malfunction(s) during the reporting period, you must include the number, duration, and a brief description for each type of malfunction which occurred during the semiannual reporting period which caused or may have caused any applicable emission limitation to be exceeded.
(d) Excess emissions and deviation reporting. For EGUs whose owners or operators rely on a CMS to comply with an emissions or operating limit, the semiannual compliance reports described in paragraph (c) of this section must include the excess emissions and monitor downtime summary report described in 40 CFR 63.10(e)(3)(vi). However, starting with the first calendar quarter of 2024, reporting of the information under 40 CFR 63.10(e)(3)(vi) (and under paragraph (e)(3)(v), if the applicable excess emissions and/or monitor downtime threshold is exceeded) is discontinued for all CMS, and you must, instead, include in the quarterly compliance reports described in paragraph (g) of this section the applicable data elements in section 13 of appendix E to this subpart for any “deviation” (as defined in 40 CFR 63.10042 and elsewhere in this subpart) that occurred during the calendar quarter. If there were no deviations, you must include a statement to that effect in the quarterly compliance report.
(e) Each affected source that has obtained a title V operating permit pursuant to part 70 or part 71 of this chapter must report all deviations as defined in this subpart in the semiannual monitoring report required by 40 CFR 70.6(a)(3)(iii)(A) or 40 CFR 71.6(a)(3)(iii)(A). If an affected source submits a semiannual compliance report pursuant to paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, or two quarterly compliance reports covering the appropriate calendar half pursuant to paragraph (g) of this section, along with, or as part of, the semiannual monitoring report required by 40 CFR 70.6(a)(3)(iii)(A) or 40 CFR 71.6(a)(3)(iii)(A), and the compliance report(s) includes all required information concerning deviations from any emission limit, operating limit, or work practice requirement in this subpart, submission of the compliance report(s) satisfies any obligation to report the same deviations in the semiannual monitoring report. Submission of the compliance report(s) does not otherwise affect any obligation the affected source may have to report deviations from permit requirements to the permit authority.
(f) For each performance stack test completed prior to January 1, 2024, (including 30- (or 90-) boiler operating day Hg LEE demonstration tests and PM tests to establish operating limits for PM CPMS), you must submit a PDF test report in accordance with paragraph (f)(6) of this section, no later than 60 days after the date on which the testing is completed. For each test completed on or after January 1, 2024, in accordance with 40 CFR 63.10031(g), submit the applicable reference method information in sections 17 through 31 of appendix E to this subpart along with the quarterly compliance report for the calendar quarter in which the test was completed.
(1) For each RATA of an Hg, HCl, HF, or SO
2
monitoring system completed prior to January 1, 2024, and for each PM CEMS correlation test, each relative response audit (RRA) and each response correlation audit (RCA) of a PM CEMS completed prior to that date, you must submit a PDF test report in accordance with paragraph (f)(6) of this section, no later than 60 days after the date on which the test is completed. For each SO
2
or Hg RATA completed on or after January 1, 2024, you must submit the applicable reference method information in sections 17 through 31 of appendix E to this subpart prior to or concurrent with the
relevant quarterly emissions report. For HCl or HF RATAs, and for correlation tests, RRAs, and RCAs of PM CEMS that are completed on or after January 1, 2024, submit the appendix E reference method information together with the summarized electronic test results, in accordance with section 11.4 of appendix B to this subpart or section 7.2.4 of appendix C to this part, as applicable.
(2) If, for a particular EGU or a group of EGUs serving a common stack, you have elected to demonstrate compliance using a PM CEMS, an approved HAP metals CMS, or a PM CPMS (on or after July 6, 2027 you may not use PM CPMS for compliance demonstrations, unless it is for an IGCC unit), you must submit quarterly PDF reports in accordance with paragraph (f)(6) of this section, which include all of the 30-boiler operating day rolling average emission rates derived from the CEMS data or the 30-boiler operating day rolling average responses derived from the PM CPMS data (as applicable). The quarterly reports are due within 60 days after the reporting periods ending on March 31st, June 30th, September 30th, and December 31st. Submission of these quarterly reports in PDF files shall end with the report that covers the fourth calendar quarter of 2023. Beginning with the first calendar quarter of 2024, the compliance averages shall no longer be reported separately, but shall be incorporated into the quarterly compliance reports described in paragraph (g) of this section. In addition to the compliance averages for PM CEMS, PM CPMS, and/or HAP metals CMS, the quarterly compliance reports described in paragraph (g) of this section must also include the 30- (or, if applicable 90-) boiler operating day rolling average emission rates for Hg, HCl, HF, and/or SO

Fossil fuel-fired
means an electric utility steam generating unit (EGU) that is capable of producing more than 25 MW of electrical output from the combustion of fossil fuels. To be “capable of combusting” fossil fuels, an
EGU would need to have these fuels allowed in its operating permit and have the appropriate fuel handling facilities on-site or otherwise available (
e.g.,
coal handling equipment, including coal storage area, belts and conveyers, pulverizers, etc.; oil storage facilities). In addition, fossil fuel-fired means any EGU that fired fossil fuels for more than 10.0 percent of the average annual heat input during the 3 previous calendar years after the compliance date for your facility in § 63.9984 or for more than 15.0 percent of the annual heat input during any one of those calendar years. EGU owners and operators must estimate coal, oil, and natural gas usage for the first 3 calendar years after the applicable compliance date and they are solely responsible for assuring compliance with this final rule or other applicable standard based on their fuel usage projections. After the first 3 years of compliance, EGUs are required to evaluate applicability based on coal or oil usage from the three previous calendars years on an annual rolling basis.

Shutdown ends when the EGU no longer generates electricity or makes useful thermal energy (such as steam or heat) for industrial, commercial, heating, or cooling purposes, and no fuel is being fired in the EGU. Any fraction of an hour in which shutdown occurs constitutes a full hour of shutdown.
Startup
means:
(1) The first-ever firing of fuel in a boiler for the purpose of producing electricity, or the firing of fuel in a boiler after a shutdown event for any purpose. Startup ends when any of the steam from the boiler is used to generate electricity for sale over the grid or for any other purpose (including on-site use). Any fraction of an hour in which startup occurs constitutes a full hour of startup.
(2) Alternatively, prior to January 2, 2025, the period in which operation of an EGU is initiated for any purpose. Startup begins with either the firing of any fuel in an EGU for the purpose of producing electricity or useful thermal energy (such as heat or steam) for industrial, commercial, heating, or cooling purposes (other than the first-ever firing of fuel in a boiler following construction of the boiler) or for any other purpose after a shutdown event.

On or after January 2, 2025 you may not choose to use paragraph (2) of the definition of startup in § 63.10042 and the following associated work practice standards in paragraph (2).
(1) If you choose to comply using paragraph (1) of the definition of “startup” in § 63.10042, you must operate all CMS during startup. Startup means either the first-ever firing of fuel in a boiler for the purpose of producing electricity, or the firing of fuel in a boiler after a shutdown event for any purpose. Startup ends when any of the steam from the boiler is used to generate electricity for sale over the grid or for any other purpose (including on site use). For startup of a unit, you must use clean fuels as defined in § 63.10042 for ignition. Once you convert to firing coal, residual oil, or solid oil-derived fuel, you must engage all of the applicable control technologies except dry scrubber and SCR. You must start your dry scrubber and SCR systems, if present, appropriately to comply with relevant standards applicable during normal operation. You must comply with all applicable emissions limits at all times except for periods that meet the applicable definitions of startup and shutdown in this subpart. You must keep records during startup periods. You must provide reports concerning activities and startup periods, as specified in § 63.10011(g) and § 63.10021(h) and (i). If you elect to use paragraph (2) of the definition of startup in 40 CFR 63.10042, you must report the applicable information in 40 CFR 63.10031(c)(5) concerning startup periods as follows: For startup periods that occur on or prior to December 31, 2023, in PDF files in the semiannual compliance report; for startup periods that occur on or after January 1, 2024, quarterly, in PDF files, according to 40 CFR 63.10031(i).
(2) If you choose to comply using paragraph (2) of the definition of “startup” in § 63.10042, you must operate all CMS during startup. You must also collect appropriate data, and you must calculate the pollutant emission rate for each hour of startup.
For startup of an EGU, you must use one or a combination of the clean fuels defined in § 63.10042 to the maximum extent possible, taking into account considerations such as boiler or control device integrity, throughout the startup period. You must have sufficient clean fuel capacity to engage and operate your PM control device within one hour of adding coal, residual oil, or solid oil-derived fuel to the unit. You must meet the startup period work practice requirements as identified in § 63.10020(e).
Once you start firing coal, residual oil, or solid oil-derived fuel, you must vent emissions to the main stack(s). You must comply with the applicable emission limits beginning with the hour after startup ends. You must engage and operate your PM control(s) within 1 hour of first firing of coal, residual oil, or solid oil-derived fuel.
You must start all other applicable control devices as expeditiously as possible, considering safety and manufacturer/supplier recommendations, but, in any case, when necessary to comply with other standards made applicable to the EGU by a permit limit or a rule other than this subpart that require operation of the control devices.
b. Relative to the syngas not fired in the combustion turbine of an IGCC EGU during startup, you must either: (1) Flare the syngas, or (2) route the syngas to duct burners, which may need to be installed, and route the flue gas from the duct burners to the heat recovery steam generator.
c. If you choose to use just one set of sorbent traps to demonstrate compliance with the applicable Hg emission limit, you must comply with the limit at all times; otherwise, you must comply with the applicable emission limit at all times except for startup and shutdown periods.
d. You must collect monitoring data during startup periods, as specified in § 63.10020(a) and (e). You must keep records during startup periods, as provided in §§ 63.10021(h) and 63.10032. You must provide reports concerning activities and startup periods, as specified in §§ 63.10011(g), 63.10021(i), and 63.10031. Before January 2, 2025, if you elect to use paragraph (2) of the definition of startup in 40 CFR 63.10042, you must report the applicable information in 40 CFR 63.10031(c)(5) concerning startup periods as follows: For startup periods that occur on or prior to December 31, 2023, in PDF files in the semiannual compliance report; for startup periods that occur on or after January 1, 2024, quarterly, in PDF files, according to 40 CFR 63.10031(i). On or after January 2, 2025 you may not use paragraph (2) of the definition of startup in § 63.10042.
4. A coal-fired, liquid oil-fired (excluding limited-use liquid oil-fired subcategory units), or solid oil-derived fuel-fired EGU during shutdown
You must operate all CMS during shutdown. You must also collect appropriate data, and you must calculate the pollutant emission rate for each hour of shutdown for those pollutants for which a CMS is used.
While firing coal, residual oil, or solid oil-derived fuel during shutdown, you must vent emissions to the main stack(s) and operate all applicable control devices and continue to operate those control devices after the cessation of coal, residual oil, or solid oil-derived fuel being fed into the EGU and for as long as possible thereafter considering operational and safety concerns. In any case, you must operate your controls when necessary to comply with other standards made applicable to the EGU by a permit limit or a rule other than this subpart and that require operation of the control devices.
If, in addition to the fuel used prior to initiation of shutdown, another fuel must be used to support the shutdown process, that additional fuel must be one or a combination of the clean fuels defined in § 63.10042 and must be used to the maximum extent possible, taking into account considerations such as not compromising boiler or control device integrity.
Relative to the syngas not fired in the combustion turbine of an IGCC EGU during shutdown, you must either: (1) Flare the syngas, or (2) route the syngas to duct burners, which may need to be installed, and route the flue gas from the duct burners to the heat recovery steam generator.
You must comply with all applicable emission limits at all times except during startup periods and shutdown periods at which time you must meet this work practice. You must collect monitoring data during shutdown periods, as specified in § 63.10020(a). You must keep records during shutdown periods, as provided in §§ 63.10032 and 63.10021(h). Any fraction of an hour in which shutdown occurs constitutes a full hour of shutdown. You must provide reports concerning activities and shutdown periods, as specified in §§ 63.10011(g), 63.10021(i), and 63.10031. Before January 2, 2025, if you elect to use paragraph (2) of the definition of startup in 40 CFR 63.10042, you must report the applicable information in 40 CFR 63.10031(c)(5) concerning shutdown periods as follows: For shutdown periods that occur on or prior to December 31, 2023, in PDF files in the semiannual compliance report; for shutdown periods that occur on or after January 1, 2024, quarterly, in PDF files, according to 40 CFR 63.10031(i). On or after January 2, 2025 you may not use paragraph (2) of the definition of startup in § 63.10042.

Monitoring System Installation Requirements.
Flue gases from the affected units under this subpart vent to the atmosphere through a variety of exhaust configurations including single stacks, common stack configurations, and multiple stack configurations. For each of these configurations, § 63.10010(a) specifies the appropriate location(s) at which to install continuous monitoring systems (CMS). These CMS installation provisions apply to the Hg CEMS, sorbent trap monitoring systems, and other continuous monitoring systems that provide data for the Hg emissions calculations in section 6.2 of this appendix.
2.2
Primary and Backup Monitoring Systems.
In the electronic monitoring plan described in section 7.1.1.2.1 of this appendix, you must designate a primary Hg CEMS or sorbent trap monitoring system. The primary system must be used to report hourly Hg concentration values when the system is able to provide quality-assured data,
i.e.,
when the system is “in control”. However, to increase data availability in the event of a primary monitoring system outage, you may install, operate, maintain, and calibrate backup monitoring systems, as follows:
2.2.1
Redundant Backup Systems.
A redundant backup monitoring system may be either a separate Hg CEMS with its own probe, sample interface, and analyzer, or a separate sorbent trap monitoring system. A redundant backup system is one that is permanently installed at the unit or stack location, and is kept on “hot standby” in case the primary monitoring system is unable to provide quality-assured data. A redundant backup system must be represented as a unique monitoring system in the electronic monitoring plan. Each redundant backup monitoring system must be certified according to the applicable provisions in section 4 of this appendix and must meet the applicable on-going QA requirements in section 5 of this appendix.
2.2.2
Non-redundant Backup Monitoring Systems.
A non-redundant backup monitoring system is a separate Hg CEMS or sorbent trap system that has been certified at a particular unit or stack location, but is not permanently installed at that location. Rather, the system is kept on “cold standby” and may be reinstalled in the event of a primary monitoring system outage. A non-redundant backup monitoring system must be represented as a unique monitoring system in the electronic monitoring plan. Non-redundant backup Hg CEMS must complete the same certification tests as the primary monitoring system, with one exception. The 7-day calibration error test is not required for a non-redundant backup Hg CEMS. Except as
otherwise provided in section 2.2.4.5 of this appendix, a non-redundant backup monitoring system may only be used for 720 hours per year at a particular unit or stack location.
2.2.3
Temporary Like-kind Replacement Analyzers.
When a primary Hg analyzer needs repair or maintenance, you may temporarily install a like-kind replacement analyzer, to minimize data loss. Except as otherwise provided in section 2.2.4.5 of this appendix, a temporary like-kind replacement analyzer may only be used for 720 hours per year at a particular unit or stack location. The analyzer must be represented as a component of the primary Hg CEMS, and must be assigned a 3-character component ID number, beginning with the prefix “LK”.
2.2.4
Quality Assurance Requirements for Non-redundant Backup Monitoring Systems and Temporary Like-kind Replacement Analyzers.
To quality-assure the data from non-redundant backup Hg monitoring systems and temporary like-kind replacement Hg analyzers, the following provisions apply:
2.2.4.1 When a certified non-redundant backup sorbent trap monitoring system is brought into service, you must follow the procedures for routine day-to-day operation of the system, in accordance with Performance Specification (PS) 12B in appendix B to part 60 of this chapter.
2.2.4.2 When a certified non-redundant backup Hg CEMS or a temporary like-kind replacement Hg analyzer is brought into service, a calibration error test and a linearity check must be performed and passed. A single point system integrity check is also required, unless a NIST-traceable source of oxidized Hg was used for the calibration error test.
2.2.4.3 Each non-redundant backup Hg CEMS or temporary like-kind replacement Hg analyzer shall comply with all required daily, weekly, and quarterly quality-assurance test requirements in section 5 of this appendix, for as long as the system or analyzer remains in service.
2.2.4.4 For the routine, on-going quality-assurance of a non-redundant backup Hg monitoring system, a relative accuracy test audit (RATA) must be performed and passed at least once every 8 calendar quarters at the unit or stack location(s) where the system will be used.
2.2.4.5 To use a non-redundant backup Hg monitoring system or a temporary like-kind replacement analyzer for more than 720 hours per year at a particular unit or stack location, a RATA must first be performed and passed at that location.

# 3. Mercury Emissions Measurement Methods
The following definitions, equipment specifications, procedures, and performance criteria are applicable to the measurement of vapor-phase Hg emissions from electric utility steam generating units, under relatively low-dust conditions (
i.e.
, sampling in the stack or duct after all pollution control devices). The analyte measured by these procedures and specifications is total vapor-phase Hg in the flue gas, which represents the sum of elemental Hg (Hg
0
, CAS Number 7439-97-6) and oxidized forms of Hg.
3.1
Definitions.
3.1.1
Mercury Continuous Emission Monitoring System or Hg CEMS
means all of the equipment used to continuously determine the total vapor phase Hg concentration. The measurement system may include the following major subsystems: sample acquisition, Hg
+ 2
to Hg
0
converter, sample transport, sample conditioning, flow control/gas manifold, gas analyzer, and data acquisition and handling system (DAHS). Hg CEMS may be nominally real-time or time-integrated, batch sampling systems that sample the gas on an intermittent basis and concentrate on a collection medium before intermittent analysis and reporting.
3.1.2
Sorbent Trap Monitoring System
means the equipment required to monitor Hg emissions continuously by using paired sorbent traps containing iodated charcoal (IC) or other suitable sorbent medium. The monitoring system consists of a probe, paired sorbent traps, an umbilical line, moisture removal components, an airtight sample pump, a gas flow meter, and an automated data acquisition and handling system. The system samples the stack gas at a constant proportional rate relative to the stack gas volumetric flow rate. The sampling is a batch process. The average Hg concentration in the stack gas for the sampling period is determined, in units of micrograms per dry standard cubic meter (µg/dscm), based on the sample volume measured by the gas flow meter and the mass of Hg collected in the sorbent traps.
3.1.3

3.1.12
Calibration Error Test
means a test designed to assess the ability of a Hg CEMS to measure the concentrations of calibration gases accurately. A zero-level gas and an upscale gas are required for this test. For the upscale gas, either a mid-level gas or a high-level gas may be used, and the gas may either be an elemental or oxidized Hg standard.
3.1.13
Linearity Check

3.1.14
System Integrity Check
means a test designed to assess the transport and measurement of oxidized Hg by a Hg CEMS. Oxidized Hg standards are used for this test. For a three-level system integrity check, low, mid, and high-level calibration gases are required. For a single-level check, either a mid-level gas or a high-level gas may be used.
3.1.15
Cycle Time Test
means a test designed to measure the amount of time it takes for a Hg CEMS, while operating normally, to respond to a known step change in gas concentration. For this test, a zero gas and a high-level gas are required. The high-level gas may be either an elemental or an oxidized Hg standard.
3.1.16
Relative Accuracy Test Audit
or
RATA
means a series of nine or more test runs, directly comparing readings from a Hg CEMS or sorbent trap monitoring system to measurements made with a reference stack test method. The relative accuracy (RA) of the monitoring system is expressed as the absolute mean difference between the monitoring system and reference method measurements plus the absolute value of the 2.5 percent error confidence coefficient, divided by the mean value of the reference method measurements.

3.2
Continuous Monitoring Methods.
3.2.1
Hg CEMS.
A typical Hg CEMS is shown in Figure A-1. The CEMS in Figure A-1 is a dilution extractive system, which measures Hg concentration on a wet basis, and is the most commonly-used type of Hg CEMS. Other system designs may be used, provided that the CEMS meets the performance specifications in section 4.1.1 of this appendix.
ER16FE12.012
3.2.1.1
Equipment Specifications.
3.2.1.1.1
Materials of Construction.
All wetted sampling system components, including probe components prior to the point at which the calibration gas is introduced, must be chemically inert to all Hg species. Materials such as perfluoroalkoxy (PFA) Teflon
TM
, quartz, and treated stainless steel (SS) are examples of such materials.
3.2.1.1.2
Temperature Considerations.
All system components prior to the Hg
+2
to Hg
0
converter must be maintained at a sample temperature above the acid gas dew point.
3.2.1.1.3
Measurement System Components.
3.2.1.1.3.1
Sample Probe.
The probe must be made of the appropriate materials as noted in paragraph 3.2.1.1.1 of this section, heated when necessary, as described in paragraph 3.2.1.1.3.4 of this section, and configured with ports for introduction of calibration gases.
3.2.1.1.3.2
Filter or Other Particulate Removal Device.
The filter or other particulate removal device is part of the measurement system, must be made of appropriate materials, as noted in paragraph 3.2.1.1.1 of this section, and must be included in all system tests.
3.2.1.1.3.3
Sample Line.
The sample line that connects the probe to the converter, conditioning system, and analyzer must be made of appropriate materials, as noted in paragraph 3.2.1.1.1 of this section.
3.2.1.1.3.4
Conditioning Equipment.
For wet basis systems, such as the one shown in Figure A-1, the sample must be kept above its dew point either by: heating the sample line and all sample transport components up to the inlet of the analyzer (and, for hot-wet extractive systems, also heating the analyzer); or diluting the sample prior to analysis using a dilution probe system. The components required for these operations are considered to be conditioning equipment. For dry basis measurements, a condenser, dryer or other suitable device is required to remove moisture continuously from the sample gas, and any equipment needed to heat the probe or sample line to avoid condensation prior to the moisture removal component is also required.
3.2.1.1.3.5
Sampling Pump.
A pump is needed to push or pull the sample gas through the system at a flow rate sufficient to minimize the response time of the measurement system. If a mechanical sample pump is used and its surfaces are in contact with the sample gas prior to detection, the pump must be leak free and must be constructed of a material that is non-reactive to the gas being sampled (see paragraph 3.2.1.1.1 of this section). For dilution-type measurement systems, such as the system shown in Figure A-1, an ejector pump (eductor) may be used to create a sufficient vacuum that sample gas will be drawn through a critical orifice at a constant rate. The ejector pump must be constructed of any material that is non-reactive to the gas being sampled.
3.2.1.1.3.6
Calibration Gas System(s).
Design and equip each Hg CEMS to permit the introduction of known concentrations of elemental Hg and HgCl
2
separately, at a point
preceding the sample extraction filtration system, such that the entire measurement system can be checked. The calibration gas system(s) must be designed so that the flow rate exceeds the sampling system flow requirements and that the gas is delivered to the CEMS at atmospheric pressure.
3.2.1.1.3.7
Sample Gas Delivery.
The sample line may feed directly to either a converter, a by-pass valve (for Hg speciating systems), or a sample manifold. All valve and/or manifold components must be made of material that is non-reactive to the gas sampled and the calibration gas, and must be configured to safely discharge any excess gas.
3.2.1.1.3.8
Hg Analyzer.
An instrument is required that continuously measures the total vapor phase Hg concentration in the gas stream. The analyzer may also be capable of measuring elemental and oxidized Hg separately.
3.2.1.1.3.9
Data Recorder.
A recorder, such as a computerized data acquisition and handling system (DAHS), digital recorder, or data logger, is required for recording measurement data.
3.2.1.2
Reagents and Standards.
3.2.1.2.1
NIST Traceability.
Only NIST-certified or NIST-traceable calibration gas standards and reagents (as defined in paragraphs 3.1.4 and 3.1.5 of this appendix), and including, but not limited to, Hg gas generators and Hg gas cylinders, shall be used for the tests and procedures required under this subpart. Calibration gases with known concentrations of Hg
0
and HgCl
2
are required. Special reagents and equipment may be needed to prepare the Hg
0
and HgCl
2
gas standards (
e.g.,
NIST-traceable solutions of HgCl
2
and gas generators equipped with mass flow controllers).
3.2.1.2.2
Required Calibration Gas Concentrations.
3.2.1.2.2.1
Zero-Level Gas.
A zero-level calibration gas with a Hg concentration below the level detectable by the Hg analyzer is required for calibration error tests and cycle time tests of the CEMS.
3.2.1.2.2.2
Low-Level Gas.
A low-level calibration gas with a Hg concentration of 20 to 30 percent of the span value is required for linearity checks and 3-level system integrity checks of the CEMS. Elemental Hg standards are required for the linearity checks and oxidized Hg standards are required for the system integrity checks.
3.2.1.2.2.3
Mid-Level Gas.
A mid-level calibration gas with a Hg concentration of 50 to 60 percent of the span value is required for linearity checks and for 3-level system integrity checks of the CEMS, and is optional for calibration error tests and single-level system integrity checks. Elemental Hg standards are required for the linearity checks, oxidized Hg standards are required for the system integrity checks, and either elemental or oxidized Hg standards may be used for the calibration error tests.
3.2.1.2.2.4
High-Level Gas.
A high-level calibration gas with a Hg concentration of 80 to 100 percent of the span value is required for linearity checks, 3-level system integrity checks, and cycle time tests of the CEMS, and is optional for calibration error tests and single-level system integrity checks. Elemental Hg standards are required for the linearity checks, oxidized Hg standards are required for the system integrity checks, and either elemental or oxidized Hg standards may be used for the calibration error and cycle time tests.
3.2.1.3
Installation and Measurement Location.
For the Hg CEMS and any additional monitoring system(s) needed to convert Hg concentrations to the desired units of measure (
i.e.
, a flow monitor, CO
2
or O
2
monitor, and/or moisture monitor, as applicable), install each monitoring system at a location: that is consistent with 63.10010(a); that represents the emissions exiting to the atmosphere; and where it is likely that the CEMS can pass the relative accuracy test.
3.2.1.4
Monitor Span and Range Requirements.
Determine the appropriate span and range value(s) for the Hg CEMS as described in paragraphs 3.2.1.4.1 through 3.2.1.4.3 of this section.
3.2.1.4.1
Maximum Potential Concentration.
There are three options for determining the maximum potential Hg concentration (MPC). Option 1 applies to coal combustion. You may use a default value of 10 µg/scm for all coal ranks (including coal refuse) except for lignite; for lignite, use 16 µg/scm. If different coals are blended as part of normal operation, use the highest MPC for any fuel in the blend. Option 2 is to base the MPC on the results of site-specific Hg emission testing. This option may be used only if the unit does not have add-on Hg emission controls or a flue gas desulfurization system, or if testing is performed upstream of all emission control devices. If Option 2 is selected, perform at least three test runs at the normal operating load, and the highest Hg concentration obtained in any of the tests shall be the MPC. Option 3 is to use fuel sampling and analysis to estimate the MPC. To make this estimate, use the average Hg content (
i.e.,
the weight percentage) from at least three representative fuel samples, together with other available information, including, but not limited to the maximum fuel feed rate, the heating value of the fuel, and an appropriate F-factor. Assume that all of the Hg in the fuel is emitted to the atmosphere as vapor-phase Hg.
3.2.1.4.2
Span Value.
To determine the span value of the Hg CEMS, multiply the Hg concentration corresponding to the applicable emissions standard by two. If the result of this calculation is an exact multiple of 10
µg/scm, use the result as the span value. Otherwise, round off the result to either: the next highest integer; the next highest multiple of 5 µg/scm; or the next highest multiple of 10 µg/scm.
3.2.1.4.3
Analyzer Range.
The Hg analyzer must be capable of reading Hg concentration as high as the MPC.
3.2.2
Sorbent Trap Monitoring System.
A sorbent trap monitoring system (as defined in paragraph 3.1.2 of this section) may be used as an alternative to a Hg CEMS. If this option is selected, the monitoring system shall be installed, maintained, and operated in accordance with Performance Specification (PS) 12B in Appendix B to part 60 of this chapter. The system shall be certified in accordance with the provisions of section 4.1.2 of this appendix.
3.2.3
Other Necessary Data Collection.
To convert measured hourly Hg concentrations to the units of the applicable emissions standard (
i.e.,
lb/TBtu or lb/GWh), additional data must be collected, as described in paragraphs 3.2.3.1 through 3.2.3.3 of this section. Any additional monitoring systems needed for this purpose must be certified, operated, maintained, and quality-assured according to the applicable provisions of part 75 of this chapter (see §§ 63.10010(b) through (d)). The calculation methods for the types of emission limits described in paragraphs 3.2.3.1 and 3.2.3.2 of this section are presented in section 6.2 of this appendix.
3.2.3.1
Heat Input-Based Emission Limits.
For a heat input-based Hg emission limit (
i.e.,
in lb/TBtu), data from a certified CO
2
or O
2
monitor are needed, along with a fuel-specific F-factor and a conversion constant to convert measured Hg concentration values to the units of the standard. In some cases, the stack gas moisture content must also be considered in making these conversions.
3.2.3.2
Electrical Output-Based Emission Rates.
If the applicable Hg limit is electrical output-based (
i.e.,
lb/GWh), hourly electrical load data and unit operating times are required in addition to hourly data from a certified stack gas flow rate monitor and (if applicable) moisture data.
3.2.3.3
Sorbent Trap Monitoring System Operation.
Routine operation of a sorbent trap monitoring system requires the use of a certified stack gas flow rate monitor, to maintain an established ratio of stack gas flow rate to sample flow rate.

# 4. Certification and Recertification Requirements
4.1
Certification Requirements.
All Hg CEMS and sorbent trap monitoring systems and the additional monitoring systems used to continuously measure Hg emissions in units of the applicable emissions standard in accordance with this appendix must be certified in a timely manner, such that the initial compliance demonstration is completed no later than the applicable date in § 63.9984(f).
4.1.1
Hg CEMS.
Table A-1, below, summarizes the certification test requirements and performance specifications for a Hg CEMS. The CEMS may not be used to report quality-assured data until these performance criteria are met. Paragraphs 4.1.1.1 through 4.1.1.5 of this section provide specific instructions for the required tests. All tests must be performed with the affected unit(s) operating (
i.e.,
combusting fuel). Except for the RATA, which must be performed at normal load, no particular load level is required for the certification tests.
4.1.1.1
7-Day Calibration Error Test.
Perform the 7-day calibration error test on 7 consecutive source operating days, using a zero-level gas and either a high-level or a mid-level calibration gas standard (as defined in paragraphs 3.1.8, 3.1.10, and 3.1.11 of this appendix). Use a NIST-traceable elemental Hg gas standard (as defined in paragraphs 3.1.4 of this appendix) for the test. If your Hg CEMS lacks an integrated elemental Hg gas generator, you may continue to use NIST-traceable oxidized Hg gases for the 7-day calibration error test (or the daily calibration error check) until such time as NIST-traceable compressed elemental Hg gas standards, at appropriate concentration levels, are available from gas vendors. If moisture is added to the calibration gas, the dilution effect of the moisture and/or chlorine addition on the calibration gas concentration must be accounted for in an appropriate manner. Operate the Hg CEMS in its normal sampling mode during the test. The calibrations should be approximately 24 hours apart, unless the 7-day test is performed over non-consecutive calendar days. On each day of the test, inject the zero-level and upscale gases in sequence and record the analyzer responses. Pass the calibration gas through all filters, scrubbers, conditioners, and other monitor components used during normal sampling, and through as much of the sampling probe as is practical. Do not make any manual adjustments to the monitor (
i.e.,
resetting the calibration) until after taking measurements at both the zero and upscale concentration levels. If automatic adjustments are made following both injections, conduct the calibration error test such that the magnitude of the adjustments can be determined, and use only the unadjusted analyzer responses in the calculations. Calculate the calibration error (CE) on each day of the test, as described in Table A-1 of this appendix. The CE on each day of the test must either meet the main performance specification or the alternative specification in Table A-1 of this appendix.
4.1.1.2
Linearity Check.
Perform the linearity check using low, mid, and high-level concentrations of NIST-traceable elemental Hg standards. Three gas injections at each
concentration level are required, with no two successive injections at the same concentration level. Introduce the calibration gas at the gas injection port, as specified in section 3.2.1.1.3.6 of this appendix. Operate the CEMS at its normal operating temperature and conditions. Pass the calibration gas through all filters, scrubbers, conditioners, and other components used during normal sampling, and through as much of the sampling probe as is practical. If moisture and/or chlorine is added to the calibration gas, the dilution effect of the moisture and/or chlorine addition on the calibration gas concentration must be accounted for in an appropriate manner. Record the monitor response from the data acquisition and handling system for each gas injection. At each concentration level, use the average analyzer response to calculate the linearity error (LE), as described in Table A-1. The LE must either meet the main performance specification or the alternative specification in Table A-1.
4.1.1.3
Three-Level System Integrity Check.
Perform the 3-level system integrity check using low, mid, and high-level calibration gas concentrations generated by a NIST-traceable source of oxidized Hg. If your Hg CEMS lacks an integrated elemental Hg gas generator, you may continue to use NIST-traceable oxidized Hg gases for the 7-day calibration error test (or the daily calibration error check) until such time as NIST-traceable compressed elemental Hg gas standards, at appropriate concentration levels, are available from gas vendors. Follow the same basic procedure as for the linearity check. If moisture and/or chlorine is added to the calibration gas, the dilution effect of the moisture and/or chlorine addition on the calibration gas concentration must be accounted for in an appropriate manner. Calculate the system integrity error (SIE), as described in Table A-1 of this appendix. The SIE must either meet the main performance specification or the alternative specification in Table A-1 of this appendix.

4.1.1.4
Cycle Time Test.
Perform the cycle time test, using a zero-level gas and a high-level calibration gas.
Either an elemental or oxidized NIST-traceable Hg standard may be used as the high-level gas. Perform the test in two stages—upscale and downscale. The slower of the upscale and downscale response times is the cycle time for the CEMS. Begin each stage of the test by injecting calibration gas
after achieving a stable reading of the stack emissions. The cycle time is the amount of time it takes for the analyzer to register a reading that is 95 percent of the way between the stable stack emissions reading and the final, stable reading of the calibration gas concentration. Use the following criterion to determine when a stable reading of stack emissions or calibration gas has been attained—the reading is stable if it changes by no more than 2.0 percent of the span value or 0.5 µg/scm (whichever is less restrictive) for two minutes, or a reading with a change of less than 6.0 percent from the measured average concentration over 6 minutes. Integrated batch sampling type Hg CEMS are exempted from this test; however, these systems must be capable of delivering a measured Hg concentration reading at least once every 15 minutes. If necessary to increase measurement sensitivity of a batch sampling type Hg CEMS for a specific application, you may petition the Administrator for approval of a time longer than 15 minutes between readings.
4.1.1.5
Relative Accuracy Test Audit (RATA).
Perform the RATA of the Hg CEMS at normal load. Acceptable Hg reference methods for the RATA include ASTM D6784-16 (IBR, see § 63.14) and methods 29, 30A, and 30B in appendix A-8 to part 60 of this chapter. When method 29 or ASTM D6784-16 is used, paired sampling trains are required, and the filterable portion of the sample need not be included when making comparisons to the Hg CEMS results for purposes of a RATA. To validate a method 29 or ASTM D6784-16 test run, calculate the relative deviation (RD) using equation A-1 of this section, and assess the results as follows to validate the run. The RD must not exceed 10 percent, when the average Hg concentration is greater than 1.0 µg/dscm. If the RD specification is met, the results of the two samples shall be averaged arithmetically.
