refers to title 40, part 52, section 1019.

# Explanation
The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.
Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:
Title 1 through Title 16
as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27
as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41
as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50
as of October 1
The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.

# LEGAL STATUS
The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

# HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS
The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, July 1, 2025), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

# EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES
Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.

# OMB CONTROL NUMBERS
The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request.
Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.

# PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE
Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.

# “[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY
The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not dropped in error.

# INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE
What is incorporation by reference?
Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.
What is a proper incorporation by reference?
The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:
(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.
(b) The matter incorporated is adequately summarized in the preamble of the final rule and is available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.
(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?
If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or email fr.inspection@nara.gov.

# CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES
A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR
Index and Finding Aids.
This volume contains the Parallel Table of Authorities and Rules. A list of CFR titles, chapters, subchapters, and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in this volume.
An index to the text of “Title 3—The President” is carried within that volume.
The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. This index is based on a consolidation of the “Contents” entries in the daily Federal Register.
A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

# REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL
There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing in the Code of Federal Regulations.

§ 52.1022
Approval status.
(a) With the exceptions set forth in this subpart, the Administrator approves Maine's plan, as identified in § 52.1020, for the attainment and maintenance of the national standards under section 110 of the Clean Air Act.
(b)(1) Insofar as the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) provisions found in this subpart apply to stationary sources of greenhouse gas (GHGs) emissions, the Administrator approves that application only to the extent that GHGs are “subject to regulation”, as provided in this paragraph (b), and the Administrator takes no action on that application to the extent that GHGs are not “subject to regulation.”
(2) Beginning January 2, 2011, the pollutant GHGs is subject to regulation if:
(i) The stationary source is a new major stationary source for a regulated
NSR pollutant that is not GHGs, and also will emit or will have the potential to emit 75,000 tpy CO
2
e or more; or
(ii) The stationary source is an existing major stationary source for a regulated NSR pollutant that is not GHGs, and also will have an emissions increase of a regulated NSR pollutant, and an emissions increase of 75,000 tpy CO
2
e or more; and,
(3) Beginning July 1, 2011, in addition to the provisions in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the pollutant GHGs shall also be subject to regulation:
(i) At a new stationary source that will emit or have the potential to emit 100,000 tpy CO
2
e; or
(ii) At an existing stationary source that emits or has the potential to emit 100,000 tpy CO
2
e, when such stationary source undertakes a physical change or change in the method of operation that will result in an emissions increase of 75,000 tpy CO
2
e or more.
(4) For purposes of this paragraph (b)—
(i) The term greenhouse gas shall mean the air pollutant defined in 40 CFR 86.1818-12(a) as the aggregate group of six greenhouse gases: Carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, methane, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, and sulfur hexafluoride.
(ii) The term tpy CO
2
equivalent emissions (CO
2
e) shall represent an amount of GHGs emitted, and shall be computed as follows:
(A) Multiplying the mass amount of emissions (tpy), for each of the six greenhouse gases in the pollutant GHGs, by the gas's associated global warming potential published at Table A-1 to subpart A of 40 CFR part 98—Global Warming Potentials.
(B) Sum the resultant value from paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(A) of this section for each gas to compute a tpy CO
2
e.
(iii) the term emissions increase shall mean that both a significant emissions increase (as calculated using the procedures in 06-096 1. of Chapter 100 of Maine's Bureau of Air Quality Control regulations) and a significant net emissions increase (as defined in 06-096, paragraphs 89 and 144 A of Chapter 100 of Maine's Bureau of Air Quality Control regulations) occur. For the pollutant GHGs, an emissions increase shall be based on tpy CO
2
e, and shall be calculated assuming the pollutant GHGs is a regulated NSR pollutant, and “significant” is defined as 75,000 tpy CO
2
e instead of applying the value in 06-096, paragraphs 143 and 144 D of Chapter 100 of Maine's Bureau of Air Quality Control regulations.
[75 FR 82555, Dec. 30, 2010]

highway mobile emissions inventories and the 2005 motor vehicle emissions budgets for the one-hour ozone attainment plans for the Baltimore severe ozone nonattainment area and the Cecil County portion of the Philadelphia-Wilmington-Trenton severe ozone nonattainment area. These revisions were submitted by the Maryland Department of the Environment on September 2, 2003. Submission of these revised MOBILE6-based motor vehicle emissions inventories was a requirement of EPA's approval of the attainment demonstration under paragraphs (h) and (k) of this section.
(n) EPA approves revisions to the Maryland State Implementation Plan for Post-1996 Rate of Progress (ROP)
Plans for the Baltimore severe 1-hour ozone nonattainment area. These revisions were submitted by the Secretary of the Maryland Department of the Environment on December 23, 2003 and consist of the following:
(1) Revisions to the base year 1990 emissions inventory which reflect the use of the MOBILE6 motor vehicle emissions model. These revisions establish motor vehicle emissions inventories for 1990 of 165.14 tons per day of volatile organic compounds (VOC) and 228.21 tons per day of oxides of nitrogen (NO
X
).
(2) Revisions to the year 2005 motor vehicle emissions budgets (MVEBs) for transportation conformity purposes, reflecting the use of the MOBILE6 motor vehicle emissions model. These revisions establish a motor vehicle emissions budget of 55 tons per day of volatile organic compounds (VOC) and 144.5 tons per day of oxides of nitrogen (NO
X
). EPA approved new 2005 MOBILE6-based MVEBs for the Baltimore area's 1-hour ozone attainment demonstration on October 27, 2003 (68 FR 61106). Those MVEBs became effective on November 26, 2003. The approved 2005 attainment plan MVEBs budgets are 55.3 tons per day of VOC and 146.9 tons per day of NO
X
. The MVEBs of the 2005 ROP plan are less than the MVEBs in the approved attainment demonstration. These more restrictive MVEBs, contained in the ROP plan, are the applicable MVEBs to be used in transportation conformity demonstrations for the year 2005 for the Baltimore area.
(3) Revisions to the 2005 ROP plan to reallocate some of the contingency measures established in prior SIP revisions to the control measures portion of the plan. EPA guidance allows states an additional year to adopt new contingency measures to replace those reallocated to the control measures portion of the plan. The State of Maryland's December 23, 2003 SIP revision submittal includes an enforceable commitment to replace those contingency measures reallocated to the control measures portion of the 2005 ROP plan and to submit these additional contingency measures by October 31, 2004.

§ 52.1122
[Reserved]
§ 52.1123
Approval status.
(a) With the exceptions set forth in this subpart the Administrator approves the Massachusetts plan as identified in § 52.1120 for attainment and maintenance of the national standards under section 110 of the Clean Air Act. Furthermore, the Administrator finds that the plan identified in § 52.1120 satisfies all requirements of Part D, Title I of the Clean Air Act as amended in 1977, except as noted below. In addition, continued satisfaction of the requirements of Part D of the ozone portion of the SIP depends on the adoption and submittal of RACT requirements by July 1, 1980 for the sources covered by CTGs issued between January 1978 and January 1979 and adoption and submittal by each subsequent January of additional RACT requirements for sourceovered by CTGs issued by the previous January.
(b) The above requirements for continued satisfaction of Part D are fulfilled by Massachusetts Regulation 310 CMR 7.18(17) and a narrative commitment to review CTG IIIs issued in the
future. Both were submitted on September 9, 1982. Additionally, each individual RACT determination made under 310 CMR 7.18(17) will be submitted as a SIP revision to incorporate the limitation into the SIP, and DEQE will propose regulations for CTG III category controls if the controls are appropriate for the State.
[45 FR 61303, Sept. 16, 1980, as amended at 48 FR 51485, Nov. 9, 1983]
§ 52.1124
Review of new sources and modifications.
(a) Revisions to Regulation 310 CMR 7.02(2)(d) submitted on March 30, 1979 are disapproved because they do not satisfy the requirements of § 51.161.
[39 FR 7281, Feb. 25, 1974, as amended at 40 FR 47495, Oct. 9, 1975; 45 FR 2043, Jan. 10, 1980; 51 FR 40677, Nov. 7, 1986; 60 FR 33923, June 29, 1995]
§ 52.1125
Emission inventories.
(a) The Governor's designee for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts submitted the 1990 base year emission inventories for the Springfield nonattainment area and the Massachusetts portion of the Boston-Lawrence-Worcester ozone nonattainment area on November 13, 1992 as a revision to the State Implementation Plan (SIP). Revisions to the inventories were submitted on November 15, 1993, and November 15, 1994, and March 31, 1997. The 1990 base year emission inventory requirement of section 182(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990, has been satisfied for these areas.
(b) The inventories are for the ozone precursors which are volatile organic compounds, nitrogen oxides, and carbon monoxide. The inventories covers point, area, non-road mobile, on-road mobile, and biogenic sources.
(c) Taken together, the Springfield nonattainment area and the Massachusetts portion of the Boston-Lawrence-Worcester nonattainment area encompass the entire geographic area of the State. Both areas are classified as serious ozone nonattainment areas.
(d) The state of Massachusetts submitted base year emission inventories representing emissions for calendar year 2002 from the Boston-Lawrence-Worcester moderate 8-hour ozone nonattainment area and the Springfield moderate 8-hour ozone nonattainment area on January 31, 2008 as revisions to the State's SIP. The 2002 base year emission inventory requirement of section 182(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990, has been satisfied for these areas. The inventories consist of emission estimates of volatile organic compounds and nitrogen oxides, and cover point, area, non-road mobile, on-road mobile and biogenic sources. The inventories were submitted as revisions to the SIP in partial fulfillment of obligations for nonattainment areas under EPA's 1997 8-hour ozone standard.
(e) The Commonwealth of Massachusetts submitted base year emission inventories representing emissions for calendar year 2011 for the Dukes county marginal 8-hour ozone nonattainment area on February 9, 2018, as a revision to the Massachusetts SIP. The 2011 base year emission inventory requirement of section 182(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990, has been satisfied for this area. The inventory consists of emission estimates of volatile organic compounds and nitrogen oxides, and applies to point, area, non-road mobile, on-road mobile and biogenic sources. The inventories were submitted as revisions to the Massachusetts SIP in partial fulfillment of obligations for nonattainment areas under EPA's 2008 8-hour ozone standard.
[62 FR 37514, July 14, 1997, as amended at 77 FR 50601, Aug. 22, 2012; 84 FR 7301, Mar. 4, 2019]

§ 52.1129
Control strategy: Ozone.
(a) Revisions to the State Implementation Plan submitted by the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection on April 1, 1999, and supplemented on June 25, 1999 and September 9, 1999. The revisions are for the purpose of satisfying the rate of progress requirements of sections 182(b)(1) and 182(c)(2)(B) of the Clean Air Act for the Springfield, Massachusetts serious ozone nonattainment area.
(b) Approval—Revisions to the State Implementation Plan submitted by the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection on July 27, 1998, October 1, 1998 and August 13, 1999. The revisions are for the purpose of satisfying the attainment demonstration requirements of section 182(c)(2)(A) of the Clean Air Act, for the Springfield (Western Massachusetts) serious ozone nonattainment area. The revision establishes an attainment date of December 31, 2003 for the Springfield, Massachusetts serious ozone nonattainment area. This revision establishes motor vehicle emissions budgets for 2003 of 23.77 tons per day of volatile organic compounds (VOC) and 49.11 tons per day of nitrogen oxides (NO
X
) to be used in transportation conformity in the Springfield, Massachusetts serious ozone nonattainment area.
(c) Revisions to the State Implementation Plan submitted by the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection on April 10, 2002 and amended on July 26, 2002. The revisions are for the purpose of satisfying the rate of progress requirements of sections 182(b)(1) and 182(c)(2)(B) of the Clean Air Act for the Massachusetts portion of the Boston-Lawrence-Worcester serious ozone nonattainment area.
(d) Approval—Revisions to the State Implementation Plan submitted by the Massachusetts Department of Environmental protection on July 27, 1998, and September 6, 2002. The revisions are for the purpose of satisfying the one-hour ozone attainment demonstration requirements of section 182(c)92)(A) of the Clean Air Act, for the Boston-Lawrence-Worcester, MA-NH serious ozone nonattainment area. The revision establishes a one-hour attainment date of November 15, 2007l, for the Boston-Lawrence-Worcester, MA-NH serious ozone nonattainment area. This revision establishes motor vehicle emissions budgets for 2007 of 86.7 tons per day of volatile organic compounds and 226.363 tons per day of nitrogen oxides to be used in transportation conformity in the Massachusetts portion of the Boston-Lawrence-Worcester, MA-NH serious ozone nonattainment area.
(e) Determination of Attainment for the One-Hour Ozone Standard. Effective May 30, 2012, EPA is determining that the Springfield (Western Massachusetts) one-hour ozone nonattainment area did not meet its applicable one-hour ozone attainment date of December 31, 2003, based on 2001-2003 complete, quality-assured ozone monitoring data. Separate from and independent of this determination, EPA is determining that the Springfield (Western Massachusetts) one-hour ozone nonattainment area met the one-hour ozone standard, based on 2007-2009 complete, quality-assured ozone monitoring data at all monitoring sites in the area. EPA's review of the ozone data shows that the area began attaining the one-hour ozone standard during the 2007-2009 monitoring period, and has continued attaining the one-hour standard through the 2008-2010 and 2009-2011 monitoring periods.
(f) Determination of Attainment for the One-Hour Ozone Standard. Effective June 28, 2012, EPA is determining that the Boston-Lawrence-Worcester, MA-NH one-hour ozone nonattainment area met the one-hour ozone standard, by the area's applicable attainment date of November 15, 2007, based on 2005-2007 complete, certified, quality-assured ozone monitoring data at all monitoring sites in the area.
(g)
Determination of Attainment.
(1) Determination of Attainment by Attainment Date; and
(2)
Determination of Attainment.
Effective June 28, 2012.
(i) Determination of Attainment by the Area's Attainment Date. EPA is determining that the Boston-Lawrence-Worcester, MA eight-hour ozone nonattainment area met the applicable June 15, 2010 attainment deadline for the 1997 eight-hour ozone standard.
(ii) EPA is determining that the Boston-Lawrence-Worcester, MA eight-hour ozone nonattainment area has attained the 1997 eight-hour ozone standard. Under the provisions of EPA's ozone implementation rule (see 40 CFR 51.918), this determination suspends the reasonable further progress and attainment demonstration requirements of section 182(b)(1) and related requirements of section 172(c)(9) of the Clean Air Act for as long as the area continues to attain the 1997 eight-hour ozone standard. If EPA determines, after notice-and comment rulemaking, that the Boston-Lawrence-Worcester, MA area no longer meets the 1997 ozone NAAQS, this determination shall be withdrawn.
(h) Determinations of Attainment: Effective July 19, 2012.
(1) Determination of Attainment. EPA is determining that the Springfield (Western Massachusetts) 8-hour ozone nonattainment area has attained the 1997 8-hour ozone standard. Under the provisions of EPA's ozone implementation rule (see 40 CFR 51.918), this determination suspends the reasonable further progress and attainment demonstration requirements of section 182(b)(1) and related requirements of section 172(c)(9) of the Clean Air Act for as long as the area continues to attain the 1997 8-hour ozone standard. If EPA determines, after notice-and comment rulemaking, that the Western Massachusetts area no longer meets the 1997 ozone NAAQS, this determination shall be withdrawn.
(2) Determination of Attainment by the Area's Attainment Date. EPA has determined that the Springfield (Western Massachusetts) 8-hour ozone nonattainment area met the applicable June 15, 2010 attainment deadline for the 1997 8-hour ozone standard.
(i) Revisions to the State Implementation Plan submitted by the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection on January 31, 2008. These revisions are for the purpose of satisfying the rate of progress requirement of section 182(b)(1) from 2002 through 2008, and the contingency measure requirement of sections 172(c)(9) and of the Clean Air Act, for the Boston-Lawrence-Worcester (E. MA) moderate 8-hour ozone nonattainment area, and the Springfield (W. MA) moderate 8-hour ozone nonattainment area. These revisions establish motor vehicle emission budgets for 2008 of 68.30 tons per day of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and 191.30 tons per day of nitrogen oxides (NO
X
) to be used in transportation conformity in the Boston-Lawrence-Worcester (E. MA) moderate 8-hour ozone nonattainment area. These revisions also establish motor vehicle emission budgets for 2008 for the Springfield (W. MA) moderate 8-hour ozone nonattainment area of 11.80 tons per day for VOCs, and 31.30 tons per day for NO
X
.
(j) Approval—Reasonably Available Control Technology Demonstration for the 1997 8-hour ozone standard submitted by the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection on January 31, 2008. The revision consists of the state's certification that with regard to the 1997 8-hour ozone standard, Reasonably Available Control Technology controls have been implemented for all sources in the state covered by EPA's Control Techniques Guidelines (CTG) and for all major sources of volatile organic compound and nitrogen oxide emissions. The submittal also includes negative declaration for several CTG categories.
(k)
Determination of attainment for the eight-hour ozone standard.
Effective June 3, 2016, the EPA is determining that complete quality-assured and certified ozone monitoring data for 2012 to 2014 show the Dukes County, Massachusetts eight-hour ozone nonattainment area attained the 2008 eight-hour ozone standard by its July 20, 2015 attainment deadline. Therefore, the EPA has met the requirement pursuant to CAA section 181(b)(2)(A) to determine, based on the area's air quality data as of the attainment date, whether the area attained the standard. The EPA also determined that the Dukes County nonattainment area will not be reclassified
for failure to attain by its applicable attainment date under section 181(b)(2)(A).
(l) On February 9, 2018, Massachusetts submitted a certification that its air emissions reporting requirements applicable to stationary sources meet the emission statement requirements of section 182(a)(3)(B) of the Clean Air Act. The certification was submitted as a SIP revision in partial fulfillment of obligations for nonattainment areas under EPA's 2008 8-hour ozone standard.

(e)
Approval
—On April 14, 2010, the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection submitted a modification to the Lowell maintenance plan approved in paragraph (c) of this section. Massachusetts will not conduct CO monitoring in Lowell, but instead commits to continue to collect and review CO monitoring data from nearby Worcester, MA on an on-going basis. In the event the second highest CO concentration in any calendar year monitored in Worcester reaches 75 percent of the federal 1-hour or 8-hour national ambient air quality standard for CO, Massachusetts will, within 9 months of recording such concentrations, re-establish a CO monitoring site in Lowell consistent with EPA citing criteria, and resume analyzing and reporting those data. Massachusetts commits to implement its contingency program in Lowell in the event that a CO violation is monitored at the re-established Lowell monitoring site at any time during the maintenance period. If the Worcester CO monitor measures a violation of either the federal 1-hour or 8-hour NAAQS for CO, contingency measures will be implemented in Lowell as well, until a re-established CO monitor in Lowell shows that the area is in attainment of the CO standard.

If the Commonwealth fails to start its program according to schedule, or by November 15, 1997 at the latest, this conditional approval will convert to a disapproval after EPA sends a letter to the state. If the Commonwealth fails to satisfy the following conditions within 12 months of this rulemaking, this conditional approval will automatically convert to a disapproval as explained under section 110(k) of the Clean Air Act.
(i) The conditions for approvability are as follows:
(A) The time extension program as described and committed to in the March 3, 1997 letter from Massachusetts must be further defined and submitted to EPA as a SIP revision by no later than one year after the effective date of this interim approval. Another program which meets the requirements of 40 CFR 51.360 (Waivers and Compliance via Diagnostic Inspection) and provides for no more than a 1% waiver rate would also be approvable.
(B) Other major deficiencies as described in the proposal must also be corrected in 40 CFR 51.351 (Enhanced I/M Performance Standard), § 51.354 (Adequate Tools and Resources), § 51.357 (Test Procedures and Standards), § 51.359 (Quality Control), and § 51.363 (Quality Assurance). The Commonwealth, committed in a letter dated March 3, 1997 to correct these deficiencies within one year of conditional interim approval by EPA.
(ii) In addition to the above conditions for approval, the Commonwealth must correct several minor, or de minimis deficiencies related to CAA requirements for enhanced I/M. Although satisfaction of these deficiencies does not affect the conditional approval status of the Commonwealth's rulemaking granted under the authority of section 110 of the Clean Air Act, these deficiencies must be corrected in the final I/M SIP revision prior to the end of the 18-month interim period granted under the National Highway Safety Designation Act of 1995:
(A) The SIP lacks a detailed description of the program evaluation element as required under 40 CFR 51.353;
(B) The SIP lacks a detailed description of the test frequency and convenience element required under 40 CFR 51.355;
(C) The SIP lacks a detailed description of the number and types of vehicles included in the program as required under 40 CFR 51.356;
(D) The SIP lacks a detailed information concerning the enforcement process, and a commitment to a compliance rate to be maintained in practice required under 40 CFR 51.361.
(E) The SIP lacks the details of the enforcement oversight program including quality control and quality assurance procedures to be used to insure the effective overall performance of the enforcement system as required under 40 CFR 51.362;
(F) The SIP lacks a detailed description of procedures for enforcement against contractors, stations and inspectors as required under 40 CFR 51.364;
(G) The SIP lacks a detailed description of data analysis and reporting provisions as required under 40 CFR 51.366;
(H) The SIP lacks a public awareness plan as required by 40 CFR 51.368; and
(I) The SIP lacks provisions for notifying motorists of required recalls prior to inspection of the vehicle as required by 40 CFR 51.370.
(iii) EPA is also approving this SIP revision under section 110(k), for its strengthening effect on the plan.

Certification of no sources.
The Commonwealth of Massachusetts has certified to the satisfaction of EPA that no sources are located in the Commonwealth which are covered by the following Control Techniques Guidelines:

Part D—Disapproval of Rules and Regulations.
On December 30, 1985, the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Quality Engineering (DEQE) submitted a revision to the Massachusetts State Implementation Plan (SIP) for the automobile surface coating regulation. This revision requested an extension of the final compliance dates to implement reasonably available control technology (RACT) on topcoat and final repair applications. As a result of EPA's disapproval of this revision, the existing compliance date of December
31, 1985 specified in the automobile surface coating regulation contained in the Massachusetts SIP will remain in effect (Massachusetts Regulation 310 CMR 7.18(7) as approved by EPA and codified at 40 CFR 52.1120(c)(30) and (53)).

This declaration was submitted to EPA on April 8, 1986. The commonwealth has further declared in a letter from Bruce K. Maillet, dated June 24, 1986, that, “[A]s part of our new source review activities under the Massachusetts SIP and our delegated PSD authority, the Department of Environmental Quality Engineering will follow EPA's stack height regulations, as revised in the
Federal Register
on July 8, 1985 (50 FR 27892).” Thus, the Commonwealth has satisfactorily demonstrated that its regulations meet 40 CFR 51.118 and 51.164.

§ 52.1172
Approval status.
With the exceptions set forth in this subpart, the Administrator approves Michigan's plan for the attainment and maintenance of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards under section 110 of the Clean Air Act. Furthermore, the Administrator finds the plan satisfies all requirements of Part D, Title I of the Clean Air Act as amended in
1977, except as noted below. In addition, continued satisfaction of the requirements of Part D for the ozone portion of the SIP depends on the adoption and submittal of RACT requirements by July 1, 1980 for the sources covered by CTGs between January 1978 and January 1979 and adoption and submittal by each subsequent January of additional RACT requirements for sources covered by CTGs issued by the previous January.

The inventory was submitted by the State of Michigan to satisfy Federal requirements under section 182(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act as amended in 1990, as a revision to the ozone State Implementation Plan for the Detroit-Ann Arbor moderate ozone nonattainment area. This area includes Livingston, Macomb, Monroe, Oakland, St. Clair, Washtenaw, and Wayne counties.
(i) Approval—On November 12, 1993, the Michigan Department of Natural Resources submitted a request to redesignate the Detroit-Ann Arbor (consisting of Livingston, Macomb, Monroe, Oakland, St. Clair, Washtenaw, and Wayne counties) ozone nonattainment area to attainment for ozone. As part of the redesignation request, the State submitted a maintenance plan as required by 175A of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990. Elements of the section 175A maintenance plan include a base year (1993 attainment year) emission inventory for NO
X
and VOC, a demonstration of maintenance of the ozone NAAQS with projected emission inventories (including interim years) to the year 2005 for NO
X
and VOC, a plan to verify continued attainment, a contingency plan, and an obligation to submit a subsequent maintenance plan revision in 8 years as required by the Clean Air Act. If the area records a violation of the ozone NAAQS (which must be confirmed by the State), Michigan will implement one or more appropriate contingency measure(s) which are contained in the contingency plan. Appropriateness of a contingency measure will be determined by an urban airshed modeling analysis. The Governor or his designee will select the contingency measure(s) to be implemented based on the analysis and the MDNR's recommendation. The menu of contingency measures includes basic motor vehicle inspection and maintenance program upgrades, Stage I vapor recovery expansion, Stage II vapor recovery, intensified RACT for degreasing operations, NO
X
RACT, and RVP reduction to 7.8 psi. The redesignation request and maintenance plan meet the redesignation requirements in sections 107(d)(3)(E) and 175A of the Act as amended in 1990, respectively. The redesignation meets the Federal requirements of section 182(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act as a revision to the Michigan Ozone State Implementation Plan for the above mentioned counties.
(j) [Reserved]
(k) Determination—USEPA is determining that, as of July 20, 1995, the Grand Rapids and Muskegon ozone nonattainment areas have attained the ozone standard and that the reasonable further progress and attainment demonstration requirements of section 182(b)(1) and related requirements of section 172(c)(9) of the Clean Air Act do not apply to the areas for so long as the areas do not monitor any violations of the ozone standard. If a violation of the ozone NAAQS is monitored in either the Grand Rapids or Muskegon ozone nonattainment area, the determination shall no longer apply for the area that experiences the violation.
(l) Approval—EPA is approving the section 182(f) oxides of nitrogen (NO
X
) reasonably available control technology (RACT), new source review (NSR), vehicle inspection/maintenance (I/M), and general conformity exemptions for the Grand Rapids (Kent and Ottawa Counties) and Muskegon (Muskegon County) moderate nonattainment areas as requested by the States of Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, and Wisconsin in a July 13, 1994 submittal. This approval also covers the exemption of NO
X
transportation and general conformity requirements of section 176(c) for the Counties of Allegan, Barry, Bay, Berrien, Branch, Calhoun, Cass, Clinton, Eaton, Gratiot, Genesee, Hillsdale, Ingham, Ionia, Jackson, Kalamazoo, Lenawee, Midland, Montcalm, St. Joseph, Saginaw, Shiawasse, and Van Buren.
(m) Approval—On November 24, 1994, the Michigan Department of Natural Resources submitted a revision to the ozone State Implementation Plan.

(n) Approval—On November 29, 1994, the Michigan Department of Natural Resources submitted a revision to the ozone State Implementation Plan for general conformity rules. The general conformity SIP revisions enable the State of Michigan to implement and enforce the Federal general conformity requirements in the nonattainment or maintenance areas at the State or local level in accordance with 40 CFR part 93, subpart B—Determining Conformity of General Federal Actions to State or Federal Implementation Plans.
(o) Approval—On March 9, 1996, the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality submitted a request to redesignate the Grand Rapids ozone nonattainment area (consisting of Kent and Ottawa Counties) to attainment for ozone. As part of the redesignation request, the State submitted a maintenance plan as required by 175A of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990. Elements of the section 175A maintenance plan include an attainment emission inventory for NO
X
and VOC, a demonstration of maintenance of the ozone NAAQS with projected emission inventories to the year 2007 for NO
X
and VOC, a plan to verify continued attainment, a contingency plan, and a commitment to submit a subsequent maintenance plan revision in 8 years as required by the Clean Air Act. If a violation of the ozone NAAQS, determined not to be attributable to transport from upwind areas, is monitored, Michigan will implement one or more appropriate contingency measure(s) contained in the contingency plan. Once a violation of the ozone NAAQS is recorded, the State will notify EPA, review the data for quality assurance, and conduct a technical analysis, including an analysis of meteorological conditions leading up to and during the exceedances contributing to the violation, to determine local culpability. This preliminary analysis will be submitted to EPA and subjected to public review and comment. The State will solicit and consider EPA's technical advice and analysis before making a final determination on the cause of the violation. The Governor or his designee will select the contingency measure(s) to be implemented within 6 months of a monitored violation attributable to ozone and ozone precursors from the Grand Rapids area. The menu of contingency measures includes a motor vehicle inspection and maintenance program, Stage II vapor recovery, RVP reduction to 7.8 psi, RACT on major non-CTG VOC sources in the categories of coating of plastics, coating of wood furniture, and industrial cleaning solvents. The redesignation request and maintenance plan meet the redesignation requirements in section 107(d)(3)(E) and 175A of the Act as amended in 1990, respectively. The redesignation meets the Federal requirements of section 182(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act as a revision to the Michigan Ozone State Implementation Plan for the above mentioned counties.

Elements of the section 175A maintenance plan include a base year (1996 attainment year) emission inventory for CO, a demonstration of maintenance of the ozone NAAQS with projected emission inventories to the year 2010, a plan to verify continued attainment, a contingency plan, and an obligation to submit a subsequent maintenance plan revision in 8 years as required by the Clean Air Act. If the area
records a violation of the CO NAAQS (which must be confirmed by the State), Michigan will implement one or more appropriate contingency measure(s) which are contained in the contingency plan. The menu of contingency measures includes enforceable emission limitations for stationary sources, transportation control measures, or a vehicle inspection and maintenance program. The redesignation request and maintenance plan meet the redesignation requirements in sections 107(d)(3)(E) and 175A of the Act as amended in 1990.
(b) Approval—On December 19, 2003, Michigan submitted a request to revise its plan for the Southeast Michigan CO maintenance area (consisting of portions of Wayne, Oakland and Macomb Counties). The submittal contains updated emission inventories for 1996 and 2010, and an update to the 2010 motor vehicle emissions budget (MVEB). The 2010 MVEB is 3,842.9 tons of CO per day.
(c) Approval—On October 3, 2016, the State of Michigan submitted a revision to their Carbon Monoxide State Implementation Plan. The submittal established transportation conformity “Conformity” criteria and procedures related to interagency consultation, and enforceability of certain transportation related control and mitigation measures.

, if the furnace is firing fuel for only five hours during a 24-hour period, then the actual operating hours for that day are five. Similarly, total number of pounds of the pollutant in question for that day is determined only from the CEMS data for the five hours during which fuel is combusted.)
(E) If the owner or operator of the CEMS required by this section uses an alternative method to determine 30-day rolling averages, that method must be described in detail in the monitoring plan required by this section. The alternative method will only be applicable if the final monitoring plan and the alternative method are approved by EPA.
(F) A new 30-day rolling average emission rate must be calculated for the period ending each new operating day.
(xi) The 720-hour rolling average emission rate determined from data derived from the CEMS required by this section (in lbs/MMBTU) must be calculated in accordance with paragraphs (l)(4)(xi)(A) through (C) of this section.
(A) Sum the total pounds of NO
X
emitted from the unit every hour and the previous (not necessarily consecutive) 719 hours for which that type of fuel (either natural gas or mixed coal and natural gas) was used.
(B) Sum the total heat input to the unit (in MMBTU) every hour and the previous (not necessarily consecutive) 719 hours for which that type of fuel (either natural gas or mixed coal and natural gas) was used.
(C) Divide the total number of pounds of NO
X
emitted during the 720 hours, as defined above, by the total heat input during the same 720-hour period. This calculation must be done separately for each fuel type (either for natural gas or mixed coal and natural gas).
(xii) Data substitution must not be used for purposes of determining compliance under this regulation.

(7) Each owner or operator of a CEMS required by this section must submit quarterly excess emissions and monitoring system performance reports to the Regional Administrator for each pollutant monitored for each BART affected unit monitored. All reports must be postmarked by the 30th day following the end of each 3-month period of a calendar year (January-March, April-June, July-September, October-December) and must include, at a minimum, the requirements of paragraphs (n)(7)(i) through (xv) of this section.
(i) Company name and address.
(ii) Identification and description of the process unit being monitored.
(iii) The dates covered by the reporting period.
(iv) Total source operating hours for the reporting period.
(v) Monitor manufacturer, monitor model number, and monitor serial number.
(vi) Pollutant monitored.
(vii) Emission limitation for the monitored pollutant.
(viii) Date of latest CEMS certification or audit.
(ix) A description of any changes in continuous monitoring systems, processes, or controls since the last reporting period.
(x) A table summarizing the total duration of excess emissions, as defined in paragraphs (n)(7)(x)(A) through (B) of this section, for the reporting period broken down by the cause of those excess emissions (startup/shutdown, control equipment problems, process problems, other known causes, unknown
causes), and the total percent of excess emissions (for all causes) for the reporting period calculated as described in paragraph (n)(7)(x)(C) of this section.
(A) For purposes of this section, an excess emission is defined as any 30-day or 720-hour rolling average period, including periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction, during which the 30-day or 720-hour (as appropriate) rolling average emissions of either regulated pollutant (SO
2
and NO
X
), as measured by a CEMS, exceeds the applicable emission standards in this section.
(B)(
1
) For purposes of this section, if a facility calculates a 30-day rolling average emission rate in accordance with this section which exceeds the applicable emission standards of this section, then it will be considered 30 days of excess emissions. If the following 30-day rolling average emission rate is calculated and found to exceed the applicable emission standards of this section as well, then it will add one more day to the total days of excess emissions (
i.e.
31 days). Similarly, if an excess emission is calculated for a 30-day rolling average period and no additional excess emissions are calculated until 15 days after the first, then that new excess emission will add 15 days to the total days of excess emissions (
i.e.
30 + 15 = 45). For purposes of this section, if an excess emission is calculated for any period of time within a reporting period, there will be no fewer than 30 days of excess emissions but there should be no more than 121 days of excess emissions for a reporting period.
(
2
) For purposes of this section, if a facility calculates a 720-hour rolling average emission rate in accordance with this section which exceeds the applicable emission standards of this section, then it will be considered 30 days of excess emissions. If the 24th following 720-hour rolling average emission rate is calculated and found to exceed the applicable emission standards of the rule as well, then it will add one more day to the total days of excess emissions (
i.e.
31 days). Similarly, if an excess emission is calculated for a 720-hour rolling average period and no additional excess emissions are calculated until 360 hours after the first, then that new excess emission will add 15 days to the total days of excess emissions (
i.e.
30+15 = 45). For purposes of this section, if an excess emission is calculated for any period of time with a reporting period, there will be no fewer than 30 days of excess emissions but there should be no more than 121 days of excess emissions for a reporting period.
(C) For purposes of this section, the total percent of excess emissions will be determined by summing all periods of excess emissions (in days) for the reporting period, dividing that number by the total BART affected unit operating days for the reporting period, and then multiplying by 100 to get the total percent of excess emissions for the reporting period. An operating day, as defined previously, is any day during which fuel is fired in the BART affected unit for any period of time. Because of the possible overlap of 30-day rolling average excess emissions across quarters, there are some situations where the total percent of excess emissions could exceed 100 percent. This extreme situation would only result from serious excess emissions problems where excess emissions occur for nearly every day during a reporting period.
(xi) A table summarizing the total duration of monitor downtime, as defined in paragraph (n)(7)(xi)(A) of this section, for the reporting period broken down by the cause of the monitor downtime (monitor equipment malfunctions, non-monitor equipment malfunctions, quality assurance calibration, other known causes, unknown causes), and the total percent of monitor downtime (for all causes) for the reporting period calculated as described in paragraph (n)(7)(xi)(B) of this section.
(A) For purposes of this section, monitor downtime is defined as any period of time (in hours) during which the required monitoring system was not measuring emissions from the BART affected unit. This includes any period of CEMS QA/QC, daily zero and span checks, and similar activities.
(B) For purposes of this section, the total percent of monitor downtime will be determined by summing all periods of monitor downtime (in hours) for the reporting period, dividing that number by the total number of BART affected unit operating hours for the reporting
period, and then multiplying by 100 to get the total percent of excess emissions for the reporting period.
(xii) A table which identifies each period of excess emissions for the reporting period and includes, at a minimum, the information in paragraphs (n)(7)(xii)(A) through (F) of this section.
(A) The date of each excess emission.
(B) The beginning and end time of each excess emission.
(C) The pollutant for which an excess emission occurred.
(D) The magnitude of the excess emission.
(E) The cause of the excess emission.
(F) The corrective action taken or preventative measures adopted to minimize or eliminate the excess emissions and prevent such excess emission from occurring again.
(xiii) A table which identifies each period of monitor downtime for the reporting period and includes, at a minimum, the information in paragraphs (n)(7)(xiii)(A) through (D) of this section.
(A) The date of each period of monitor downtime.
(B) The beginning and end time of each period of monitor downtime.
(C) The cause of the period of monitor downtime.
(D) The corrective action taken or preventative measures adopted for system repairs or adjustments to minimize or eliminate monitor downtime and prevent such downtime from occurring again.
(xiv) If there were no periods of excess emissions during the reporting period, then the excess emission report must include a statement which says there were no periods of excess emissions during this reporting period.
(xv) If there were no periods of monitor downtime, except for daily zero and span checks, during the reporting period, then the excess emission report must include a statement which says there were no periods of monitor downtime during this reporting period except for the daily zero and span checks.
(8) The owner or operator of each CEMS required by this section must develop and submit for review and approval by the Regional Administrator a site specific monitoring plan. The purpose of this monitoring plan is to establish procedures and practices which will be implemented by the owner or operator in its effort to comply with the monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements of this section. The monitoring plan must include, at a minimum, the information in paragraphs (n)(8)(i) through (x) of this section.
(i) Site specific information including the company name, address, and contact information.
(ii) The objectives of the monitoring program implemented and information describing how those objectives will be met.
(iii) Information on any emission factors used in conjunction with the CEMS required by this section to calculate emission rates and a description of how those emission factors were determined.
(iv) A description of methods to be used to calculate emission rates when CEMS data are not available due to downtime associated with QA/QC events.
(v) A description of the QA/QC program to be implemented by the owner or operator of CEMS required by this section. This can be the QA/QC program developed in accordance with 40 CFR part 60, appendix F, Procedure 1, Section 3.
(vi) A list of spare parts for CEMS maintained on site for system maintenance and repairs.
(vii) A description of the procedures to be used to calculate 30-day rolling averages and 720-hour rolling averages and example calculations which show the algorithms used by the CEMS to calculate 30-day rolling averages and 720-hour rolling averages.
(viii) A sample of the document to be used for the quarterly excess emission reports required by this section.
(ix) A description of the procedures to be implemented to investigate root causes of excess emissions and monitor downtime and the proposed corrective actions to address potential root causes of excess emissions and monitor downtime.
(x) A description of the sampling and calculation methodology for determining the percent sulfur by weight as
a monthly block average for coal used during that month.
(o) The requirements of section 169A of the Clean Air Act are not met because the regional haze plan submitted by the state on November 5, 2010, does not meet the requirements of 40 CFR 51.308(e) with respect to NO

§ 52.1219
Identification of plan—conditional approval.
(a) On November 12, 1993, the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency submitted a revision request to Minnesota's carbon monoxide SIP for approval of the State's basic inspection and maintenance (I/M) program. The basic I/M program requirements apply to sources in the State's moderate nonattainment areas for carbon monoxide and includes the following counties: Anoka, Carver, Dakota, Hennepin, Ramsey, Scott, and Washington Counties. The USEPA is conditionally approving Minnesota's basic I/M program provided that the State adopt specific enforceable measures as outlined in its July 5, 1994 letter from Charles W. Williams, Commissioner, Minnesota Air Pollution Control Agency.
(i) Incorporation by reference.
(A) Minnesota Rules relating to Motor Vehicle Emissions parts 7023.1010 to 7023.1105, effective January 8, 1994.
(ii) Additional material.
(A) Letter from the State of Minnesota to USEPA dated July 5, 1994.
(b) On February 9, 1996, the State of Minnesota submitted a request to revise its particulate matter (PM) State Implementation Plan (SIP) for the Saint Paul area. This SIP submittal contains administrative orders which include control measures for three companies located in the Red Rock Road area—St. Paul Terminals, Inc., Lafarge Corporation and AMG Resources Corporation. Recent exceedances were attributed to changes of emissions/operations that had occurred at particular sources in the area. The results from the modeling analysis submitted with the Red Rock Road SIP revision, preliminarily demonstrate protection of the PM National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). However, due to the lack of emission limits and specific information regarding emission distribution at Lafarge Corporation following the installation of the pneumatic unloader, EPA is conditionally approving the SIP revision at this time. Final approval will be conditioned upon EPA receiving a subsequent modeled attainment demonstration with specific emission limits for Lafarge Corporation, corrected inputs for Peavey/Con-Agra, and consideration of the sources in the 2-4 km range which have experienced emission changes that may impact the Red Rock Road attainment demonstration.

For these sources, NSR Rule APC 3 (40 CFR 52.1220(c)(5)), will continue to apply. Additionally, USEPA is taking no action on the CPR in relationship to the requirements of Section 111, Part C, and Part D of the Clean Air Act.
(i) Incorporation by reference.
(A) Within Title 6 Environment, Minnesota Code of Administrative Rules, Part 4 Pollution Control Agency (6 MCAR 4), Rule 6 MCAR 4 section 4.0002, Parts A, B, C, and E—Definitions, Abbreviations, Applicability of Standards, and Circumvention (formerly APC 2) Proposed and Published in Volume 8 of the State of Minnesota STATE REGISTER (8 S.R.) on October 17, 1983, at 8 S.R. 682 and adopted as modified on April 16, 1984, at 8 S.R. 2275.
(B) Rules 6 MCAR section 4.4001 through section 4.4021—Permits (formerly APC 3)—Proposed and Published on December 19, 1983, at 8 S.R. 1419 (text of rule starting at 8 S.R. 1420) and adopted as modified on April 16, 1984, at 8 S.R. 2278.
(C) Rules 6 MCAR section 4.4301 through section 4.4305—Air Emission Facility Permits—Proposed and Published on December 19, 1983, at 8 S.R. 1419 (text of rule starting at 8 S.R. 1470) and adopted as proposed on April 16, 1984, at 8 S.R. 2276.
(D) Rules 6 MCAR section 4.4311 through section 4.4321—Indirect Source Permits (formerly APC 19)—Proposed and Published on December 19, 1983, at 8 S.R. 1419 (text of rule starting at 8 S.R. 1472) and adopted as modified on April 16, 1984, at 8 S.R. 2277.
(25) On July 9, 1986, the State of Minnesota submitted Rules 7005.2520 through 7005.2523, submitted to replace the rule APC-29 in the existing SIP (see paragraph (20)). This submittal also included State permits for three sources, but these permits were withdrawn from USEPA consideration on February 24, 1992. This submittal provides for regulation of particulate matter from grain handling facilities, and was submitted to satisfy a condition on the approval of Minnesota's Part D plan for particulate matter.
(i) Incorporation by reference.
(A) Minnesota Rule 7005.2520, Definitions; Rule 7005.2521, Standards of Performance for Dry Bulk Agricultural Commodity Facilities; Rule 7005.2522, Nuisance; and Rule 7005.2523, Control Requirements Schedule, promulgated by Minnesota on January 16, 1984, and effective at the State level on January 23, 1984.
(ii) Additional Material.
(A) Appendix E to Minnesota's July 9, 1986, submittal, which is a statement signed on April 18, 1986, by Thomas J. Kalitowski, Executive Director, Minnesota Pollution Control Agency, interpreting Rules 7005.2520 through 7005.2523 in the context of actual barge loading practices in Minnesota.
(26) On March 13, 1989, the State of Minnesota requested that EPA revise the referencing of regulations in the SIP to conform to the State's recodification of its regulations. On November 26, 1991, and September 18, 1992, the State submitted an official version of the recodified regulations to be incorporated into the SIP. The recodified regulations are in Chapter 7001 and Chapter 7005 of Minnesota's regulations. Not approved as part of the SIP are recodified versions of regulations which EPA previously did not approve. Therefore, the SIP does not include Rules 7005.1550 through 7005.1610 (National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) for asbestos), Rules 7005.2300 through 7005.2330 (limits for iron and steel plants), Rules 7005.2550 through 7005.2590 (NESHAP for beryllium), Rules 7005.2650 through 7005.2690 (NESHAP for mercury), Rule 7005.0116 (Opacity Standard Adjustment) and Rule 7005.2910 (Performance Test Methods for coal handling facilities). Similarly, the SIP continues to exclude the exemption now in Rule 7001.1210 as applied to small sources subject to new source performance standards, and the SIP is approved only for “existing sources” in the case of Rules 7005.1250 through 7005.1280 (Standards of Performance for Liquid Petroleum Storage Vessels), Rules 7005.1350 through 7005.1410 (Standards of Performance for Sulfuric Acid Plants), Rules 7005.1450 through 7005.1500 (Standards of Performance for Nitric Acid Plants), and Rules 7005.2100 through 7005.2160 (Standards of Performance for Petroleum Refineries). The SIP also does not include changes in the State's Rule 7005.0100 (relating to offsets) that were withdrawn by the State on February 24, 1992, and does not include the new rules 7005.0030 and 7005.0040.
(i) Incorporation by reference.
(A) Minnesota regulations in Chapter 7005 as submitted November 26, 1991,
and in Chapter 7001 as submitted September 18, 1992, except for those regulations that EPA has not approved as identified above.
(27) On August 16, 1982, the MPCA submitted an amendment to the St. Cloud Area Air Quality Control Plan for Transportation as a State Implementation Plan revision. This revision to the SIP was adopted by the Board of the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency on July 27, 1982. On August 31, 1989, the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency submitted a revision to the Minnesota State Implementation Plan (SIP) for carbon monoxide deleting the Lake George Interchange roadway improvement project (10th Avenue at First Street South) from its St. Cloud transportation control measures. This revision to the SIP was approved by the Board on June 27, 1989.

(B) Sample, analyze, and record emissions data for all periods of process operation except as described in paragraph (c)(4)(viii)(C) of this section.
(C) When emission data from CEMS are not available due to continuous monitoring system breakdowns, repairs, calibration checks, or zero and span adjustments, emission data must be obtained using other monitoring systems or emission estimation methods approved by the EPA. The other monitoring systems or emission estimation methods to be used must be incorporated into the monitoring plan required by this section and provide information such that emissions data are available for a minimum of 18 hours in each 24-hour period and at least 22 out of 30 successive unit operating days.
(ix) Owners or operators of each CEMS required by this section must reduce all data to 1-hour averages. Hourly averages shall be computed using all valid data obtained within the hour but no less than one data point in each 15-minute quadrant of an hour. Notwithstanding this requirement, an hourly average may be computed from at least two data points separated by a minimum of 15 minutes (where the unit operates for more than one quadrant in an hour) if data are unavailable as a result of performance of calibration, quality assurance, preventive maintenance activities, or backups of data from data acquisition and handling systems and recertification events.
(x) The 30-day rolling average emission rate determined from data derived from the CEMS required by this section (in lbs/MMBTU or lbs/hr depending on the emission standard selected) must be calculated in accordance with paragraphs (c)(4)(x)(A) through (F) of this section.
(A) Sum the total pounds of the pollutant in question emitted from the unit during an operating day and the previous 29 operating days.
(B) Sum the total heat input to the unit (in MMBTU) or the total actual hours of operation (in hours) during an operating day and the previous 29 operating days.
(C) Divide the total number of pounds of the pollutant in question emitted during the 30 operating days by the total heat input (or actual hours of operation depending on the emission limit selected) during the 30 operating days.
(D) For purposes of this calculation, an operating day is any day during which fuel is combusted in the BART affected unit regardless of whether pellets are produced. Actual hours of operation are the total hours a unit is firing fuel regardless of whether a complete 24-hour operational cycle occurs (
i.e.
if the furnace is firing fuel for only five hours during a 24-hour period, then the actual operating hours for that day are five. Similarly, total number of pounds of the pollutant in question for that day is determined only from the CEMS data for the five hours during which fuel is combusted.)
(E) If the owner or operator of the CEMS required by this section uses an alternative method to determine 30-day rolling averages, that method must be described in detail in the monitoring plan required by this section. The alternative method will only be applicable if the final monitoring plan and the alternative method are approved by EPA.
(F) A new 30-day rolling average emission rate must be calculated for each new operating day.
(xi) The 720-hour rolling average emission rate determined from data derived from the CEMS required by this section (in lbs/MMBTU) must be calculated in accordance with (c)(4)(xi)(A) through (C).
(A) Sum the total pounds of NO
X
emitted from the unit every hour and the previous (not necessarily consecutive) 719 hours for which that type of fuel (either natural gas or mixed coal and natural gas) was used.
(B) Sum the total heat input to the unit (in MMBTU) every hour and the previous (not necessarily consecutive) 719 hours for which that type of fuel
(either natural gas or mixed coal and natural gas) was used.
(C) Divide the total number of pounds of NO
X
emitted during the 720 hours, as defined above, by the total heat input during the same 720 hour period. This calculation must be done separately for each fuel type (either for natural gas or mixed coal and natural gas).
(xii) Data substitution must not be used for purposes of determining compliance under this section.
(xiii) All CEMS data shall be reduced and reported in units of the applicable standard.
(xiv) A Quality Control Program must be developed and implemented for all CEMS required by this section in accordance with 40 CFR part 60, appendix F, Procedure 1, Section 3. The program will include, at a minimum, written procedures and operations for calibration checks, calibration drift adjustments, preventative maintenance, data collection, recording and reporting, accuracy audits/procedures, periodic performance evaluations, and a corrective action program for malfunctioning CEMS.

(7) Each owner or operator of a CEMS required by this section must submit quarterly excess emissions and monitoring system performance reports for each pollutant monitored for each BART affected unit monitored. All reports must be postmarked by the 30th day following the end of each three-month period of a calendar year (January-March, April-June, July-September, October-December) and must include, at a minimum, the requirements at paragraphs (e)(7)(i) through (xv) of this section.
(i) Company name and address.
(ii) Identification and description of the process unit being monitored.
(iii) The dates covered by the reporting period.
(iv) Total source operating hours for the reporting period.
(v) Monitor manufacturer, monitor model number, and monitor serial number.
(vi) Pollutant monitored.
(vii) Emission limitation for the monitored pollutant.
(viii) Date of latest CEMS certification or audit.
(ix) A description of any changes in continuous monitoring systems, processes, or controls since the last reporting period.
(x) A table summarizing the total duration of excess emissions, as defined at paragraphs (e)(7)(x)(A) through (B) of this section, for the reporting period broken down by the cause of those excess emissions (startup/shutdown, control equipment problems, process problems, other known causes, unknown causes), and the total percent of excess emissions (for all causes) for the reporting period calculated as described at paragraph (e)(7)(x)(C) of this section.
(A) For purposes of this section, an excess emission is defined as any 30-day or 720-hour rolling average period, including periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction, during which the 30-day or 720-hour (as appropriate) rolling average emissions of either regulated pollutant (SO
2
and NO
X
), as measured by a CEMS, exceeds the applicable emission standards in this section.
(B)(
1
) For purposes of this rule, if a facility calculates a 30-day rolling average emission rate in accordance with this rule which exceeds the applicable emission standards of this rule, then it will be considered 30 days of excess emissions. If the following 30-day rolling average emission rate is calculated and found to exceed the applicable emission standards of this rule as well, then it will add one more day to the total days of excess emissions (
i.e.
31 days). Similarly, if an excess emission is calculated for a 30-day rolling average period and no additional excess emissions are calculated until 15 days after the first, then that new excess emission will add 15 days to the total days of excess emissions (
i.e.
30 + 15 = 45). For purposes of this section, if an excess emission is calculated for any period of time within a reporting period, there will be no fewer than 30 days of excess emissions but there should be no more than 121 days of excess emissions for a reporting period.
(
2
) For purposes of this section, if a facility calculates a 720-hour rolling average emission rate in accordance with this rule which exceeds the applicable emission standards of this section, then it will be considered 30 days of excess emissions. If the 24th following 720-hour rolling average emission rate is calculated and found to exceed the applicable emission standards of the rule as well, then it will add one more day to the total days of excess emissions (
i.e.
31 days). Similarly, if an excess emission is calculated for a 720-hour rolling average period and no additional excess emissions are calculated until 360 hours after the first, then that new excess emission will add 15 days to the total days of excess emissions (
i.e.
30+15 = 45). For purposes of this section, if an excess emission is calculated for any period of time with a reporting period, there will be no fewer than 30 days of excess emissions but there should be no more than 121 days of excess emissions for a reporting period.
(C) For purposes of this section, the total percent of excess emissions will be determined by summing all periods of excess emissions (in days) for the reporting period, dividing that number by the total BART affected unit operating days for the reporting period, and then multiplying by 100 to get the total percent of excess emissions for the reporting period. An operating day, as defined previously, is any day during which fuel is fired in the BART affected unit for any period of time. Because of the possible overlap of 30-day rolling average excess emissions across quarters, there are some situations where the total percent of excess emissions could exceed 100 percent. This extreme situation would only result from serious excess emissions problems where excess emissions occur for nearly every day during a reporting period.
(xi) A table summarizing the total duration of monitor downtime, as defined at paragraph (e)(7)(xi)(A) of this section, for the reporting period broken down by the cause of the monitor
downtime (monitor equipment malfunctions, non-monitor equipment malfunctions, quality assurance calibration, other known causes, unknown causes), and the total percent of monitor downtime (for all causes) for the reporting period calculated as described at paragraph (e)(7)(xi)(B) of this section.
(A) For purposes of this section, monitor downtime is defined as any period of time (in hours) during which the required monitoring system was not measuring emissions from the BART affected unit. This includes any period of CEMS QA/QC, daily zero and span checks, and similar activities.
(B) For purposes of this section, the total percent of monitor downtime will be determined by summing all periods of monitor downtime (in hours) for the reporting period, dividing that number by the total number of BART affected unit operating hours for the reporting period, and then multiplying by 100 to get the total percent of excess emissions for the reporting period.
(xii) A table which identifies each period of excess emissions for the reporting period and includes, at a minimum, the information in paragraphs (e)(7)(xii)(A) through (F) of this section.
(A) The date of each excess emission.
(B) The beginning and end time of each excess emission.
(C) The pollutant for which an excess emission occurred.
(D) The magnitude of the excess emission.
(E) The cause of the excess emission.
(F) The corrective action taken or preventative measures adopted to minimize or eliminate the excess emissions and prevent such excess emission from occurring again.
(xiii) A table which identifies each period of monitor downtime for the reporting period and includes, at a minimum, the information in paragraphs (e)(7)(xiii)(A) through (D) of this section.
(A) The date of each period of monitor downtime.
(B) The beginning and end time of each period of monitor downtime.
(C) The cause of the period of monitor downtime.
(D) The corrective action taken or preventative measures adopted for system repairs or adjustments to minimize or eliminate monitor downtime and prevent such downtime from occurring again.
(xiv) If there were no periods of excess emissions during the reporting period, then the excess emission report must include a statement which says there were no periods of excess emissions during this reporting period.
(xv) If there were no periods of monitor downtime, except for daily zero and span checks, during the reporting period, then the excess emission report must include a statement which says there were no periods of monitor downtime during this reporting period except for the daily zero and span checks.
(8) The owner or operator of each CEMS required by this section must develop and submit for review and approval by the Regional Administrator a site specific monitoring plan. The purpose of this monitoring plan is to establish procedures and practices which will be implemented by the owner or operator in its effort to comply with the monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements of this section. The monitoring plan must include, at a minimum, the information at paragraphs (e)(8)(i) through (x) of this section.
(i) Site specific information including the company name, address, and contact information.
(ii) The objectives of the monitoring program implemented and information describing how those objectives will be met.
(iii) Information on any emission factors used in conjunction with the CEMS required by this section to calculate emission rates and a description of how those emission factors were determined.
(iv) A description of methods to be used to calculate emission rates when CEMS data are not available due to downtime associated with QA/QC events.
(v) A description of the QA/QC program to be implemented by the owner or operator of CEMS required by this section. This can be the QA/QC program developed in accordance with 40
CFR part 60, appendix F, Procedure 1, Section 3.
(vi) A list of spare parts for CEMS maintained on site for system maintenance and repairs.
(vii) A description of the procedures to be used to calculate 30-day rolling averages and 720-hour rolling averages and example calculations which show the algorithms used by the CEMS to calculate 30-day rolling averages and 720-hour rolling averages.
(viii) A sample of the document to be used for the quarterly excess emission reports required by this section.
(ix) A description of the procedures to be implemented to investigate root causes of excess emissions and monitor downtime and the proposed corrective actions to address potential root causes of excess emissions and monitor downtime.

As part of the redesignation request, the State submitted a maintenance plan as required by 175A of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990. Elements of the section 175A maintenance plan include a base year (1996 attainment year) emission inventory for CO, a demonstration of maintenance of the ozone NAAQS with projected emission inventories to the year 2009, a plan to verify continued attainment, a contingency plan, and an obligation to submit a subsequent maintenance plan revision in 8 years as required by the Clean Air Act. If the area records a violation of the CO NAAQS (which must be confirmed by the State), Minnesota will implement one or more appropriate contingency measure(s) which are contained in the contingency plan. The menu of contingency measures includes oxygenated fuel, transportation control measures, or a vehicle inspection and maintenance program. The redesignation request and maintenance plan meet the redesignation requirements in section 107(d)(3)(E) and 175A of the Act as amended in 1990, respectively.
(d) Approval—On November 10, 2004, Minnesota submitted a revision to the Carbon Monoxide (CO) maintenance plan for the Minneapolis-St. Paul area. These plans revised 1996 and 2009 motor vehicle emission inventories and 2009 Motor Vehicle Emissions Budgets (MVEB) recalculated using the emissions factor model MOBILE6. The MVEB for transportation conformity purposes for the Minneapolis-St. Paul maintenance area is 1961 tons per winter day of CO.
(e) Approval—On June 16, 2010, Minnesota submitted a carbon monoxide (CO) limited maintenance plan for the Minneapolis-St. Paul area under section 175A of the CAA for the continued attainment of the one hour and eight hour CO NAAQS.
(f) Approval—On July 16, 2015, the State of Minnesota submitted a revision to their Particulate Matter State Implementation Plan. The submittal establishes transportation conformity criteria and procedures related to interagency consultation, and the enforceability of certain transportation related control and mitigation measures.

§ 52.1238
Control strategy: Lead (Pb).
(a) Based upon EPA's review of the air quality data for the 3-year period 2012 to 2014, EPA determined that the Eagan, Minnesota lead nonattainment area attained the 2008 Lead National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS). This clean data determination suspends the requirements for this area to submit an attainment demonstration, associated reasonably available control measures, a reasonable further progress plan, contingency measures, and other planning SIPs related to attainment of the standard for as long as this area continues to meet the 2008 lead NAAQS.

§ 52.1272
Approval status.
With the exceptions set forth in this subpart, the Administrator approves Mississippi's plan for the attainment and maintenance of the national standards under section 110 of the Clean Air Act. Furthermore, the Administrator finds that the plan satisfies all requirements of part D, title 1, of the Clean Air Act as amended in 1977.
[83 FR 50018, Oct. 4, 2018]
§ 52.1273
Control strategy: Ozone.
(a)
Determination of attainment.
The EPA has determined, as of June 3, 2016, that based on 2012 to 2014 ambient air quality data, the Memphis, TN-MS-AR 2008 ozone Marginal nonattainment area has attained the 2008 ozone NAAQS. Therefore, the EPA has met the requirement pursuant to CAA section 181(b)(2)(A) to determine, based on the area's air quality data as of the attainment date, whether the area attained the standard. The EPA also determined that the Memphis, TN-MS-AR nonattainment area will not be reclassified for failure to attain by its applicable attainment date under section 181(b)(2)(A).
(b)
Disapproval.
The state implementation plan (SIP) revision submitted on September 3, 2019, addressing Clean Air Act section 110(a)(2)(D)(i)(I) (prongs 1 and 2) for the 2015 ozone national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) is disapproved.
[81 FR 26709, May 4, 2016, as amended at 88 FR 9383, Feb. 13, 2023]
§ 52.1275
Legal authority.
(a) The requirements of § 51.230(d) of this chapter are not met since statutory authority to prevent construction, modification, or operation of a facility, building, structure, or installation, or combination thereof, which indirectly results or may result in emissions of any air pollutant at any location which will prevent the maintenance of a national air quality standard is not adequate.
(b) The requirements of § 51.230(f) of this chapter are not met, since section 7106-117 of the Mississippi Code could, in some circumstances, prohibit the disclosure of emission data to the public. Therefore, section 7106-117 is disapproved.
[39 FR 7282, Feb. 25, 1974, as amended at 39 FR 34536, Sept. 26, 1974; 51 FR 40676, Nov. 7, 1986]
§ 52.1276
[Reserved]
§ 52.1277
General requirements.
(a) The requirements of § 51.116(c) of this chapter are not met, since the legal authority to provide public availability of emission data is inadequate.
(b)
Regulation for public availability of emission data.
(1) Any person who cannot obtain emission data from the Agency responsible for making emission data available to the public, as specified in the applicable plan, concerning emissions from any source subject to emission limitations which are part of the approved plan may request that the appropriate Regional Administrator obtain and make public such data. Within 30 days after receipt of any such written request, the Regional Administrator shall require the owner or operator of any such source to submit information within 30 days on the nature and amounts of emissions from such source and any other information as may be deemed necessary by the Regional Administrator to determine whether such source is in compliance with applicable emission limitations or other control measures that are part of the applicable plan.
(2) Commencing after the initial notification by the Regional Administrator pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the owner or operator of the source shall maintain records of the nature and amounts of emissions from such source and any other information as may be deemed necessary by the Regional Administrator to determine whether such source is in compliance with applicable emission limitations or other control measures that are part of the plan. The information recorded shall be summarized and reported to the Regional Administrator, on forms furnished by the Regional Administrator, and shall be submitted within 45 days after the end of the reporting period. Reporting periods are January 1 to June 30 and July 1 to December 31.
(3) Information recorded by the owner or operator and copies of this summarizing report submitted to the Regional Administrator shall be retained by the owner or operator for 2 years after the date on which the pertinent report is submitted.
(4) Emission data obtained from owners or operators of stationary sources will be correlated with applicable emission limitations and other control measures that are part of the applicable plan and will be available at the appropriate regional office and at other locations in the state designated by the Regional Administrator.

§ 52.1278
Control strategy: Sulfur oxides and particulate matter.
(a) In a letter dated January 30, 1987, the Mississippi Department of Natural Resources certified that no emission limits in the State's plan are based on dispersion techniques not permitted by EPA's stack height rules. This certification does not apply to: Mississippi Power-Daniel; South Mississippi Electric Power, Hattiesburg-Morrow; E.I. Dupont, Delisle Boilers 1
2; and International Paper, Vicksburg.

X
Ozone Season Group 2 allowances equivalent in quantity and usability to all such allowances allocated to units in the State and Indian country within the borders of the State for control periods after 2022) shall continue to apply.
(6) Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, the effectiveness of paragraph (a)(3) of this section is stayed with regard to emissions occurring in 2023 and thereafter, provided that while such stay remains in effect, the provisions of paragraph (a)(2) of this section shall apply with regard to such emissions.
(b)(1) The owner and operator of each source located in the State of Mississippi and Indian country within the borders of the State and for which requirements are set forth in § 52.40 and § 52.41, § 52.42, § 52.43, § 52.44, § 52.45, or § 52.46 must comply with such requirements with regard to emissions occurring in 2026 and each subsequent year.
