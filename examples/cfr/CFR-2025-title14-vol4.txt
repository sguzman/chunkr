# Explanation
The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.
Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:
Title 1 through Title 16
as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27
as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41
as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50
as of October 1
The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.

# LEGAL STATUS
The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

# HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS
The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, January 1, 2025), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

# EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES
Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.

# OMB CONTROL NUMBERS
The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request.
Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.

# PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE
Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.

# “[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY
The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not dropped in error.

# INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE
What is incorporation by reference?
Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.
What is a proper incorporation by reference?
The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:
(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.
(b) The matter incorporated is adequately summarized in the preamble of the final rule and is available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.
(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?
If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or email fr.inspection@nara.gov.

# CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES
A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR
Index and Finding Aids.
This volume contains the Parallel Table of Authorities and Rules. A list of CFR titles, chapters, subchapters, and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in this volume.
An index to the text of “Title 3—The President” is carried within that volume.
The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. This index is based on a consolidation of the “Contents” entries in the daily Federal Register.
A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

# REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL
There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing in the Code of Federal Regulations.

Amendments.
If, after receipt of any application, the Department asks the applicant to supply additional information, such information shall be furnished in the form of a supplement to the original application.
§ 201.3
Incorporation by reference.
Incorporation by reference shall be avoided. However, where two or more applications are filed by a single carrier, lengthy exhibits or other documents attached to one may be incorporated in the others by reference if that procedure will substantially reduce the cost to the applicant.
§ 201.4
General provisions concerning contents.
(a) All pages of an application shall be consecutively numbered, and the application shall clearly describe and identify each exhibit by a separate number or symbol. All exhibits shall be deemed to constitute a part of the application to which they are attached.
(b) All amendments to applications shall be consecutively numbered and shall comply with the requirements of this part.
(c) Requests for authority to engage in interstate air transportation shall not be included in the same application with requests for authority to engage in foreign air transportation. Similarly, requests for authority to engage in scheduled air transportation under section 41102 of 49 U.S.C. Subtitle VII shall not be included in the same application with requests for authority to engage in charter air transportation under section 41102 of 49 U.S.C. Subtitle VII or with requests for authority to engage in interstate all-cargo air transportation under section 41103 of 49 U.S.C. Subtitle VII.

(f) Each application shall give full and adequate information with respect to each of the relevant filing requirements set forth in part 204 of this chapter. In addition, the application may contain such other information and data as the applicant shall deem necessary or appropriate in order to acquaint the Department fully with the particular circumstances of its case; however, the statements contained in an application shall be restricted to significant and relevant facts.

§ 201.5
Advertising and sales by applicants.
(a) An applicant for new or amended certificate or commuter air carrier authority shall not:
(1) Advertise, list schedules, or accept reservations for the air transportation covered by its application until the application has been approved by the Department; or
(2) Accept payment or issue tickets for the air transportation covered by its application until the authority or amended authority has become effective or the Department issues a notice authorizing sales.
(b) An applicant for new or amended certificate or commuter air carrier authority may not advertise or publish schedule listings for the air transportation covered by its application after the application has been approved by the Department (but before all authority issued by DOT, including the FAA,
becomes effective) unless such advertising or schedule listings prominently state: “This service is subject to receipt of government operating authority.”

# Subpart B—Certificate Terms, Conditions, and Limitations
§ 201.6
Applicability.
Unless the certificate or the order authorizing its issuance shall otherwise provide, such terms, conditions and limitations as are set forth in this part, and as may from time to time be prescribed by the Department, shall apply to the exercise of the privileges granted by each certificate issued under section 41102 or section 41103 of 49 U.S.C. Subtitle VII.
[Doc. No. 47582, 57 FR 38765, Aug. 27, 1992, as amended at 60 FR 43523, Aug. 22, 1995; Doc. No. DOT-OST-2014-0140, 84 FR 15924, Apr. 16, 2019]
§ 201.7
General certificate conditions.
(a) It shall be a condition upon the holding of a certificate that any intentional failure by the holder to comply with any provision of Statute or any order, rule, or regulation issued thereunder or any term, condition, or limitation of such certificate shall be a failure to comply with the terms, conditions, and limitations of the certificate within the meaning of section 41110 of 49 U.S.C. Subtitle VII even though the failure to comply occurred outside the territorial limits of the United States, except to the extent that such failure shall be necessitated by an obligation, duty, or liability imposed by a foreign country.
(b) Failure to file the reports required by part 241, 291, or 298 of this chapter shall be sufficient grounds to revoke a certificate.
(c) The authority to transport U.S. mail under a certificate is permissive, unless the Department, by order or rule, directs a carrier or class of carriers to transport mail on demand of the U.S. Postal Service; such certificate confers no right to receive subsidy, for the carriage of mail or otherwise.
(d) An all-cargo air transportation certificate shall confer no right to carry passengers, other than cargo attendants accompanying a shipment, or to engage in any air transportation outside the geographical scope of interstate cargo transportation. Such certificate shall not, however, restrict the right of the holder to provide scheduled, charter, contract, or other transportation of cargo, by air, within that geographical scope.
(e) It shall be a condition upon the holding of a certificate that the holder have and maintain in effect and on file with the Department a signed counterpart of Agreement 18900 (OST Form 4523), and a tariff (for those carriers otherwise generally required to file tariffs) that includes its terms, and that the holder comply with all other requirements of part 203. OST Form 4523 may be obtained from the Office of International Aviation, Special Authorities Division.

§ 203.4
Montreal Agreement as part of airline-passenger contract and conditions of carriage.
(a) As required by the Montreal Agreement, carriers that are otherwise generally required to file tariffs shall file with the Department's Pricing and Multilateral Affairs Division a tariff that includes the provisions of the counterpart to Agreement 18900.
(b) As further required by that Agreement, each participating carrier shall include the Agreement's terms as part of its conditions of carriage. The participating carrier shall give each of its passengers the notice required by the Montreal Agreement as provided in § 221.105 of this chapter.
(c) Participation in the Montreal Agreement, whether by signing the Agreement, filing a signed counterpart to it under § 203.3, or by operation of law under § 203.5, shall constitute a special agreement between the carrier and its passengers as a condition of carriage that a liability limit of not less than $75,000 (U.S.) shall apply under Article 22(1) of the Warsaw Convention for passenger injury and death. Such participation also constitutes a waiver of the defense under Article 20(1) of the Convention that the carrier was not negligent.

Compliance as condition on operations in air transportation.
It shall be a condition on the authority of all direct U.S. and foreign carriers to operate in air transportation that they have and maintain in effect and on file with the Department a signed counterpart of Agreement 18900, and a tariff (for those carriers otherwise generally required to file tariffs) that includes its provisions, as required by this subpart. Notwithstanding any failure to file that counterpart and such tariff, any such air carrier or foreign air carrier issued license authority (including exemptions) by the Department or operating in air transportation shall be deemed to have agreed to the provisions of Agreement 18900 as fully as if that air carrier or foreign air carrier had in fact filed a properly executed counterpart to that Agreement and tariff.

(a) A certificated or commuter air carrier proposing a substantial change in operations, ownership or management shall file the data set forth in § 204.3. These data must be submitted in cases where:
(1) The proposed change requires new or amended authority, or
(2) The change substantially alters the factors upon which its latest fitness finding is based, even if no new authority is required.
(b) Information which a carrier has previously formally filed with the Department, or with another Federal agency where they are available to the Department, which continues to reflect the current state of the carrier's fitness may be omitted. The carrier instead should identify the data and provide a citation for the date(s) and place(s) of filing.

§ 204.6
Certificated and commuter air carriers proposing a change in operations, ownership, or management which is not substantial.
Carriers proposing to make a change which would not substantially affect their operations, management, or ownership, such as certificated carriers applying for additional authority which would not substantially change their operations, will be presumed to be fit and need not file any information relating to their fitness at time of the change. However, if the Department concludes, from its own analysis or based on information submitted by third parties, that such change may bring the carrier's fitness into question, the Department may require the applicant carrier to file additional information.
§ 204.7
Revocation for dormancy.
(a) An air carrier that has not commenced any type of air transportation operations for which it was found fit, willing, and able within one year of the date of that finding, or an air carrier that, for any period of one year after the date of such a finding, has not provided any type of air transportation for which that kind of finding is required, is deemed no longer to continue to be fit to provide the air transportation for which it was found fit and, accordingly, its authority to provide such air transportation shall be revoked.
(b) An air carrier found fit which commences operations within one year after being found fit but then ceases operations, shall not resume operations without first filing all of the data required by § 204.3 at least 45 days before it intends to provide any such air transportation. Such filings shall be addressed to the Docket Operations Office, U.S. Department of Transportation, 1200 New Jersey Avenue, SE., Washington, DC 20590. The Department will entertain requests for exemption from this 45-day advance filing requirement for good cause shown. If there has been no change in fitness data previously formally filed with the Department, the carrier shall file a sworn statement to that effect signed by one of its officers. The carrier may contact the Department (Air Carrier Fitness Division) to ascertain which data are already available to the Department and need not be refiled. A carrier to which this paragraph applies shall not provide any air transportation for which it is required to be found fit, willing, and able until the Department decides that the carrier continues to be fit, willing, and able to perform such air transportation. During the pendency of the Department's consideration of a data submission under this paragraph, the expiration period set out in paragraph (a) of this section shall be stayed. If the decision or finding by the Department on the issue of the carrier's fitness is favorable, the date or that decision or finding shall be the date considered in applying paragraph (a) of this section.
(c) For purposes of this section, the date of a Department decision or finding shall be the service date of the Department's order containing such decision or finding, or, in cases where the Department's decision or finding is made by letter, the date of such letter.
(d) For purposes of this section, references to operations and to the providing of air transportation shall refer only to the actual performance of flight operations under an operating certificate issued to the carrier by the FAA.

§ 205.1
Purpose.
This part contains the rules for aircraft accident liability insurance coverage needed by U.S. direct air carriers to obtain or to exercise authority from the Department to operate in interstate or foreign air transportation, and by foreign direct air carriers to operate under permit or other authority in foreign air transportation. It further requires a disclosure statement to shippers about cargo liability limits and insurance coverage for U.S. and foreign direct air carriers.

§ 205.2
Applicability.
These rules apply to all U.S. direct air carriers, including commuter air carriers and air taxi operators as defined in § 298.2 of this chapter, and foreign direct air carriers, including Canadian charter air taxi operators as defined in § 294.2(c) of this chapter.
[Doc. No. 47939, 57 FR 40100, Sept. 2, 1992]
§ 205.3
Basic requirements.
(a) A U.S. or foreign direct air carrier shall not engage in air transportation unless it has in effect aircraft accident liability insurance coverage that meets the requirements of this part for its air carrier or foreign air carrier operations. The minimum amounts of coverage required by this part may be provided either by insurance policies or by self-insurance plans. The currently effective policy of insurance or complete plan for self-insurance shall be available for inspection by the Department at the carrier's principal place of business. The current certificate of insurance or a summary of the complete self-insurance plan on file with the Department, as required by § 205.4, shall be available for public inspection at the carrier's principal place of business.
(b) For purposes of this part, a certificate of insurance is one or more certificates showing insurance by one or more insurers (excluding reinsurers) of currently effective and properly endorsed policies of aircraft accident liability insurance in compliance with this part. When more than one such insurer is providing coverage, the limits and types of liability assumed by each insurer (excluding reinsurers) shall be clearly stated in the certificate of insurance. Insurance policies and self-insurance plans named in a certificate of insurance that accompanies an application for initial registration or for operating authority shall become effective not later than the proposed starting date for air carrier operations as shown in the application.
(c) The certificate of insurance shall list the types or classes of aircraft, or the specific aircraft by FAA or foreign government registration number, with respect to which the policy of insurance applies, or shall state that the policy applies to all aircraft owned or operated by the carrier in its air transportation operations. With respect to certificates of insurance that list aircraft by government registration number, the policy or self-insurance plan shall state that, while an aircraft
owned or leased by the carrier and declared in the policy is withdrawn from normal use because of its breakdown, repair, or servicing, such insurance as is provided by the policy or plan for that aircraft shall apply also to another aircraft of similar type, horsepower, and seating capacity, whether or not owned by the insured, while temporarily used as a substitute aircraft.
(d) Each certificate of insurance shall be signed by an authorized officer, agent, or other representative of the insurer or the insurance broker.
(e) Insurance coverage to meet the requirements of this part shall be obtained from one or more of the following:
(1) An insurer licensed to issue aircraft accident liability policies in any State, Commonwealth, or Territory of the United States, or in the District of Columbia;
(2) Surplus line insurers named on a current list of such insurers issued and approved by the insurance regulatory authority of any State, Commonwealth, or Territory of the United States or of the District of Columbia; or
(3) Insurers licensed or approved by a foreign government.
This requirement may be waived by the Department in the public interest.

§ 205.4
Filing of evidence of insurance.
(a) A U.S. or foreign air carrier shall file a certificate of insurance or a complete plan for self-insurance with the Department.

§ 205.5
Minimum coverage.
(a) Insurance contracts and self-insurance plans shall provide for payment on behalf of the carrier, within the specific limits of liability in this section, of all sums that the carrier
shall become legally obligated to pay as damages, excluding any deductible in the policy, for bodily injury to or death of a person, or for damage to the property of others, resulting from the carrier's operation or maintenance of aircraft in air transportation provided under its authority from the Department.
(b) U.S. and foreign direct air carriers, including commuter air carriers but excluding U.S. air taxi operators and Canadian charter air taxi operators, shall maintain the following coverage:
(1) Third-party aircraft accident liability coverage for bodily injury to or death of persons, including nonemployee cargo attendants, other than passengers, and for damage to property, with minimum limits of $300,000 for any one person in any one occurrence, and a total of $20,000,000 per involved aircraft for each occurrence, except that for aircraft of not more than 60 seats or 18,000 pounds maximum payload capacity, carriers need only maintain coverage of $2,000,000 per involved aircraft for each occurrence.
(2) Any such carrier providing air transportation for passengers shall, in addition to the coverage required in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, maintain aircraft accident liability insurance coverage for bodily injury to or death of aircraft passengers, with minimum limits of $300,000 for any one passenger, and a total per involved aircraft for each occurrence of $300,000 times 75 percent of the number of passenger seats installed in the aircraft.
(c) U.S. air taxi operators registered under part 298 shall maintain the following coverage:
(1) Third-party aircraft accident liability coverage for bodily injury to or death of persons, including nonemployee cargo attendants, other than passengers, with minimum limits of:
(i) $75,000 for any one person in any one occurrence, and a total of $300,000 per involved aircraft for each occurrence, and
(ii) A limit of a least $100,000 for each occurrence for loss of or damage to property.
(2) U.S. air taxi operators carrying passengers in air transportation shall, in addition to the coverage required in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, maintain aircraft accident liability insurance coverage for bodily injury to or death of aircraft passengers, with minimum limits of $75,000 for any one passenger, and a total per involved aircraft for each occurrence of $75,000 times 75 percent of the number of passenger seats installed in the aircraft.
(d) Canadian charter air taxi operators registered under part 294 of this chapter shall maintain the following coverage:
(1) Third-party aircraft accident liability coverage for bodily injury to or death of persons, including nonemployee cargo attendants, other than passengers, and for damage to property, with a minimum coverage of $75,000 for any one person in any one occurrence, and a total of $2,000,000 per involved aircraft for each occurrence, except that Canadian charter air taxi operators operating aircraft of more than 30 seats or 7,500 pounds maximum cargo payload capacity, and a maximum authorized takeoff weight on wheels not greater than 35,000 pounds shall maintain coverage for those aircraft of $20,000,000 per involved aircraft for each occurrence.
(2) Canadian charter air taxi operators engaging in passenger charter air service under part 294 of this chapter shall, in addition to the coverage required in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, maintain aircraft accident liability coverage for bodily injury to or death of aircraft passengers, with a minimum coverage of $75,000 for any one passenger and a total per involved aircraft for each occurrence of $75,000 times 75 percent of the total number of passenger seats installed in the aircraft.
(e) Notwithstanding paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) of this section, the carrier may be insured for a combined single limit of liability for each occurrence. The combined single-limit coverage must be not less than the combined required minimums for bodily injury and property damage coverage plus, if the aircraft is used in passenger service, the required total passenger coverages stipulated in paragraph (b) of this section for U.S. and foreign direct air carriers and commuter carriers, paragraph
(c) of this section for U.S. air taxi operators, or paragraph (d) of this section for Canadian charter air taxi operators.
1
The single-limit liability policy for the required aircraft accident liability coverage may be provided by a single policy or by a combination of primary and excess policies.
1
For example: the minimum single limit of liability acceptable for any aircraft in air taxi passenger service with 16 passenger seats would be computed on the basis of limits set forth in paragraph (c) as follows: 16 × .75 equals 12; 12 × $75,000 equals $900,000; $900,000 plus $300,000 (nonpassenger liability per occurrence) plus $100,000 (property damage per occurrence) equals $1,300,000. The latter amount is the minimum in which a single-limit liability policy may be written.
(f) The liability coverage shall not be contingent upon the financial condition, solvency, or freedom from bankruptcy of the carrier. The limits of the liability for the amounts required by this part shall apply separately to each occurrence. Any payment made under the policy or plan because of any one occurrence shall not reduce the coverage for payment of other damages resulting from any other occurrence.
[Doc. No. 47939, 57 FR 40101, Sept. 2, 1992; 57 FR 52590, Nov. 4, 1992]
§ 205.6
Prohibited exclusion of coverage.
(a) No warranty or exclusion in the policy or plan or in any endorsement or amendment to the policy or plan, nor any violation of the policy or plan by the carrier, shall remove the liability coverage required by this part, except as specifically approved by the Department. This requirement shall not limit the right of insurers to recover from the carrier for amounts paid.
(b) A policy of insurance or a self-insurance plan required by this part shall not contain the following exclusions:
(1) Violation of any safety-related requirement imposed by statute or by rule of a government agency.
(2) Liability assumed by the carrier under an agreement to raise the liability limitations of the Warsaw Convention by signing a counterpart to an agreement of carriers (such as the Montreal Agreement, 18900, signed May 13, 1966, agreeing to a limit on the carrier's liability for injury or death of passengers of $75,000 per passenger), or any amendment to such agreement that may be approved by the Department and to which the carrier becomes a party.

§ 205.7
Cancellation, withdrawal, modification, expiration, or replacement of insurance coverage.
(a) Each policy of aircraft accident liability insurance and plan for self insurance shall specify that it shall remain in force, and may not be replaced, canceled, withdrawn, or in any way modified to reduce the minimum standards set forth in this part, or to change the extent of coverage, by the insurer or the carrier, nor expire by its own terms, in regard to coverage for the carrier in its common carrier operations in air transportation, until 10 days after written notice by the insurer (in the event of replacement, by the retiring insurer), or by the insurer's representative, or by the carrier, describing the change, to the Department at the addresses specified in § 205.4(c), which 10-day notice period shall start to run from the date such notice is actually received at the Department. For purposes of this part, a policy will not be considered to have expired if the same insurer renews its coverage without reduction in the extent of coverage or amounts of coverage, and without a break in coverage, whether or not a new policy is issued, and notice to the Department is not required in that event. If the coverage being changed is by type or class of aircraft or by specific aircraft, endorsements adding or deleting specific aircraft or types or classes of aircraft, for which prior notice would be required by this paragraph, shall be filed in accordance with § 205.4(b), and prior notice of the change need not be given under this paragraph.
(b) The requirements of this section shall not apply if the policy contains a lesser time period for cancellation in a war risk exclusion. If the war risk exclusion is activated by the insurer, the
insurer or its representative shall immediately notify the Department.

§ 205.8
Cargo liability disclosure statement.
Every direct U.S. or foreign air carrier providing air cargo service in air transportation shall give notice in writing to the shipper, when a shipment is accepted, of the existence or absence of cargo liability insurance, and the limits on the extent of its liability, if any. The notice shall be clearly and conspicuously included on or attached to all of its rate sheets and airwaybills.

§ 211.33
Interstate and interstate authority.
(a) An application under this subpart may include a request, in addition to other foreign air transportation, for authority to engage in interstate air transportation between Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands and Honolulu, Hawaii, and interstate air transportation within the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. A request for all or part of such limited interstate air transportation authority shall be supported by documentation establishing:
(1) The impact of such interstate air transportation services on the economic projections of the carrier's proposed operations;
(2) The need for such proposed interstate air transportation by the affected U.S. points;

(b) The Department may grant a Freely Associated State Air Carrier authority to engage in all or part of the interstate air transportation requested in paragraph (a) of this section provided that the Department finds:
(1) That grant of such interstate air transportation authority would be in furtherance of the objectives of the Compact of Free Association and related agreements between the United States and the Freely Associated States, and would otherwise be in the public interest; and
(2) That grant of such interstate air transportation authority would not significantly impair the economic viability of existing services providing essential air transportation to any eligible Freely Associated State point within the scope of part 272 of this chapter, or significantly increase compensation that may be required to maintain any such essential air transportation.
(c) The Department may, at any time, subject to Presidential review under section 41307, suspend, modify, or revoke such interstate authority if it
concludes that the requirements specified in paragraph (b) of this section are not then being met.
[Amdt. 211-18, 52 FR 5442, Feb. 22, 1987]
§ 211.34
Other permits.
Nothing in this section shall be construed as limiting the authority of the Department to issue a foreign air carrier permit, other than a Freely Associated State Foreign Air Carrier Permit, to a carrier owned or controlled, in whole or in part, by citizens of the Federated States of Micronesia, the Marshall Islands or Palau, that does not meet the requirements of this section.
§ 211.35
Termination of eligibility.
The eligibility of a carrier owned or controlled, in whole or in part, by citizens of the Federated States of Micronesia, the Marshall Islands or Palau, respectively, for issuance of a Freely Associated State Foreign Air Carrier Permit under this subpart shall exist only for such period as subparagraphs (a), (d), and (e) (eligibility for Freely Associated State essential air transportation subsidy compensation), or subparagraph (c) (limited interstate air transportation authority), of paragraph (5) of the Agreement on Civil Aviation Economic Services and Related Programs (Article IX of the Federal Programs and Services Agreement) remain in effect between the Government of those States and the Government of the United States, insofar as authority is conferred by such permits for purposes specified in those subparagraphs.

(b) Charter flights may be operated on a round-trip or one-way basis, with no minimum group, shipment, or contract size.
(c) Contracts to perform charter flights must be in writing and signed by an authorized representative of the certificated or foreign air carrier and the charterer prior to the operation of the flights involved. The written agreement shall include:
(1) The name and address of either the surety whose bond secures advance charter payments received by the carrier, or of the carrier's depository bank to which checks or money orders for the advance charter payments are to be made payable as escrow holder pending completion of the charter trip; and

(d) A certificated or foreign air carrier must make a reasonable effort to verify that any charterer with which it contracts, and any charter it conducts, meets the applicable requirements of this chapter.

For the purpose of this section, payment to the carrier's depository bank, as designated in the charter contract, shall be deemed payment to the carrier.
(f) A certificated or foreign air carrier operating a U.S.-originating passenger charter shall be responsible to return to his or her point of origin any passenger who purchased round trip transportation on that charter and who was transported by that carrier on his or her outbound flight; except that this provision shall not apply in cases where the return transportation is to be provided by another certificated or foreign air carrier.

Some of the Federal rules that protect against tour changes and loss of passengers' money in publicly sold charters do not apply to this charter flight.
(d) “Bona fide members” are members of an organization who: Have not joined the organization merely to travel on a charter flight; and who have been members of the chartering organization for a minimum of six months prior to the date of commencement of the affected flight;
provided,
that the “six month” rule does not apply to:

§ 212.6
Operation of gambling junket charters.
A gambling junket charter operated by a certificated or foreign air carrier must meet the following criteria:

(b) The casino, hotel, or cruise line or its agents, may not require a passenger to incur any expense in taking the trip,
provided,
that this provision shall not preclude the casino, hotel, or cruise line or its agents, from requiring prospective passengers to pay nominal reservation fees that are duly refundable by the casino, hotel, or cruise line before the flight, establish a minimum line-of-credit at the casino, hotel, or cruise line, bring (but not necessarily spend) a specified minimum amount of money, or meet other requirements that do not place them in financial jeopardy; nor does it preclude the casino, hotel, or cruise line, or its agents,
from offering operational land packages for a fee.
§ 212.7

(a) Certificated and foreign air carriers may sell or offer for sale, and operate, as principal, Public Charter flights under part 380 of this chapter directly to the public.
(b) Each certificated or foreign air carrier operating a charter trip under this section shall comply with all the requirements of part 380 of this chapter, except that:

The liability of the securer with respect to any charter participant may be limited to the charter price paid by or on behalf of such participant.
(c) The Department reserves the right to limit or prohibit the operation of direct sales Public Charters by a foreign air carrier upon a finding that such action is necessary in the public interest.
§ 212.8
Protection of customers' payments.
(a) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, no certificated air carrier or foreign air carrier shall perform any charter trip (other than a cargo charter trip) originating in the United States or any Overseas Military Personnel Charter trip, as defined in part 372 of this chapter, nor shall such carrier accept any advance payment in connection with any such charter trip, unless there is on file with the Department a copy of a currently effective agreement made between said carrier and a designated bank, by the terms of which all sums payable in advance to the carrier by charterers, in connection with any such trip to be performed by said carrier, shall be deposited with and maintained by the bank, as escrow holder, the agreement to be subject to the following conditions:
(1) The charterer (or its agent) shall pay the carrier either by check or money order made payable to the depository bank. Such check or money order and any cash received by the carrier from a charterer (or its agent) shall be deposited in, or mailed to, the bank no later than the close of the business day following the receipt of the check or money order or the cash, along with a statement showing the name and address of the charterer (or its agent); provided, however, that where the charter transportation to be performed by a carrier is sold through a travel agent, the agent may be authorized by the carrier to deduct its commission and remit the balance of the advance payment to the carrier either by check or money order made payable to the designated bank.
(2) The bank shall pay over to the carrier escrowed funds with respect to a specific charter only after the carrier has certified in writing to the bank that such charter has been completed; provided, however, that the bank may be required by the terms of the agreement to pay over to the carrier a specified portion of such escrowed funds, as payment for the performance of the outbound segment of a round-trip charter upon the carrier's written certification that such segment has been so completed.
(3) Refunds to a charterer from sums in the escrow account shall be paid directly to such charterer its assigns. Upon written certification from the carrier that a charter has been canceled, the bank shall turn over directly to the charterer or its assigns all escrowed sums (less any cancellation penalties as provided in the charter contract) which the bank holds with respect to such canceled charter, provided however, that in the case of a split charter escrowed funds shall be turned over to a charterer or its assigns only if the carrier's written certification of cancellation of such charter includes a specific representation that either the charter has been canceled by the carrier or, if the charter has been canceled by the charterer, that the carrier has accepted a substitute charterer.
(4) The bank shall maintain a separate accounting for each charter flight.
(5) As used in this section the term “bank” means a bank insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
(b) The escrow agreement required under paragraph (a) of this section shall not be effective until approved by the Department. Claims against the escrow may be made only with respect to the non-performance of air transportation.
(c) The carrier may elect, in lieu of furnishing an escrow agreement pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, to furnish and file with the Department a surety bond with guarantees to the United States Government the performance of all charter trips (other than cargo charter trips) originating in the United States and of all overseas military personnel charter trips, as defined in part 372 of this chapter, to be performed, in whole or in part, by such carrier pursuant to any contracts entered into by such carrier. The amount of such bond shall be unlimited.
1
Claims under the bond may be made only with respect to the non-performance of air transportation.
1
While the face amount of the bond is unlimited, claims are limited to amounts that are paid to carrier for U.S.-originating passenger charter flights that carrier fails to perform or to refund.
(d) The bond permitted by this section shall be in the form set forth as the appendix to this part. Such bond shall be issued by a bonding or surety company—
(1) Which is listed in Best's Insurance Reports (Fire and Casualty) with a general policyholders' rating of “A” or better or
(2) Which is listed in the U.S. Department of Treasury's notice listing companies holding Certificates of Authority as acceptable sureties on Federal bonds and as acceptable reinsuring companies, published in the
Federal Register
on or about July 1. The bonding or surety company shall be one legally authorized to issue bonds of that type in the State in which there is located the office or usual residence of the agency designated by the carrier under 49 U.S.C. 46103 to receive service of notices, process and other documents issued by or filed with the Department of Transportation. For the purposes of this section the term “State” includes any territory or possession of the United States, or the District of Columbia. If the bond does not comply with the requirements of this section, or for any reason fails to provide satisfactory or adequate protection for the public, the Department will notify the certificated or foreign air carrier by registered or certified mail, stating the deficiencies of the bond. Unless such deficiencies are corrected within the time limit set forth in the notification, no amounts payable in advance by customers for the subject charter trips shall be accepted by the carrier.
(e) The bond required by this section shall provide that unless the charterer files a claim with the carrier, or, if the carrier is unavailable, with the surety, within 60 days after cancellation of a charter trip with respect to which the charterer's advance payments are secured by the bond, the surety shall be released from all liability under the bond to such charterer for such charter trip. The contract between the carrier and the charterer shall contain notice of this provision.
§ 212.9
Prior authorization requirements.
(a) Certificated air carriers shall obtain a statement of authorization for
each long-term wet lease to a foreign air carrier.
(b) Foreign air carriers shall obtain a statement of authorization for each:
(1) Fifth-, sixth- and/or seventh-freedom charter flights to or from the United States;
(2) Long-term wet lease;
(3) Charter flight for which the Department specifically requires prior authorization under paragraph (e) or (f) of this section; or
(4) Part charter.
(c) The Department may issue blanket statements of authorization to foreign air carriers to conduct fifth freedom charters. The standards for issuing such blanket authorizations shall be those stated in § 212.11. The Department may revoke any authority granted under this paragraph at any time without hearing.
(d) The Department may at any time, with or without hearing, but with at least 30 days' notice, require a foreign air carrier to obtain a statement of authorization before operating any charter flight. In deciding whether to impose such a requirement, the Department will consider (but not be limited to considering) whether the country of the carrier's nationality:
(1) Requires prior approval for third or fourth freedom charter flights by U.S. air carriers;
(2) Has, over the objection of the U.S. Government, denied rights of a U.S. air carrier guaranteed by a bilateral agreement; or
(3) Has otherwise impaired, limited, or denied the operating rights of U.S. air carriers, or engaged in unfair, discriminatory, or restrictive practices with respect to air transportation services to, from, through, or over its territory.
(e) The Department, in the interest of national security, may require a foreign air carrier to provide prior notification or to obtain a statement of authorization before operating any charter flight over U.S. territory.

(c)(1) Applicants for statements of authorization filed by foreign air carriers shall include documentation to establish the extent to which the country of the applicant's nationality deals with U.S. air carriers on the basis of reciprocity for similar flights, if such flights are not subject to a bilateral agreement, and
(i) The Department has not established that the country accords reciprocity;
(ii) The Department has found reciprocity defective in the most recent
prior approval application involving the country; or

(3) A copy of each memorandum shall be served on the certified or foreign air carrier applying for approval.
(f)(1) Unless otherwise ordered by the Department, each application and memorandum filed in response will be available for public inspection at the Office of International Aviation immediately upon filing. Such information with respect to codeshare applications and responsive pleadings will be available for public inspection at DOT Dockets or at the DOT Dockets website. Notice of the filing of all applications shall be published in the Department's Weekly List of Applications Filed.
(2) Any person objecting to public disclosure of any information in an application or memorandum must state the grounds for the objection in writing.

§ 212.11
Issuance of statement of authorization.
(a) The Department will issue a statement of authorization if it finds that the proposed charter flight, part charter, or wet lease meets the requirements of this part and that it is in the public interest. Statements of authorization may be conditioned or limited.
(b) In determining the public interest the Department will consider (but not be limited to) the following factors:
(1) The extent to which the authority sought is covered by and consistent with bilateral agreements to which the United States is a party.
(2) The extent to which an applicant foreign air carrier's home country (and, in the case of a long-term wet lease, the lessee's home country) deals with U.S. air carriers on the basis of substantial reciprocity.
(3) Whether the applicant or its agent has previously violated the provisions of this part.
(4) Where the application concerns a long-term wet lease:
(i) Whether the lessor (applicant) or its agent or the lessee (charterer) or its agent has previously violated the provisions of the Department's charter regulations.
(ii) Whether, because of the nature of the arrangement and the benefits involved, the authority sought should be the subject of a bilateral agreement.
(iii) To what extent the lessor owns and/or controls the lessee, or is owned and/or controlled by the lessee.
(c) The Department will submit any denial of an authorization specifically required of a foreign air carrier under § 212.9(d) to the President of the United States at least 10 days before the proposed departure. The denial will be subject to stay or disapproval by the President within 10 days after it is submitted. A shorter period for Presidential review may be specified by the Department where the application for authorization is not timely or properly filed. Denial of a late-filed application need not be submitted to the President. For the purposes of this paragraph, an application filed by a foreign air carrier under § 212.9(d) to conduct a cargo charter will be considered as timely filed only if it is filed at least 30 calendar days before the proposed flight, notwithstanding the 10-day filing requirement for cargo charters in § 212.10(d)(3).
(d) The Department will publish notice of its actions on applications for statements of authorization in its Weekly List of Applications Filed. Interested persons may upon request obtain copies of letters of endorsed forms advising applicants of action taken on their applications.

§ 212.12
Waiver.
The Department may grant a waiver of any of the provisions of this part upon a finding that such waiver is in the public interest. A certificated or foreign air carrier may request a waiver by filing a written application with the Department, citing the specific provision to be waived and providing justification for such waiver.

# Appendix A to Part 212—Certificated or Foreign Air Carrier's Surety Bond Under Part 212 of the Regulations of the Department of Transportation (14 CFR Part 212)
Know all persons by these presents, that we __________ (Name of certificated or foreign air carrier) of __________, (City) __________ (State or Country) as Principal (hereinafter called Principal), and __________ (name of Surety) a corporation created and existing under the laws of the State of ________ (State) as Surety (hereinafter called Surety) are held and firmly bound unto the United States of America in an unlimited amount, as required by 14 CFR 212.8, for which payment, well and truly to be made, we bind ourselves and our heirs, executors, administrators, successors, and assigns, jointly and severally, firmly by these presents.
Whereas the principal, a certificated air carrier holding a certificate of public convenience and necessity issued under 49 U.S.C. 41102, or a foreign air carrier holding a foreign air carrier permit issued under 49 U.S.C. 41302 or an exemption issued under 49 U.S.C. 40109 authorizing that foreign air carrier to engage in charter trips in foreign air transportation, is subject to rules and regulations of the Department of Transportation relating to security for the protection of charterers of civil aircraft and has elected to file with the Department of Transportation such a bond as will guarantee to the United States Government the performance of all charter trips (other than cargo charter trips) originating in the United States and of all Overseas Military Personnel Charters, as defined in 14 CFR part 372, to be performed, in whole or in part, by such certificated or foreign air carrier pursuant to contracts entered into by such carrier after the execution date of this bond, and
Whereas this bond is written to assure compliance by the Principal with rules and regulations of the Department of Transportation relating to security for the protection of charterer of civil aircraft for charter trips (other than cargo charters) originating in the United States or of Overseas Military Personnel Charter trips and shall inure to the benefit of any and all such charterers to whom the Principal may be held legally liable for any of the damages herein described.
Now, therefore, the condition of this obligation is such that if the Principal shall pay or cause to be paid to such charterer any sum or sums for which the Principal may be held legally liable by reason of the Principal's failure faithfully to perform, fulfill,
and carry out all contracts made by the Principal while this bond is in effect for the performance of charter trips (other than cargo charter trips) originating in the United States and of Overseas Military Personnel Charter trips, then this obligation shall be void, otherwise to remain in full force and effect.
The liability of the Surety shall not be discharged by any payment or succession of payments hereunder in any specified amount. The surety agrees to furnish written notice to the Department of Transportation forthwith of all suits filed, judgments rendered, and payments made by said Surety under this bond.
This bond is effective the ___ day of ________, ____, 12:01 a.m., standard time at the address of the Principal as stated herein and shall continue in force until terminated as hereinafter provided. The Principal or the Surety may at any time terminate this bond by written notice to the Department of Transportation at its office in Washington, D.C., such termination to become effective thirty (30) days after actual receipt of said notice by the Department. The Surety shall not be liable hereunder for the payment of the damages hereinbefore described which arise as the result of any contracts for the performance of air transportation services made by the Principal after the termination of this bond becomes effective, as herein provided, but such termination shall not affect the liability of the Surety hereunder for the payment of any such damages arising as the result of contracts for the performance of air transportation services made by the Principal after the termination of this bond becomes effective. Liability of the Surety under this bond shall in all events be limited only to a charterer who shall within sixty (60) days after the cancellation of a charter trip with respect to which the charterer's advance payments are secured by this bond give written notice of claim to the certificated or foreign air carrier, or, if it is unavailable, to the Surety, and all liability on this bond for such charter trip shall automatically terminate sixty (60) days after the termination date thereof except for claims filed within the time provided herein.

The Department may at any time require any foreign air carrier to file with the Department traffic data disclosing the nature and extent of such carrier's engagement in transportation between points in the United States and points outside thereof. The Department will specify the traffic data required in each such instance. Interested persons seeking reconsideration of a Department determination under this section may file a petition pursuant to § 302.14 of this chapter (Rule 14 of part 302) within 10 days after Department action.

§ 213.3
Filing and approval of schedules.
(a) In the absence of provisions to the contrary in the permit and of Department action pursuant to this section, a foreign air carrier may determine the schedules (including type of equipment used) pursuant to which it engages in transportation between points in the United States and points outside thereof.
(b) In the case of a foreign air carrier permit for scheduled air transportation which is not the subject of an air transport agreement between the United States and the government of the holder, the Department, if it finds that the public interest so requires, may with or without hearing order the foreign air carrier to file with it within 7 days after service of such order, an original and three copies of any or all of its existing schedules of service between any point in the United States and any point outside thereof, and may require such carrier thereafter to file an original and three copies of any proposed schedules of service between such points at least 30 days prior to the date of inauguration of such service. Such schedules shall contain all schedules of aircraft which are or will be operated by such carrier between each pair of points set forth in the order, the type of equipment used or to be used, the time of arrival and departure at each point, the frequency of each schedule, and the effective date of any proposed schedule.
(c) In the case of any foreign air carrier permit for scheduled air transportation which is the subject of an air transport agreement between the United States and the government of the holder, the Department may with or without hearing issue an order, similar to that provided for in paragraph (b) of this section, if it makes the findings provided for in that subsection and, in addition, finds that the government or aeronautical authorities of the government of the holder, over the objections of the U.S. Government, have: (1) Taken action which impairs, limits, terminates, or denies operating rights, or (2) otherwise denied or failed to prevent the denial of, in whole or in part, the fair and equal opportunity to exercise the operating rights, provided for in such air transport agreement, of any U.S. air carrier designated thereunder with respect to flight operations to, from, through, or over the territory of such foreign government.
(d) The carrier may continue to operate existing schedules, and may inaugurate operations under proposed schedules 30 days after the filing of such schedules with the Department, unless the Department with or without hearing issues an order, subject to stay or disapproval by the President of the United States within 10 days after adoption, notifying the carrier that such operations, or any part of them, may be contrary to applicable law or may adversely affect the public interest. If the notification pertains to a proposed schedule, service under such schedule shall not be inaugurated; if the notification pertains to existing schedules, service under such schedules shall be discontinued on the date specified in the Department's order. Such date shall be not less than ten days after adoption of the Department's order unless affirmative Presidential approval is obtained at an earlier date.
(e) No petitions for reconsideration may be filed with respect to Department orders issued pursuant to paragraph (b), (c), or (d) of this section. Nevertheless, if the Department serves a notification under paragraph (d) of this section, the carrier may make application to the Department for approval of any or all existing or proposed schedules, pursuant to the provisions of § 213.5. The Department may with or without hearing withdraw, in whole or in part, its notification at any time and may permit existing or proposed schedules to be operated for such period or periods as the Department may determine.
(f) The date of service on a foreign air carrier of orders and notifications pursuant to this section shall be the date of mailing thereof, by certified or registered mail, to the agent designated by the foreign air carrier pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 46103 or, if the foreign air carrier has failed to designate an agent, the date of mailing by registered air mail to the foreign air carrier's home office.

Compliance.
Any violation by the foreign air carrier of applicable provisions of Subtitle VII of Title 49 of the U.S. Code or of orders, rules or regulations issued thereunder, or of the terms, conditions or limitations applicable to the exercise of the privileges granted by the permit shall constitute a failure to comply
with the terms, conditions and limitations of such permit:
Provided,
That upon a showing that a violation of a provision not mandatorily prescribed by law resulted from the observance by the holder of an obligation, duty or liability imposed by a foreign country, the Department may excuse the violation.

§ 215.1
Applicability.
This part applies to all certificated air carriers, commuter air carriers, and foreign direct air carriers and to initial and amended applications for authority, applications for certificate or permit transfers or reissuances, and registration of business names.
[Doc. No. DOT-OST-2014-0140, 84 FR 15925, Apr. 16, 2019]
§ 215.2
Purpose.
This part sets rules under which direct air carriers may use the names in their operating authorizations and change those names. It further provides for notification to air carriers that may be affected by the use by other air carriers of the same or similar names. Its purpose is to place the responsibility for resolving private disputes about the use of similar names with the air carriers involved, through recourse to the trade names statutes
and the courts. These rules do not preclude Department intervention or enforcement action should there be evidence of a significant potential for, or of actual, public confusion.
§ 215.3
Use of name.
In holding out to the public and in performing air transportation services, a direct air carrier or foreign direct air carrier subject to this part shall use only the name in which its operating authorization is issued or trade name is registered, and shall not operate or hold out to the public in a name not acknowledged by the Department to be so registered. Minor variations in the use of this name, including abbreviations, contractions, initial letters, or other variations of the name that are identifiable with the authorized name, are permitted. Slogans and service marks shall not be considered names for the purpose of this part, and their use is not restricted.
[53 FR 17923, May 19, 1988, as amended at 70 FR 25768, May 16, 2005]
§ 215.4
Change of name or use of trade name.
(a)
Registrations.
Any air carrier subject to this part that desires to change the name in which its operating authorization has been issued, or to use a trade name, or to obtain initial operating authority must register the name with the Department. The Department will construe any application for initial, reissued, or transferred authority as containing a “registration” of the intended name. A separate name registration document need not be filed. A carrier registering use of a trade name, without seeking reissuance of its underlying certificate commuter or foreign air carrier permit or exemption authority, must file a statement that complies with §§ 302.3 and 302.4 of this chapter registering its intended name with the Air Carrier Fitness Division if it is a U.S. certificated or commuter carrier, or within the Foreign Air Carrier Licensing Divisionif it is a foreign air carrier.
(b)
Montreal Agreement.
Each registration under this section shall be accompanied by three copies of a counterpart to the Montreal Agreement (Agreement 18900) (OST Form 4523) signed by the carrier using the proposed name. Upon arrival of the application, the Department will place a copy of the signed OST form 4523 in Docket DOT-OST-1995-236.
(Reporting and recordkeeping requirements in paragraph (b) were approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 3024-0064.)

§ 215.5
Procedure in case of similarity of names.
The Department will compare the proposed name in any registration filed under this part or in an application for new, reissued, or transferred authority with a list of names used by existing certificated, commuter and foreign direct air carriers. The Department will notify the applicant of any other certificated, foreign or commuter carriers that may have an identical or similar name. The registrant must then notify those carriers of its registration. The notification will identify the applicant and state its proposed name or the name requested, area of operation or proposed area of operation, type of business, and other pertinent matters. The registrant must then file a certificate of service of the notification with the Department.
§ 215.6
Acknowledgment of registration.
After completion of the filing and notification requirements of this part, the Department may acknowledge the registration by notice in the action granting the application for initial operating authority, transfer, or reissuance or by separate notice in the case of use of a trade name. Non-action under this provision shall not be construed as an adjudication of any rights or liabilities.

§ 216.2
Applicability.
This part sets forth the requirements applicable to foreign air carriers for obtaining a Special Authorization from the Department with respect to any deviation from an authorized foreign air transportation route for the purpose of commingling blind sector traffic with air transportation traffic carried pursuant to a foreign air carrier permit issued by the Department. The deviation by a foreign air carrier from its authorized route for the purpose of combined carriage to or from the United States of nonrevenue or other traffic, the carriage of which does not constitute engaging in foreign air transportation, is governed by the provisions of part 375 of this chapter.
[ER-525, 33 FR 692, Jan. 19, 1968, as amended by Doc. No. DOT-OST-2014-0140, 84 FR 15926, Apr. 16, 2019]
§ 216.3
Prohibition.
No foreign air carrier shall carry any blind sector traffic, as defined in this part, on any flight operating in air transportation pursuant to the authority of a foreign air carrier permit issued under 49 U.S.C. 41301, unless the combined carriage of such traffic has been specifically authorized by such permit, or by a Special Authorization issued under § 216.4.
[ER-525, 33 FR 692, Jan. 19, 1968, as amended by Doc. No. DOT-OST-2014-0140, 84 FR 15926, Apr. 16, 2019]
§ 216.4
Special authorizations.
(a)
Applications.
Any foreign air carrier may apply to the Department for a Special Authorization, as required by this part, for the carriage of blind sector traffic on a particular flight, series of flights, or for a specified or indefinite period of time between specified points. Applications shall be submitted directly to the Department, addressed to the attention of the Director, Office of International Aviation. One original and two copies in conformity with the requirements of §§ 302.3(b) and 302.4 (a) and (b) of this chapter shall be filed. The applications shall contain a proper identification of the applicant; the flight or flights upon which it is proposed to carry such blind sector traffic, including routing, nontraffic stops, and dates or duration of the authority sought; a full description of such traffic, and points between which such traffic will be carried; information or documentation as to whether the country of which the applicant is a national grants reciprocal privileges to U.S. carriers; and the reasons for requesting such authorization together with such additional information as will establish that the grant of such authority will otherwise be in the public interest. Such additional information as may be specifically requested by the Department shall also be furnished.
(b)
Service.
Applications shall be served upon each direct U.S. air carrier certificated to engage in individually
ticketed or waybilled foreign air transportation over any portion of the route to which the application pertains, and on such other persons as the Department may require, and proof of such service shall accompany the application as provided in § 302.7 of this chapter. Notice of such applications shall also be published in the Department's Weekly List of Applications Filed.
(c)
Memoranda in support or opposition.
Any interested person may file a memorandum in support of or in opposition to the grant of an application. Such memorandum shall set forth in detail the reasons why it is believed that the application should be granted or denied and shall be accompanied by such data, including affidavits, which it is desired that the Department consider. Copies of the memorandum shall be served upon the applicant. Nothing in this subparagraph shall be deemed to preclude the Department from granting or denying an application when the circumstances so warrant without awaiting the filing of memoranda in support of or in opposition to the application.
(d)
Time for filing.
(1) Applications seeking authority to engage in blind sector operations for a period of 3 months or longer, shall be submitted at least 60 days in advance of the proposed commencement of such operations. Memoranda in response to such an application shall be submitted within 15 days after the date of filing thereof.
(2) Applications seeking authority to engage in blind sector operations for a period less than three months shall be filed at least 20 days in advance of the proposed commencement of such operations, and memoranda in response thereto within 7 days after the date of filing thereof:
Provided,
That the Department may consider late filed applications upon a showing of good cause for failure to adhere to this requirement.
(e)
General procedural requirements.
Except as otherwise provided herein, the provisions of part 302, subpart A, of this chapter shall apply to the extent applicable.
(f)
Issuance of Special Authorization.
A Special Authorization authorizing the carriage of blind sector traffic will be issued only if the Department finds that the proposed carriage is fully consistent with applicable law and this part, and that grant of such authority would be in the public interest. The application may be granted or denied in whole or in part without hearing, and a Special Authorization made subject to any conditions or limitations, to the extent that such action is deemed by the Department to be in the public interest. Special Authorizations are not transferable.
(g)
Nature of the privilege conferred.
A Special Authorization issued pursuant to this section shall constitute a privilege conferred upon a carrier, which may be enjoyed only to the extent that its continued exercise remains in the interest of the public. Accordingly, any Special Authorization issued pursuant to this section may be revoked, suspended, amended or restricted without hearing.

§ 216.5
Existing permits.
“Foreign aircraft permits” issued by the Department under the provisions of part 375 of this chapter (the Department's Special Regulations), authorizing the combined carriage of blind sector traffic as defined in this part, shall continue in effect in accordance with their terms until their expiration date unless sooner terminated, revoked or modified by the Department. Such permits shall, upon the effective date of this part, be deemed to constitute a Special Authorization issued pursuant to § 216.4.

§ 216.6
Existing unauthorized operations.
Notwithstanding the provisions of § 216.3, if within 30 days after the effective date of this part a carrier files an application for a Special Authorization to continue to perform existing blind
sector operations which have been regularly performed by such carrier commencing on a date prior to August 9, 1967, such carrier may continue to engage in such blind sector operations until final decision by the Department on such application:
Provided,
That any such application shall, in addition to the requirements of § 216.4(a), contain a statement that the carrier is relying upon this section for continuance of preexisting blind sector operations, and shall fully describe such operations including the date inaugurated, and the frequency and continuity of performance.

Pt. 217, App. A

# Appendix A to Part 217—Instructions to Foreign Air Carriers for Reporting Traffic Data on Form 41 Schedule T-100(f)
(a) General instructions.
(1) Description. Form 41 Schedule T-100(f) provides flight stage data covering both passenger/cargo and all cargo operations in scheduled and nonscheduled services. The schedule is used to report all flights which serve points in the United States or its territories as defined in this part.
(2) Applicability. Each foreign air carrier holding a section 41302 permit or exemption authority shall file Schedule T-100(f).
(3) Reports required by this section shall be submitted to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics in a format specified in accounting and reporting directives issued by the Bureau of Transportation Statistics' Director of Airline Information.
(4) Filing period. Form 41 Schedule T-100(f) shall be filed monthly and is due at the Department thirty (30) days following the end of the reporting month to which the data are applicable.
(b) Preparation of Form 41 Schedule T-100(f):
(1) Explanation of nonstop segments and on-flight markets. There are two basic categories of data, one pertaining to nonstop segments and the other pertaining to on-flight markets. For example, the routing (A-B-C-D) consists of three nonstop segment records A-B, B-C, and C-D, and six on-flight market records A-B, A-C, A-D, B-C, B-D, and C-D.
(2) Guidelines for reporting a nonstop segment. A nonstop segment is reported when one or both points are in the United States or its territories. These data shall be merged with that for all of the other reportable nonstop operations over the same segment. Nonstop segment data must be summarized by aircraft type, under paragraph (h)(1) of this appendix, and class of service, paragraph (g)(1)(v) of this appendix.
(3) Rules for determining a reportable on-flight market. On-flight markets are reportable when one or both points are within the U.S., with the following exceptions: (i) Do not report third country to U.S. markets resulting from flight itineraries which serve a third country prior to a homeland point in flights passing through the homeland bound for the U.S.; and (ii) do not report U.S. to third country markets resulting from itineraries serving third country points subsequent to a homeland point in flights outbound from the U.S. and passing through the homeland. In reporting data pertaining to these two exceptions, the traffic moving to or from the U.S. relating to the applicable prior or subsequent third countries (referred to as “behind” or “beyond” traffic) is to be combined with the applicable foreign homeland gateway point, just as though the traffic were actually enplaned or deplaned at the homeland gateway, without disclosure of the actual prior or subsequent points. Applicable flights are illustrated in examples (6) and (7) under paragraph (c) of this appendix.
(c) Examples of flights. Following are some typical flight itineraries that show the reportable nonstop segment and on-flight market entries. The carrier's homeland is the key factor in determining which on-flight markets are reportable.
(1) SQ flight # 11 LAX—NRT—SIN. This is an example of a flight with an intermediate foreign country. It is not necessary to report anything on the NRT—SIN leg.

(3) LB flight # 902 LPB-VVI-MAO-CCS-MIA. This flight serves two homeland points and two different foreign countries before terminating in the U.S. Nonstop segment information is required only for the nonstop segment involving a U.S. point. On-flight market information is required in 4 of the 10 markets, LPB-MIA and VVI-MIA, since these involve homeland and U.S. points; MAO-MIA is necessary to show traffic carried into the U.S., and CCS-MIA for the same reason, and also because in all cases where a nonstop segment entry is required, a corresponding on-flight market entry must also be reported.

(d) Provisions to reduce paperwork:
(1) Nonstop Segment Entries. The flight stage data applicable to nonstop segment entries must be summarized to create totals by aircraft equipment type, within service class, within pairs-of-points.
(2) On-flight Market Entries. The applicable on-flight market entries shall be summarized to create totals by service class within pair-of-points.
(e) Preparation of Schedule T-100 (f):
(1) Section A—Indicative and flight pattern information. A copy of Schedule T-100(f) is shown at the end of this appendix. Section A defines the origin and destination points and the service class code to which the nonstop segment data in Section B and the on-flight market data in Section C are applicable. Section A information, along with the carrier code and report date, must be included on each schedule.
(2) Section B—Nonstop segment information. Section B of the schedule is used for reporting nonstop segment information by aircraft type. To reduce the number of schedules reported, space is provided for including data on multiple different aircraft types. Similarly, the on-flight market section has been included on a single Schedule T-100(f), along with the nonstop segment data, rather than on a separate schedule.
(3) Section C—On-flight market information. Section C of the schedule is used for reporting on-flight market data. There will always be an on-flight market that corresponds to the nonstop segment. Because the on-flight market data are reported at the service class level rather than by aircraft type, a specific flight may produce more on-flight markets than nonstop segments, (see examples in paragraph (c) of this appendix), resulting in data reported in sections A and C only.
(f) [Reserved]
(g) Data element definitions:
(1) Service pattern information.
(i) Line A-1 Carrier code. Use the carrier code established by the Department. This code is provided to each carrier in the initial reporting letter from the Office of Airline Information (OAI). If there are any questions about these codes, contact the OAI Data Administration Division at the address in paragraph (a)(3) of this appendix.
(ii) Line A-2 Report date. This is the year and month to which the data are applicable. For example, 200009 indicates the year 2000, and the month of September.
(iii) Line A-3 Origin airport code. This is the departure airport, where an aircraft begins a flight segment, and where the passengers originate in an on-flight market. Use the 3-letter code from the City/Airport Codes section of the Official Airline Guide Worldwide Edition. If no 3-letter code is available, OAI will assign one; the address is in paragraph (a)(3) of this appendix.
(iv) Line A-4 Destination airport code. This is the arrival airport, where an aircraft stops on a flight segment, and where passengers deplane (get off the flight) after reaching their destination in a market. Use the 3-letter code from the source described in paragraph (g)(1)(iii) of this appendix.
(v) Line A-5 Service class code. Select one of the following single letter codes which describes the type of service being reported on a given flight operation.
F = Scheduled Passenger/cargo Service
G = Scheduled All-cargo Service
L = Nonscheduled Civilian Passenger/Cargo Charter
P = Nonscheduled Civilian All-Cargo Charter
Q = Nonscheduled Services (Other than Charter)
(2) Nonstop segment information:
(i) Line B-1 Aircraft type code. Use the four digit numeric code prescribed in paragraph (h)(1) of this appendix. If no aircraft type code is available, OAI will assign one. The address is in paragraph (a)(3) of this appendix.
(ii) Line B-2 Aircraft departures performed. This is the total number of physical departures performed with a given aircraft type, within service class and pair-of-points.
(iii) Line B-3 Revenue passengers transported. This is the total number of revenue passengers transported on a given nonstop segment. It represents the total number of revenue passengers on board over the segment without regard to their actual point of enplanement.
(iv) Line B-4 Revenue freight transported. This item is the total weight in kilograms (kg) of the revenue freight transported on a given nonstop segment without regard to its actual point of enplanement.
(3) On-flight market information:
(i) Line C-1 Total revenue passengers in market. This item represents the total number of revenue passengers, within service class, that were enplaned at the origin airport and deplaned at the destination airport.
(ii) Line C-2 Total revenue freight in market. This item represents the total weight in kilograms (kg) of revenue freight enplaned at the origin and deplaned at the destination airport.
(h) [Reserved]
(i) Joint Service.
(1) The Department may authorize joint service operations between two direct air carriers. Examples of these joint service operations are:
Blocked-space agreements;
Part-charter agreements;
Code-sharing agreements;
Wet-lease agreements, and similar arrangements.
(2) Joint-service operations shall be reported on BTS Form 41 Schedules T-100 and T-100(f) by the air carrier in operational control of the flight,
i.e.,
the air carrier that uses its flight crew to perform the operation. If there are questions about reporting a joint-service operation, contact the BTS Assistant Director—Airline Information at the address in paragraph (a)(3) of this appendix.
(j) [Reserved]

# Source:
ER-716, 36 FR 23148, Dec. 4, 1971, unless otherwise noted.
§ 218.1
Definitions.
For the purpose of this part the term
lease
shall mean an agreement under which an aircraft is furnished by one party to the agreement to the other party, irrespective of whether the agreement constitutes a true lease, charter arrangement, or some other arrangement.
§ 218.2
Applicability.
This part applies to foreign air carriers and other persons not citizens of the United States which, as lessors or lessees, enter into agreements providing for the lease of aircraft with crew to a foreign air carrier for use in foreign air transportation. For purposes of 49 U.S.C. 41301, the person who
has operational control and safety responsibility is deemed to be the carrier, and is required to have appropriate operating authority.
[ER-716, 36 FR 23148, Dec. 4, 1971, as amended by ER-1250, 46 FR 47770, Sept. 30, 1981; DOT-OST-2014-0140, 84 FR 15929, Apr. 16, 2019]
§ 218.3
Prohibition against unauthorized operations employing aircraft leased with crew.
(a) No foreign air carrier, or other person not a citizen of the United States, shall lease an aircraft with crew to a foreign air carrier for use by the latter in performing foreign air transportation unless either:
(1) The lessor holds a foreign air carrier permit issued under 49 U.S.C. 41301 or an approved registration issued under part 294 of this chapter, and any statement of authorization required by part 212 of this chapter; or
(2) The Department has issued an exemption under 49 U.S.C. 40109 specifically authorizing the lessor to engage in the foreign air transportation to be performed under the lease; or
(3) The Department has issued an order under § 218.6 disclaiming jurisdiction over the matter.
(b) For purposes of this part, an aircraft shall be considered to be leased with crew if:
(1) The pilot in command or a majority of the crew of the aircraft, other than cabin attendants:
(i) Is to be furnished by the lessor;
(ii) Is employed by the lessor;
(iii) Continues in the employ of the lessor in the operation of services other than those provided for in the agreement between the parties; or
(iv) Has been employed by the lessor prior to the lease, and the employment of whom by the lessee is coextensive with the period or periods for which the aircraft is available to the lessee under the lease; or
(2) The aircraft is operated under operations specifications issued to the lessor by the Federal Aviation Administration.
[ER-716, 36 FR 23148, Dec. 4, 1971, as amended by ER-1250, 46 FR 47770, Sept. 30, 1981; ER-1260, 46 FR 52598, Oct. 27, 1981; DOT-OST-2014-0140, 84 FR 15929, Apr. 16, 2019]
§ 218.4
Condition upon authority of lessee.
In any case where a foreign air carrier leases from another foreign air carrier or other person not a citizen of the United States an aircraft with crew for use in performing foreign air transportation, it shall be a condition upon the authority of the lessee to perform such foreign air transportation that compliance be achieved with the requirements of this part.
§ 218.5
Application for disclaimer of jurisdiction.
The parties to a lease with crew as described in § 218.3(b) may apply to the Department for an order disclaiming jurisdiction over the matter. The application shall be filed jointly by both parties to the lease, and shall generally conform to the procedural requirements of part 302, subpart A, of this chapter. It shall be served upon any air carrier providing services over all or any part of the route upon which air transportation services will be provided pursuant to the agreement. The application should set forth in detail all evidence and other factors relied upon to demonstrate that true operational control and safety responsibility for the air transportation services to be provided are in the hands of the lessee rather than the lessor. A copy of the agreement and all amendments thereof, as well as a summary interpretation of its pertinent provisions, shall be included with the applications. Any interested person may file an answer to the application within 7 days after service hereof. Until the Department has acted upon the application, no operations in foreign transportation shall be performed pursuant to the agreement.
[ER-716, 36 FR 23148, Dec. 4, 1971, as amended by DOT-OST-2014-0140, 84 FR 15929, Apr. 16, 2019]
§ 218.6
Issuance of order disclaiming jurisdiction.
If the Department finds that true operational control and safety responsibility will be vested in the lessee and not in the lessor (
i.e.
, that the lease transaction is in substance a true lease
of aircraft rather than a charter or series of charters), and that the performance of the operations provided for in such lease will not result in the lessor's being engaged in foreign air transportation, it will issue an order disclaiming jurisdiction over the matter. Otherwise the application for disclaimer of jurisdiction will be denied.
[ER-716, 36 FR 23148, Dec. 4, 1971, as amended by DOT-OST-2014-0140, 84 FR 15929, Apr. 16, 2019]
§ 218.7
Presumption.
Whether under a particular lease agreement the lessor of the aircraft is engaged in foreign air transportation is a question of fact to be determined in the light of all the facts and circumstances. However, in circumstances where the lessor furnishes both the aircraft and the crew, there is a presumption that true operational control and safety responsibility are exercised by the lessor, and that the agreement constitutes a charter arrangement under which the lessor is engaged in foreign air transportation. The burden shall rest upon the applicants for disclaimer of jurisdiction in each instance to demonstrate by an appropriate factual showing that the operation contemplated will not constitute foreign air transportation by the lessor.

(iii) To the extent fares for scheduled passenger service are within a statutory or Department-established zone of fare flexibility; and
(iv) To meet competition: Provided, that
(A) Changed matter will be deemed to have been filed to meet competition only when it effects decreases in fares or charges and/or increases the value of service so that the level of the fares or charges and the services provided will be substantially similar to the level of fares or charges and the services of a competing carrier or carriers.
(B) New matter will be deemed to have been filed to meet competition only when it establishes or affects a fare or charge and a service which will be substantially similar to the fares or charges and the services of a competing carrier or carriers.
(C) When new or changed matter is filed to meet competition over a portion of the filing air carrier's system and is simultaneously made applicable to the balance of the system, such matter, insofar as it applies over the balance of the system, will be deemed to be within the exception in this paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this section only if such carrier submits an explanation as to the necessity of maintaining uniformity over its entire system with respect to such new or changed matter.
(D) In any case where new or changed matter is filed to meet competition, the filing carrier or agent must supply, as part of the filing justification, the complete tariff references which will serve to identify the competing tariff matter which the tariff purports to meet. In such case the justification or attachment shall state whether the new or changed matter is identical to the competing tariff matter which it purports to meet or whether it approximates the competing tariff matter. If the new or changed matter is not identical, the transmittal letter or attachment shall contain a statement explaining, in reasonable detail, the basis for concluding that the tariff publication being filed is substantially similar to the competing tariff matter.

§ 221.105
Special notice of limited liability under international treaty.
(a)(1) In addition to the other requirements of this subpart, each air carrier and foreign air carrier which, to any extent, avails itself of the limitation on liability to passengers provided by an international treaty, shall, at the time of delivery of the ticket, furnish to each passenger whose transportation is governed by the international treaty and whose place of departure or place of destination is in the United States, the following statement in writing:

# Advice to International Passengers on Limitations of Liability
Passengers embarking upon a journey involving an ultimate destination or a stop in a country other than the country of departure are advised that the provisions of an international treaty (the Warsaw Convention, the 1999 Montreal Convention, or other treaty), as well as a carrier's own contract of carriage or tariff provisions, may be applicable to their entire journey, including any portion entirely within the countries of departure and destination. The applicable treaty governs and may limit the liability of carriers to passengers for death or personal injury, destruction or loss of, or damage to, baggage, and for delay of passengers and baggage.
Additional protection can usually be obtained by purchasing insurance from a private company. Such insurance is not affected by any limitation of the carrier's liability under an international treaty. For further information please consult your airline or insurance company representative.
(2) The statement prescribed in paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall be printed or displayed in type at least as large as 10-point modern type and in a form that contrasts with the stock or background on:
(i) Each ticket, including electronic tickets;
(ii) A piece of paper either placed in the ticket envelope with the ticket or attached to the ticket; or
(iii) The ticket envelope.
(3) When a carrier is a signatory of a Department-approved intercarrier agreement implementing an international treaty, and such agreement contains specific text a carrier may use as a notice to international passengers regarding carrier liability, the carrier may substitute the exact text contained in the intercarrier agreement in lieu of the required text of the notice quoted in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
(b) By December 31, 2019, each air carrier and foreign air carrier which, to any extent, avails itself of the limitation on liability to passengers provided by an international treaty, shall also cause to be displayed continuously in a conspicuous public place at each desk, station, and position in the United States which is in the charge of a person employed exclusively by it or by it jointly with another person, or by any agent employed by such air carrier or foreign air carrier to sell tickets to passengers whose transportation may be governed by an international treaty and whose place of departure or destination may be in the United States, a sign which shall have printed thereon the statement prescribed in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
(c) It shall be the responsibility of each carrier to ensure that travel agents authorized to sell air transportation for such carrier comply with the notice provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.
(d) Any air carrier or foreign air carrier subject to the provisions of this section which wishes to use a notice of limited liability of its own wording, but containing the substance of the language prescribed in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, may substitute a notice of its own wording upon approval by the Department.
(e) The requirements as to time and method of delivery of the notice (including the size of type) specified in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section and the requirement with respect to travel agents specified in paragraph (c) of this section may be waived by the Department upon application and showing by the carrier that special and unusual circumstances render the enforcement of the regulations impractical and unduly burdensome and that adequate alternative means of giving notice are employed.
(f) Applications for relief under paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section shall be filed with the Department's Office of International Aviation not later than 15 days before the date on which such relief is requested to become effective.
(g) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, no air taxi operator subject to part 298 of this subchapter shall be required to give the notices prescribed in this section, either in its capacity as an air carrier or in its capacity as an agent for an air carrier or foreign air carrier.

§ 221.110
Department's authority to reject.
The Department may reject any tariff which is not consistent with section 41504 of 49 U.S.C. Subtitle VII, with the regulations in this part, or with Department orders.
§ 221.111
Notification of rejection.
When a tariff is rejected, the issuing carrier or agent thereof will be notified electronically or in writing that the tariff is rejected and of the reason for such rejection.
§ 221.112
Rejected tariff is void and must not be used.

Grounds for approving or denying Special Tariff Permission applications.
(a)
General authority.
The Department may permit changes in fares, charges or other tariff provisions on less than the statutory notice required by section 41505 of 49 U.S.C. Subtitle VII.
(b)
Grounds for approval.
The following facts and circumstances constitute some of the grounds for approving applications for Special Tariff Permission in the absence of other facts and circumstances warranting denial:
(1)
Clerical or typographical errors.
Clerical or typographical errors in tariffs constitute grounds for approving applications for Special Tariff Permission to file on less than statutory notice the tariff changes necessary to correct such errors. Each application for Special Tariff Permission based on such grounds shall plainly specify the errors and contain a complete statement of all the attending facts and circumstances, and such application shall be presented to the Department with reasonable promptness after issuance of the defective tariff.
(2)
Rejection caused by clerical or typographical errors or unintelligibility.
Rejection of a tariff caused by clerical or typographical errors constitute grounds for approving applications for Special Tariff Permission to file on less than statutory notice, effective not earlier than the original effective dates in the rejected tariff, all changes contained in the rejected tariff but with the errors corrected. Each application for the grant of Special Tariff Permission based on such grounds shall plainly specify the errors and contain a complete statement of all the attending facts and circumstances, and such application shall be filed with the Department within five days after receipt of the Department's notice of rejection.
(3)
Newly authorized transportation.
The fact that the Department has newly authorized a carrier to perform foreign air transportation constitutes grounds for approving applications for Special Tariff Permission to file on less than statutory notice the fares, rates, and other tariff provisions covering such newly authorized transportation.
(4) The fact that a passenger fare is within a statutory or Department-established zone of fare flexibility constitutes grounds for approving an application for Special Tariff Permission to file a tariff stating that fare and any rules affecting them exclusively, on less than statutory notice. The Department's policy on approving such applications is set forth in § 399.35 of this chapter.
(5)
Lowered fares and charges.
The prospective lowering of fares or charges to the traveling public constitutes grounds for approving an application for Special Tariff Permission to file on less than statutory notice a tariff stating the lowered fares or charges and any rules affecting them exclusively. However, the Department will not approve the application if the proposed tariff raises significant questions of lawfulness, as set forth in § 399.35 of this chapter.
(c)
Filing notice required by formal order.
When a formal order of the Department requires the filing of tariff matter on a stated number of days' notice, an application for Special Tariff Permission to file on less notice will not be approved. In any such instance a petition for modification of the order should be filed in the formal docket.
§ 221.121
How to prepare and file applications for Special Tariff Permission.
(a)
Form.
Each application for Special Tariff Permission to file a tariff on less than statutory notice shall conform to the requirements of § 221.212 if filed electronically.
(b)
Number of paper copies and place of filing.
For paper format applications, the original and one copy of each such application for Special Tariff Permission, including all exhibits thereto and amendments thereof, shall be sent to the Office of International Aviation, Department of Transportation, Washington, DC 20590.
(c)
Who may make application.
Applications for Special Tariff Permission to file fares, or other tariff provisions on less than statutory notice shall be made only by the issuing carrier or agent authorized to issue and file the proposed tariff. Such application by the issuing carrier or agent will constitute application on behalf of all carriers participating in the proposed fares, or other tariff provisions.
(d)
When notice is required.
Notice in the manner set forth in paragraph (e) of this section is required when a carrier files an application for Special Tariff Permission:
(1) To offer passenger fares that would be outside a Department-established zone of price flexibility or, in markets for which the Department has not established such a zone, outside the statutory zone of price flexibility; or
(2) To file any price increase or rule change that the carrier believes is likely to be controversial.
(e)
Form of notice.
When notice of filing of a Special Tariff Permission application affecting passenger fares is required by paragraph (d) of this section, the carrier shall, when it files the application, give immediate telegraphic notice or other notice approved by the Office of International Aviation, to all certificated and foreign route carriers authorized to provide nonstop or one-stop service in the markets involved, and to civic parties that would
be substantially affected. The application shall include a list of the parties notified.
§ 221.122
Special Tariff Permission to be used in its entirety as granted.
Each Special Tariff Permission to file fares, or other tariff provisions on less than statutory notice shall be used in its entirety as granted. If it is not desired to use the permission as granted, and lesser or more extensive or different permission is desired, a new application for Special Tariff Permission conforming with § 221.121 in all respects and referring to the previous permission shall be filed.
§ 221.123
Re-use of Special Tariff Permission when tariff is rejected.
If a tariff containing matter issued under Special Tariff Permission is rejected, the same Special Tariff Permission may be used in a tariff issued in lieu of such rejected tariff provided that such re-use is not precluded by the terms of the Special Tariff Permission, and is made within the time limit thereof or within seven days after the date of the Department's notice of rejection, whichever is later, but in no event later than fifteen days after the expiration of the time limit specified in the Special Tariff Permission.

# Subpart N—Waiver of Tariff Regulations

Applications for waiver of tariff regulations.
Applications for waiver or modification of any of the requirements of this part 221 or for modification of chapter 415 of 49 U.S.C. Subtitle VII with respect to the filing and posting of tariffs shall be made by the issuing carrier or issuing agent.
§ 221.131
Form of application for waivers.
Applications for waivers shall be in the form of a letter addressed to the Office of International Aviation, Department of Transportation Washington, DC 20590, and shall:

When a concurrence is revoked, a corresponding amendment of the tariff or tariffs affected shall be made by the issuing carrier of such tariffs, on not less than statutory notice, to become effective not later than the effective date stated in the Notice of Revocation of Concurrence. In the event of failure to so amend the tariff or tariffs, the provisions therein shall remain applicable until lawfully canceled.
§ 221.142
Method of withdrawing portion of authority conferred by concurrence.
If a carrier desires to issue a concurrence conferring less authority than a previous concurrence given to the same carrier, the new concurrence shall not direct the cancellation of such previous concurrence.

§ 221.150
Method of giving power of attorney.
(a)
Prescribed form of power of attorney.
A power of attorney prepared in accordance with a form acceptable to the Office of International Aviation shall be used by a carrier to give authority to an agent and (in the case of the agent being an individual) such agent's alternate to issue and file with the Department tariffs which contain local or joint fares or charges, including provisions governing such fares or charges, applicable via and for account of such carrier. Agents may be only natural persons or corporations (other than incorporated associations of air carriers). The authority conferred in a power of attorney may not be delegated to any other person.
(b)
Designation of tariff issuing person by corporate agent.
When a corporation has been appointed as agent it shall forward to the Department a certified excerpt of the minutes of the meeting of its Board of Directors designating by name and title the person responsible for issuing tariffs and filing them with the Department. Only one such person may be designated by a corporate agent, and the title of such designee shall not contain the word “Agent”. When such a designee is replaced the Department shall be immediately notified in like manner of his successor. An officer or employee of an incorporated tariff-publishing agent may not be authorized to act as tariff agent in his/her individual capacity. Every tariff issued by a corporate agent shall be issued in its name as agent.
(c)
Number of copies.

§ 221.161
Notice of adoption to be filed in former carrier's tariffs.
At the same time that the adoption notice is issued, posted, and filed pursuant to § 221.160, the adopting carrier shall issue, post and file with the Department a notice in each effective tariff issued by the former carrier providing specific notice of the adoption in a manner authorized by the Office of International Aviation and which shall contain no matter other than that authorized.

The adopting carrier shall consecutively number its powers of attorney and concurrences in its own series of power of attorney numbers and concurrence numbers (commencing with No. 1 in each series if it had not previously filed any such instruments with the Department), except that a receiver or other fiduciary shall consecutively number its powers of attorney or concurrences in the series of the former carrier. The cancellation reference shall show that the canceled power of attorney or concurrence was issued by the former carrier.
(b) If such new powers of attorney or concurrences confer less authority than the powers of attorney or concurrences which they are to supersede, the new issues shall not direct the cancellation of the former issues; in such instances, the provisions of §§ 221.142 and 221.152 shall be observed.

i.e.,
that they shall be substantially equivalent for all similarly-situated persons.
§ 221.550
Copies of tariffs made from filer's printer(s) located in Department's public reference room.
Copies of information contained in a filer's on-line tariff database may be obtained by any user at Departmental
Headquarters from the printer or printers placed in Tariff Public Reference Room by the filer.

flights, or portion thereof, that the carrier holds out to the public through a CRS, the last segment of which is a reportable flight.
(b) The on-time performance code shall be calculated as follows:
(1) Based on reportable flight data provided to the Department, calculate the percentage of on-time arrivals of each nonstop flight. Calculations shall not include discontinued or extra-section flights for which data are not reported to the Department.
(2) Based upon the on-time performance percentage calculated in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, assign a single digit code to each flight that reflects the percentile of on-time performance achieved by the flight, as set forth in the following table:
On Time Performance
Code:
Percentage

(3) For a one-stop or multi-stop flight, or portion thereof, listed in a CRS, the performance code for the nonstop flight segment arriving at the destination listed in the CRS shall be used.
(4) In the case of a new flight, carriers shall assign a performance code consisting of the letter “N.” A flight that is not a new flight shall be assigned the performance code calculated for the flight that it replaces, even if the two flights do not have the same flight number. In the case of a flight scheduled to operate three times or less during a month, carriers shall assign a performance code consisting of the letter “U.”
(c) Carriers shall calculate on-time performance percentages and assign on-time performance codes on a monthly basis. This process shall be completed no later than the 15th day of each month, when the reports required by this part are due to the Department, and the codes shall reflect the previous month's operations.

Section 04
Air Carrier Groupings
(a) All large certificated air carriers are placed into three basic air carrier groupings based upon their level of operations and the nature of these operations. In order to determine the level of operations, total operating revenues for a twelve-month period are used. The following operating revenue ranges are used to establish air carrier groupings:
Carrier Group
Total Annual Operating Revenues
I
0-$100,000,000
II
$100,000,001-$1,000,000,000
III
$1,000,000,001 +
For reporting purposes, Group I air carriers are further divided into two subgroups: (1) Air carriers with total annual operating revenues from $20,000,000 to $100,000,000 and (2) Air carriers with total annual operating revenues below $20,000,000.
(b) Both the criteria for establishing air carrier groupings and the assignment of each air carrier to a specific group of carriers will be reviewed periodically by the Director, Office of Airline Information, to assure the maintenance of appropriate standards for the grouping of carriers. When an air carrier's level of operations passes the upper or lower limit of its currently assigned carrier grouping, the carrier is not automatically transferred to a different group and a new level of reporting. The Office of Airline Information will issue an updated listing of the carrier groups on an annual basis. A carrier may petition for reconsideration of its assigned carrier grouping or request a waiver from the accounting and reporting requirements that are applicable to a particular group under the provisions of section 1-2 of this Uniform System of Accounts and Reports.

# General Accounting Provisions
Section 1
Introduction to System of Accounts and Reports
Sec. 1-1
Applicability of system of accounts and reports.
Each large certificated air carrier shall keep its books of account, records and memoranda and make reports to the BTS in accordance with this system of accounts and reports. The BTS reserves the right, however, under the provisions of sections 49 U.S.C. 41701 and 41708, to expand or otherwise modify the classes of carriers subject to this system of accounts and reports.
[ER-1400, 50 FR 11, Jan. 2, 1985, as amended at 60 FR 66723, Dec. 26, 1995]
Sec. 1-2
Waivers from this system of accounts and reports.
A waiver from any provision of this system of accounts or reports may be made by the BTS upon its own initiative or upon the submission of written request therefor from any air carrier, or group of air carriers, provided that such a waiver is in the public interest and each request for waiver expressly demonstrates that: existing peculiarities or unusual circumstances warrant a departure from a prescribed procedure or technique; a specifically defined alternative procedure or technique will result in a substantially equivalent or more accurate portrayal of operating results or financial condition, consistent with the principles embodied in the provisions of this system of accounts and reports; and the application of such alternative procedure will maintain or improve uniformity in substantive results as between air carriers.
[ER-755, 37 FR 19726, Sept. 21, 1972, as amended at 60 FR 66723, Dec. 26, 1995]
Sec. 1-3
General description of system of accounts and reports.
(a) This system of accounts and reports is designed to permit limited contraction or expansion to reflect the varying needs and capacities of different air carriers without impairing basic accounting comparability as between air carriers. In its administration three air carrier groups, designated Group I, Group II, and Group III, respectively (see section 04), are established by the BTS. This grouping will be reviewed from time to time upon petition of individual air carriers or by initiative of the BTS with the view of a possible regrouping of the air carriers.
(b) Under the system of accounts prescribed, balance sheet elements are accounted for by all air carrier groups within a fixed uniform pattern of specific accounts. All profit and loss elements are accounted for within specific objective accounts established for each air carrier group resulting from dual classifications, designated for each air carrier group, which are descriptive of both basic areas of financial activity, or functional operation, and objective served. The profit and loss elements of the three air carrier groups can be reduced to broad objectives and general or functional classifications which are comparable for all air carrier groups. Both balance sheet and profit and loss accounts and account groupings are designed, in general, to embrace all activities, both air transport and other than air transport, in which the air carrier engages and provide for the separation of elements identifiable exclusively with other than air transport activities. Profit and loss elements which are recorded during the current accounting year are subclassified as between (1) those which relate to the current accounting year and adjustments of a recurrent nature applicable to prior accounting years, and (2) extraordinary items of material magnitude.
(c) In order to afford air carriers as much flexibility and freedom as possible in establishing ledger and subsidiary accounts to meet their individual needs, a minimum number of account subdivisions have been prescribed in this Uniform System of Accounts. It is intended, however, that each air carrier, in maintaining its accounting records, will provide subaccount and subsidiary account segregations of accounting elements which differ in nature of accounting characteristics, in a manner which will render individual elements readily discernible and traceable throughout the accounting system, and will provide for relating profit and loss elements to applicable balance sheet counterparts.
[ER-755, 37 FR 19726, Sept. 21, 1972, as amended at 60 FR 66723, Dec. 26, 1995]
Sec. 1-4
System of accounts coding.
(a) A four digit control number is assigned for each balance sheet and profit and loss account. Each balance sheet account is numbered sequentially, within blocks, designating basic balance sheet classifications. The first two digits of the four digit code assigned to each profit and loss account denote a detailed area of financial activity or functional operation. The first two digits, thus assigned to each profit and loss account, are numbered sequentially within blocks, designating more general classifications of financial activity and functional operation. The second two digits assigned to profit and loss accounts denote objective classifications.
(b) A fifth digit, appended as a decimal, has been assigned for internal control by the BTS of prescribed subdivisions of the primary objective balance sheet and profit and loss classifications. A different fifth digit code number from that assigned by the BTS may be adopted for internal recordkeeping by the air carrier provided the prescribed subclassification of objective accounts is not impaired and the code number assigned by the BTS is employed in reporting to the BTS on Form 41 Reports.
[ER-755, 37 FR 19726, Sept. 21, 1972, as amended at 60 FR 66723, Dec. 26, 1995]
Sec. 1-5
Records.
(a) The general books of account and all books, records, and memoranda which support in any way the entries therein shall be kept in such manner as to provide at any time full information relating to any account. The entries in each account shall be supported by
such detailed information as will render certain the identification of all facts essential to a verification of the nature and character of each entry and its proper classification under the prescribed Uniform System of Accounts. Registers, or other appropriate records, shall be maintained of the history and nature of each note receivable and each note payable.
(b) The books and records referred to herein include not only accounting records in a limited technical sense, but all other records such as organization tables and charts, internal accounting manuals and revisions thereto, minute books, stock books, reports, cost distributions and other accounting work sheets, correspondence, memoranda, etc., which may constitute necessary links in developing the history of, or facts regarding, any accounting or financial transaction.
(c) All books, records and memoranda shall be preserved and filed in such manner as to readily permit the audit and examination thereof by representatives of the DOT. All books, records, and memoranda shall be housed or stored in such manner as to afford protection from loss, theft, or damage by fire, flood or otherwise and no such books and records shall be destroyed or otherwise disposed of, except in conformance with 14 CFR part 249 for the preservation of records.
[ER-755, 37 FR 19726, Sept. 21, 1972, as amended at 60 FR 66723, Dec. 26, 1995]
Sec. 1-6
Accounting entities.
(a) Separate accounting records shall be maintained for each air transport entity for which separate reports to the BTS are required to be made by sections 21(g) and for each separate corporate or organizational division of the air carrier. For purposes of this Uniform System of Accounts and Reports, each nontransport entity conducting an activity which is not related to the air carrier's transport activities and each transport-related activity or group of activities qualifying as a nontransport venture pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, whether or not formally organized within a distinct organizational unit, shall be treated as a separately operated organizational division; except that provisions of this paragraph and paragraph (b) shall not apply to leasing activities.
(b) As a general rule, any activity or group of activities comprising a transport-related service provided for in transport-related revenue and expense accounts 09 through 18 shall be considered a separate nontransport venture under circumstances in which either: (1) A separate corporate or legal entity has been established to perform such services, (2) the aggregate annual revenue rate, as determined in section 2-1(d), during either of the prior two years exceeds the greater of $1 million per annum or one percent of the air carrier's total annual transport revenues, or (3) the aggregate annual expense rate, as determined in section 2-1(d), during either of the prior two years exceeds the greater of $1 million or one percent of the carrier's total annual operating expenses:
Provided,
That revenues and expenses from in-flight sales, and interchange sales shall be considered related to air transportation and accounted for accordingly, regardless of the revenue or expense standard set forth above.
(c) The records for each required accounting entity shall be maintained with sufficient particularity to permit a determination that the requirements of section 2-1 have been complied with.
[ER-755, 37 FR 19726, Sept. 21, 1972, as amended by ER-841, 39 FR 11994, Apr. 2, 1974; ER-1022, 42 FR 46495, Sept. 15, 1977; ER-1027, 42 FR 60127, Nov. 25, 1977; 60 FR 66723, Dec. 26, 1995]
Sec. 1-7
Interpretation of accounts.
To the end that uniform accounting may be maintained, questions involving matters of accounting significance which are not clearly provided for should be submitted to the Director, Office of Airline Information, K-25, Bureau of Transportation Statistics, for explanation, interpretation, or resolution.

Section 2
General Accounting Policies
Sec. 2-1
Generally accepted accounting principles.
(a) The accounting provisions contained in this part are based on generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Persons subject to this part are authorized to implement, as prescribed by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, newly issued GAAP pronouncements until and unless the Director, Office of Airline Information (OAI), issues an Accounting Directive making an initial determination that implementation of a new pronouncement would adversely affect the Department's programs.
(b) The Director, OAI, shall review each newly issued GAAP pronouncement to determine its affect on the Department's regulatory programs. If adopting a specific change in GAAP would adversely affect the Department's programs, the Director will issue the results of the review in the form of an Accounting Directive. The directive will state the reasons why the particular change should not be incorporated in the uniform system of accounts and contain accounting guidance for maintaining the integrity of the Department's air carrier accounting provisions.
(c) Objections and comments relating to the Department's decision not to implement a change in generally accepted principles may be addressed to Director, Office of Airline Information, K-25, U.S. Department of Transportation, 1200 New Jersey Avenue, SE., Washington, DC 20590. If significant objections are raised urging adoption of a particular GAAP pronouncement, the Department will institute a rulemaking.

Sec. 2-2
Basis of allocation between entities.
(a) The provisions of this section shall apply to each person controlling an air carrier, each person controlled by the air carrier, as well as each transport entity and organizational division of the air carrier for which separate records must be maintained pursuant to section 1-6.
(b) Each transaction shall be recorded and placed initially under accounting controls of the particular air transport entity or organizational division of the air carrier or member of an affiliated group to which directly traceable. If applicable to two or more accounting entities, a proration shall be made from the entity of original recording to other participating entities on such basis that the statements of financial condition and operating results of each entity are comparable to those of distinct legal entities. The allocations involved shall include all debits and credits associated with each entity.
(c) For purposes of this section, investments by the air carrier in resources or facilities used in common by the regulated air carrier and those transport-related revenue services defined as separate nontransport ventures under section 1-6(b) shall not be allocated between such entities but shall be reflected in total in the appropriate accounts of the entity which predominately uses those investments. Where the entity of predominate use is a nontransport venture, the air carrier shall reflect the investment in account 1510.3, Advances to Associated Companies.
(d) For purposes of this Uniform System of Accounts and Reports, all revenues shall be assigned to or apportioned between accounting entities on bases which will fully recognize the services provided by each entity, and expenses, or costs, shall be apportioned between accounting entities on such bases as will result: (1) With respect to
transport-related services, in the assignment thereto of proportionate direct overheads, as well as direct labor and materials, of the applicable expense functions prescribed by this system of accounts and reports, and (2) with respect to separate ventures, in the assignment thereto of proportional general and administrative overheads as well as the direct overheads, labor, and materials.

Sec. 2-3
Distribution of revenues and expenses within entities.
(a) Revenues and expenses attributable to a single natural objective account or functional classification shall be assigned accordingly.
(b) Revenue and expense items which are common to two or more natural objective accounts shall be recorded in the objective accounts to which they predominantly relate.
(c) Expense items contributing to more than one function shall be charged to the general overhead functions to which applicable except that where only incidental contribution is made to more than a single function an item may be included in the function to which primarily related, provided such function is not distorted by including an aggregation of amounts applicable to other functions. When assignment of expense items on the basis of the primary activity to which related does not in the aggregate result in a fair presentation of the expenses applicable to each function, apportionment shall be made between functions based upon a study of the contribution to each function during a representative period.

Sec. 2-4
Accounting period.
(a) The accounting year of each air carrier subject to this Uniform System of Accounts shall be the calendar year unless otherwise approved by the BTS.
(b) Each air carrier shall keep its financial accounts and records on a full accrual basis for each quarter so that all transactions, as nearly as may reasonably be ascertained, shall be fully reflected in the air carrier's books for the quarter in which revenues have been earned and the costs attaching to the revenues so earned in each quarter have been incurred independently of the incidence of sales or purchases and settlement with debtors or creditors.
(c) Expenditures incurred during the current accounting year which demonstrably benefit operations to be performed during subsequent accounting years to a significant extent shall be deferred and amortized to the period in which the related operations are performed when of sufficient magnitude to distort the accounting results of the year in which incurred.
(d) Expenditures charged directly or amortized to operations within one accounting year shall not be reversed in a subsequent accounting year and reamortized or charged directly against operations of subsequent years except that retroactive adjustments are permitted where necessary to conform with adjustments required by the DOT for ratemaking purposes.

Sec. 2-5
Revenue and accounting practices.
(a) Revenue accounting practices shall conform to the provisions of account 2160, Air Traffic Liability.
(b) Each route air carrier shall physically verify the reliability of its passenger revenue accounting practice at least once each accounting year.
(c) For those carriers who use the yield or average-fare method to determine earned revenue, the analysis supporting the verification shall include:
(1) The cutoff date for the liability to be verified; such cutoff date shall be at the end of a calendar month.
(2) The number of months after the cutoff date during which documents were examined to verify the liability; the number of months after the cutoff date during which documents are examined shall not exceed the maximums set forth below:

(6) The amount and basis for all estimates employed in the verification.
(7) The amount of resulting adjustments and the quarter in which such adjustments were, or are to be, made in the accounts.
(d) For those carriers who use the sales-lift match method to determine earned revenue, the analysis supporting the physical inventory verification shall include:
(1) The cutoff date for the liability to be verified; such cutoff date shall be at the end of a calendar month.
(2) A trial balance as of the cutoff date of all subaccounts supporting the Air Traffic Liability control account; the subsidiary trial balance must agree with the Air Traffic Liability control account or a reconciliation statement furnished.
(3) A statement to the effect that a sales listing of the value of all unmatched auditor coupons has been compiled and compared to the general ledger control figure; the statement required by this subparagraph shall indicate whether or not the value of the unmatched coupons is in agreement with the general ledger. If the sales listing is not in agreement with the Air Traffic Liability control account, the amount of such difference shall be shown on such statement.

(b) Each air carrier shall subdivide this account in such manner that the balance can be readily segregated as between balances in United States currency and the balances in each foreign currency.

# 1100 Short-term Investments.
(a) Record here the cost of short-term investments such as special deposits and United States Government securities, any other temporary cash investments, and the allowance for unrealized gain or loss on current marketable equity securities.
(b) Special deposits for more than one year, not offset by current liabilities, shall not be included in this account but in account 1550 Special Funds.
(c) This account should be charged or credited for discount or premium on United States Government securities or other securities which should be amortized to profit and loss account 80 Interest Income.

# 1200 Notes Receivable.
(a) Record here current notes receivable including those from associated companies, company personnel, and all other sources.
(b) Balances of notes payable to associated companies shall not be offset against amounts carried in this account. Balances with associated companies which are not normally settled currently shall not be included in this account but in balance sheet account 1510.3 Advances to Associated Companies.

(a) Record here accruals for estimated losses from uncollectible accounts.
(b) All accounts against which allowances have been established shall be examined quarterly for the purpose of redetermining the basis of accruals to be applied to subsequent accounting periods and the reasonableness of allowances already provided.

# 1300 Spare parts and supplies.
(a) Record here the cost of:
(1) Flight equipment replacement parts of a type which ordinarily would be recurrently expended and replaced rather than repaired and reused;
(2) Unissued fuel inventories for use in the overall or system operations of the carrier. Adjustments of inventories for aircraft fuel due to retroactive price increases and decreases shall not be entered in this account but in profit and loss account 45, Aircraft Fuels and Oils; and
(3) Unissued and unapplied materials and supplies held in stock such as unissued shop materials, expendable tools, stationery and office supplies, passenger service supplies, and restaurant and food service supplies.
(b) Costs paid by the air carrier such as transportation charges and customs duties; excise, sales, use and other taxes; special insurance; and other charges applicable to the cost of spare parts and supplies shall be charged to this account when they can be definitely allocated to specific items or units of property. If such costs cannot be so allocated, or if of minor significance in relation to the cost of such property, such amounts may be charged to balance sheet account 1890 Other Assets and Deferred Charges and cleared either by a suitable “loading charge” as the parts are used or by current charges to appropriate expense or property accounts; so long as the method of application does not cause material distortion in operating expenses from one accounting period to another.
(c) Reusable spare parts and supplies recovered in connection with construction, maintenance, or retirement of property and equipment shall be included in this account at fair and reasonable values but in no case shall such values exceed original cost. Recoveries of normally reparable and reusable parts of a type for which losses in value may be covered on a practical basis through valuation allowance provisions shall be included in this account on an original cost basis. Scrap and nonusable parts, expensed from this account and recovered, shall be included at net amounts realizable therefrom with contra credit to the expense accounts initially charged.
(d) The cost of rotable parts and assemblies of material value included in this account which ordinarily are repaired and reused and possess a service life approximating that of the primary property types to which related shall not be recorded in this account but in balance sheet account 1608 Flight Equipment Rotable Parts and Assemblies. For purposes of identifying rotable parts and assemblies of insignificant unit value which may be included in this account, a reasonable maximum unit value limitation may be established.
(e) Any losses sustained or gains realized upon the abandonment or other disposition of flight equipment expendable parts shall be taken up as capital gains or losses in the periods in which sustained or realized. (See balance sheet account 1311.)
(f) Items in this account shall be charged to appropriate expense accounts as issued for use. Profit and loss on sales of inventory items as a routine service to others shall be included in profit and loss accounts 14 General Service Sales—Associated Companies, or 16 General Service Sales—Outside, and the parts sold shall be removed from this accounts at full cost.
(g) Materials and supplies held in small supply and purchased currently may be charged to appropriate expense accounts when purchased.
(h) An allowance for inventory adjustment applicable to materials and supplies is prohibited. Items in this account shall be charged to appropriate expense accounts as issued for use.
(i) Subaccounts shall be established within this account for the separate recording of each class or type of spare parts and supplies.
[ER-980, 42 FR 29, Jan. 3, 1977, as amended by ER-1401, 50 FR 241, Jan. 3, 1985]

# 1311 Allowance for Obsolescence—Spare Parts and Supplies.
(a) Accruals shall be made to this account when allowances are established for losses in the value of expendable parts. The accruals to this account shall be made by charges to profit and loss account 73 Provisions for Obsolescence and Deterioration—Expendable Parts. Records shall be maintained with sufficient detail to permit association of the allowances with each class or type of expendable parts.
(b) The accruals to this account shall be based upon a predetermination by the air carrier of that portion of the total inventory of each class and type of expendable parts against which an allowance for loss is to be accrued. Expendable parts issued for use in operations shall be charged to operating expenses as issued and shall not be charged to this account. If at the end of any calendar year the amount of the allowance exceeds the product of the applicable inventory for the year determined consistently on a year-end or average basis, and the sum of the standard percentage accrual rates for all prior years including the current, the allowance shall be adjusted downward by the amount of the excess. Such adjustments shall be charged to this account and credited to profit and loss account 73 Provisions for Obsolescence and Deterioration—Expendable Parts.
(c) Where changing conditions necessitate a revision or adjustment in rates of accrual, such revision or adjustment shall be made applicable to current and subsequent accounting periods and shall not be applied retroactively to prior accounting periods. Following retirement of airframe or aircraft engine types to which related, any balance remaining in this account shall be offset against related balances carried in balance sheet account 1300 Spare Parts and Supplies and the net cleared to profit and loss accounts 88.5 Capital Gains and Losses—Operating Property or 88.6 Capital Gains and Losses—Other.

Section 8
General
(a) The profit and loss accounts are designed to reflect, through natural groupings, the elements entering into the derivation of income or loss accruing to the proprietary interests during each accounting period.
(b) The prescribed system of accounts provides for the co-ordinate grouping of all revenues and expenses in terms of both major natural objectives and functional activities and for subdivision of both to provide varying degrees of detail for air carriers of differing accounting capacities and/or requirements.
(c) The detailed objective accounts established for each air carrier group, by the dual subdivision of profit and loss elements in terms of both natural objectives and functional activities, are set forth in section 7, Chart of Profit and Loss Accounts.
(d) The prescribed system of accounts provides generally that profit and loss elements shall be grouped in accordance with their inherent characteristics within the following primary classifications:
(1)
Operating revenues.
(i) This primary classification shall include revenues of a character usually and ordinarily derived from the performance of air transportation and air transportation-related services, which relate to services performed during the current accounting year, and adjustments of a recurrent nature applicable to services performed in prior accounting years.
(ii) Operating revenues shall be subclassified in terms of functional activities as provided in section 9.
(2)
Operating expenses.
(i) This primary classification shall include expenses of a character usually and ordinarily incurred in the performance of air transportation and air transportation-related services, which relate to services performed during the current accounting year, and adjustments of a
recurring nature attributable to services performed in prior accounting years.
(ii) Operating expenses shall be subclassified in terms of functional activities as provided in sections 10 and 11.
(3)
Nonoperating income and expense—net.
This primary classification (8100) shall include income and loss incident to commercial ventures not inherently related to the performance of the common carrier air transport services of the accounting entity; other revenues and expenses attributable to financing or other activities which are extraneous to and not an integral part of air transportation or its incidental services; and special recurrent items of a nonperiod nature.
(4)
Income taxes for current period.
This primary classification (9100) shall include provisions for Federal, state, local, and foreign taxes which are based upon the net income of the air carrier for the current period together with refunds for excess profits credits or carryback of losses and increases or reductions of income taxes of prior years of a magnitude which will not distort net income of the current accounting year. Income taxes applicable to special income credits or debits recorded in profit and loss classification 9700 Extraordinary Items, and other material income tax items not allocable to income of the current accounting year, shall not be included in this classification but in profit and loss classification 9700 Extraordinary Items.
(5)
Discontinued operations.
This primary classification (9600) shall include earnings and losses of discontinued nontransport operations and gains or losses from the disposal of nontransport operations the result of which are customarily accounted for through profit and loss objective accounts 86, 87 and 88.2.
(6)
Extraordinary items.
This primary classification (9700) shall include material items characterized by their unusual nature and infrequent occurrence.
(7)
Cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles.
This primary classification (9800) shall include the cumulative effect of material changes in accounting principles.

Section 9
Functional Classification—Operating Revenues

# 3900 Transport Revenues.
This classification is prescribed for all air carrier groups and shall include all revenues from the air transportation of traffic of all classes. It shall consist of the following subclassifications:

# 3100
Scheduled Services.
This subclassification shall include revenues from the transportation by air of individual passengers or cargo shipments (as opposed to charter flights) pursuant to published schedules, including extra sections and other flights performed as an integral part of published flight schedules.

# 3200
Nonscheduled Services.
This subclassification shall include revenues from the transportation by air of traffic applicable to the performance of aircraft charters, and other air transportation services not part of services performed pursuant to published flight schedules (but shall not include data applicable to flights performed as extra sections to published flight schedules, which shall be reported in the subclassification 3100 Scheduled Services).
[ER-755, 37 FR 19726, Sept. 21, 1972, as amended by ER-1401, 50 FR 243, Jan. 3, 1985]

# 4800 Transport-Related Revenues.
(a) This classification is prescribed for all air carrier groups and shall include all revenues from the United States Government as direct grants or aids for providing air transportation facilities and all revenues from services which grow from and are incidental to the air transportation services performed by the air carrier.
(b) Revenues related to services of a magnitude or scope beyond an incidental adjunct to air transportation services shall not be included in this classification (see section 1-6(b)). Revenues applicable to such services shall be included in profit and loss classification 8100, Nonoperating Income and Expense-Net, and the accounting modified to conform with that of a nontransport
division whether or not the service is organized as a nontransport division.
[ER-841, 39 FR 11997, Apr. 2, 1974]
Section 10
Functional Classification—Operating Expenses of Group I Air Carriers

# 5100 Flying Operations.
(a) This function shall include expenses incurred directly in the in-flight operation of aircraft and expenses attaching to the holding of aircraft and aircraft operational personnel in readiness for assignment to an in-flight status.
(b) This function shall not include expenses incurred in repairing, servicing or storing aircraft, expenses incurred on the ground in protecting and controlling the inflight movement of aircraft, or the compensation of ground personnel and other expenses incurred in scheduling or preparing aircraft or aircraft operational personnel for flight assignment. Such expenses shall be included in function 5400 Maintenance or function 6900 General Services and Administration.

Sec. 19-7
Passenger origin-destination survey.
(a) All U.S. large certificated air carriers conducting scheduled passenger operations (except helicopter carriers) shall participate in a Passenger Origin-Destination (O
D) Survey covering domestic and international operations, as described in the instructions manual entitled,
Instructions to Air Carriers for Collecting and Reporting Passenger Origin-Destination Survey Statistics
(Appendix A to this section), and in
Passenger Origin-Destination Directives
issued by the Department's Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS), Office of Airline Information (OAI). Copies of these
Instructions
and
Directives
are provided to each large carrier participating in the Survey. Copies are also available from the Office of Airline Information, RTS-42, U.S. Department of Transportation, 1200 New Jersey Avenue, SE., Washington, DC 20590. Copies of these
Instructions
and
Directives
are available on the BTS Web page at (
http://www.bts.gov/programs/airline_information/
).
(b) Reports required by this section shall be submitted to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics in a format specified in accounting and reporting directives issued by the Bureau of Transportation Statistics' Director of Airline Information.
(c) A statistically valid sample of light coupons shall be selected for reporting purposes. The sample shall consist of at least 1 percent of the total lifted ticket flight coupons for all large domestic markets listed in the Instructions and 10 percent for all others—including domestic and international markets. The sample shall be selected and reported in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (a) of their section, except that the participating O
D carriers with nonstandard ticketing procedures, or other special operating characteristics, may propose
alternative procedures. Such departures from standard O
D Survey practices shall not be authorized unless approved in writing by the Director, Office of Airline Information under the procedures in Sec. 1-2 of 14 CFR part 241. The data to be recorded and reported from selected lifted ticket flight coupons, as stipulated in the
Instructions
and
Directives
shall include the following data elements: Point of origin, carrier on each flight-coupon stage, fare-basis code for each flight-coupon stage, points of stopover or connection (interline and intraline), point of destination, number of passengers, and total dollar value of ticket (fare plus tax).
(d) Data covering the operations of foreign air carriers that are similar to the information collected in the Passenger Origin-Destination Survey are generally not available to the Department, the U.S. carriers, or U.S. interests. Therefore, because of the damaging competitive impact on U.S. carriers and the adverse effect upon the public interest that would result from unilateral disclosure of the U.S. survey data, the Department has determined its policy to be that the international data in the Passenger Origin-Destination Survey shall be disclosed only as follows:
(1) To an air carrier directly participating in and contributing input data to the Survey or to a legal or consulting firm designated by an air carrier to use on its behalf O
D data in connection with a specific assignment by such carrier.
(2) To parties to any proceeding before the Department to the extent that such data are relevant and material to the issues in the proceeding upon a determination to this effect by the Administrative Law Judge or by the Department's decision-maker. Any data to which access is granted pursuant to this section may be introduced into evidence subject to the normal rules of admissability of evidence.
(3) To agencies and other components of the U.S. Government.
(4) To other persons upon a showing that the release of the data will serve specifically identified needs of U.S. users which are consistent with U.S. interests.
(5) To foreign governments and foreign users as provided in formal reciprocal arrangements between the foreign and U.S. governments for the exchange of comparable O
D data.
(e) The Department reserves the right to make such other disclosures of the O
D data as is consistent with its regulatory functions and responsibilities.

# B. Narrative Description
A single O
D Survey is conducted continuously by the large U.S. certificated air carriers. Foreign air carriers do not directly participate in the Survey, although some of their data are captured in the Survey, since passengers who share a ticketed itinerary between a U.S. carrier and a foreign carrier may be sampled by the U.S. carrier. The authority for these instructions is found in 14 CFR part 241, sec. 19-7.
The Survey samples revenue passenger trips moving in whole or in part on domestic and/or international scheduled services of the carriers participating in the Survey. In general, these requirements do not apply to small certificated, all-cargo and all charter carriers.
The source documents for the Survey data are passenger tickets. These data are collected from the “lifted” flight coupons of tickets (a portion of a multi-part ticket booklet of three
1
or more coupons, including one for each stage of the passenger's trip itinerary which is lifted by the carrier as the passenger boards a particular flight segment).
1
Each ticket booklet is comprised of one or more
flight coupons
for passenger travel in a city-pair market, plus a
passenger coupon
(the traveler's receipt) and the
auditor coupon
(for the carrier's internal controls).
The Survey data are taken from the coupon that is lifted by a participating carrier, unless it is apparent from the lifted coupon that another participating carrier has already recorded and reported the data, in which instance the ticket coupon is non-reportable for the second honoring/participating carrier. The complete passenger itinerary, and related data on type of fare and dollar value of the ticket, is recorded as
one entry from the sampled, reportable flight coupon.
The recording of data from the sampled flight coupon normally consists of transcribing the information exactly as indicated on the ticket. The detail recorded for each trip shows the complete routing from the origin city (airport code) to the destination city (airport code) including, in sequence from the origin, each point of transfer and stopover (intraline and interline), the summarized fare-basis code shown for each flight coupon stage of the itinerary, and the total dollar value of the fare and tax for the entire ticket.
Prior to 1987, the Survey was generally based on a 10-percent sample of passenger tickets. Beginning July 1, 1987, the Survey is collected primarily on the basis of a stratified, scientific sample of at least 1 percent of tickets in domestic major markets and 10 percent of tickets in all other domestic and in all international city-pair markets. The Survey data are taken from the selected flight coupons of the tickets sampled: single-coupon or double-coupon round trips in domestic major markets where the ticket serial number ends in double zero (00) and all other ticket coupons ending in zero (0). This procedure yields a “two-tiered” stratified sample.
Group tickets are included on the basis of a 10-percent sample when the number of passengers on such a group ticket is 10 or less. Group tickets with more than 10 passengers on each ticket are included on the basis of a 100 percent census,
i.e.,
all such tickets are sampled, regardless of serial number, and the total data listed are conformed to a 10 percent sample for inclusion in the O
D Survey.
Following the selection of reportable flight coupons and the recording of data, each participating carrier shall edit and summarize
2
the data into a quarterly report to the Department.
2
These summarization procedures include showing two or more passengers with the same itinerary as one O
D record and compressing extremely lengthy itineraries (such as around-the-world tickets) into a standard trip stage length limit (which may be either seven or twenty-three stages, at the carrier's option), as explained in Section V.D.

# II. Effective Date of Instructions
These data collection and reporting instructions are effective on and after July 1, 1987 and apply to all flight coupons lifted on or after July 1, 1987.

# III. Carriers Participating in Survey
A.
Participating carriers.
As defined in section 19-7 of the Department's Economic Regulations (14 CFR part 241), the participants in the O
D Survey include all large certificated air carriers conducting scheduled passenger services (except helicopter carriers). These participating carriers collect and report data in accordance with these Instructions, and supplemental
Passenger Origin-Destination Directives
that may be issued periodically. The list of participating carriers will be issued by reporting directive under the authority in 14 CFR 385.27(b).
B.
Amendments to list of participating carriers.
As new carriers begin service, they will be required to file O
D Survey Data. These carriers will not be added to the participating carrier list automatically, but will be added when the next annual review is made.

# V. Selection of Sample and Recording of Data.
4
4
Upon approval of the Director, Office of Airline Information, carriers may continue current reporting procedures (up to twenty-three stages of a passenger flight) and may report a uniform 10 percent sample of tickets lifted (each zero ending lifted coupon) without reducing the sample size from 10 percent
to 1 percent for domestic major markets. Note that the domestic major markets will be reviewed each year at June 30, based on the prior 12 months O
D data, and the list amended as necessary. The list could remain static for more than a year, although it will be reviewed annually. Necessary amendments will be effective on January 1 of the following year.
A.
Sampling Basis.
Each participating carrier in this O
D Survey shall search all listed flight coupons, whether the coupons are
its own ticket stock or on the ticket stock of another U.S. or foreign carrier (either standard IATA and ARC ticket stock or nonstandard ticket stock), and is to
select for reporting purposes
the following flight coupons:
(1)
Major domestic markets.
All single-passenger flight coupons that are either a single flight coupon ticket or part of a round trip, two coupon ticket where the ticket serial number ends in the digits double-zero (00).

# Note.
The list of major domestic markets will be issued by reporting directive under the authority in 14 CFR 385.27(b).
(2)
International markets and all other domestic markets.
(a) All single-passenger flight coupons with ticket serial numbers ending with the digit zero (0);
(b) Those group-ticket flight coupons with 10 or fewer passengers with ticket serial numbers ending with the digit zero (0);
(c) Those group-ticket flight coupons with 11 or more passengers without regard to serial number; and
(d) Itineraries in major domestic markets that comprise more than two coupons are sampled on a uniform 10 percent basis, by selecting all ticket serial numbers ending with the digit zero (0).
B.
Selection of Reportable Flight Coupons.
The flight coupons identified above are to be examined to isolate the reportable flight coupons, i.e. coupons from which data are to be recorded. Flight coupon data are reported only by the first honoring and participating carrier (operating carrier). Such carriers shall report the required data for the entire ticketed itinerary.
If a participating carrier has preceded an examining carrier on any stage in the trip itinerary, including any stage in a conjunction itinerary and any stage in a reissued ticket (either before or after reissue) that coupon is not reportable.
For conjunction tickets, the ticket number for the first ticket booklet determines if the conjunction tickets should be reported in the Survey. Otherwise, conjunction tickets do not require special treatment and are governed by the rules for regular tickets.
No adjustment is made in the Survey for alterations or changes in the trip itinerary subsequent to the stage covered by the reportable coupon.
C.
Optional Use of Other Sampling Procedures.
(1) Alternative sampling procedures or alternative O
D data systems may be proposed by participating carriers with nonstandard ticketing procedures, or other special operating characteristics. Data reported under proposed alternative procedures must approximate the usefulness and statistical validity of the O
D Survey.
(2) Such departures from the prescribed O
D Survey practices shall not be authorized unless approved in writing by the Director, Office of Airline Information (address inside front cover). The proposed alternative O
D Survey procedures must be described in detail in the letter requesting the waiver.
D.
Recording of Data from Reportable Flight Coupons.
(1) The following items are to be reported from the reportable flight coupons:
(a) Point of origin,
(b) Operating carrier on each flight stage (if unknown, identify ticketed carrier),
(c) Ticketed carrier on each flight stage,
(d) Fare-basis on each flight coupon, C, D, F, G, X or Y,
(e) Points of stopover or connection (interline and intraline),
(f) Point of destination,
(g) Number of passengers, and
(h) Total dollar value of ticket (fare plus tax and other charges, such as Passenger Facility Charges).
(2) The individual items are to be recorded in the sequence of occurrence in the itinerary as follows:
(a) All entries for
points
(airport codes
5
) in an itinerary are to be recorded in three-letter airport code data to fit into the stage-length limitation (seven or twenty-three stages at the carrier's option), all airport codes are to be reported, including data on commuter, foreign, intra-state and other carriers' portions of itineraries. Normally codes are recorded as they appear on the ticket. However, if a code is obviously incorrect,
record the correct code.
For instance, if a ticket is coded DCA-NYC or Washington/National to New York when the flight stage actually operated from Washington, Dulles to Newark (EWR), record the correct airport code. When only name spellings of a city appear on the ticket for multi-airport cities (such as Washington, New York, San Francisco, or Los Angeles), record the specific
three letter airport code.
In cases where two airport codes are shown on the ticket for a point, such as when the passenger arrives at an airport such as San Francisco and departs from another local airport such as Oakland, record the code for the arrival airport, enter
a surface segment indicator (—) to the departure airport, and record the departure airport code. (When the surface portion is at the beginning or end of an itinerary, the surface indicator is to be omitted). For example:
5
Codes to be used are those appearing in the
Official Airline Guide
at the time the data are being recorded. If a code is not found in the OAG, contact the Director, Office of Airline Information (address inside front cover).

In the above example, the passenger trip stages or segments are compressed into the maximum of 7 stages so that several intermediate city-pairs (Los Angeles to Seattle to Anchorage, or LAX—SEA—Anc) and the related carriers have not been recorded, as prescribed below in this Section V.D.(3)(e). In addition, after the fourth city-pair (Los Angeles-Salt Lake City), the passenger trip itinerary moves from the initial four-part ticket booklet onto another “conjunction” ticket, and the summary fare code data are not recorded beyond the initial four-part ticket.
(b) All entries for operating and ticketed carriers for a coupon stage of an itinerary are to be recorded using two character IATA-assigned or DOT codes, as in the above example. Note that the fare code summary was properly inserted after the ticketed carrier's code, i.e., UA for United Air Lines and Y for unrestricted coach class service. When a two-character carrier code is shown on the ticket, record that code for the ticketed carrier. However, if a code is obviously incorrect, record the correct carrier code. If the reporting carrier does not know the operating carrier on a downline code-share segment, it would use the ticketed carrier's code for both the operating and ticketed carriers. The reporting carrier is not responsible for knowing the operating carrier of a downline code-share where it is not a party to the code-share segment. Except for the infrequent compression of data to fit into the stage-length limitation (7 or 23 stages at the carrier's option), all carrier codes are to be recorded, including data on air taxis, commuters, intra-state, and other carrier portions of itineraries. On tickets involving interchange service or other cooperative carrier arrangements, the juncture point(s) where the passenger moves from one carrier system to another is to be recorded as an intermediate point in the itinerary, even when not shown on the ticket and even though the flight may overfly the juncture point.
(c) Entries for fare-basis codes are to be taken from the “fare basis” and “fare description” portions of the ticket and simplified into the appropriate category, as shown below. No attempt shall be made to determine and record fare-basis codes for that portion of a conjunction ticket appearing in the ticket. Fare-basis codes are to be recorded in one-character alphabetic codes. The fare-basis codes are recorded as follows:
C—Unrestricted Business Class
D—Restricted Business Class
F—Unrestricted First Class
G—Restricted First Class
X—Restricted Coach/Economy Class
Y—Unrestricted Coach/Economy Class
U—Unknown (This fare category is used when none is shown on a ticket coupon, or when a fare category is not discernible, or when two or more carrier fare codes are compressed into a single stage of a passenger trip).
(d) In recording the number of passengers, each single-passenger ticket is to be recorded as one passenger. Tickets for infants under two years of age not occupying a seat are not to be counted. A revenue passenger is defined in Section X.
For group tickets of 10 or fewer passengers per ticket record the actual number of passengers on each ticket,
i.e.,
either 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10. For group tickets with 11 or more passengers (those sampled at a 100-percent rate) record the actual number of passengers traveling on each ticket, but keep these entries separate from the group ticket records with 10 or fewer passengers and from the single-passenger ticket records. Group tickets with 11 or more passengers are to be sorted and summarized to combine all passengers for all itineraries which are identical in every respect,
i.e.,
points, carriers, fare basis codes, and average dollar value (as defined in paragraph (e), below). The total number of passengers on each summarized record is to be divided by 10, rounding to the nearest whole passenger. If the quotient ends in 0.5 or more, raise to the next whole passenger. If the quotient ends in less than 0.5, drop the fraction. These large group-ticket records, after division by 10 for compatibility with the other data, are to be merged with the single-passenger records and with the group-ticket entries from tickets of 10 or fewer passengers for the quarterly O
D Survey report.
(e) The total dollar value shall be taken from the “Total” box on each ticket and shall be the sum of the fare plus tax for the entire ticket. Record this amount in whole U.S. dollars, with the cents dropped. Do not round cents to nearest whole dollar.
Amounts on tickets stated in foreign currency are to be converted to U.S. dollar equivalents. For
all group tickets,
the dollar value to be recorded shall be the average amount per passenger, determined by dividing the total dollar value for the entire group by the number of passengers on the group ticket, dropping cents in the average amount.
(3) The
length of the itineraries to be recorded is limited
to a maximum of seven stages or twenty-three stages, at the carrier's option. This recognizes that the vast majority of tickets sampled have seven stages or fewer and that the rare occurrences of extremely lengthy itineraries do not impact the overall Survey results enough to justify their reporting burden. Therefore, trips longer than these limits are
compressed
to fall within the stated maximums. The ticketed origin and destination are retained, but the
intermediate routing is compressed
by applying the following rules, in sequence:
(a) Combine any contiguous open, unknown carrier, or surface stages eliminating the connecting point, and ignoring the fare-basis codes, if different:
(b) Combine any contiguous stages via the same non-U.S. carrier, eliminating the connecting point, and ignoring the fare-basis codes, if different;
(c) Combine any contiguous stages via different non-U.S. carrier, making the carrier “UK”, eliminating the connecting point, and ignoring fare-basis codes, if different:
(d) Combine any contiguous stages via the
same U.S. carrier,
eliminating the connecting point, and ignoring the fare-basis codes, if different, and;
(e) If the trip, after applying the four steps above, is still too long, record the compressed routing through to the stage length limitation city (seventh or twenty-third city), enter UK as the final carrier, and then record the ticketed destination as the next (the 8th or 24th) city.

# VI. Summarization of Recorded Data
A.
General.
Prior to the submission of each quarterly report to the Department, each carrier is to summarize the data in accordance with the rules in Section VI.B. In special hardship cases, carriers may submit a waiver request (with justification under Section 1-2 of 14 CFR part 241) requesting permission to report their flight coupon records exactly as represented on their lifted tickets. Waiver requests must provide the documentation described in Section VI.C. so that the Department can develop the necessary procedures and edit routines to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the overall O
D Survey results. The granting of such waivers will depend upon the availability of resources for the Department to assume this additional burden, which can only be determined on a case by case basis, after evaluating each carrier's need.
B.
Rules for Summarization.
Sort the recorded entries into sequence by the entire record (excluding the passenger field)
i.e.,
by origin, complete routing (including fare-basis codes), tickets destination, and dollar value of ticket.
All identical records are then to be combined into one summary record.
The number of passengers on the summary record is to be the sum of the passenger amounts of all the individual records combined. Passengers are only summarized where records are identical in all respects except in the number of passengers including dollar value of ticket.
Note:
Do not summarize dollars over identical records. This summarization is to include the entries from group tickets, but only after the entries for
group tickets
with 11 or more passengers have been summarized and divided by 10,
as stated in Section V.D.(2)(d).
C.
Waiver Requests.
Requests for permission to depart from the required O
D Survey procedures should include a
procedural statement
describing the process the carrier proposed to employ in
examining, selecting and editing
the data from reportable flight coupons for the O
D Survey, as well as a flow chart diagramming the proposed procedures.
D.
Quantity and Quality Controls.
Carriers are expected to establish and maintain
continuous quantity and quality
controls on the flow of all lifted flight coupons through their system processes to determine the total
number of coupons handled
and the number of reportable
coupons selected.
Such data controls and tests have not been specified by the Department, and necessarily must be developed by each carrier. Each participating carrier shall develop and use on a continuous basis such control tests as are necessary to ensure that all reportable coupons are being selected, recorded and reported as intended by these O
D Survey Instructions. Such controls should extend over all ADP processing, both in-house and that from external service bureaus.

# VII. Editing of Recorded Data
A.
City and Airport Codes.
Prior to submission of O
D Survey reports, each carrier is to edit the recorded data to validate city and airport codes. This edit is to verify that the codes recorded are valid official codes, and it is independent of whether or not the carriers shown actually operated into or out of the airport shown. Any questions about airport codes should be addressed to the Director, Office of Airline Information (see inside of cover).
B.
Edit Responsibility of Carriers.
Each carrier is responsible for developing edit procedures and internal controls over its data entry and processing procedures so that valid and reliable data are captured in the O
D Survey inputs and are properly summarized in the outputs. Since the carriers have many different statistical systems, it is not practicable for the Department of Transportation to prescribe specific controls in this area, and each carrier is responsible for developing the appropriate internal control procedures to edit the O
D Survey data and ensure the integrity of these data. The Department will control the accuracy of its processing of the sampled data upon receipt from the carriers.
C.
System Documentation of Edits.
Carriers are required to maintain written O
D Survey procedural statements and flow charts. As provided in Section VIII, these must be established, or re-certified as of July 1, 1987, and thereafter when significant procedural revisions occur.

# VIII. Control of Sample Selection and Data Recording
A.
Sample Accuracy and Reliability.
In order to maximize the accuracy and reliability of the sample selection and data recording, each carrier is to:
(1) Develop a written statement describing the procedures it will employ in examining and selecting reportable flight coupons and in recording, summarizing, editing, and testing the Survey data.
(2) Submit any proposed changes in the above procedures to the Department's Office of Airline Information, prior to implementation of such changes.
(3) Establish continuous quantity controls on the flow of all lifted flight coupons through the carrier's accounting processing to determine the total number of coupons handled, and the number of reportable coupons selected. Tests are to be made continuously to assure that all reportable coupons are being selected and the data recorded. Such tests should be completed while the “lifted” flight coupons (representing earned passenger revenues for flight segments operated) remain in the possession of the carrier. Establish such other internal control procedures as are necessary for supervising and monitoring the accuracy of the recording of data from reportable flight coupons.
B.
Staff Review.
The OAI staff will review the carrier procedures and practices and may request modifications or the use of special procedures necessary to improve the sample or to bolster the controls for accuracy and reliability.
[Reserved]

Sec. 19-8
Passenger Origin—Destination
19-8.1
Purpose.
The purpose of this part is to set forth required data that certain air carriers must submit to the Department, either themselves or via third party vendors, so that information on air carriers' ticket pricing, passenger volumes, and trip routings can be made available to consumers of air transportation.
19-8.2
Definitions.
For purposes of this part:
Airport
see Origin or Destination.
As Sold
means to report ticket information as it appears on the ticket at the time the ticket was issued or reissued just prior to first known flown lift usage. For purposes of this part, any change to an existing ticket prior to the first segment being flown that results in a change to the ticket amount should be considered as requiring the ticket to be reissued. Any changes made to the ticket after the first segment is flown or that are incidental to the ticket value should not be considered as requiring the ticket to be reissued. For example, a last-minute schedule change by the carrier to an itinerary before first known flown lift usage that does not result in a change in the amount paid and does not change the intended trip destination should not be considered as a reissued ticket in this context. Partial reissued tickets shall not be included in the collection.
Commuter Air Carrier
means a commuter air carrier as defined in 14 CFR 298.2.
Connecting point
means an intermediate point in a sequence of travel at which the passenger deplanes from one flight and boards another flight, either on the same carrier or from the flight of one carrier to a flight of another carrier, for continuation of the journey.
Coupon Stage
(
See
Flight-Coupon).
Destination
means the airport code or terminus in the ticket sequence of travel where a passenger deplanes from a flight stage. Qualifying airports or terminus will be specified periodically in accounting and reporting directives issued by the OAI. Airport, or terminus, codes are most commonly assigned by the International Air Transport Association (IATA) and occasionally by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) or the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) depending on the jurisdiction of the airport. A common private industry source of these industry designator codes is 3rd party schedule products and OAI will use one of these products as a source where possible. Where none exists, OAI will furnish a code upon request.
Dwell Time
means scheduled elapsed time (in minutes) between each ticketed coupon. Dwell time is not required to be reported at Via Airport stops. When dwell time exceeds 1,440 minutes, or 24 hours, report “9999”.
Eligible Ticket
means a ticket that meets the 40% sampling criteria where the right-most digit is equal to “0” (zero), “2” (two), “7” (seven) or “9” (nine) when following the standard sampling procedure. For ad-hoc procedures, an eligible ticket is any ticket that meets the approved sampling procedure selected.
Flight Coupon
means a defined origin and destination for a single stage of flight provided by a single Operating Carrier. Tickets are composed of one or more flight stages, also known as coupons or coupon stages.
First Reporting Carrier Rule
means a rule applied during the Reporting Event Evaluation. The rule states that the first Reporting Carrier in the sequence of travel for a Category Two ticket is designated as the carrier responsible for reporting the ticket.
Flown Lift Usage
is a record or indicator in the accounting system of the issuing carrier that represents a passenger ticket coupon that has been used by the passenger for travel on a flight.
International Ticket
means a ticket that involves an international point and is submitted by a Reporting Carrier, or a ticket submitted under 49 U.S.C. 41308 and 41309 for certain foreign air carriers granted antitrust immunity that includes a Reporting Carrier (or affiliate) operated leg in an itinerary. An international point is a point that resides outside of the 50
States. U.S. possessions are considered International Points.
Issuing Carrier
means an air carrier or foreign air carrier that issues an air travel ticket.
Marketing Carrier
means the air carrier that markets the seat on the aircraft, regardless of whether it operates the flight segment.
Operating Carrier
means the carrier that has operational control over the aircraft that is scheduled to depart from an airport. Under a code-share arrangement, the air carrier whose flight crew are used to perform a flight segment.
Origin
means an airport or terminus in the ticket sequence of travel where a passenger boards a flight stage. Qualifying airports or terminus will be specified periodically in accounting and reporting directives issued by the Office of Airline Information. Airport, or terminus, codes are most commonly assigned by the International Air Transport Association (IATA) and occasionally by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) or the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) depending on the jurisdiction of the airport. A common private industry source of these industry designator codes is 3rd party schedule products and OAI will use one of these products as a source where possible. Where none exists, OAI will furnish a code upon request.
Purchase Window Group
means one of three groups indicating the advance purchase window of the ticket. “21AP” is less than or equal to 21 days prior to departure, “2290” is 22 to 90 days prior to departure, and “91UP” is more than 90 days prior to departure.
Record Identification Number
(RIN) means an air carrier assigned number that uniquely identifies each ticket within each reporting period.
Reporting Carrier
means the U.S. Certificated Air Carrier or Commuter Air Carrier that is required to report O
D data and reported a given itinerary to the Department.
Reporting Event
means the occurrence of a Reporting Carrier recognizing that a ticket has been flown and evaluating the ticket to determine if it should be reported to the O
D.
Reporting Carrier List
means a list maintained and published by the Office of Airline Information (OAI). Carriers report O
D data consistent with these regulations, but a carrier is not required to report until OAI adds the carrier to the Reporting Carriers List. Carriers must also determine the responsible reporting carrier for Category Two tickets using the first reporting carrier rule and should use the Reporting Carriers List to determine the responsible reporting carrier.
Reporting Month
means the month applicable to the ticket submission.
Reportable Ticket
means that the combination of flown lift usage, sampling process criteria, and the Category One and Category Two ticket evaluation determines if a ticket is reportable.
Reporting Year
means the year applicable to the ticket submission.
Revenue Passenger
has the same meaning as the definition in 14 CFR 241 Section 03—Definitions for Purposes of This System of Accounts and Reports—Passenger, Revenue.
Routing
means the sequence of travel for each flight stage including all intermediate points of routing stopover or connection (interline or intraline) in the movement of the passenger from the first airport in the sequence of travel to the last airport in the sequence of travel for the ticket.
Scheduled Flight Month
means month for a departure from an airport in the sequence of travel for a ticket.
Scheduled Flight Year
means year for a departure from an airport in the sequence of travel for a ticket.
Scheduled Service
means transport service held out and operated on a certificated air carrier or commuter carrier's routes pursuant to published flight schedules, including extra sections of scheduled flights.
Tax Amount
means all aggregated taxes and fees imposed by the U.S., government entity, or a foreign government, such as, but not limited to, Federal excise taxes, flight segment taxes, U.S. passenger facility surcharges, September 11 security fees, U.S. or international departure and arrival charges, and immigration charges. Taxes and mandatory fees charged by other foreign authorities, such as passenger service charges and
airport taxes, are also considered part of Tax Amount.
Ticket
means a legal contract between an Issuing Carrier and a Revenue Passenger for transportation.
Total Amount
means:
(1) Gross total of funds collected on a ticket by the Issuing Carrier for the transportation of a passenger, inclusive of taxes and fees imposed by non-carrier entities or air carriers, and exclusive of ancillary fees not required to board the plane charged by the air carrier. Factors considered in determining what should be included in the Total Amount are as follows:
(i) Total Amount includes charges required to board the aircraft (domestic and international) that are recognized as revenue at the time of purchase of the ticket and at the time of first lift of the ticket.
(ii) Where a charge assessed at the time of purchase of the ticket is associated with a choice, such as seat assignment, where the consumer must pay the fee or charge regardless of the choice made, the charge is considered part of the Total Amount.
(iii) The Total Amount does not include charges for optional services (services offered which the consumer may choose not to utilize and thus not incur the fee or charge) such as baggage fees, seat upgrade fees, or ticket change fees. When a fee is assessed and there is a no cost option, that fee is considered an ancillary fee. When a fee is assessed for a service that provides something distinct from the air travel product then that fee is considered an ancillary fee.
(iv) The term Total Amount should align with standard passenger ticket documents; however, for air carriers that do not follow such standards or have, or may have, created new fees that may not be included in the standard passenger ticket document and yet are required to be paid to board the aircraft, these must also be included in Total Amount.
(2) Based on the criteria, the following is a non-exhaustive list of carrier-imposed fees and charges that must be reported as part of the Total Amount of the ticket: fuel surcharges, carrier usage charges, carrier interface fees, check-in fees, electronic usage charges, peak/holiday travel fees, transaction processing charges, and credit card surcharge fees. When a customer is assessed a fee based on how the customer acquires a ticket to board the aircraft, a booking fee, the fee is included in the Total Amount. Being required to pay a fee or charge for electronic or phone booking where there is no fee for purchase at the counter must be reported in the Total Amount. Being charged a call center fee for booking by phone when the customer could have booked online at no charge is not an example of a booking fee that must be reported. Carriers must also include all taxes and fees imposed by the U.S. or a foreign government, such as, but not limited to, Federal excise taxes, flight segment taxes, U.S. passenger facility surcharges, September 11 security fees, U.S. or international departure and arrival charges, and immigration charges. Carriers must also include taxes and mandatory fees charged by other foreign authorities, such as passenger service charges and airport taxes.
USD
means United States Dollars.
Via Airport (Point(s))
means any point(s) of stopover at intermediate airports as part of a “direct” or “through” flight. These are points that are not usually recorded on a ticket as the passenger does not generally deplane from the aircraft at the intermediate point.
§ 19-8.3
Applicability.
(a) All U.S. certificated and commuter air carriers conducting scheduled passenger services (except helicopter carriers) shall participate in a Passenger Origin-Destination (O
D) Survey covering domestic and international air carrier operations, as prescribed by the Department's Office of Airline Information (OAI) in the instructions manual entitled,
Instructions to Air Carriers for Collecting and Reporting Passenger Origin-Destination Survey Statistics
and in
Passenger Origin-Destination Directives issued by OAI.
Copies of these Instructions and Directives are available on the BTS web page and will be provided to each reporting carrier at the time it becomes a reporting carrier.
(b) Air carriers are not required to begin reporting O
D until placed on the Reporting Carrier List that will be published by BTS/OAI 75 days prior to the beginning of each period of reporting. The Reporting Carrier List will identify each U.S. Certificated and Commuter Air Carrier required by this part to report O
D as designated by BTS OAI. Carriers may be added to this list as a result of consideration under this part or under 49 U.S.C. 41308 and 41309 for certain Foreign Air Carriers granted antitrust immunity. Foreign Air Carriers granted antitrust immunity under 49 U.S.C. 41308 and 41309 are not considered Reporting Carriers under this part but do report the same data under different legal authority.
(c) This section applies for air transportation taking place on or after July 1, 2025. Reporting pursuant to section 19-7 of this part is not required for air travel taking place on or after April 1, 2025.
§ 19-8.4
Reporting of O
D data.
(a) Each reporting carrier must file O
D data with the Bureau of Transportation Statistics Office of Airline Information (BTS/OAI) on a monthly basis for each of its reportable O
D tickets as follows. Collect the ticket information once there is an indication that the ticket has been flown,
i.e.
first known Flown Lift Usage. Report routing (and other ticket information) As Sold. Reporting carriers must determine the points ticketed and integrate the ticketed information required for reporting. It is at each reporting carrier's discretion whether to use a third-party provider to manage their O
D data submissions. The use of a third-party provider will not remove the responsibility of the reporting carrier to ensure that their data is reported accurately and on schedule.
(b) A statistically valid sample of flight coupons must be selected for reporting purposes. Flight coupons should only be sampled from tickets:
(1) issued for scheduled service itineraries;
(2) issued to revenue passengers who are individually ticketed (
i.e.
no group tickets, no infants flying without their own tickets); and
(3) that involve a U.S. airport or a U.S. air carrier operation at some point in the scheduled itinerary. The sample must consist of 40 percent of the total lifted ticket flight coupons for all domestic and international markets. Partially reissued tickets, which are tickets issued for changes to an itinerary after the first segment is flown, should not be included in the total lifted ticket flight coupons for all domestic and international markets from which the sample is drawn.
(c) The data recorded and reported from selected lifted flight ticket coupons must include the following information elements:
(1) Reporting Carrier,
(2) Reporting Month and Reporting Year,
(3) Record Identification Number (RIN),
(4) Issuing Carrier,
(5) Total Amount,
(6) Tax Amount,
(7) Airport code,
(8) Operating Carrier code,
(9) Marketing Carrier code,
(10) Scheduled Flight Year,
(11) Scheduled Flight Month,
(12) Dwell Time,
(13) Via Airport (if any),
(14) Purchase Window Group.
(d) Report Total Amount and Tax Amount in United States Dollars (USD) rounded to two decimal places.
(e) A Reporting Event evaluation occurs when a Reporting Carrier's revenue accounting system recognizes that any portion of a ticket has been flown,
i.e.
, first known lift usage. This evaluation will inform the Reporting Carrier if a ticket in their system has been recognized that meets criteria that may require the ticket be reported. Situations may occur where the Reporting Carrier's revenue accounting system identifies a ticket from a flight that occurs after the first flight in the ticket sequence. This may occur when the first flight in the ticket sequence is not used for travel, or the Reporting Carrier's revenue accounting system does not recognize the first flight in the ticket for some other reason. When this occurs, the second (or subsequent) flight is the first known lift usage and becomes the Reporting
Event. The Reporting Carrier is responsible for reporting the complete ticket information as it appears at the time of the Reporting Event which should correspond with the information at the time the ticket was sold. Reporting carriers should not report ticket information as flown if the ticket information changes after first known lift usage.
(f)
Ticket reporting.
(1) A ticket will be reported when:
(i) The criteria of the sampling process are met, and
(ii) The ticket meets either the criteria of a Category One or Category Two ticket.
(A)
Category One ticket reporting process.
Tickets issued by a Reporting Carrier are known as Category One tickets. These tickets will be reported by the Reporting Carrier if the sampling process criteria conditions are satisfied. The carrier that issues the ticket remains the Reporting Carrier regardless of which flight from the ticket is first recognized by the revenue accounting system as the first flown lift usage.
(B)
Category Two ticket reporting process.
Tickets issued by carriers that do not appear on the published Reporting Carrier List but are recognized by a carrier that participates on the ticket and is on the Reporting Carrier List are known as Category Two tickets. The examining Reporting Carrier must apply the “First Reporting Carrier” rule: The first carrier in a ticket's sequence of travel that also appears on the Reporting Carrier List is responsible for submitting the ticket to the O
D if the sampling criteria are also met. The first Reporting Carrier in the sequence of a Category Two ticket remains the Reporting Carrier regardless of which flight from the ticket is first recognized by the revenue accounting system. For the purposes of the First Reporting Carrier Rule, any carrier that appears on the Reporting Carrier List is considered a Reporting Carrier.
(iii)
Additional provisions for Category Two tickets.
Reporting Carriers should use all reasonable efforts to determine the required information from Category Two tickets. If the information for Operating Carrier, Via Airports, Dwell Time, Tax Amount, and Purchase Window Group is unavailable to the Reporting Carrier, however, then leave the fields for which information is unavailable blank. In cases where a carrier is unable to determine Dwell Time between coupons insert a “B” (for Break) in the appropriate dwell time slot where the reporting carrier provides an estimate of where in the itinerary the trip break occurs. Record a surface segment indicator (--, dash dash) where two consecutive stops within the itinerary have no air carrier operator. Record surface segments at the beginning and end of itineraries when the segments are designated with an airline flight number, appear on the ticket, and have a designator code that appears in an airline schedule source.
(g) The primary ticket's right-most digit of the standard ticket document number forms the basis for the random sample size. All required information associated with a primary ticket must be reported, which may include information from a related conjunction ticket. A conjunction ticket is a ticket that is a continuation of a primary ticket itinerary. Conjunction tickets should not be included in the sample process on their own. Any Reporting Carrier that does not assign ticket numbers to passenger journeys, does not assign ticket numbers such that the final, right-most digit is not randomly assigned, or otherwise seeks to use an alternative method must develop an alternative method of creating a valid 40 percent sample. Those Reporting Carriers would need to submit their alternative sample methods to DOT for approval within 90 days of the date that the Reporting Carrier recognizes that it must make use of the alternative sample selection method to comply with the proposed reporting regulation for determining a Reportable Ticket.
§ 19-8.5
Form of reports.
Reporting carriers should report individual tickets as separate records where the Record Identifier Number (RIN) uniquely identifies each record in a submission. Except where otherwise noted, all reports required by this part shall be filed within 45 days of the
end of the month for which data are reported. The reports should be submitted to the Office of Airline Information in a format specified in the
Instructions to Air Carriers for Collecting and Reporting Passenger Origin-Destination Survey Data
or accounting and reporting directives issued by BTS/OAI.
(a) Each Reporting Carrier shall maintain its prescribed reportable records in a manner and at such locations as will permit ready accessibility for examination by representatives of DOT. The record retention requirements are prescribed in part 249 of this chapter.
(b) [Reserved]
§ 19-8.6
Dissemination.
Any Ticket that is submitted that involves a Reporting Carrier and an International Point providing service in whole or in part under this part are generally not available to the Department, the U.S. carriers, or U.S. interests. Therefore, because of the damaging competitive impact on U.S. carriers and the adverse effect upon the public interest that would result from unilateral disclosure of international ticket survey data that involves a Reporting Carrier, the Department will not disclose international ticket data that involves a Reporting Carrier in the Passenger Origin-Destination Survey to citizens or non-citizens except:
(a) To an air carrier directly participating in and contributing input data to the Survey under this part or to a legal or consulting firm designated by a directly participating air carrier to use on its behalf and in connection with a specific assignment by such carrier;
(b) To parties to any proceeding before the Department to the extent that such data are relevant and material to the issues in the proceeding upon a determination to this effect by the Administrative Law Judge or by the Department's decision-maker. Any data to which access is granted pursuant to this section may be introduced into evidence subject to the normal rules of admissibility of evidence;
(c) To agencies and other components of the U.S. Government;
(d) To other persons upon a showing that the release of the data will serve specifically identified needs of U.S. users which are consistent with U.S. interests; and
(e) To foreign governments and foreign users as provided in formal reciprocal arrangements between the foreign and U.S. Governments for the exchange of comparable O
D data.

for the O
D Survey, as well as a flow chart diagramming the proposed procedures.
(d)
Quantity and quality controls.
Carriers are expected to establish and maintain continuous quantity and quality controls on the flow of all lifted flight coupons through their system processes to determine the total number of coupons handled and the number of reportable coupons selected. Such data controls and tests have not been specified by the Department, and necessarily must be developed by each carrier. Each participating carrier shall develop and use on a continuous basis such control tests as are necessary to ensure that all reportable coupons are being selected, recorded, and reported as intended by these regulations, the
Instructions to Air Carriers for Collecting and Reporting Passenger Origin—Destination Survey Data,
and any related accounting and reporting directives. (Instructions and accounting and reporting directives are available from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics Office of Airline Information. Please visit
https://www.bts.gov/
or call 800-853-1351 for more information.) Such controls should extend over all ADP processing, both in-house and that from third-party service providers.
§ 19-8.8
Editing data.
(a)
City and airport, or terminus, codes.
Prior to submission of O
D, each carrier is to edit the recorded data to validate city and airport or terminus codes. This edit is to verify that the codes recorded are valid official codes, and it is independent of whether the carriers shown operated into or out of the airport or terminus shown. Any questions about airport or terminus codes should be addressed to the Director, Office of Airline Information.
(b)
Edit responsibility of carriers.
Each carrier is responsible for developing edit procedures and internal controls over its data entry and processing procedures so that valid and reliable data are captured in the O
D inputs. Since the carriers have many different statistical systems, it is not practicable for the Department of Transportation to prescribe specific controls in this area, and each carrier is responsible for developing the appropriate internal control procedures to edit the O
D data and ensure the integrity of these data. The Department will control the accuracy of its processing of the sampled data upon receipt from the carriers or their third-party providers.
(c)
System documentation of edits.
Carriers are required to maintain written O
D procedural statements and flow charts.
§ 19-8.9
Control of sample selection and data recording.
Sample accuracy and reliability.
To maximize the accuracy and reliability of the sample selection and data recording, each carrier is to:
(a) Develop a written statement describing the procedures it will employ in examining and selecting reportable flight coupons and in recording, summarizing, editing, and testing the Survey data;
(b) Submit any proposed changes in the procedures specified in paragraph (a) of this section to the Department's Office of Airline Information, prior to implementation of such changes;
(c) Establish continuous quantity controls on the flow of all lifted flight coupons through the carrier's accounting processing to determine the total number of coupons handled, and the number of reportable coupons selected. Tests are to be made continuously to assure that all reportable coupons are being selected and the data recorded. Such tests should be completed while the “lifted” flight coupons (representing earned passenger revenues for flight segments operated) remain in the possession of the carrier. Establish such other internal control procedures as are necessary for supervising and monitoring the accuracy of the recording of data from reportable flight coupons.
§ 19-8.10
Staff review.
The OAI staff will review the carrier procedures and practices and may request modifications or the use of special procedures necessary to improve the sample or to bolster the controls for accuracy and reliability.

# General Reporting Provisions—Large Certificated Air Carriers
Section 21
Introduction to System of Reports
(a) Each large certificated air carrier shall file with the BTS, monthly, quarterly, semiannually, and annually BTS Form 41 Reports of financial and operating statistics as prescribed herein unless waiver has been made by the BTS.
(b) The system prescribed provides for the submission by each air carrier of four classes of financial and operating statistics, on individual schedules of the BTS Form 41 Report, grouped as follows:
A. Certification.
B. Balance Sheet Elements.
P. Profit and Loss Elements.
T. Traffic and Capacity Elements.
(c) The prescribed system of reports provides that the frequency of reporting shall be monthly for some schedules, quarterly for some, semiannually for some and annually for others. It also provides in some areas for the classification of large certificated air carriers into Group I, Group II, and Group III with the form and content differentiated as between groups.
(d) Each schedule of the prescribed BTS Form 41 Report has been assigned a specific code. The prefix alphabetical codes A, B, P and T, respectively, have been employed to denote certification, balance sheet, profit and loss, and traffic and capacity. The digits immediately following the alphabetical prefix designate the particular schedule.
(e) [Reserved]
(f) [Reserved]
(g) Four separate air carrier entities shall be established for large certificated air carriers conducting scheduled service for the purpose of submitting the prescribed reports. They are as follows: (1) Domestic operations; (2) operations via the Atlantic Ocean; (3) operations via the Pacific Ocean; and (4) operations in Latin American areas. With respect to the first classification, the domestic entity shall embrace all operations within and between the 50 States of the United States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, and shall also include Canadian transborder operations. The reports to be submitted by each entity shall be comparable to those required of a distinct legal entity whether the reporting entity constitutes such an entity, a semiautonomous physically separated operating division of the carrier, or an entity established for reporting purposes only.
(h) Two separate entities shall be established for large certificated air carriers predominantly engaged in conducting charter activities for the purpose of submitting the prescribed reports: (1) Domestic operations; and (2) international operations. The domestic entity includes all operations within and between the 50 States of the United States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. All other operations will be in the international entity.
(i) The entities for which separate reports shall be made by the different route and charter air carriers will be set semiannually by the Office of Airline Information.
(j) As a general rule separate reports shall be filed for the air carrier and for each associated company air carriers as defined in section 03 which is an air carrier. However, transactions of associated companies in which 100 percent equity control resides in the reporting air carrier shall be consolidated with transactions of the reporting air carrier when such associated companies perform services related to the transport operations of the reporting air carrier almost exclusively and are not engaged in air transportation for their own account.
(k) Generally, route air carriers' nonscheduled services shall be treated as an integral part of the reporting entity to which most closely related without regard to the geographic area in which such nonscheduled services may actually be performed. However, supplemental reports shall be made of nonscheduled services (including service for the Department of Defense) in areas not encompassed by the prescribed reporting entity in any month in which the available ton-miles of such nonscheduled services exceed 5 percent of the available ton-miles of the reporting entity. Such supplemental reports
shall continue until waived by the BTS upon a showing that such nonscheduled operations will not in the subsequent 12-month period exceed the 5-percent limit. The supplemental reports to be filed each month or calendar quarter, as applicable, shall be comprised of report Schedules P-5, T-1, and T-2. Transport and nontransport revenues pertaining to such separately reported nonscheduled services shall be reported on Schedule P-2 each quarter.
(l) When and as required in the national interest, any air carrier which performs nonscheduled transport services for the Department of Defense shall, when directed by the Department, make separate reports for such services as if they were conducted by a physically separate transport entity, such reports shall consist of Schedules P-1 through P-7, T-1, and T-2. The letter “D” shall be inserted on such reports, following the schedule number of each P and T schedule. When a carrier has more than one reporting entity, nonscheduled transport and nonscheduled Defense services shall be assigned to the reporting entity to which more closely related.

Reporting due dates on Form 41 Schedules B and P are extended to March 30 if preliminary schedules are filed at the Department by February 10
(b) Each large certificated air carrier shall file the applicable schedules of the BTS Form 41 Report with the BTS in accordance with the above instructions with the following exceptions:
(1) The time for filing B and P report schedules for the final quarter or semiannual period of each calendar year may be extended to the following March 30 if the preliminary Schedules B-1 or B-1.1 and P-1.1 or P-1.2 are submitted, as applicable, and are received on or before their respective due dates.
(2) For the third month of any calendar quarter, Schedule P-1(a) need not be filed if Schedule P-1.1 or P-1.2 for the quarter or semiannual period, as applicable, is received on the due date prescribed for Schedule P-1(a).
(3) Income and expense data on Schedule P-1(a) for each month will be withheld by the BTS from public disclosure, until such time as (i) the semiannual or quarterly financial reports are due, (ii) the semiannual or quarterly financial reports are filed, or (iii) information covered by monthly reports is publicly released by the carrier concerned, whichever occurs first. Before that time, income and expense data reported on Schedule P-1(a) will be disclosed to parties to any proceeding before the DOT to the extent that such data are relevant and material to the issues in the proceeding upon a determination to this effect by the administrative law judge assigned to the case or by the DOT. Any data to which access is granted may be introduced into evidence, subject to the normal rules of admissibility of evidence. The DOT will make other disclosure of these data upon its own motion or upon application of any interested person, when the DOT finds the public interest so requires. The BTS may, from time to time, publish summary information compiled from Schedule P-1(a) in a form which will not identify the individual carrier. At the request of an air carrier, and upon a showing by such air carriers that public disclosure of its preliminary year-end report would adversely affect its interests and would not be in the public interest, the BTS will withhold such preliminary year-end report from public disclosure until such time as (i) the final report is filed, (ii) the final report is due, or (iii) information covered by the preliminary report is publicly released by the carrier concerned, whichever occurs first.
(c) If circumstances prevent the filing of a report on or before the prescribed due date, consideration will be given to the granting of an extension
upon receipt of a written request therefor. To provide ample time for consideration and communication to the air carrier of the action taken, such a request must be delivered to the BTS in writing at least three (3) days in advance of the due date, setting forth good and sufficient reason to justify the granting of the extension and the date when the report can be filed. Except in cases of emergency, no such request will be entertained which is not in writing and received by the BTS at least three (3) days before the prescribed due date. If a request is denied, the air carrier remains subject to the filing requirements to the same extent as if no request for extension of time had been made.
(d) [Reserved]
(e) All financial data reported on B, P and G schedules shall reflect the status of the air carrier's books of account for the period for which the report is being made and shall conform to the instructions contained in this Uniform System of Accounts and Reports. At the option of the air carrier, Group III air carriers may round reported financial data to the nearest thousands of dollars by typing “($000)” at the top of each amount column. All Group I and Group II air carriers may, at their option, round reported financial data to the nearest whole dollars by dropping the cents. All rounded amounts must be balanced within and between schedules. This option applies only to the submission of hardcopy reports. Instructions for the submission of data in ADP format are contained in the Accounting and Reporting Directives, which are available from OAI.
(f) Traffic and other operational statistics included in schedules of the BTS Form 41 reports shall reflect data pertaining to the month, quarter or 12-months-to-date period for which the report is being made.
(g) Adjustments correcting errors in previously reported traffic and other operational statistics shall not be included in data reported in schedules for the current period but shall be effected by submission of corrected schedules for the period to which applicable or, if only a few items are involved, by written notice and authorization to the BTS to correct previously filed reports except that any correction which amounts to less than one-half of one percent (0.5%) of the corrected amount for the month to which related may be included in the report for the current month provided the amount of the correction is clearly noted on the Form 41 Report.
(h) All letters and statements of correction or revision of reported data shall be a part of the BTS Form 41 reports.
(i) All changes in accounting methods having a material impact upon the particular financial elements involved, and all changes in methods of computing and reporting traffic and capacity statistics having a material impact upon the particular statistic involved shall be adequately explained and identified in the report first reflecting such changes. Such explanations related to financial position or financial results shall be made on BTS Form 41 Schedule P-2. Changes in methods for computing or reporting traffic and capacity statistics shall be identified and explained on a separate sheet attached to the first report affected. (See sec. 2-16.) The reporting requirements shall not be construed, in any sense, as relieving the air carrier of the responsibility for conforming its procedures to those otherwise prescribed in this system of accounts and reports.
(j) All financial statements released by carriers to the public reflecting a financial position or operating results for dates or reporting periods not covered by reports on file with the BTS shall be filed with the Board simultaneously with their public release.

Section 23
Certification and Balance Sheet Elements

# Schedule A—Certification
(a) The certification of the BTS Form 41 Report shall be signed by an elective corporate officer, executive, or director. Other
persons may be authorized by the carrier to sign the certification provided a written authorization disclosing the individual's name and title is forwarded to the Department of Transportation. Since corrections or revisions of reported data are a part of the BTS Form 41 Report, all correspondence relating to such matters shall be signed only by the person(s) authorized to sign the certification.
(b) The certification of the Form 41 reports, embodied in Schedule A thereof, shall read as follows:
I, the undersigned (Title of officer in charge of accounts) ____ of the (Full name of the reporting company) ___ do certify that this report and all schedules, ADP-media submissions, Passenger Origin-Destination Survey submissions and supporting documents which are submitted herewith or have been submitted heretofore as parts of this report filed for the above indicated period have been prepared under my direction; that I have carefully examined them and declare that they correctly reflect the accounts and records of the company, and to the best of my knowledge and belief are a complete and accurate statement, after adjustments to reflect full accruals, of the operating revenues and expenses, income items, assets, liabilities, capital, retained earnings, and operating statistics for the periods reported in the several schedules, the Schedule T-100 ADP-media submissions, and the Passenger Origin-Destination Survey; that the various items herein reported were determined in accordance with the Uniform System of Accounts and Reports for Large Certificated Air Carriers prescribed by the Department of Transportation; and that the data contained herein are reported on a basis consistent with that of the preceding report except as specifically noted in the financial and statistical statements.

(b) Each carrier shall insert in the space provided for “OAG Code” its carrier code as contained in the Official Airlines Guide (OAG). If the OAG does not contain a carrier code for the reporting carrier, a code will be provided by the Office of Airline Information upon request. This code will then be inserted in the space provided for “carrier code.”
(c) This schedule shall show the account balances at the close of business on June 30 or December 31, as applicable, of each semiannual reporting period.
(d) “Current Assets” shall include all resources that may reasonably be expected to be realized in cash or sold or consumed within one year. This group of assets is classified into three basic accounts:
(1) “Cash and Equivalents” shall include cash on hand and on deposit, U.S. Government securities, and other temporary cash investments.
(2) “Notes and Accounts Receivable-Net” shall include general traffic accounts receivable, government receivables, notes and receivables from associated companies, officers, employees and others, and a deduction for a reasonable allowance for bad debts.
(3) “Other Current Assets” shall contain all other current assets not provided for in the above classifications. This account shall include, but is not limited to, short-term prepayments, expendable spare parts, supplies and other inventories of flight equipment replacement parts that are usually replaced rather than repaired, and materials and supplies held in stock, such as fuel and oil, expendable tools, office supplies and food service supplies. Spare parts may be reduced by an allowance for obsolescence to provide for losses in value.
(e) “Property and Equipment” shall be segregated into that which is owned and that which is leased under capital leases. All property and equipment, with the deception of land, shall be reported net of accumulated depreciation or amortization.
(f) “Other Assets” shall included all assets not included in the above categories, such as long-term investments, long-term prepayments, long-term receivables, deferred charges, intangible assets, equipment purchase deposits, and construction work in progress.
(g) “Current Liabilities” shall include all obligations, the liquidation of which is reasonably expected to require the use of existing resources within one year. This group of liabilities is classified into three basic accounts:
(1) “Notes and Accounts Payable” shall include any payments on long-term debt, short-term notes and accounts payable, and accrued expenses that are payable within one year.
(2) “Accrued Taxes” shall include tax liabilities, such as those imposed on income,
property and payroll, which are reasonably expected to be liquidated within one year.
(3) “Other Current Liabilities” shall include all current liabilities which are not provided for elsewhere, such as air traffic liabilities for unused transportation sold (includes sales of transportation on both the reporting carrier and other carriers).
(h) “Long-Term Debt” shall include all obligations which are not reasonably expected to be liquidated within one year. Typical examples include bonds payable, long-term notes payable, lease obligations, and pension obligations.
(i) “Other Liabilities” shall include any debts or obligations which are not properly listed in the “Current Liabilities” or “Long-Term Debt” sections.
(j) “Deferred Credits” shall include all credit balances of a general clearing nature, including credits held in suspense pending receipt of further information necessary for final disposition. Included in this account are deferred income taxes and deferred investment tax credits.
(k) “Stockholder's Equity” shall be reported as follows:

(2) “Other Paid-In Capital” shall include the difference between the price at which the capital stock is sold and the par or stated value of the stock.
(3) “Retained Earnings” shall represent the net income or loss from all operations of the corporate entity less dividends.
(4) “Treasury Stock” shall represent the cost of stock issued by the carrier and reacquired by it but not retired or cancelled.
(l) The statement of certification shall be signed by the carrier's chief accounting officer.
(m) All substantive matters that may materially influence interpretations or conclusions in regard to the financial condition or the earnings position of the air carrier which are not clearly identified in the body of the schedule or which represent information that cannot be expressed adequately in monetary terms shall be completely and clearly stated in a note attached to this schedule and cross-referenced to the affected account or accounts.

# Schedule B-7 Airframe and Aircraft Engine Acquisitions and Retirements
(a) This schedule shall be filed by all Group II and Group III air carriers.
(b) Data applicable to acquisitions and data applicable to retirements shall be grouped and reported separately. The data reported within each group (acquisitions; retirements) shall be further subgrouped and reported as follows:
(1) Acquisitions: the indicated data shall be reported for each individual airframe, identified by type, model, and design of cabin as to use for passengers exclusively, cargo exclusively, or both passengers and cargo in combination. Data pertaining to aircraft engines shall be reported in aggregate for each type or model; however, leased aircraft engines shall be separately reported under captions entitled: Capital Leases—Aircraft Engines; and Operating Leases—Aircraft Engines. Airframe units leased from others for a period of more than 90 days shall be reported in a separate subsection of this schedule, captioned as follows: Capital Leases—Airframe Units; and Operating Leases—Airframe Units. In addition, a notation shall be made by license number of airframe units of the air carrier returned after lease to others for a period of more than 90 days. Airframe units obtained through interchange lease arrangements shall not be so reported.
(2) Retirements: The indicated data shall be reported for the sale or retirement of each airframe, each type of aircraft engine (stating the number of units retired) and, to the extent retired along with airframes and engines, in aggregates by accounts, operating property and equipment included in accounts 1607 and 1608 and nonoperating property and equipment included in accounts 1707 and 1708. Disposition of properties in accounts 1608 and 1708 not related to airframe and aircraft engine retirements shall be reported in a separate group for each account. Airframe units leased from others for a period of more than 90 days shall be reported, upon return to the lessor, in a separate subsection of this schedule and captioned as follows: Capital Leases—Airframe Units; and Operating Leases—Airframe Units. In addition, a notation shall be made by license number and name of lessee of airframe units leased to others for a period of more than 90 days; moreover, airframe units leased to others under sales-type or direct financing leases shall be separately captioned and reported on this schedule. Airframe units leased under interchange arrangements shall not be so reported. Aircraft engines leased from others for a period of more than 90 days shall be reported, upon return to the lessor, in a separate subsection of this schedule and captioned as follows: Capital Leases—Aircraft Engines; and Operating Leases—Aircraft Engines. In addition, a notation shall be made by model number, number of units, and name of lessee of aircraft engines leased to others for a period of more than 90 days; moreover, aircraft engines leased to others under sales-type or direct financing leases shall be separately captioned and reported on this schedule. Aircraft engines leased under interchange arrangements shall not be so reported.
(c) All dates shall indicate the day, the month and the year; shall be provided on a unit basis for airframes only, and, shall be reported for each aircraft engine group by date of transaction.
(d) Column 1, “Year of First Delivery—Airframe,” shall reflect, for each reported airframe, the year that the airframe was first delivered by its manufacturer.
(e) Column 2, “Airframe Manufacturer's Serial Number,” shall reflect the serial number assigned to each reported airframe by its manufacturer.
(f) Column 4, “Acquisitions or Retirements,” shall be used to indicate, for each item entered, whether it represents an acquisition or retirement. This shall be indicated by inserting in Column 4 an “A” for acquisition or an “R” for retirement.
(g) Column 8, “Maximum Seating Capacity,” shall reflect the number of passenger seats installed in each airframe acquired. When airframes are designed for multiple adjustable seating configurations, the maximum number of seats for which designed shall be reported. When the seating configuration of airframes is modified subsequent to original acquisition, the revised passenger capacity of each airfame shall be reported in the quarter in which modified and referenced to identify original capacity reported.
(h) Column 9, “Cost,” shall reflect the book cost of reported airframe and aircraft engine acquisitions and retirements.
(i) Column 10, “Amortization/Depreciated Cost,” shall reflect the book cost, less amortization or depreciation expense, for airframes and aircraft engines that have been retired.
(j) Column 11, “Realization,” shall reflect the proceeds from the disposition of airframes and aircraft engines, including any insurance proceeds.
(k) Column 12, “Acquired From/Disposition,” shall reflect: (1) for acquisitions: the name of the person or organization from which airframes and aircraft engines are acquired and (2) for dispositions (retirements): the name of the person or organization to which airframes and aircraft engines are sold or a notation as to the nature of the retirement and the account to which any depreciated cost has been charged, if not sold. Items included in accounts 1607, 1608, 1707, and 1708, sold as a part of an airframe or aircraft sales transaction, shall also be identified by the name of the buyer. Other sales of items included in these accounts shall be reported in a separate group in aggregate for each property account affected.

# Schedule B-12—Statement of Cash Flows

# PART 244—REPORTING TARMAC DELAY DATA
Sec.
244.1
Definitions.
244.2
Applicability.
244.3
Reporting of tarmac delay data.

# Authority:
49 U.S.C. 40101(a)(4), 40101(a)(9), 40113(a), 41702, 41708, 41712, and 42301.

# Source:
Docket No. DOT-OST-2010-0140, 76 FR 23160, Apr. 25, 2011, unless otherwise noted.
§ 244.1
Definitions.
Cancelled flight
means a flight operation that was not operated, but was listed in an air carrier or a foreign air carrier's computer reservation system within seven calendar days of the scheduled departure.
Certificated air carrier
means a U.S. carrier holding a certificate issued under 49 U.S.C. 41102 to conduct passenger service or holding an exemption to conduct passenger operations under 49 U.S.C. 40109.
Commuter air carrier
means a U.S. carrier that has been found fit under 49 U.S.C. 41738 and is authorized to carry passengers on at least five round trips per week on at least one route between two or more points according to a published flight schedule using small aircraft as defined in 14 CFR 298.2.
Covered carrier
means a certificated carrier, a commuter carrier, or a foreign air carrier operating to, from, or within the United States, conducting scheduled passenger service or public charter service with at least one aircraft having a designed passenger seating capacity of 30 or more seats.
Diverted flight
means a flight which is operated from the scheduled origin point to a point other than the scheduled destination point in the carrier's published schedule. For example, a carrier has a published schedule for a flight from A to B to C. If the carrier were to actually fly an A to C operation, the A to B segment is a diverted flight, and the B to C segment is a cancelled flight. The same would apply if the flight were to operate from A to an airport other than B or C.
Excessive tarmac delay
means a tarmac delay of more than three hours for a domestic flight and more than four hours for an international flight.
Foreign air carrier
means a carrier that is not a citizen of the United States as defined in 49 U.S.C. 40102(a) that holds a foreign air carrier permit issued under 49 U.S.C. 41302 or an exemption issued under 49 U.S.C. 40109 authorizing direct foreign air transportation.
Gate arrival time
is the instant when the pilot sets the aircraft parking brake after arriving at the airport gate or passenger unloading area. If the parking brake is not set, record the time for the opening of the passenger door. Also, for purposes of § 244.3 carriers using a Docking Guidance System (DGS) may record the official “gate-arrival time” when the aircraft is stopped at the appropriate parking mark.
Gate departure time
is the instant when the pilot releases the aircraft parking brake after passengers have boarded and aircraft doors have closed. In cases where the flight returned to the departure gate before wheels-off time and departs a second time, the reportable gate departure time for purposes of this part is the last gate departure time before wheels-off time. In cases of a return to the gate after wheels-off time, the reportable gate departure time is the last gate departure time before the gate return. If passengers were boarded without the parking brake being set, the reportable gate departure time is the time that the last passenger door was closed. Also, the official “gate-departure time” may be based on aircraft movement for carriers using a Docking Guidance System (DGS). For example, one DGS records gate departure time when the aircraft moves more than 1 meter from the appropriate parking mark within 15 seconds. Fifteen seconds is then subtracted from the recorded time to obtain the appropriate “out” time.
Gate Return time
means the time that an aircraft that has left the boarding gate returns to a gate or other position at an airport for the purpose of allowing passengers the opportunity to disembark from the aircraft.
Large hub airport
means an airport that accounts for at least 1.00 percent of the total enplanements in the United States.
Medium hub airport
means an airport accounting for at least 0.25 percent but less than 1.00 percent of the total enplanements in the United States.
Non-hub airport
means an airport with 10,000 or more annual enplanements but less than 0.05 percent of the total enplanements in the United States.
Small hub airport
means an airport accounting for at least 0.05 percent but less than 0.25 percent of the total enplanements in the United States.
Tarmac delay
means the period of time when an aircraft is on the ground with passengers and the passengers have no opportunity to deplane.

§ 244.2
Applicability.
(a)
Covered operations.
Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, this part applies to U.S. certificated air carriers, U.S. commuter air carriers and foreign air carriers that operate passenger service to or from a U.S. airport with at least one aircraft that has an original manufacturer's design capacity of 30 or more seats. Covered carriers must report all passenger operations that experience an excessive tarmac delay at a U.S. airport.
(b)
Exceptions.
(1) For foreign air carriers that operate charter flights from foreign airports to U.S. airports, and return to foreign airports, and do not pick up any new passengers in the United States, the charter flights are not flights subject to the reporting requirements of this part.
(2) For U.S. air carriers whose flights are reported under 14 CFR part 234 (Airline Service Quality Performance Reports), their scheduled domestic flights are not subject to the reporting requirements of this part.
[Docket No. DOT-OST-2019-0144, 86 FR 23269, May 3, 2021]
§ 244.3
Reporting of tarmac delay data.
(a) Each covered carrier shall file BTS Form 244 “Tarmac Delay Report” with the Office of Airline Information of the Department's Bureau of Transportation Statistics setting forth the information for each of its covered
flights that experienced an excessive tarmac delay at a U.S. airport, including diverted flights and cancelled flights on which the passengers were boarded and then deplaned before the cancellation. The reports are due within 15 days after the end of any month during which the carrier experienced the excessive tarmac delay. The reports shall be made in the form and manner set forth in accounting and reporting directives issued by the Director, Office of Airline Information, and shall contain the following information:
(1) Carrier code.
(2) Flight number.
(3) Departure airport (three letter code).
(4) Arrival airport (three letter code).
(5) Date of flight operation (year/month/day).
(6) Gate departure time (actual) in local time.

(12) Longest time away from gate for gate return or canceled flight.
(13) Three letter code of airport where flight diverted.
(14) Wheels-on time at diverted airport.
(15) Total time away from gate at diverted airport.
(16) Longest time away from gate at diverted airport.
(17) Wheels-off time at diverted airport.
(b) Covered carriers that experience an excessive tarmac delay at a U.S. airport and are filing a form under this section must also report the length of the excessive tarmac delay to the Office of Airline Information of the Department's Bureau of Transportation Statistics, if the length of the excessive tarmac delay experienced is not otherwise represented by the data points listed in paragraph (a) of this section (
e.g.,
the pilot sets the aircraft parking brake after arriving at the passenger unloading area, but passengers are not provided an opportunity to deplane at that time).
(c) The same information required by paragraphs (a)(13) through (17) of this section must be provided for each subsequent diverted airport landing.

(c) If any record which must be retained under the provisions of §§ 249.20 and 249.21 is included as an exhibit to another document which must also be retained, the carrier need only keep in its files one copy of the record to satisfy these record retention requirements. In these cases, the carrier shall establish adequate cross-references to assist in locating the record.
(d) The provisions in this part do not excuse noncompliance with requirements of any other governmental body, Federal or State, prescribing longer retention periods for any rec­ords.

§ 249.8
Premature loss or destruction of records.
If records are destroyed or lost before the expiration of the prescribed retention period, a statement shall be prepared and submitted to the Director, Office of Airline Information, which lists, as accurately as possible, the unavailable records and describes the circumstances under which they became unavailable.

Waiver of requirements.
A waiver from any provision of this part may be made by the Director, Office of Airline Information, upon the Director's own initiative or upon submission of a written request by a carrier or group of carriers. Each request for waiver shall demonstrate that unusual circumstances warrant a departure from prescribed retention periods, procedures, or techniques, or that compliance with the prescribed requirements would impose an unreasonable
burden on the carrier, and that granting the waiver would be in the public interest.

§ 250.1
Definitions.
Airport

i.e.
, used) by the passenger.
Alternate transportation
means air transportation with a confirmed reservation at no additional charge, operated by a carrier as defined below, or other transportation accepted and used by the passenger in the case of denied boarding.
Carrier
means: (1) a direct air carrier, except a helicopter operator, holding a certificate issued by the Department of Transportation pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 41102 or that has been found fit to conduct commuter operations under 49 U.S.C. 41738, or an exemption from 49 U.S.C. 41102, authorizing the scheduled transportation of persons; or (2) a foreign air carrier holding a permit issued by the Department pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 41302, or an exemption from that provision, authorizing the scheduled foreign air transportation of persons.
Class of service
means seating in the same cabin class such as First, Business, or Economy class, or in the same seating zone if the carrier has more than one seating product in the same cabin such as Economy and Premium Economy class.
Confirmed reserved space
means space on a specific date and on a specific flight and class of service of a carrier which has been requested by a passenger, including a passenger with a “zero fare ticket,” and which the carrier or its agent has verified, by appropriate notation on the ticket or in any other manner provided therefore by the carrier, as being reserved for the accommodation of the passenger.
Fare

§ 250.2
Applicability.
Except for § 250.7, this part applies to every carrier, as defined in § 250.1, with respect to scheduled flight segments using an aircraft that has a designed passenger capacity of 30 or more passenger seats, operating in interstate air transportation or foreign air transportation with respect to nonstop flight segments originating at a point within the United States. Section 250.7 applies to any air carrier or foreign air carrier as those terms are defined in 49 U.S.C. 40102.
[Doc. No. DOT-OST-2020-0251, 86 FR 2537, Jan. 13, 2021]
§ 250.2a
Policy regarding denied boarding.
In the event of an oversold flight, every carrier shall ensure that the smallest practicable number of persons holding confirmed reserved space on that flight are denied boarding involuntarily.
§ 250.2b
Carriers to request volunteers for denied boarding.
(a) In the event of an oversold flight, every carrier shall request volunteers for denied boarding before using any other boarding priority. A “volunteer” is a person who responds to the carrier's request for volunteers and who willingly accepts the carriers' offer of compensation, in any amount, in exchange for relinquishing the confirmed reserved space. Any other passenger denied boarding is considered for purposes of this part to have been denied boarding involuntarily, even if that passenger accepts the denied boarding compensation.
(b) Every carrier shall advise each passenger solicited to volunteer for denied boarding, no later than the time the carrier solicits that passenger to volunteer, whether he or she is in danger of being involuntarily denied boarding and, if so, the compensation the carrier is obligated to pay if the passenger is involuntarily denied boarding. If an insufficient number of volunteers come forward, the carrier may deny boarding to other passengers in accordance with its boarding priority rules.
(c) If a carrier offers free or reduced rate air transportation as compensation to volunteers, the carrier must disclose all material restrictions, including but not limited to administrative fees, advance purchase or capacity restrictions, and blackout dates applicable to the offer before the passenger decides whether to give up his or her confirmed reserved space on the flight in exchange for the free or reduced rate transportation. If the free or reduced rate air transportation is offered orally to potential volunteers, the carrier shall also orally provide a brief description of the material restrictions on that transportation at the same time that the offer is made.
(d) Carriers must proactively offer to pay compensation to a passenger who is voluntarily or involuntarily denied boarding on an oversold flight, rather than waiting until the passenger requests the compensation.

§ 250.3
Boarding priority rules.
(a) Every carrier shall establish priority rules and criteria for determining which passengers holding confirmed reserved space shall be denied boarding on an oversold flight in the event that an insufficient number of volunteers come forward. Such rules and criteria shall reflect the obligations of the carrier set forth in §§ 250.2a and 250.2b to minimize involuntary denied boarding and to request volunteers, and shall be written in such manner as to be understandable and meaningful to the average passenger. Such rules and criteria shall not make, give, or cause any undue or unreasonable preference or advantage to any particular person or subject any particular person to any unjust or unreasonable prejudice or
disadvantage in any respect whatsoever.
(b) Boarding priority factors may include, but are not limited to, the following:
(1) A passenger's time of check-in;
(2) Whether a passenger has a seat assignment before reaching the departure gate for carriers that assign seats;
(3) The fare paid by a passenger;
(4) A passenger's frequent-flyer status; and
(5) A passenger's disability or status as an unaccompanied minor.

§ 250.5
Amount of denied boarding compensation for passengers denied boarding involuntarily.
(a) Subject to the exceptions provided in § 250.6, a carrier to whom this part applies as described in § 250.2 shall pay compensation in interstate air transportation to passengers who are denied boarding involuntarily from an oversold flight as follows:
(1) No compensation is required if the carrier offers alternate transportation that, at the time the arrangement is made, is planned to arrive at the airport of the passenger's first stopover, or if none, the airport of the passenger's final destination not later than one hour after the planned arrival time of the passenger's original flight;
(2) Compensation shall be at least 200 percent of the fare to the passenger's destination or first stopover, or $775, whichever is lower, if the carrier offers alternate transportation that, at the time the arrangement is made, is planned to arrive at the airport of the passenger's first stopover, or if none, the airport of the passenger's final destination more than one hour but less than two hours after the planned arrival time of the passenger's original flight; and
(3) Compensation shall be at least 400 percent of the fare to the passenger's destination or first stopover, or $1,550, whichever is lower, if the carrier does not offer alternate transportation that, at the time the arrangement is made, is planned to arrive at the airport of the passenger's first stopover, or if none, the airport of the passenger's final destination less than two hours after the planned arrival time of the passenger's original flight.
(b) Subject to the exceptions provided in § 250.6, a carrier to whom this part applies as described in § 250.2 shall pay compensation to passengers in foreign air transportation who are denied boarding involuntarily at a U.S. airport from an oversold flight as follows:
(1) No compensation is required if the carrier offers alternate transportation that, at the time the arrangement is made, is planned to arrive at the airport of the passenger's first stopover, or if not, the airport of the passenger's final destination not later than one hour after the planned arrival time of the passenger's original flight;
(2) Compensation shall be at least 200 percent of the fare to the passenger's destination or first stopover, or $775, whichever is lower, if the carrier offers alternate transportation that, at the time the arrangement is made, is planned to arrive at the airport of the passenger's first stopover, or if not, the airport of the passenger's final destination more than one hour but less than four hours after the planned arrival time of the passenger's original flight; and
(3) Compensation shall be at least 400 percent of the fare to the passenger's destination or first stopover, or $1,550, whichever is lower, if the carrier does not offer alternate transportation that, at the time the arrangement is made, is planned to arrive at the airport of the passenger's first stopover, or if not, the airport of the passenger's final destination less than four hours after the planned arrival time of the passenger's original flight.
(c) Carriers may offer free or reduced rate air transportation in lieu of the cash or check due under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, if—
(1) The value of the transportation benefit offered, excluding any fees or other mandatory charges applicable for using the free or reduced rate air transportation, is equal to or greater than the cash/check payment otherwise required;
(2) The carrier fully informs the passenger of the amount of cash/check compensation that would otherwise be due and that the passenger may decline
the transportation benefit and receive the cash/check payment; and
(3) The carrier fully discloses all material restrictions, including but not limited to, administrative fees, advance purchase or capacity restrictions, and blackout dates applicable to the offer, on the use of such free or reduced rate transportation before the passenger decides to give up the cash/check payment in exchange for such transportation. (See also § 250.9(c)).
(d) The requirements of this section apply to passengers with “zero fare tickets.” The fare paid by these passengers for purposes of calculating denied boarding compensation shall be the lowest cash, check, or credit card payment charged for a ticket in the same class of service on that flight.
(e) The Department of Transportation will review the denied boarding compensation liability limit amounts prescribed in this part every two years except for the first review, which will take place in 2012, to put the reviews specified in this section on the same cycle as the reviews of domestic baggage liability limits specified in 14 CFR 254.6. The Department will use any increase in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) as of July of each review year to calculate the increased denied boarding compensation liability limit amounts. The Department will use the following formula:
(1) Current Denied Boarding Compensation liability limit in paragraph (a)(2) of this section multiplied by (a/b) rounded to the nearest $25 where a = July CPI-U of year of current adjustment and b = the CPI-U figure in August 2011 when the inflation adjustment provision was added to this part.
(2) The Denied Boarding Compensation liability limit in paragraph (a)(3) of this section shall be twice the revised limit for paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
(3) The Denied Boarding Compensation liability limit in paragraph (b)(2) of this section shall be the same as the revised limit for paragraph (a)(2) of this section, and the Denied Boarding Compensation liability limit in paragraph (b)(3) of this section shall be twice the revised limit for paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
(f) In addition to the denied boarding compensation specified in this part, a carrier shall refund all unused ancillary fees for optional services paid by a passenger who is voluntarily or involuntarily denied boarding. The carrier is not required to refund the ancillary fees for services that are provided with respect to the passenger's alternate transportation.
(g) Nothing in this part prohibits carriers from offering denied boarding compensations in an amount more than the amount calculated according to paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section, or more than the denied boarding compensation liability limit amounts effective at the time of denied boarding.

# Compensation for Denied Boarding
If you have been denied a reserved seat on (name of air carrier), you are probably entitled to monetary compensation. This notice explains the airline's obligation and the passenger's rights in the case of an oversold flight, in accordance with regulations of the
U.S. Department of Transportation.

# Volunteers and Boarding Priorities
If a flight is oversold (more passengers hold confirmed reservations than there are seats available), no one may be denied boarding against his or her will until airline personnel first ask for volunteers who will give
up their reservation willingly, in exchange for compensation of the airline's choosing. If there are not enough volunteers, other passengers may be denied boarding involuntarily in accordance with the following boarding priority of (name of air carrier): (In this space the carrier inserts its boarding priority rules or a summary thereof, in a manner to be understandable to the average passenger.)

# Compensation for Involuntary Denied Boarding
If you are denied boarding involuntarily, you are entitled to a payment of “denied boarding compensation” from the airline unless:
(1) you have not fully complied with the airline's ticketing, check-in and reconfirmation requirements, or you are not acceptable for transportation under the airline's usual rules and practices; or
(2) you are denied boarding because the flight is canceled; or
(3) you are denied boarding because a smaller capacity aircraft was substituted for safety or operational reasons; or
(4) on a flight operated with an aircraft having 60 or fewer seats, you are denied boarding due to safety-related weight/balance restrictions that limit payload; or
(5) you are offered accommodations in a section of the aircraft other than specified in your ticket, at no extra charge (a passenger seated in a section for which a lower fare is charged must be given an appropriate refund); or
(6) the airline is able to place you on another flight or flights that are planned to reach your next stopover or final destination within one hour of the planned arrival time of your original flight.

# Amount of Denied Boarding Compensation

# Domestic Transportation
Passengers traveling between points within the United States (including the territories and possessions) who are denied boarding involuntarily from an oversold flight are entitled to: (1) No compensation if the carrier offers alternate transportation that is planned to arrive at the passenger's destination or first stopover not later than one hour after the planned arrival time of the passenger's original flight; (2) at least 200 percent of the fare to the passenger's destination or first stopover, or $775, whichever is lower, if the carrier offers alternate transportation that is planned to arrive at the passenger's destination or first stopover more than one hour but less than two hours after the planned arrival time of the passenger's original flight; and (3) at least 400 percent of the fare to the passenger's destination or first stopover, or $1,550, whichever is lower, if the carrier does not offer alternate transportation that is planned to arrive at the airport of the passenger's destination or first stopover less than two hours after the planned arrival time of the passenger's original flight.
0 to 1 hour arrival delay
No compensation.
1 to 2 hour arrival delay
200% of one-way fare (carriers may limit this amount to $775 if it is higher than $775).*
Over 2 hours arrival delay
400% of one-way fare (carriers may limit this amount to $1,550 if it is higher than $1,550).*
*
Nothing in the Department of Transportation's regulation prohibits carriers from offering denied boarding compensations in an amount more than the amount calculated according to the chart above, or more than the denied boarding compensation liability limit amounts stated in the chart.

# International Transportation
Passengers traveling from the United States to a foreign point who are denied boarding involuntarily from an oversold flight originating at a U.S. airport are entitled to: (1) No compensation if the carrier offers alternate transportation that is planned to arrive at the passenger's destination or first stopover not later than one hour after the planned arrival time of the passenger's original flight; (2) at least 200 percent of the fare to the passenger's destination or first stopover, or $775, whichever is lower, if the carrier offers alternate transportation that is planned to arrive at the passenger's destination or first stopover more than one hour but less than four hours after the planned arrival time of the passenger's original flight; and (3) at least 400 percent of the fare to the passenger's destination or first stopover, or $1,550, whichever is lower, if the carrier does not offer alternate transportation that is planned to arrive at the airport of the passenger's destination or first stopover less than four hours after the planned arrival time of the passenger's original flight.
0 to 1 hour arrival delay
No compensation.
1 to 4 hour arrival delay
200% of one-way fare (carriers may limit this amount to $775 if it is higher than $775).**

**
Nothing in the Department of Transportation's regulation prohibits carriers from offering denied boarding compensations in an amount more than the amount calculated according to the chart above, or more than the denied boarding compensation liability limit amounts stated in the chart.

# Alternate Transportation
“Alternate transportation” is air transportation with a confirmed reservation at no additional charge (by any scheduled airline licensed by DOT), or other transportation accepted and used by the passenger in the case of denied boarding.

# Method of Payment
Except as provided below, the airline must give each passenger who qualifies for involuntary denied boarding compensation a payment by cash or check for the amount specified above, on the day and at the place the involuntary denied boarding occurs. If the airline arranges alternate transportation for the passenger's convenience that departs before the payment can be made, the payment shall be sent to the passenger within 24 hours. The air carrier may offer free or discounted transportation in place of the cash payment. In that event, the carrier must disclose all material restrictions on the use of the free or discounted transportation before the passenger decides whether to accept the transportation in lieu of a cash or check payment. The passenger may insist on the cash/check payment or refuse all compensation and bring private legal action.

# Passenger's Options
Acceptance of the compensation may relieve (name of air carrier) from any further liability to the passenger caused by its failure to honor the confirmed reservation. However, the passenger may decline the payment and seek to recover damages in a court of law or in some other manner.
(c) In addition to furnishing passengers with the carrier's written statement as specified in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, if the carrier orally advises involuntarily bumped passengers that they are entitled to receive free or discounted transportation as denied boarding compensation, the carrier must also orally advise the passengers of any material restrictions or conditions applicable to the free or discounted transportation and that they are entitled to choose a check instead (or cash if that option is offered by the carrier).

# Notice—Overbooking of Flights
Airline flights may be overbooked, and there is a slight chance that a seat will not be available on a flight for which a person has a confirmed reservation. If the flight is overbooked, no one will be denied a seat until airline personnel first ask for volunteers willing to give up their reservation in exchange for compensation of the airline's choosing. If there are not enough volunteers, the airline will deny boarding to other persons in accordance with its particular boarding priority. With few exceptions, including failure to comply with the carrier's check-in deadline (carrier shall insert either “of _ minutes prior to each flight segment” or “(which are available upon request from the air carrier)” here), persons denied boarding involuntarily are entitled to compensation. The complete rules for the payment of compensation and each airline's boarding priorities are available at all airport ticket counters and boarding locations. Some airlines do not apply these consumer protections to travel from some foreign countries, although other consumer protections may be available. Check with your airline or your travel agent.
(b) Every carrier shall include with each ticket sold in the United States the notices set forth in paragraph (a) of this section, printed in at least 12-point type. The notice may be printed on a separate piece of paper, on the ticket stock, or on the ticket envelope. The last two sentences of the notice shall be printed in a type face contrasting with that of the rest of the notice.
(c) It shall be the responsibility of each carrier to ensure that travel agents authorized to sell air transportation for that carrier comply with the notice provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.
(d) [Reserved]
(e) Any air carrier or foreign air carrier engaged in foreign air transportation that complies fully with this part for inbound traffic to the United States need not use the last two sentences of the notices required by paragraph (a) of this subsection.

Docket No. DOT-OST-2014-0056, 81 FR 76828, Nov. 3, 2016, unless otherwise noted.
§ 256.1
Purpose.
(a) The purpose of this part is to set forth requirements for the display of flight options by electronic airline information systems that provide air carrier or foreign air carrier schedule, fare, or availability information, including, but not limited to, global distribution systems (GDSs), corporate booking tools, and internet flight search tools, for use by consumers, carriers, ticket agents, and other business entities so as to prevent unfair or deceptive practices in the distribution and sale of air transportation.
(b) Nothing in this part exempts any person from the operation of the antitrust laws set forth in subsection (a) of the first section of the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. 12).
§ 256.2
Applicability.
(a) This part applies to any air carrier, foreign air carrier, or ticket agent
that operates an electronic airline information system,
e.g.,
GDS, corporate booking tool, or internet flight search tool, that combines the schedules, fares or availability information of more than one air carrier or foreign air carrier for the distribution or sale in the United States of interstate or foreign air transportation.
(b) This part applies only if the electronic airline information system is displayed on a Web site marketed to consumers in the United States or on a proprietary display available to travel agents, business entities, or a limited segment of consumers of air transportation in the United States.
§ 256.3
Definitions.
For purposes of this part:
Availability
means information provided in displays with respect to the ability to make a reservation on a particular flight.
Display
means the presentation of air carrier or foreign air carrier schedules, fares, or availability to a consumer or agent or other individual involved in arranging air travel for a consumer by means of a computer or mobile electronic device.
Electronic airline information system or EAIS
means a system that combines air carrier or foreign air carrier schedule, fare, or availability information for transmission or display to air carriers or foreign air carriers, ticket agents, other business entities, or consumers.
Integrated display
means any display that includes the schedules, fares or availability of more than one listed carrier.
§ 256.4
Prohibition on undisclosed display bias.
Each air carrier, foreign air carrier, and ticket agent that operates an EAIS must comply with the requirements of this section.
(a) Each EAIS that uses any factor, not based on user selection or corporate contract travel arrangement, directly or indirectly relating to carrier identity in ordering the information contained in an integrated display must clearly disclose as provided for in § 256.5 that the identity of the carrier is a factor in the order in which information is displayed.
(b) An EAIS's integrated display must not give any carrier's flights a system-imposed preference over any other carrier's flights in that market based on carrier identity unless the preference is prominently disclosed as provided for in § 256.5.
(c) Each EAIS must display information in an objective manner based on search criteria selected by the user (
e.g.,
lowest fare, lowest total cost, date and time of travel, class of service, stopovers, total elapsed time or duration of travel, number of stops, limitations on carriers to be used, particular airport(s), number of passengers, etc.) When providing information in response to a search by a user of the EAIS, the EAIS must order the information provided so that the flight options that best satisfy the parameters of the user-selected search criteria are displayed conspicuously and no less prominently (
e.g.,
in the same or larger font size and the same or more noticeable font color) than any other flight option displayed. Flight options may be presented in sequence, matrix, or other formats, but the flight options that best satisfy the parameters of the user-selected search criteria must be ranked in lists above other flight options, or identified more prominently than other flight options in a matrix or other format. This does not preclude systems from setting default display parameters that are not deceptive or offering users the option to choose a variety of display methods within those parameters.
§ 256.5
Minimum disclosure requirements for biased displays.
To the extent an EAIS engages in display bias based on carrier identity, it must clearly and conspicuously disclose that fact at the top of each search result display presented to the user in response to the user-selected search criteria. The notice must state that the flights are not displayed in neutral order and that certain airlines' fare, schedule or availability information is given preferential treatment in how it is displayed.
§ 256.6
No requirement to provide access to systems.
Nothing in this section requires an air carrier, foreign air carrier, or ticket agent to allow a system to access its internal computer reservation system or to permit “screen scraping” or “content scraping” of its Web site; nor does it require an air carrier or foreign air carrier to permit the marketing or sale of the carrier's services through any ticket agent or other carrier's system. “Screen scraping” as used in this paragraph refers to a process whereby a company uses computer software techniques to extract information from other companies' Web sites without permission from the company operating the targeted Web site.

§ 257.4
Unfair and deceptive practice.
The holding out or sale of scheduled passenger air transportation involving a code-sharing arrangement or long-term wet lease is prohibited as unfair and deceptive in violation of 49 U.S.C. 41712 unless, in conjunction with such holding out or sale, carriers and ticket agents follow the requirements of this part.
§ 257.5
Notice requirement.
(a)
Notice in flight itineraries and schedules.
Each air carrier, foreign air
carrier, or ticket agent providing flight itineraries and/or schedules for scheduled passenger air transportation to the public in the United States and to the Official Airline Guides and comparable publications, and, where applicable, computer reservation systems, shall ensure that each flight on which the designator code is not that of the operating carrier is clearly and prominently identified and contains the following disclosures. If there is more than one operating carrier for a particular flight (
e.g.,
change of gauge), the required disclosures shall be made for each flight segment where the designator code is not that of the operating carrier.
(1) In flight schedule information provided by an air carrier, foreign air carrier, or ticket agent to U.S. consumers on desktop browser-based Web sites or applications in response to any requested itinerary search, for each flight in scheduled passenger air transportation that is operated by a carrier other than the one listed for that flight, the corporate name of the transporting carrier and any other name under which the service is held out to the public must appear prominently in text format, with font size not smaller than the font size of the flight itinerary itself, on the first display following the input of a search query, immediately adjacent to each code-share flight in that search-results list. Roll-over, pop-up and linked disclosures do not comply with this paragraph.
(2) In flight schedule information provided by an air carrier, foreign air carrier, or ticket agent to U.S. consumers on mobile browser-based Web sites or applications in response to any requested itinerary search, for each flight in scheduled passenger air transportation that is operated by a carrier other than the one listed for that flight, the corporate name of the transporting carrier must appear prominently in text format, with font size not smaller than the font size of the flight itinerary itself, on the first display following the input of a search query, immediately adjacent to each code-share flight in that search-results list. Roll-over, pop-up and linked disclosures do not comply with this paragraph.
(3) For static written schedules, each flight in scheduled passenger air transportation that is operated by a carrier other than the one listed for that flight shall be identified by an asterisk or other easily identifiable mark that leads to disclosure of the corporate name of the operating carrier and any other name under which that service is held out to the public.
(4) Each air carrier and foreign air carrier that provides flight schedule information to any computer reservation system or global distribution system that receives and distributes the U.S. or foreign carrier's fare, schedule, or availability information shall ensure that each flight on which the designator code is not that of the operating carrier is clearly and prominently identified and the corporate name of the transporting carrier and any other name under which the service is held out to the public appears prominently in text format, with font size that is not smaller than the font size of the flight itinerary itself, immediately adjacent to each code-share flight in that search-results list.
(b)
Notice in oral communications with prospective consumers.
In any direct oral communication in the United States with a prospective consumer, and in any telephone call placed from the United States by a prospective consumer, concerning a flight within, to, or from the United States that is part of a code-sharing arrangement or long-term wet lease, a ticket agent doing business in the United States or a carrier shall inform the consumer, the first time that such a flight is offered to the consumer, or, if no such offer was made, the first time a consumer inquires about such a flight, that the operating carrier is not the carrier whose name or designator code will appear on the ticket and shall identify the transporting carrier by its corporate name and any other name under which that service is held out to the public.
(c)
Notice in ticket confirmations.
At the time of purchase, each selling carrier or ticket agent shall provide written disclosure of the actual operator of the flight to each consumer of scheduled passenger air transportation sold in the United States that involves a
code-sharing arrangement or long-term wet lease. For any flight on which the designator code is not that of the operating carrier the notice shall state “Operated by” followed by the corporate name of the transporting carrier and any other name in which that service is held out to the public. The following form of statement will satisfy the requirement of this paragraph:
Important Notice: Service between XYZ City and ABC City will be operated by Jane Doe Airlines d/b/a QRS Express.
At the purchaser's request, the notice required by this part may be delivered in person, or by fax, electronic mail, or any other reliable method of transmitting written material.
(d) In any written advertisement distributed in or mailed to or from the United States (including those that appear on an internet Web site that is marketed to consumers in the United States) for service in a city-pair market that is provided under a code-sharing arrangement or long-term wet lease, the advertisement shall prominently disclose that the advertised service may involve travel on another carrier and clearly indicate the nature of the service in reasonably sized type and shall identify all potential operating carriers involved in the markets being advertised by corporate name and by any other name under which that service is held out to the public. In any radio or television advertisement broadcast in the United States for service in a city-pair market that is provided under a code-sharing or long-term wet lease, the advertisement shall include at least a generic disclosure statement, such as “Some flights are operated by other airlines.”

§ 259.4
Contingency Plan for Lengthy Tarmac Delays.
(a)
Adoption of plan.
Each covered carrier, as defined by § 259.3, shall adopt a Contingency Plan for Lengthy Tarmac Delays for its scheduled and public charter flights at each U.S. large hub airport, medium hub airport, small hub airport, and non-hub airport at which it operates or markets such air service, except as specified in § 259.2, and shall adhere to its plan's terms.
(b)
Contents of plan.
Each Contingency Plan for Lengthy Tarmac Delays shall include, at a minimum, assurances that the covered carrier shall comply with the requirements set forth in paragraph (c) of this section.
(c)
Requirements.
Covered carriers must comply with the following requirements:
(1) For all domestic flights, each covered U.S. air carrier shall provide a passenger on a flight experiencing a tarmac delay at a U.S. airport the opportunity to deplane before the tarmac delay exceeds three hours in duration, subject to the exceptions in paragraph (c)(3) of this section;
(2) For all international flights, each covered carrier shall provide a passenger on a flight experiencing a tarmac delay at a U.S. airport the opportunity to deplane before the tarmac delay exceeds four hours in duration, subject to the exceptions in paragraph (c)(3) of this section;
(3) A covered U.S. carrier that experiences a tarmac delay at a U.S. airport must comply with paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section, and a covered foreign air carrier must comply with paragraph (c)(2) of this section, unless:
(i) For departing flights, the flight begins to return to a suitable disembarkation point no later than three hours (for domestic flights) or four hours (for international flights) after the main aircraft door is closed in order to deplane passengers. If the aircraft is in an area that is not under the carrier's control, the aircraft has begun to return to a suitable disembarkation point when a request is made to the Federal Aviation Administration control tower, airport authority, or other relevant authority directing the aircraft's operations. If the aircraft is in an area that is under the carrier's control, the aircraft has begun to return to a suitable disembarkation point when the pilot begins maneuvering the aircraft to a suitable disembarkation point;
(ii) The pilot-in-command determines that deplaning passengers at a suitable disembarkation point would jeopardize passenger safety or security, or there is a safety related or security related reason why the aircraft cannot leave its position on the tarmac to deplane passengers; or
(iii) Air traffic control advises the pilot-in-command that returning to a suitable disembarkation point to deplane passengers would significantly disrupt airport operations;
(4) For all flights during a tarmac delay, each covered carrier must provide adequate food and potable water no later than two hours after the start of the tarmac delay, unless the pilot-in-command determines that safety or security considerations preclude such service;
(5) For all flights, each covered carrier must ensure operable lavatory facilities, as well as adequate medical attention if needed, during a tarmac delay;
(6) For all flights, each covered carrier must notify the passengers on board the aircraft during a tarmac delay regarding the status of the delay when the tarmac delay exceeds 30 minutes, and thereafter each covered carrier may provide subsequent updates, including flight status changes, as the carrier deems appropriate;
(7) For all departing flights and diversions, each time the opportunity to deplane exists at a suitable disembarkation point, each covered carrier must timely notify the passengers on board the aircraft that the passengers have the opportunity to deplane;
(8) Each covered carrier must ensure that it has sufficient resources to implement its Contingency Plan for Lengthy Tarmac Delays, as set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section; and
(9) Each covered carrier must ensure that its Contingency Plan for Lengthy Tarmac Delays, as set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, has been coordinated with the following entities:
(i) Airport authorities (including terminal facility operators where applicable) at each U.S. large hub airport, medium hub airport, small hub airport, and non-hub airport that the carrier serves, as well as its regular U.S. diversion airports;
(ii) U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) at each large U.S. hub airport, medium hub airport, small hub airport, and non-hub airport that is regularly used for that carrier's international flights, including regular U.S. diversion airports; and
(iii) The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) at each U.S. large hub airport, medium hub airport, small hub airport, and non-hub airport that the carrier serves, including regular U.S. diversion airports.
(d)
Diversions.
For purposes of this section, a diverted flight is treated as an arriving flight up to the point that an opportunity to deplane is provided to passengers. Once an opportunity to deplane is provided, the diversion is treated as a departing flight, and after that point, the departure delay exception in paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section applies if the carrier begins to return to a suitable disembarkation point in order to deplane passengers as required by the exception.
(e)
Code-share responsibility.
The tarmac delay contingency plan of the carrier under whose code the service is marketed governs, if different from the operating carrier, unless the marketing carrier specifies in its contract of carriage that the operating carrier's plan governs.
(f)
Amendment of plan.
At any time, a carrier may amend its Contingency Plan for Lengthy Tarmac Delays to decrease the time for aircraft to remain on the tarmac for domestic flights covered in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, for aircraft to remain on the tarmac for international flights covered in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, for aircraft to begin to return to a suitable disembarkation point covered in paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section, and for providing food and water covered in paragraph (c)(4) of this section. A carrier may also amend its plan to increase these intervals (up to the limits in this part), in which case the amended plan shall apply only to departures that are first offered for sale after the plan's amendment.
(g)
Written reports.
(1) Each covered operating carrier subject to this part shall submit to the Office of Aviation Consumer Protection of the U.S. Department of Transportation a written description of each of the flights it operates that experiences a tarmac delay of more than three hours (on domestic flights) and more than four hours (on international flights) at a U.S. airport no later than 30 days after the tarmac delay occurs.
(2) The written description referenced in paragraph (g)(1) of this section shall include, at a minimum, the following information:
(i) The name of the operating carrier, the name of the marketing carrier if the operating carrier is not the marketing carrier, and the flight number;
(ii) The originally scheduled origin and destination airports of the flight;
(iii) The airport at which the tarmac delay occurred and the date it occurred;
(iv) The length of the tarmac delay that occurred; and
(v) An explanation of the incident, including the precise cause of the
tarmac delay, the actions taken to minimize hardships for passengers (including the provision of food and water, the maintenance and servicing of lavatories, and medical assistance), and the resolution of the incident.
(3) The written description referenced in paragraph (g)(1) of this section shall be accompanied by a signed certification statement that reads as follows:
I, (Name) and (Title), of (Carrier Name), certify that the enclosed report has been prepared under my direction, and affirm that, to the best of my knowledge and belief, the report is true and correct, based on information available at the time of this report's submission.
Date:

Email address and phone number:
(4) A U.S. air carrier that submits a report in accordance with paragraph (g) of this section is in compliance with the reporting mandate for U.S. air carriers in 49 U.S.C. 42301(h) with respect to the excessive tarmac delay reported.
(h)
Unfair and deceptive practice.
A carrier's failure to comply with the assurances required by this part and contained in its Contingency Plan for Lengthy Tarmac Delays will be considered to be an unfair and deceptive practice within the meaning of 49 U.S.C. 41712 that is subject to enforcement action by the Department.

(5) Providing prompt refunds in the original form of payment (
i.e.,
money is returned to an individual using whatever payment method the individual used to make the original payment, such as a check, credit card, debit card, cash, or airline miles) when ticket or ancillary service fee refunds, including checked bag fee refunds, are due pursuant to 14 CFR part 260 unless the consumer agrees to receive the refunds in a different form of payment that is a cash equivalent payment as defined in 14 CFR 260.2. Carriers may not retain a processing fee for issuing refunds that are due;
(6) Disclosing that consumers are entitled to a refund if that is the case when offering alternative transportation, travel credits, vouchers, or other compensation in lieu of refunds consistent with the requirement in 14 CFR 260.7.

§ 260.2
Definitions.
As used in this part:
Air carrier
means a citizen of the United States undertaking by any means, directly or indirectly, to provide air transportation.
Ancillary service
means any optional service related to air travel that a covered carrier provides for a fee, beyond passenger air transportation. Such services may include, but are not limited to, transport of checked or carry-on baggage, advance seat selection, access to in-flight entertainment programs or Wi-Fi, in-flight beverages, snacks, meals, pillows and blankets, seat upgrades, and lounge access.
Automatic refund
means issuing a refund to a consumer without waiting to receive an explicit refund request, when the consumer's right to a refund is undisputed because the contracted service was not provided and either the consumer rejected the alternative offered or no alternative was offered.
Break in journey
means any deliberate interruption by a passenger of a journey between a point in the United States and a point in a foreign country where there is a stopover at a foreign point scheduled to exceed 24 hours. If the stopover is 24 hours or less, whether it is a break in journey depends on various factors such as whether the segment between two foreign points and the segment between a foreign point and the United States were purchased in a single transaction and as a single ticket/itinerary, whether the segment between two foreign points is operated or marketed by a carrier that has no codeshare or interline agreement with the carrier operating or marketing the segment to or from the United States, and whether the stopover at a foreign point involves the passenger picking up checked baggage, leaving the airport, and continuing the next segment after a substantial amount of time.
Business days
means Monday through Friday, excluding Federal holidays in the United States.
Cancelled flight
or
flight cancellation
means a covered flight with a specific flight number scheduled to be operated between a specific origin-destination city pair that was published in the carrier's Computer Reservation System at the time of the ticket sale but not operated by the carrier.
Cash equivalent
means a form of payment that can be used like cash, including but not limited to a check, a prepaid card, funds transferred to a consumer's bank account, funds provided through digital payment methods (
e.g.,
PayPal, Venmo), or a gift card that is widely accepted in commerce. It is not cash equivalent if consumers bear the burden for transaction, maintenance, or usage fees related to the payment.
Checked bag
means a bag, special item (
e.g.,
musical instrument or a pet), or sports equipment (
e.g.,
golf clubs) that was provided to a covered carrier by or on behalf of a passenger for transportation in the cargo compartment of a scheduled passenger flight. A checked bag includes a gate-checked bag and a valet bag.
Class of service
means seating in the same cabin class such as First, Business, Premium Economy, or Economy
class, which is defined based on seat location in the aircraft and seat characteristics such as width, seat recline angles, or pitch (including the amount of legroom).
Covered carrier
means an air carrier or a foreign air carrier operating to, from, or within the United States, conducting scheduled passenger service.
Covered flight
means a scheduled flight operated or marketed by a covered carrier to, from, or within the United States, including itineraries with brief and incidental stopover(s) at a foreign point without a break in journey.
Foreign air carrier
means a person, not a citizen of the United States, undertaking by any means, directly or indirectly, to provide foreign air transportation.

[DOT-OST-2022-0089 and DOT-OST-2016-0208, 89 FR 32832, Apr. 26, 2024, as amended by DOT-OST-2022-0089, 89 FR 65536, Aug. 12, 2024]
§ 260.3
Applicability.
This part applies to: covered carriers that are the merchants of record; covered carriers that operate the flight or, for multiple-carrier itineraries, covered carriers that operate the last segment of a flight where a ticket agent is the merchant of record for a checked bag fee; and covered carriers that fail to provide an ancillary service (other than checked bag service) for which the
consumer paid where a ticket agent is the merchant of record for an ancillary service fee other than checked bag fee.
§ 260.4
Refunding fees for ancillary services that consumers paid for but that were not provided.
(a) A covered carrier that is the merchant of record shall provide a prompt and automatic refund to a consumer for any fees it collected from the consumer for ancillary services if the service was not provided through no fault of the consumer (
e.g.,
prepaid ancillary service not utilized by the consumer because of flight cancellation, significant change, or oversale situation; service not provided because of aircraft substitution, equipment malfunction, etc.). If a ticket agent is the merchant of record for a checked bag fee and the checked bag service was not provided (or was significantly delayed) through no fault of the consumer, the carrier that operated the flight, or for multiple-carrier itineraries, the carrier that operated the last segment of the consumer's itinerary is responsible for providing a prompt and automatic refund of the checked bag fee, consistent with § 260.5. If a ticket agent is the merchant of record for fees for all other ancillary services, the carrier that operated the flight and failed to provide the service through no fault of the consumer is responsible for providing a prompt and automatic refund.
(b) In situations where the ancillary service the consumer paid for (other than the service of transporting a checked bag) is not available for all the passengers who paid for that service (
e.g.,
Wi-Fi not available for all passengers on a flight, lounge access not available for all passengers on a certain date), a carrier's obligation under paragraph (a) of this section to provide a prompt and automatic refund begins when the information about the unavailability of the service is known by the carrier that failed to provide the service, and, if applicable, relayed as provided in paragraph (d) of this section to the carrier responsible for providing a prompt refund as specified in paragraph (a) of this section.
(c) In situations where the ancillary service the consumer paid for (other than the service of transporting a checked bag) is not available to an individual or several individuals, rather than to all the passengers who paid for that service, a carrier's obligation under paragraph (a) of this section to provide a prompt and automatic refund begins when the consumer affected by the service failure notifies the operating carrier that failed to provide the ancillary service about the unavailability of the service and that information has been confirmed and, if applicable, relayed as provided in paragraph (d) of this section to the carrier responsible for providing a prompt refund as specified in paragraph (a) of this section. Notification of the unavailability of the ancillary service by a consumer is considered a request for a refund.
(d) In situations where a carrier is the merchant of record for a fee for an ancillary service and the carrier that operates the flight where the ancillary service was not provided are different entities, the operating carrier that failed to provide the ancillary service must timely notify the carrier that is the merchant of record about the unavailability of the ancillary service. Notification by the operating carrier as set forth in this paragraph is necessary for the obligation to provide a prompt refund of ancillary service fees in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section to apply. The obligation set forth in this paragraph for the operating carrier to timely notify the carrier that is the merchant of record does not apply when the failure to provide service relates to transporting checked bags. Timely notification requirements pertaining to refunds for fees charged to transport checked bags are set forth in § 260.5(c).
§ 260.5
Refunding fees for significantly delayed or lost bags.
A covered carrier that is the merchant of record or, if a ticket agent is the merchant of record, the covered carrier that operated the flight or the last flight segment in a multiple-carrier itinerary, must provide a prompt refund to a consumer of any fee charged for transporting a lost bag or a significantly delayed checked bag, as defined in § 260.2 of this part and determined according to paragraph (a) of this section, subject to the conditions
in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.
(a)
Determining the length of delay for the bag.
For the purpose of determining whether a checked bag is significantly delayed as defined in § 260.2, the length of delay is calculated from the time the passenger is given the opportunity to deplane from a flight at the passenger's final destination airport (the beginning of the delay) to the time that the carrier has delivered the bag to a location agreed upon by the passenger and carrier (
e.g.,
passenger's home or hotel) or the time that the bag has been picked up by the passenger or another person acting on behalf of the passenger at the passenger's final destination airport (the end of the delay).
(b)
Notification by passenger about lost or significantly delayed bag.
A covered carrier does not have an obligation to provide a refund of the fee for a lost or significantly delayed checked bag unless a passenger files a Mishandled Baggage Report (MBR) for the lost or delayed bag with the carrier that operated the flight, or for multiple-carrier itineraries, the carrier that operated the last segment of the consumer's itinerary.
(c)
Notification by carrier that received an MBR about lost or significantly delayed checked bag.
Except when the carrier responsible for providing a prompt refund for a baggage fee as specified in this section is the same carrier that received the MBR, a covered carrier that received the MBR must timely notify the carrier responsible for providing a prompt refund that the bag has been lost or significantly delayed when this is the case. A covered carrier's obligation to provide a prompt refund of a baggage fee for a lost bag or a significantly delayed checked bag as defined in § 260.2 is conditioned upon the carrier that received the MBR notifying the carrier responsible for providing a prompt refund that the bag has been lost or significantly delayed.
(d)
Automatic refunds.
An automatic refund of a bag fee is due when a checked bag is significantly delayed as determined according to paragraph (a) of this section, the passenger has filed an MBR as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, and, if applicable, notification has been provided by the carrier that received the MBR as set forth in paragraph (c) of this section.
(e)
Amount of the refund.
The amount of the refund issued to a consumer must be a value equal to or greater than the fee that the consumer paid to transport his/her checked bag.
(1) For carriers that adopt an escalated baggage fee scale for multiple bags checked by one passenger, the amount of baggage fee refund issued to the passenger can be determined based on the unique identifier assigned to the significantly delayed or lost bag that correlates to the baggage fee charged for that bag at the time of checking. If there is no such unique identifier assigned, carriers must refund the highest per bag fee or fees charged for the multiple bags.
(2) For a carrier that offers a baggage fee subscription program where consumers can pay a subscription fee that covers fees for checked bags for a specified period, the carrier must refund the lowest amount of the baggage fee the carrier charges another passenger of similar frequent flyer status and in the same class of service without the subscription when a passenger subscribing to the program has a significantly delayed or lost bag.
(f)
Exemptions from the refund obligation.
A covered carrier is exempted from the obligation to refund the fee for a significantly delayed bag in situations where the delay resulted from:
(1) A passenger's failure to pick up and recheck a bag at the first international entry point into the United States as required by U.S. Customs and Border Protection;
(2) A passenger's failure to pick up a checked bag that arrived on time at the passenger's ticketed final destination due to the fault of the passenger if documented by the carrier (
e.g.,
passenger ended the travel before reaching the final destination on the itinerary—“hidden city” itinerary, or the passenger failed to pick up the bag before taking a flight on a separate itinerary); and
(3) A passenger's voluntary agreement to travel without the checked bag on the same flight as described in paragraph (g) of this section.
(g)
Voluntary separation from bag.
A carrier may require a passenger who
fails to meet the minimum check-in time requirement for a flight or is a standby passenger for a flight (
i.e.,
a passenger who lacks a reservation on that flight and is waiting at the gate for a seat to be available on the flight) to agree to a new baggage delivery date and location in situations where the carrier is unable to place the passenger's checked bag on that flight because of the limited time available. The carrier must not require the passenger to waive the right to a refund of bag fees if the bag is lost, the right to compensation for damaged, lost, or pilfered bags, or the right to incidental expenses reimbursement arising from delayed bags beyond the agreed upon delivery date, consistent with the Department's regulation in 14 CFR part 254 and applicable international treaties.
§ 260.6
Refunding fare for flights cancelled or significantly delayed or changed by carriers.
(a)
Carriers' obligation to provide refunds
—(1)
Carriers' obligation.
A covered carrier that is the merchant of record must provide a full and prompt refund of the airfare, including any taxes and ancillary fees, as set forth in paragraph (a)(2) of this section to a consumer that holds a nonrefundable ticket on a scheduled flight to, from, or within the United States for any cancelled flight or significantly delayed or changed flight where the consumer chooses not to:
(i) Fly on the significantly delayed or changed flight or accept rebooking on an alternative flight; or
(ii) Accept any voucher, credit, or other form of compensation offered by the air carrier or foreign air carrier pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section.
(2)
Automatic refunds.
A full refund of the airfare, including any taxes and ancillary fees, is due to a consumer as described in paragraphs (a)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section:
(i) A flight is canceled and a consumer is not offered an alternative flight or any voucher, credit, or other form of compensation by the air carrier or foreign air carrier pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section;
(ii) A consumer rejects the significantly delayed or changed flight, rebooking on an alternative flight, or any voucher, credit, or other form of compensation offered by the covered carrier pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section; or
(iii) A consumer does not respond to an offer of:
(A) A significantly delayed or changed flight or an alternative flight and the flight departs without the consumer; or
(B) A voucher, credit, or other form of compensation by the date on which the cancelled flight was scheduled to depart or the date that the significantly delayed or changed flight departs.
(b)
Individuals with a disability.
A carrier that is the merchant of record must provide a full and prompt refund to an individual with a disability upon notification by the individual with a disability that he/she does not want to continue travel because of the significant changes described in paragraphs (b)(1) through (3) of this section. The covered carrier must also provide a full and prompt refund to any individuals in the same reservation as the individual with a disability who do not want to continue travel without the individual with a disability in situations described in paragraphs (b)(1) through (3).
(1) The individual with a disability is downgraded to a lower class of service that results in one or more accessibility features needed by the individual becoming unavailable.
(2) The individual with a disability is scheduled to travel through one or more connecting airports that are different from the original itinerary.
(3) The individual with a disability is scheduled to travel on a substitute aircraft on which one or more accessibility features available on the original aircraft needed by the individual are unavailable.
(c)
Alternative to refund.
A covered carrier may offer a voucher, credit, or other form of compensation as an explicit alternative to providing a refund required by paragraph (a) of this section if:
(1) The offer includes a clear and conspicuous notice of—
(i) The terms of the offer as specified in § 260.8; and
(ii) The consumer's right to a full refund under this section.
(2) The voucher, credit, or other form of compensation offered explicitly as an alternative to providing a refund required by paragraph (a) of this section remains valid and redeemable by the consumer for a period of at least five years from the date on which such voucher, credit, or other form of compensation is issued;
(3) Upon the issuance of such voucher, credit, or other form of compensation, a covered carrier notifies the recipient of the expiration date of the voucher, credit, or other form of compensation; and
(4) Upon request by an individual who self identifies as an individual with a disability a covered carrier provides a notification under paragraph (c)(3) of this section in an electronic format accessible to the recipient.
(d)
Carriers' obligation to notify ticket agents.
In situations where a ticket agent is the merchant of record for the transaction, after receiving a refund request by a consumer through the ticket agent, the carrier that canceled or significantly delayed or changed the flight must inform the ticket agent without delay whether the consumer is eligible for a refund under this section (
i.e.,
whether the consumer has accepted the significantly changed flight, the alternative flight, or other compensation offered in lieu of refunds).
(e)
Carriers' obligation to transfer funds to ticket agents.
In situations where a ticket agent is responsible for providing the refund to the consumer pursuant to 14 CFR 399.80(l) and the ticket agent does not possess the funds of the consumer, that carrier that has the funds must promptly transfer the funds to the ticket agent.
[DOT-OST-2022-0089, 89 FR 65537, Aug. 12, 2024]
§ 260.7
Affirmative acceptance of an offer of alternative compensation.
A covered carrier must not deem a consumer to have accepted an offer for travel credits, vouchers, or other compensation in lieu of a refund under § 260.6(c) unless the consumer affirmatively agrees to the alternative form of compensation.
[DOT-OST-2022-0089, 89 FR 65537, Aug. 12, 2024]
§ 260.8
Disclosing material restrictions, conditions, or limitations.
In carrying out the requirements of § 260.6(c), a covered carrier must clearly and conspicuously disclose, no later than at the time of voucher or credit offer, any material restrictions, limitations, or conditions on travel credits, vouchers, or other compensation, including but not limited to validity period, advance purchase requirement, capacity restrictions, and blackout dates, regardless of whether consumers are entitled to a refund.
[DOT-OST-2022-0089, 89 FR 65537, Aug. 12, 2024]
§ 260.9
Notification to consumers.
(a) Upon the occurrence of a flight cancellation or a significant delay or change, a covered carrier must timely notify affected consumers about the cancellation or significant delay or change, and the information relating to any alternative to refund as provided in § 260.6(c).
(b) Covered air carriers must ensure that their passenger notification systems notify passengers owed a refund pursuant to § 260.6(a) and (b) of their right to receive a refund. Covered carriers that provide notification subscription services to passengers must ensure notifications under this paragraph be provided through media that the carriers offer and the subscribers choose, including emails, text messages, and push notices from mobile apps.
[DOT-OST-2022-0089, 89 FR 65538, Aug. 12, 2024]
§ 260.10
Providing prompt refunds.
When a refund of a fare or a fee for an ancillary service, including a fee for lost or significantly delayed checked baggage, is due pursuant to this part, the refund must be issued promptly in the original form of payment (
i.e.,
money is returned to an individual using whatever payment method the individual used to make the original payment, such as a check, credit card,
debit card, cash, or airline miles) unless the consumer agrees to receive the refunds in a different form of payment that is a cash equivalent as defined in § 260.2. Carriers may not retain a processing fee for issuing refunds that are due.

§ 262.1
Purpose.
The purpose of this part is to ensure that carriers provide travel credits or vouchers, upon request, to consumers who are restricted or prohibited from traveling by a governmental entity due to a serious communicable disease (
e.g.,
as a result of a stay at home order, entry restriction, or border closure) or are advised by a licensed treating medical professional consistent with public health guidance issued by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) or the World Health Organization (WHO) not to travel to protect themselves or others from a serious communicable disease.
§ 262.2
Definitions.
As used in this part:
Air carrier
means a citizen of the United States undertaking by any means, directly or indirectly, to provide air transportation.
Break in journey
means any deliberate interruption by a passenger of a journey between a point in the United States and a point in a foreign country where there is a stopover at a foreign point scheduled to exceed 24 hours. If the stopover is 24 hours or less, whether it is a break in journey depends on various factors such as whether the segment between two foreign points and the segment between a foreign point and the United States were purchased in a single transaction and as a single ticket/itinerary, whether the segment between two foreign points is operated or marketed by a carrier that has no codeshare or interline agreement with the carrier operating or marketing the segment to or from the United States, and whether the stopover at a foreign point involves the passenger picking up checked baggage, leaving the airport, and continuing the next segment after a substantial amount of time.
Covered carrier
means an air carrier or a foreign air carrier operating to, from or within the United States, conducting scheduled passenger service.
Covered flight
means a scheduled flight operated or marketed by a covered carrier to, from, or within the United States, including itineraries with brief and incidental stopover(s) at a foreign point without a break in journey.
Licensed treating medical professional
means an individual, including a physician, a nurse practitioner, a physician's assistant, or other medical provider, who is licensed or authorized under the law of a State or territory in the United States or a comparable jurisdiction in another country to engage in the practice of medicine to diagnose
or treat a patient for a health condition that is the reason for the passenger to request a travel credit or voucher under § 262.4(b) and (c).
Merchant of record
means the entity (carrier or ticket agent) responsible for processing payment by the consumer for airfare or ancillary services or products, as shown in the consumer's financial charge statements such as debit or credit card charge statements.
Foreign air carrier
means a person, not a citizen of the United States, undertaking by any means, directly or indirectly, to provide foreign air transportation.
Public health emergency
has the same meaning as defined in 42 CFR 70.1.
Serious communicable disease
means a communicable disease as defined in 42 CFR 70.1 that can cause serious health consequences (
e.g.,
breathing problems, organ damage, neurological difficulties, death) and can be easily transmitted by casual contact in an aircraft cabin environment (
i.e.,
easily spread to others in an aircraft cabin through general activities of passengers such as sitting next to someone, shaking hands, talking to someone, or touching communal surfaces). For example, the common cold is readily transmissible in an aircraft cabin environment but does not have severe health consequences. AIDS has serious health consequences but is not readily transmissible in an aircraft cabin environment. Both the common cold and AIDS would not be considered serious communicable diseases for purposes of this part. SARS is readily transmissible in an aircraft cabin environment and has severe health consequences. SARS would be considered a serious communicable disease for purposes of this part.
§ 262.3
Applicability.
This part applies to all covered carriers that are the merchant of record for a covered flight or the operating carrier of a covered flight when a ticket agent is the merchant of record.
§ 262.4
Passengers entitled to receive travel credits or vouchers.
A covered carrier as identified in § 262.3 must provide a transferrable travel credit or voucher that does not expire for at least five years from the date of issuance to consumers described in paragraphs (a) to (c) of this section.
(a) The consumer is prohibited from travel to, from, or within the United States or is required to quarantine at the destination as shown on the consumer's itinerary for more than 50% of the length of the trip (excluding travel dates) because of a U.S. (Federal, State, or local) or foreign government restriction or prohibition (
e.g.,
stay at home order, entry restriction, border closure, or quarantine notice) in relation to a serious communicable disease. The consumer must have purchased the airline ticket before a public health emergency was declared for the origination or destination of the consumer's scheduled travel or, if there is no declaration of a public health emergency, before the government prohibition or restriction applicable to the origination or the destination of the consumer's scheduled travel was imposed.
(b) There is a public health emergency applicable to the origination or destination of the consumer's itinerary, the consumer purchased the airline ticket before the public health emergency was declared, the consumer is scheduled to travel during the public health emergency, and the consumer is advised by a licensed treating medical professional not to travel by air to protect himself or herself from a serious communicable disease.
(c) Regardless of whether there is a public health emergency, the consumer is advised by a licensed treating medical professional not to travel by air because the consumer has or is likely to have contracted a serious communicable disease, and the consumer's condition is such that traveling on a commercial flight would pose a direct threat to the health of others.
§ 262.5
Documentation.
In the absence of an applicable determination issued by the Department of Health and Human Services that requiring the documentation specified in paragraphs (b) or (c) of this section is not in the public interest, as a condition for issuing the travel credits or
vouchers in § 262.4, carriers may require, as appropriate, documentation specified in paragraphs (a) to (c) of this section.
(a) For any consumer requesting a travel credit or voucher because of a government restriction or prohibition pursuant to § 262.4(a), carriers may require the consumer to provide the applicable current government order or other document demonstrating how the government order prohibits the consumer from travel to, from, or within the United States as scheduled or requires the consumer to quarantine for more than 50% of the length of the consumer's scheduled trip at the destination (excluding travel dates) as shown on the passenger's itinerary.
(b) For any consumer requesting a travel credit or voucher to protect his or her health pursuant to § 262.4(b), carriers may require the consumer to provide a valid medical certificate as set forth in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section.
(1) For purposes of paragraph (b) of this section, a medical certificate means a written statement from a licensed treating medical professional stating that it is his/her professional opinion, based on the medical condition of the individual and current medical knowledge on the relevant serious communicable disease, including public health guidance issued by CDC or WHO, if available, that the individual should not travel during the current public health emergency by commercial air transportation to protect his or her health from a serious communicable disease.
(2) To be valid, a medical certificate under paragraph (b) of this section must be dated after the declaration of the relevant public health emergency and no earlier than one year before the scheduled travel date and include information regarding the licensed treating medical professional's license (the date of issuance, type of the license, State or other jurisdiction in which the license was issued).
(c) For any consumer requesting a travel credit or a voucher to protect the health of others pursuant to § 262.4(c), carriers may require the consumer to provide a valid medical certificate as set forth in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(3) of this section. For any consumer who informed carriers that there is not adequate time to obtain and submit a valid medical certificate as set forth in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(3) of this section before the scheduled travel date, carriers must allow submission of the medical certificate within a reasonable time after the scheduled travel date.
(1) For purposes of paragraph (c) of this section, a medical certificate means a written statement from a licensed treating medical professional stating that it is his/her professional opinion, based on the medical condition of the individual and current medical knowledge of the relevant serious communicable disease, including public health guidance issued by CDC or WHO, if available, that the individual should not travel by commercial air transportation on the date of the scheduled travel to protect the health of others from a serious communicable disease because the individual has or is likely to have contracted a serious communicable disease .
(2) To be valid, a medical certificate under paragraph (c) of this section must include information regarding the licensed treating medical professional's license (the date of issuance, type of the license, State or other jurisdiction in which license was issued).
(3) For a medical certificate under paragraph (c) of this section, carriers may require that it be dated close to the travel date, as determined based on the current medical knowledge and applicable public health guidance issued by CDC or WHO regarding the contagious period of the relevant serious communicable disease.
§ 262.6
Value of travel credits or vouchers.
Upon confirming a consumer's eligibility for a travel credit or voucher pursuant to this paragraph, a carrier must promptly issue the travel credit or voucher with a value equal to or greater than the fare (including government-imposed taxes and fees and carrier-imposed charges and prepaid ancillary service fees for services not
utilized by the consumer). If a consumer has obtained a refund of the September 11th Security Fee or other government-imposed taxes and fees, then those fee amounts may be deducted from the consumer's travel credit or voucher. Nothing in this section relieves the carrier of its obligation to comply with the requirements of other Federal agencies relating to the refund of government-imposed taxes and fees.
§ 262.7
Processing fee.
A carrier may retain a processing fee for issuing the travel voucher or credit, as long as the fee is on a per-passenger basis and the existence and amount of the fee is clearly and prominently disclosed to consumers at the time they purchased the airfare.
§ 262.8
Disclosure of restrictions, conditions or limitations.
A carrier shall not impose unreasonable restrictions, conditions or limitations on the travel credits or vouchers, including a validity period that is shorter than five years from the date of issuance, a restriction on the transferability of the credits or vouchers to another individual, conditions that severely restrict booking with respect to travel date, time, route, or class of service; a limitation that allows redemption only in one booking and renders any residual value void; or a limitation that only allows the value of the credits or vouchers to apply to the base fare of a new booking but not government-imposed taxes or fees, carrier imposed fees, or ancillary service fees. A carrier must clearly disclose, no later than at the time of voucher or credit issuance, any material restrictions, limitations, or conditions on the use of the credits and vouchers that are not deemed unreasonable, including but not limited to advance purchase requirement or capacity restrictions and blackout dates.
§ 262.9
Contract of carriage.
A carrier shall not include terms or conditions in its contract of carriage inconsistent with the carriers' obligations as specified by this part. Any such action will be considered an unfair and deceptive practice within the meaning of 49 U.S.C. 41712.

In establishing the subsidy for an air carrier providing essential air service at an eligible place, the Department will consider the following:
(a) The reasonable projected costs of a carrier in serving that place;
(b) The carrier's reasonable projected revenues for serving that place;
(c) The appropriate size of aircraft for providing essential air service at that place; and
(d) A reasonable profit for a carrier serving that place.
[ER-1398, 49 FR 49846, Dec. 24, 1984, as amended at 60 FR 43524, Aug. 22, 1995]
§ 271.4
Carrier costs.
(a) The reasonable costs projected for a carrier providing essential air service at an eligible place will be evaluated:
(1) For costs attributable to the carrier's flying operations (direct expenses), by comparing the projected costs submitted by the carrier with the following:
(i) The carrier's historical direct operating costs with the same or similar aircraft types;
(ii) The direct operating unit costs of similar carriers using the same or similar equipment; and
(iii) Data supplied by the manufacturer of the carrier's aircraft.
(2) For other costs, by one or more of the following methods:
(i) By direct assignment where the indirect costs are attributable to the carrier's operations at the eligible place;
(ii) By comparing the carrier's systemwide indirect operating expenses to those submitted by the carrier for the eligible place; or
(iii) By comparing the indirect operating expenses submitted by the carrier with the ratio of indirect to direct costs that have been experienced by the carrier in other markets or to costs that are representative of the industry.
(3) By considering the unique circumstances of the carrier or the community being served that justify deviations from the costs that would otherwise be established for that carrier under this paragraph.
(4) By determining whether the aircraft to be used by the carrier at the eligible place, and on which its costs are derived, are appropriate for providing essential air service there. The appropriateness of the aircraft to be used is based on the following characteristics of the eligible place:
(i) Traffic levels;
(ii) The level of air service that the Department has decided is essential for the eligible place;
(iii) Distance to the designated hub;
(iv) The altitude at which the carrier must fly to the designated hub; and
(v) Other operational elements involved.
(b) When the essential air service would be made part of the carrier's linear system, the Department might, instead of the factors in paragraph (a) of this section, consider only the incremental costs that the carrier will incur in adding that service to its system.
[ER-1398, 49 FR 49846, Dec. 24, 1984, as amended at 60 FR 43524, 43525, Aug. 22, 1995]
§ 271.5
Carrier revenues.
(a) The projected passenger revenue for a carrier providing essential air service at an eligible place will be calculated by multiplying the following:
(1) A reasonable projected net fare, which is the standard fare expected to be charged for service between the eligible place and the designated hub less any dilution caused by joint fare arrangements, discount fares that it offers, or prorates of fares for through one-line passengers; and
(2) The traffic (including both local and beyond traffic) projected to flow between the eligible place and the designated hub or hubs, which is based on the carrier's own estimates, Department estimates, and on traffic levels in the market at issue when such data are available.
(b) The reasonableness of a carrier's passenger revenue projections will be evaluated by:
(1) Comparing the carrier's proposed fare with the fare charged in other city-pair markets of similar distances and traffic densities; and
(2) Comparing the carrier's proposed pricing structure with historical pricing practices in the market at issue, with the pricing practices of that carrier in other markets, and with any standard industry pricing guidelines that may be available.
(c) An estimate of freight and other transport-related revenue will be included as a component of projected revenues and will be based on recent experience in the market involved and on the experience of the carrier involved in other markets.
[ER-1398, 49 FR 49846, Dec. 24, 1984, as amended at 60 FR 43524, Aug. 22, 1995]
§ 271.6
Profit element.
The reasonable return for a carrier for providing essential air service at an eligible place generally will be set at a flat percentage, typically 5 percent of that carrier's projected operating costs as established under § 271.4, plus any applicable interest expenses on flight equipment.
[ER-1398, 49 FR 49846, Dec. 24, 1984, as amended at 60 FR 43524, 43525, Aug. 22, 1995]
§ 271.7
Subsidy payout formula.
(a) Subsidy will be paid by the Department to the air carrier monthly, based on the subsidy rate established by the Department for the carrier under this part. Payments will not vary except as provided in this section.
(b) While a carrier's subsidy rate will not vary even if actual revenues or costs differ from projections, the actual amount of each payment may vary depending on the following factors:
(1) Seasonal characteristics of the carrier's operations at the eligible place;
(2) The actual number of flights completed, aircraft miles flown, available seat-miles flown, or variations in other operational elements upon which the subsidy rate is based; or
(3) Adjustments to the carrier's subsidy required by § 271.8(b).
(c) Payments will continue for the duration of the rate term established under § 271.8 provided that the carrier continues to provide the required service.
[ER-1398, 49 FR 49846, Dec. 24, 1984, as amended at 60 FR 43524, 43525, Aug. 22, 1995]
§ 271.8
Rate period.
(a) The subsidy rate generally will be set for a 2-year period, or two consecutive 1-year periods. The Department may set the rate for a shorter period in the following situations:
(1) A commuter air carrier is replacing a larger certificated carrier at the eligible place;
(2) Traffic at the eligible place has substantially decreased;
(3) The Department considers the cost or revenue projections of the carrier for the second year to be unrealistic;
(4) It is likely that there will be changes in the eligible place essential air service level; or
(5) The uncertainties of the market or other circumstances warrant a shorter rate period.
(b) The subsidy rate established for a carrier under this part will not be changed during the rate period unless an adjustment is required in the public interest.
(c) At the end of the rate period, the carrier will not have a continuing right to receive subsidy for providing essential air service at the eligible place.
[ER-1398, 49 FR 49846, Dec. 24, 1984, as amended at 60 FR 43524, 43525, Aug. 22, 1995]
§ 271.9
Discrimination prohibited.
(a) All air carriers receiving subsidy under this part shall comply with the following:
(1) The Age Discrimination Act of 1975;
(2) The Civil Rights Act of 1964 and 49 CFR part 21; and
(3) The Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 49 CFR part 27, and part 382 of this chapter.
(b) Within 1 year after it first receives a subsidy under this part, the carrier shall evaluate its practices and procedures for accommodating the handicapped in accordance with § 382.23 of this chapter.
(c) All air carriers seeking a subsidy under this part shall include in their subsidy application the assurances required by 49 CFR parts 20, 21, 27 and 29, and § 382.21 of this chapter.

BTS Schedule P-12(a), Fuel Consumption by Type of Service and Entity.
(a) For the purposes of BTS schedule P-12(a), type of service shall be either scheduled service or nonscheduled service as those terms are defined in § 291.45(c)(2) and (3).
(b) For the purpose of this schedule, scheduled service shall be reported separately for:
(1) Intra-Alaskan operations;
(2) Domestic operations, which shall include all operations within and between the 50 States of the United States (except Intra-Alaska), the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands, or a U.S. territory or possession to a place in any State of the United States the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands, or a U.S. territory or possession;
(3) International operations are flight stages with one or both terminals outside the 50 States of the United States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands, or a U.S. territory or possession.
(c) For the purpose of this schedule, nonscheduled service shall be reported separately for domestic operations and international operations as defined in paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section, except that domestic and international Military Airlift Command (MAC) operations shall be reported on separate lines.
(d) The cost data reported on each line shall represent the average cost of fuel, as determined at the station level, consumed in that geographic entity.
(e)(1) The cost of fuel shall include shrinkage, but excludes:
(i) “Throughput” and “in to plane” fees, i.e., service charges or gallonage levies assessed by or against the fuel vendor or concessionaire and passed on to the carrier in a separately identifiable form; and

(f) Each air carrier shall maintain records for each station showing the computation of fuel inventories and consumption for each fuel type. The periodic average cost method shall be used in computing fuel inventories and consumption. Under this method, an average unit cost for each fuel type shall be computed by dividing the total cost of fuel available (Beginning Inventory plus Purchases) by the total gallons available. The resulting unit cost shall then be used to determine the ending inventory and the total consumption costs to be reported on this schedule.
(g) Where amounts reported for a specific entity include other than Jet A fuel, a footnote shall be added indicating the number of gallons and applicable costs of such other fuel included in amounts reported for that entity.
(h) Where any adjustment(s) recorded on the books of the carrier results in a material distortion of the current month's schedule, carriers shall file a revised Schedule P-12(a) for the month(s) affected.

(b) Schedule T-100 shall be filed monthly.
(1) Schedule T-100 collects summarized flight stage data and on-flight market data for revenue flights. All traffic statistics shall be compiled in terms of each flight stage as actually performed. The detail T-100 data shall be maintained in such a manner as to permit monthly summarization and organization into two basic groupings. First, the nonstop segment information which is to be summarized by equipment type, within class of service, within pair-of-points, without regard to individual flight number. The second grouping requires that the enplanement/deplanement information be broken out into separate units called on-flight market records, which shall be summarized by class of service, within pair-of-points, without regard for equipment type or flight number.
(2)
Joint-service operations.
The Department may authorize joint-service operations between two direct air carriers. Examples of these joint-service operations are: blocked-space agreements; part-charter agreements; code-sharing agreements; wet-lease agreements, and similar arrangements.
(i) Joint-service operations are reported by the carrier in operational control of the flight, i.e., the carrier that uses its flight crews under its own FAA operating authority. The traffic moving under these agreements is reported on Schedule T-100 the same way as any other traffic on the aircraft.
(ii) If there are questions about reporting a joint-service operation, contact the BTS Assistant Director—Airline Information (fax no. 202 366-3383,
telephone no. 202 366-4373). Joint-service operations are reported in Schedule T-100 in accordance with this paragraph (b).
(iii)
Operational control.
The air carrier in operational control of the aircraft (the carrier that uses its flight crews under its own FAA operating authority) must report joint services.
(c)
Service classes.
(1) The statistical classifications are designed to reflect the operating characteristics attributable to each distinctive type of service offered. The combination of scheduled and nonscheduled operations with passenger, all-cargo, and military services are placed into service classes as follows:
Code
Type of service
F
Scheduled Passenger/Cargo.
G
Scheduled All-Cargo.
L
Nonscheduled Civilian Passenger/Cargo/
P
Nonscheduled Civilian Cargo.
N
Nonscheduled Military Passenger/Cargo.
R
Nonscheduled Military Cargo.
(2) Scheduled services include traffic and capacity elements applicable to air transportation provided pursuant to published schedules and extra sections of scheduled flights. Scheduled Passenger/Cargo (Service Class F) is a composite of first-class, coach, and mixed passenger/cargo service.
(3) Nonscheduled services include all traffic and capacity elements applicable to the performance of nonscheduled aircraft charters, and other air transportation services not constituting an integral part of services performed pursuant to published flight schedules.
(d)
Air transport traffic and capacity elements.
Within each of the service classifications, carriers shall report air transport traffic and capacity elements. The elements are reported on segment and/or market records as follows:

Pt. 291, Subpt. E, App. A

# Appendix A to Subpart E of Part 291—Instructions to U.S. Air Carriers for Reporting Traffic and Capacity Data on Schedule T-100
(a)
Format of reports
—(1)
Automatic Data Processing (ADP) magnetic tape.
Refer to paragraph (d) of this appendix for instructions pertaining to mainframe and minicomputer reporting. The Department will issue “Accounting and Reporting Directives” to make necessary technical changes to these T-100 instructions. Technical changes which are minor in nature do not require public notice and comment.
(2)
Microcomputer diskette
—(i)
Optional specification.
If an air carrier desires to use its personal computers (PC's), rather than mainframe or minicomputers to prepare its data submissions, the following specifications for filing data on diskette media apply.
(ii)
Reporting medium.
Microcomputer ADP data submission of T-100 information must be on IBM compatible disks. Carriers wishing to use a different ADP procedure must obtain written approval to do so from the BTS Assistant Director—Airline Information. Requests for approval to use alternate methods must disclose and describe the proposed data transmission methodology. Refer to paragraph (i) of this appendix for microcomputer record layouts.
(iii)
Microcomputer file characteristics.
The files will be created in ASCII delimited format, sometimes called Data Interchange Format (DIF). This form of recording data provides for variable length fields (data elements) which, in the case of alphabetic data, are enclosed by quotation marks (“) and separated by a comma (,) or tab. Numeric data elements that are recorded without editing symbols are also separated by a comma (,) or tab. The data are identified by their juxtaposition within a given record. Therefore, each record must contain the exact number of data elements, all of which must be juxtapositionally correct. Personal computer software including most spreadsheets, data base management programs, and BASIC are capable of producing files in this format.
(b)
Filing date for reports.
The reports must be received at BTS within 30 days following the end of each reporting period.
(c)
Address for filing.
Data Administration Division, RTS-42, Office of Airline Information, Bureau of Transportation Statistics, U.S. Department of Transportation, 1200 New Jersey Avenue SE, Washington, DC 20590-0001.
(d)
ADP format for magnetic tape
—(1)
Magnetic tape specifications.
IBM compatible 9-track EBCDIC recording. Recording density of 6250 or 1600 bpi. The order of recorded information is:
(i) Volume label.
(ii) Header label.
(iii) Data records.
(iv) Trailer label.
(2) [Reserved]
(e)
External tape label information.
(1) Carrier name.
(2) Report date.
(3) File identification.
(4) Carrier address for return of tape reel.
(f)
Standards.
It is the policy of the Department to be consistent with the American National Standards Institute and the Federal Standards Activity in all data processing and telecommunications matters. It is our
intention that all specifications in this application are in compliance with standards promulgated by these organizations.
(g)
Volume, header, and trailer label formats
—(1)
Use standard IBM label formats.
The file identifier field of the header labels should be “T-100.SYSTEM”.

(i)
Record layouts for microcomputer diskettes.
The record layouts for diskette are generally identical to those shown for magnetic tape, with the exception that delimiters (quotation marks, tabs and commas) are used to separate fields. It is necessary that the order of fields be maintained in all records.
(1)
File characteristics.
The files will be created in ASCII delimited format, sometimes called Data Interchange Format (DIF). This form of recording data provides for variable length fields (data elements) which, in the case of alphabetic data, are enclosed by quotation marks (”) and separated by a comma (,) or tab. Numeric data elements that are recorded without editing symbols are also separated by a comma (,) or tab. The data are identified by their juxtaposition within a given record. Therefore, it is critical that each record contain the exact number of data elements, all of which must be juxtapositionally correct. PC software including most spreadsheets, data base management programs, and BASIC produce minidisk files in this format.
(2)
File naming conventions for diskettes.
For microcomputer reports, each record type should be contained in a separate DOS file on the same physical diskette. The following DOS naming conventions should be followed:
(i) Record type S = SEGMENT.DAT
(ii) Record type M = MARKET.DAT

# Subpart A—General
§ 294.1
Applicability and purpose.
This part establishes a classification of foreign air carriers known as “Canadian charter air taxi operators,” and establishes registration procedures for these carriers operating or seeking to operate transborder services between Canada and the United States. This part also exempts Canadian charter air taxi operators from certain provisions of the Subtitle VII of Title 49 of the United States Code (Transportation), and establishes rules applicable to their operations in the United States. This part does not provide exemption from the safety regulatory provisions of 49 U.S.C. Subtitle VII that are administered by the U.S. Department of Transportation through the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and Canadian charter air taxi operators in the conduct of their operations must observe all applicable safety standards and requirements.
[ER-1257, 46 FR 52591, Oct. 27, 1981, as amended at 60 FR 43526, Aug. 22, 1995]
§ 294.2
Definitions.
As used in this part:
(a)
Agreement
means the
Air Transport Agreement Between the Government of the United States and the Government of Canada
, signed at Ottawa, February 24, 1995, with Annexes and any amendments, supplements, reservations, or supersessions to it.
(b)
Canadian charter air taxi operator
means a foreign air carrier that is substantially owned and effectively controlled by Canadian citizens, the Government of Canada, or both, whose foreign air transportation operations are limited to charter air service between points in Canada and points in the United States, and that does not use large aircraft in those operations.
(c)
Charter air service
means nonscheduled commercial air transportation of persons and their accompanied baggage, and of property, on a time, mileage, or trip basis where the entire planeload capacity of one or more aircraft has been engaged, or the transportation of mail by aircraft.
(d)
Large aircraft
means any aircraft that are not
small aircraft
as defined in this section.
(e)
Maximum authorized takeoff weight
has the meaning assigned to it in regulations of the Canadian Transport Commission.
(f)
Maximum certificated takeoff weight
means the maximum takeoff weight authorized by the terms of the aircraft airworthiness certificate. This weight may be found in the airplane operating record or in the airplane flight manual that is incorporated by regulation into the airworthiness certificate.
(g)
Maximum passenger capacity
means the maximum number of passenger seats for which an aircraft is configured.
(h)
Maximum payload capacity
means the maximum certificated takeoff weight of an aircraft less the empty weight as defined in section 03 of part 241 of this chapter, less all justifiable aircraft equipment, and less the operating load (consisting of minimum fuel load, oil, flight crew, steward's supplies, etc.).

(b) Air charter brokers may display their name and logo on aircraft provided the name of the direct air carrier is displayed prominently and clearly on the aircraft and consumers are not otherwise misled into thinking that the air charter broker is a direct air carrier or direct foreign air carrier.
§ 295.24
Disclosures.
(a) Before entering a contract for a specific flight or series of flights with
charterers, air charter brokers must disclose to the charterer the information in paragraphs (a)(1),(2), and (6) of this section. Before entering a contract for a specific flight or series of flights with charterers, air charter brokers must, upon request of the charterer, disclose to the charterer the information in paragraphs (a)(3), (4), and (5) of this section.
