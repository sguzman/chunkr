# Explanation
The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.
Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:
Title 1 through Title 16
as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27
as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41
as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50
as of October 1
The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.

# LEGAL STATUS
The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

# HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS
The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, July 1, 2025), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

# EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES
Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.

# OMB CONTROL NUMBERS
The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request.
Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.

# PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE
Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.

# “[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY
The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not dropped in error.

# INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE
What is incorporation by reference?
Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.
What is a proper incorporation by reference?
The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:
(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.
(b) The matter incorporated is adequately summarized in the preamble of the final rule and is available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.
(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?
If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or email fr.inspection@nara.gov.

# CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES
A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR
Index and Finding Aids.
This volume contains the Parallel Table of Authorities and Rules. A list of CFR titles, chapters, subchapters, and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in this volume.
An index to the text of “Title 3—The President” is carried within that volume.
The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. This index is based on a consolidation of the “Contents” entries in the daily Federal Register.
A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

# REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL
There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing in the Code of Federal Regulations.

(2) Any manufacturer of a new chemical substance satisfying all of the following low environmental release and low human exposure eligibility criteria:
(i)
Consumers and the general population.
For exposure of consumers and the general population to the new chemical substance during all manufacturing, processing, distribution in commerce, use, and disposal of the substance:
(A) No dermal exposure.
(B) No inhalation exposure (except as described in paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section.
(C) Exposure in drinking water no greater than a 1 milligram per year (estimated average dosage resulting from drinking water exposure in streams from the maximum allowable concentration level from ambient surface water releases established under paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section or a higher concentration authorized by EPA under paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section).
(ii)
Workers.
For exposure of workers to the new chemical substance during all manufacturing, processing, distribution in commerce, use and disposal of the substance:
(A) No dermal exposure (this criterion is met if adequate dermal exposure controls are used in accordance with applicable EPA guidance).
(B) No inhalation exposure (this criterion is considered to be met if adequate inhalation exposure controls are used in accordance with applicable EPA guidance).
(iii)
Ambient surface water.
For ambient surface water releases, no releases resulting in surface water concentrations above 1 part per billion, calculated using the methods prescribed in §§ 721.90 and 721.91, unless EPA has approved a higher surface water concentration supported by relevant and scientifically valid data submitted to EPA in a notice under paragraph (e) of this section on the substance or a close structural analogue of the substance which demonstrates that the new substance will not present an unreasonable risk of injury to aquatic species or human health at the higher concentration.
(iv)
Incineration.
For ambient air releases from incineration, no releases of the new chemical substance above 1 microgram per cubic meter maximum annual average concentration, calculated using the formula:
(kg/day of release after treatment) multiplied by (number of release days per year) multiplied by (9.68 × 10
−6
) micrograms per cubic meter.
(v)
Land or groundwater.
For releases to land or groundwater, no releases to groundwater, to land, or to a landfill
unless the manufacturer has demonstrated to EPA's satisfaction in a notice under paragraph (e) of this section that the new substance has negligible groundwater migration potential.
(d)
Chemical substances that cannot be manufactured under this exemption.
A new chemical substance cannot be manufactured under this section, notwithstanding satisfaction of the criterion of paragraph (c)(1) or (2) of this section, if EPA determines, in accordance with paragraph (g) of this section, that the substance, any reasonably anticipated metabolites, environmental transformation products, or byproducts of the substance, or any reasonably anticipated impurities in the substance, under anticipated conditions of manufacture, processing, distribution in commerce, use, or disposal of the new chemical substance:
(1) May cause:
(i) Serious acute (lethal or sublethal) effects;
(ii) Serious chronic (including carcinogenic and teratogenic) effects; or
(ii) Significant environmental effects.
(2) Or is:
(i) A PFAS.
(ii) A PBT chemical substance with anticipated environmental releases and potentially unreasonable exposures to humans or environmental organisms.
(e)
Exemption notice.
(1) A manufacturer applying for an exemption under either paragraph (c)(1) or (c)(2) of this section must submit an exemption notice to EPA at least 30 days before manufacture of the new chemical substance begins. Exemption notices and modifications must be submitted to EPA on EPA Form No. 7710-25 via CDX using e-PMN software in the manner set forth in this paragraph. See 40 CFR 720.40(a)(2)(ii) for information on how to obtain e-PMN software. Notices and any related support documents, must be generated and completed (via CDX) using e-PMN software. See 40 CFR 720.40(a)(2)(ii) for information on how to obtain e-PMN software.
(2) The notice shall contain the information described below, pursuant to the referenced provisions of § 720.45.
(i) Manufacturer identity.
(ii) Chemical identity (§ 720.45(a)).
(iii) Impurities (§ 720.45(b)).
(iv) Known synonyms or trade names (§ 720.45(c)).
(v) Byproducts (§ 720.45(d)).
(vi) Production volume (§ 720.45(e)). (A) Manufacturers submitting an exemption application under paragraph (c)(1) of this section will be assumed to be manufacturing at an annual production volume of 10,000 kilograms. Manufacturers who intend to manufacture an exempted substance at annual volumes of less than 10,000 kilograms and wish EPA to conduct its risk assessment based upon such lesser annual production level rather than a 10,000-kilograms level, may so specify by writing the lesser annual production volume in the appropriate box on the PMN form and marking the adjacent binding option box. Manufacturers who opt to specify annual production levels below 10,000 kilograms and who mark the production volume binding option box shall not manufacture more than the specific annual amount of the exempted substance unless a new exemption notice for a higher (up to 10,000 kgs) manufacturing volume is submitted and approved pursuant to this section.
(B) Manufacturers submitting an exemption under paragraph (c)(2) of this section shall list the estimated maximum amount to be manufactured during the first year of production and the estimated maximum amount to be manufactured during any 12-month period during the first 3 years of production.
(vii) Description of intended categories of use (§ 720.45(f)).
(viii) For manufacturer-controlled sites, the manufacturer shall supply identity of manufacturing sites, process descriptions, and worker exposure and environmental release information (§ 720.45(g)); for sites not controlled by the manufacturer, processing and use operation descriptions, estimated number of processing and use sites, and worker exposure/environmental release information (§ 720.45(h)). A manufacturer applying for an exemption under paragraph (c)(1) of this section need not provide information on worker exposure and environmental release referenced in paragraphs (e)(2)(viii) of this section if such information is not
known or not readily available to the manufacturer. To assist in reporting this information, manufacturers may obtain a copy of EPA's Guidance for Reporting Occupational Exposure and Environmental Release Information under 40 CFR 723.50, available from the Environmental Assistance Division at the address listed in paragraph (e)(1) of this section. Where worker exposure and environmental release information is not supplied by the manufacturer, EPA will generally apply “bounding estimates” (i.e., exposure estimates higher than those incurred by persons in the population with the highest exposure) to account for uncertainties in actual exposure and release scenarios.
(ix) Type and category of notice. The manufacturer must clearly indicate on the first page of the PMN form that the submission is a “TSCA section 5(h)(4) exemption notice,” and must indicate whether the notice is being submitted under paragraph (c)(1) or (c)(2) of this section. Manufacturers of chemical substances that qualify for an exemption under both paragraph (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section may apply for either exemption, but not both.
(x) Test data (§ 720.50).
(xi) Certification. In addition to the certifications required in EPA form 7710-25, the following certifications shall be included in notices under this section. The manufacturer must certify that:
(A) The manufacturer intends to manufacture the new chemical substance for commercial purposes, other than in small quantities solely for research and development, under the terms of this section.
(B) The manufacturer is familiar with the terms of this section and will comply with those terms.
(C) The new chemical substance for which the notice is submitted meets all applicable exemption conditions.
(D) For substances manufactured under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the manufacturer intends to commence manufacture of the exempted substance for commercial purposes within 1 year of the date of the expiration of the 30-day review period.
(xii) Sanitized copy of notice. (A) The manufacturer must make all claims of confidentiality in accordance with paragraph (l) of this section. If any information is claimed confidential, the manufacturer must submit a second copy of the notice, with all information claimed as confidential deleted, in accordance with paragraph (l)(3) of this section.
(B) If the manufacturer does not provide the second copy, the submission will be considered incomplete.
(xiii) Safety Data Sheet (§ 720.45(i)).
(xiv) Physical and chemical properties and environmental fate characteristics (§ 720.45(j)).
(3)
Incomplete notices.
EPA will conduct a pre-screen of the notice, typically taking 2-3 days and according to the criteria under paragraph (e)(2) of this section. If EPA concludes that the notice is incomplete, EPA will notify the submitter and the review period will not begin. Once the submitter corrects the errors or incomplete submission according to the requirements provided by EPA and re-submits the notice to EPA, the review period will begin. If EPA does not identify errors or determine the notice to be incomplete during screening, the review period will begin on the date EPA received the complete notice.
(f)
Multiple exemption holders.
(1) A manufacturer who intends to manufacture a substance for which an exemption under this section was previously approved may apply for an exemption under paragraph (c)(1) or (c)(2) of this section; however, EPA will not approve any subsequent exemption application under paragraph (c)(1) of this section unless it can determine that the potential human exposure to, and environmental release of, the new chemical substance at the higher aggregate production volume will not present an unreasonable risk of injury to human health or the environment.
(2)(i) If EPA proposes to deny an exemption application for a substance for which another manufacturer currently holds an exemption, and that proposed denial is based exclusively on the cumulative human exposure or environmental release of the substance which precludes the EPA from determining that the subsequent applicant's activities will not present an unreasonable risk of injury to human health or the environment, the EPA will notify the
first exemption holder that it must, within 21 days of its receipt of EPA's notice, either:
(A) Provide a new certification that it has commenced, or that it will commence, manufacture of the new chemical substance under this section within 1 year of the expiration of its exemption review period; or
(B) Withdraw its exemption for the new chemical substance.
(ii) If the first exemption holder does not respond to the EPA's notice under paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section within the prescribed time period, EPA shall issue a notice of ineligibility to the first exemption holder under the provisions of paragraph (h)(2) of this section.
(g)
Review period.
(1) EPA will review the notice submitted under paragraph (e) of this section to determine whether manufacture of the new chemical substance is eligible for the exemption. The review period will run for 30 days from the date EPA receives a complete notice. To provide additional time to address any unresolved issues concerning an exemption application, the exemption applicant may, at any time during the review period, request a suspension of the review period pursuant to the provisions of § 720.75(b) of this chapter.
(2) No person submitting a notice under paragraph (e) of this section may manufacture the new chemical substance until EPA notifies the submitter that the new chemical substance meets the terms of this section.
(h)
Notice of ineligibility
—(1)
During the review period.
If the EPA determines during the review period that manufacture of the new chemical substance does not meet the terms of this section or that there are issues concerning toxicity or exposure that require further review which cannot be accomplished within the 30-day review period, EPA will notify the manufacturer by telephone that the substance is not eligible. This telephone notification will subsequently be confirmed by certified letter that identifies the reasons for the ineligibility determination. The manufacturer may not begin manufacture of the new chemical substance without complying with section 5(a)(1) of the Act or submitting a new notice under paragraph (e) of this section that satisfies EPA's concerns.
(2)
After the review period.
(i)(A) If at any time after the review period specified in paragraph (g) of this section the Assistant Administrator for the Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention (“the Assistant Administrator”) makes a preliminary determination that manufacture of the new chemical substance does not meet the terms of this section, the Assistant Administrator will notify the manufacturer by certified letter that EPA believes that the new chemical substance does not meet the terms of the section.

§ 723.250
Polymers.
(a)
Purpose and scope.
(1) This section grants an exemption from certain of the premanufacture notice requirements of section 5(a)(1)(A) of the Toxic Substances Control Act (15 U.S.C. 2604(a)(1)(A)) for the manufacture of certain polymers. This section does not apply to microorganisms subject to part 725 of this chapter.
(2) To manufacture a new chemical substance under the terms of this section, a manufacturer must:
(i) Determine that the substance meets the definition of polymer in paragraph (b) of this section.
(ii) Determine that the substance is not specifically excluded by paragraph (d) of this section.
(iii) Ensure that the substance meets the exemption criteria of paragraph (e) of this section.
(iv) Submit a report as required under paragraph (f) of this section.
(v) Comply with the recordkeeping requirements of paragraph (j) of this section.
(b)
Definitions.
In addition to the definitions under section 3 of the Act, 15 U.S.C. 2602, the following definitions apply to this part.
Act
means the Toxic Substances Control Act (15 U.S.C. 2601
et seq.
).
Biopolymer
means a polymer directly produced by living or once-living cells or cellular components.
Category of chemical substances
has the same meaning as in section 26(c)(2) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 2625).
Cationic polymer
means a polymer that contains a net positively charged atom(s) or associated groups of atoms covalently linked to its polymer molecule.
Chemical substance, Director, EPA, importer, impurity, Inventory, known to or reasonably ascertainable, manufacture, manufacturer, mixture, new chemical, person, possession or control, process and test data
have the same meanings as in § 720.3 of this chapter.
Equivalent weight of a functional group
means the ratio of the molecular weight to the number of occurrences of that functional group in the molecule. It is the weight of substance that contains one formula-weight of the functional group.
Fluorotelomers
means the products of telomerization, which is the reaction of a telogen (such as pentafluoroethyl iodide) with an ethylenic compound (such as tetrafluoroethylene) to form low molecular weight polymeric compounds, which contain an array of saturated carbon atoms covalently bonded to each other (C-C bonds) and to fluorine atoms (C-F bonds). This array is predominantly a straight chain, and depending on the telogen used produces a compound having an even number of carbon atoms. However, the carbon chain length of the fluorotelomer varies widely. The perfluoroalkyl groups formed by this process are usually, but do not have to be, connected to the polymer through a functionalized ethylene group as indicated by the following structural diagram: (Rf-CH
2
CH
2
-Anything).
Internal monomer unit
means a monomer unit that is covalently bonded to at least two other molecules. Internal monomer units of polymer molecules are chemically derived from monomer molecules that have formed covalent bonds between two or more other monomer molecules or other reactants.
Monomer
means a chemical substance that is capable of forming covalent bonds with two or more like or unlike molecules under the conditions of the relevant polymer-forming reaction used for the particular process.
Monomer Unit
means the reacted form of the monomer in a polymer.
Number-average molecular weight
means the arithmetic average (mean) of the molecular weight of all molecules in a polymer.
Oligomer
means a polymer molecule consisting of only a few monomer units (dimer, trimer, tetramer)
Other reactant
means a molecule linked to one or more sequences of monomer units but which, under the relevant reaction conditions used for the particular process, cannot become a repeating unit in the polymer structure.
Perfluoroalkyl carboxylate (PFAC)
means a group of saturated carbon atoms covalently bonded to each other in a linear, branched, or cyclic array and covalently bonded to a carbonyl moiety and where all carbon-hydrogen (C-H) bonds have been replaced with carbon-fluorine (C-F) bonds. The carbonyl moiety is also covalently bonded to a hetero atom, typically, but not necessarily oxygen (O) or nitrogen (N).
Perfluoroalkyl sulfonate (PFAS)
means a group of saturated carbon atoms covalently bonded to each other in a linear, branched, or cyclic array and covalently bonded to a sulfonyl moiety and where all carbon - hydrogen (C-H) bonds have been replaced with carbon - fluorine (C-F) bonds. The sulfonyl moiety is also covalently bonded to a hetero atom, typically, but not necessarily oxygen (O) or nitrogen (N).
Polyester
means a chemical substance that meets the definition of polymer and whose polymer molecules contain at least two carboxylic acid ester linkages, at least one of which links internal monomer units together.
Polymer
means a chemical substance consisting of molecules characterized by the sequence of one or more types of monomer units and comprising a simple weight majority of molecules containing at least 3 monomer units which are covalently bound to at least one other monomer unit or other reactant and which consists of less than a simple weight majority of molecules of the same molecular weight. Such molecules must be distributed over a range of molecular weights wherein differences in the molecular weight are primarily attributable to differences in the number of monomer units. In the context of this definition, sequence means that the monomer units under consideration are covalently bound to
one another and form a continuous string within the molecule, uninterrupted by units other than monomer units.
Polymer molecule
means a molecule which contains a sequence of at least 3 monomer units which are covalently bound to at least one other monomer unit or other reactant.
Reactant
means a chemical substance that is used intentionally in the manufacture of a polymer to become chemically a part of the polymer composition.
Reactive functional group
means an atom or associated group of atoms in a chemical substance that is intended or can reasonably be anticipated to undergo further chemical reaction.
Reasonably anticipated
means that a knowledgeable person would expect a given physical or chemical composition or characteristic to occur based on such factors as the nature of the precursors used to manufacture the polymer, the type of reaction, the type of manufacturing process, the products produced in polymerization, the intended uses of the substance, or associated use conditions.
(c)
Applicability.
This section applies to manufacturers of new chemical substances that otherwise must submit a premanufacture notice to EPA under § 720.22 of this chapter. New substances are eligible for exemption under this section if they meet the definition of “polymer” in paragraph (b) of this section, and the criteria in paragraph (e) of this section, and if they are not excluded from the exemption under paragraph (d) of this section.

(f)
Exemption report for polymers manufactured under the terms of this section.
For substances exempt under paragraphs (e)(1) through (3) of this section a report of manufacture or import must be submitted by January 31 of the year subsequent to initial manufacture, except that for initial manufacture or import in 2023 the report must be submitted by March 31, 2024. The report and accompanying claims must be submitted via CDX (
https://cdx.epa.gov/
), using the TSCA Section 5 Notices and Supports—ePMN application. See § 720.40(a)(2)(ii) of this subchapter for information on how to access e-PMN software. The notice must include:
(1)
Manufacturer's name.
This includes the name and address of the manufacturer and the name and telephone number of a technical contact.
(2)
Number of substances manufactured.
Number of substances manufactured. The manufacturer must identify the number of polymers manufactured under terms of the exemption for the first time in the year preceding the notice.
(g)
Chemical identity information.
For substances exempt under paragraph (e) of this section the manufacturer must to the extent known to or reasonably ascertainable by the manufacturer identify the following and maintain the records in accordance with paragraph (j) of this section:
(1) A specific chemical name and CAS Registry Number (or EPA assigned Accession Number) for each “reactant,” as that term is defined in paragraph (b) of this section, used at any weight in the manufacture of the polymer. For purposes of determining chemical identity, the manufacturer may determine whether a reactant is used at greater than two weight percent according to either the weight of the reactant charged to the reaction vessel or the weight of the chemically combined (incorporated) reactant in the polymer. Manufacturers who choose the “incorporated” method must have analytical
data, or theoretical calculations (if it can be documented that an analytical determination cannot be made or is not necessary), to demonstrate compliance with this paragraph.

# Subpart A—General Provisions and Applicability
§ 725.1
Scope and purpose.
(a) This part establishes all reporting requirements under section 5 of TSCA for manufacturers, importers, and processors of microorganisms subject to TSCA jurisdiction for commercial purposes, including research and development for commercial purposes. New microorganisms for which manufacturers and importers are required to report under section 5(a)(1)(A) of TSCA are those that are intergeneric. In addition, under section 5(a)(1)(B) of TSCA, manufacturers, importers, and processors may be required to report for any microorganism that EPA determines by rule is being manufactured, imported, or processed for a significant new use.
(b) Any manufacturer, importer, or processor required to report under section 5 of TSCA (see § 725.100 for new microorganisms and § 725.900 for significant new uses) must file a Microbial Commercial Activity Notice (MCAN) with EPA, unless the activity is eligible for a specific exemption as described in this part. The general procedures for filing MCANs are described in subpart D of this part. The exemptions from the requirement to file a MCAN are for certain kinds of contained activities (see §§ 725.424 and 725.428), test marketing activities (see § 725.300), and research and development activities described in paragraph (c) of this section.
(c) Any manufacturer, importer, or processor required to file a MCAN for research and development (R
D) activities may instead file a TSCA Experimental Release Application (TERA) for a specific test (see § 725.250). A TERA is not required for certain R
D activities; however a TERA exemption does not extend beyond the research and development stage, to general commercial use of the microorganism, for which compliance with MCAN requirements is required. The TERA exemptions are for R
D activities subject to other Federal agencies or programs (see § 725.232), certain kinds of contained R
D activities (see § 725.234), and R
D activities using certain listed microorganisms (see § 725.238).
(d) New microorganisms will be added to the Inventory established under section 8 of TSCA once a MCAN has been received, the MCAN review period has expired, and EPA receives a Notice of Commencement (NOC) indicating that manufacture or importation has actually begun. New microorganisms approved for use under a TERA will not be added to the Inventory until a MCAN has been received, the MCAN review period has expired, and EPA has received an NOC.
§ 725.3
Definitions.
Definitions in section 3 of the Act (15 U.S.C. 2602), as well as definitions contained in §§ 704.3, 720.3, and 721.3 of this chapter, apply to this part unless otherwise specified in this section. In addition, the following definitions apply to this part:

Microorganism identity is always part of a health and safety study of a microorganism.
(1) It is intended that the term “health and safety study of a microorganism” be interpreted broadly. Not only is information which arises as a result of a formal, disciplined study included, but other information relating to the effects of a microorganism or microbial mixture on health or the environment is also included. Any data that bear on the effects of a microorganism on health or the environment would be included.
(2) Examples include:
(i) Tests for ecological or other environmental effects on invertebrates,
fish, or other animals, and plants, including: Acute toxicity tests, chronic toxicity tests, critical life stage tests, behavioral tests, algal growth tests, seed germination tests, plant growth or damage tests, microbial function tests, bioconcentration or bioaccumulation tests, and model ecosystem (microcosm) studies.
(ii) Long- and short-term tests of mutagenicity, carcinogenicity, or teratogenicity; dermatoxicity; cumulative, additive, and synergistic effects; and acute, subchronic, and chronic effects.

(2) The term “intergeneric microorganism” does not include a microorganism which contains introduced genetic material consisting of only well-characterized, non-coding regulatory regions from another genus.
Introduced genetic material
means genetic material that is added to, and remains as a component of, the genome of the recipient.
Manufacture, import, or process for commercial purposes
means:
(1) To import, produce, manufacture, or process with the purpose of obtaining an immediate or eventual commercial advantage for the manufacturer, importer, or processor, and includes, among other things, “manufacture” or “processing” of any amount of a microorganism or microbial mixture:

[62 FR 17932, Apr. 11, 1997, as amended at 89 FR 102799, Dec. 18, 2024]
§ 725.12
Identification of microorganisms for Inventory and other listing purposes.
To identify and list microorganisms on the Inventory, both taxonomic designations and supplemental information will be used. The supplemental information required in paragraph (b) of this section will be used to specifically describe an individual microorganism on the Inventory. Submitters must provide the supplemental information required by paragraph (b) of this section to the extent necessary to enable a microorganism to be accurately and unambiguously identified on the Inventory.
(a)
Taxonomic designation.
The taxonomic designation of a microorganism must be provided for the donor organism and the recipient microorganism to the level of strain, as appropriate. These designations must be substantiated by a letter from a culture collection, literature references, or the results of tests conducted for the purpose of taxonomic classification. Upon EPA's request to the submitter, data supporting the taxonomic designation must be provided to EPA. The genetic history of the recipient microorganism should be documented back to the isolate from which it was derived.
(b)
Supplemental information.
The supplemental information described in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section is required to the extent that it enables a microorganism to be accurately and unambiguously identified.
(1)
Phenotypic information.
Phenotypic information means pertinent traits that result from the interaction of a microorganism's genotype and the environment in which it is intended to be used and may include intentionally added biochemical and physiological traits.
(2)
Genotypic information.
Genotypic information means the pertinent and distinguishing genotypic characteristics of a microorganism, such as the identity of the introduced genetic material and the methods used to construct the reported microorganism. This also may include information on the vector construct, the cellular location, and the number of copies of the introduced genetic material.
§ 725.15
Determining applicability when microorganism identity or use is confidential or uncertain.
(a)
Consulting EPA.
Persons intending to conduct activities involving microorganisms may determine their obligations under this part by consulting the Inventory or the microorganisms and uses specified in § 725.239 or in subpart M of this part. This section establishes procedures for EPA to assist persons in determining whether the microorganism or the use is listed on the Inventory, in § 725.239 or in subpart M of this part.
(1)
Confidential identity or use.
In some cases it may not be possible to directly determine if a specific microorganism is listed, because portions of that entry may contain generic information to protect confidential business information (CBI). If any portion of the microorganism's identity or use has
been claimed as CBI, that portion does not appear on the public version of the Inventory, in § 725.239 or in subpart M of this part. Instead, it is contained in a confidential version held in EPA's Confidential Business Information Center (CBIC). The public versions contain generic information which masks the confidential business information. A person who intends to conduct an activity involving a microorganism or use whose entry is described with generic information will need to inquire of EPA whether the unreported microorganism or use is on the confidential version.
(2)
Uncertain microorganism identity.
The current state of scientific knowledge leads to some imprecision in describing a microorganism. As the state of knowledge increases, EPA will be developing policies to determine whether one microorganism is equivalent to another. Persons intending to conduct activities involving microorganisms may inquire of EPA whether the microorganisms they intend to manufacture (including import) or process are equivalent to specific microorganisms described on the Inventory, in § 725.239, or in subpart M of this part.
(b)
Requirement of bona fide intent.
(1) EPA will answer the inquiries described in paragraph (a) of this section only if the Agency determines that the person has a
bona fide
intent to conduct the activity for which reporting is required or for which any exemption may apply.
(2) To establish a
bona fide
intent to manufacture (including import) or process a microorganism, the person who proposes to manufacture (including import) or process the microorganism must submit the request to EPA via CDX. Prior to submission to EPA via CDX, such
bona fide
intents to manufacture (including import) or process must be generated and completed using e-PMN software. See 40 CFR 720.40(a)(2)(ii) for information on how to access the e-PMN software. A
bona fide
intent to manufacture (including import) or process must contain the following information:
(i) Taxonomic designations and supplemental information required by § 725.12.
(ii) A signed statement certifying that the submitter intends to manufacture (including import) or process the microorganism for commercial purposes.
(iii) A description of research and development activities conducted with the microorganism to date, demonstration of the submitter's ability to produce or obtain the microorganism from a foreign manufacturer, and the purpose for which the person will manufacture (including import) or process the microorganism.
(iv) An indication of whether a related microorganism was previously reviewed by EPA to the extent known by the submitter.
(v) A specific description of the major intended application or use of the microorganism.
(c) If an importer or processor cannot provide all the information required by paragraph (b) of this section, because it is claimed as confidential business information by its foreign manufacturer or supplier, the foreign manufacturer or supplier may supply the information directly to EPA.
(d) EPA will review the information submitted by the manufacturer (including importer) or processor under this paragraph to determine whether that person has shown a
bona fide
intent to manufacture (including import) or process the microorganism. If necessary, EPA will compare this information to the information requested for the confidential microorganism under § 725.85(b)(3)(iii).
(e) In order for EPA to make a conclusive determination of the microorganism's status, the proposed manufacturer (including importer) or processor must show a
bona fide
intent to manufacture (including import) or process the microorganism and must provide sufficient information to establish identity unambiguously. After sufficient information has been provided, EPA will inform the manufacturer (including importer) or processor whether the microorganism is subject to this part and if so, which sections of this part apply.
(f) If the microorganism is found on the confidential version of the Inventory, in § 725.239 or in subpart M of this part, EPA will notify the person(s) who
originally reported the microorganism that another person (whose identity will remain confidential, if so requested) has demonstrated a
bona fide
intent to manufacture (including import) or process the microorganism and therefore was told that the microorganism is on the Inventory, in § 725.239, or in subpart M of this part.
(g) A disclosure to a person with a
bona fide
intent to manufacture (including import) or process a particular microorganism that the microorganism is on the Inventory, in § 725.239, or in subpart M of this part will not be considered a public disclosure of confidential business information under section 14 of the Act.
(h) EPA will answer an inquiry on whether a particular microorganism is subject to this part within 30 days after receipt of a complete submission under paragraph (b) of this section.

This subpart describes general administrative procedures applicable to all persons who submit MCANs and exemption requests to EPA under section 5 of the Act for microorganisms.
§ 725.25
General administrative requirements.
(a)
General.
(1) Each person who is subject to the notification provisions of this part must complete, sign, and submit a MCAN or exemption request containing the information as required for the appropriate submission under this part. Except as otherwise provided, each submission must include all referenced attachments. All information in the submission (unless certain attachments appear in the open scientific literature) must be in English. All information submitted must be true and correct.
(2) In addition to specific information required, the submitter should submit all information known to or reasonably ascertainable by the submitter that would permit EPA to make a reasoned evaluation of the human health and environmental effects of the microorganism and any microbial mixture or article that may contain the microorganism.
(b)
Certification.
Persons submitting MCANs and exemption requests to EPA under this part, and material related to their reporting obligations under this part, must attach the following statement to any information submitted to EPA. This statement must be signed and dated by an authorized official of the submitter:
I certify that to the best of my knowledge and belief: The company named in this submission intends to manufacture, import, or process for a commercial purpose, other than in small quantities solely for research and development, the microorganism identified in this submission. All information provided in this submission is complete and truthful as of the date of submission. I am including with this submission all test data in my possession or control and a description of all other data known to or reasonably ascertainable by me as required by 40 CFR 725.160 or 725.260.
(c)
Where to submit information under this part.
MCANs and exemption requests, and any support documents related to these submissions, may only be submitted in a manner set forth in this paragraph. MCANs and exemption requests, and any related support documents, must be generated, completed, and submitted to EPA (via CDX) using e-PMN software. See 40 CFR 720.40(a)(2)(ii) for information on how to obtain e-PMN software.
(d)
General requirements for submission of data.
(1) Submissions under this part must include the information described
in § 725.155, § 725.255, § 725.355, or § 725.455, as appropriate, to the extent such information is known to or reasonably ascertainable by the submitter.
(2) In accordance with § 725.160 or § 725.260, as appropriate, the submission must also include any test data in the submitter's possession or control and descriptions of other data which are known to or reasonably ascertainable by the submitter and which concern the health and environmental effects of the microorganism.
(e)
Agency or joint submissions.
(1) A manufacturer or importer may designate an agent to assist in submitting the MCAN. If so, only the manufacturer or importer, and not the agent, signs the certification on the form.
(2) A manufacturer or importer may authorize another person, (e.g., a supplier or a toll manufacturer) to report some of the information required in the MCAN to EPA on its behalf. The manufacturer or importer should indicate in a cover letter accompanying the MCAN which information will be supplied by another person and identify that other person as a joint submitter where indicated in their MCAN. The other person supplying information (i.e., the joint submitter) may submit the information to EPA either in the MCAN or a Letter of Support, except that if the joint submitter is not incorporated, licensed, or doing business in the United States, the joint submitter must submit the information to EPA in a Letter of Support only, rather than the MCAN. The joint submitter must indicate in the MCAN or Letter of Support the identity of the manufacturer or importer. Any person who submits the MCAN or Letter of Support for a joint submission must sign and certify the MCAN or Letter of Support.
(3) If EPA receives a submission which does not include the information required, which the submitter indicates that it has authorized another person to provide, the review period will not begin until EPA receives all of the required information.
(f)
Microorganisms subject to a section 4 test rule.
(1) Except as provided in paragraph (f)(3) of this section, if a person intends to manufacture or import a new microorganism which is subject to the notification requirements of this part, and the microorganism is subject to a test rule promulgated under section 4 of the Act before the notice is submitted, section 5(b)(1) of the Act requires the person to submit the test data required by the testing rule with the notice. The person must submit the data in the form and manner specified in the test rule and in accordance with § 725.160. If the person does not submit the test data, the submission is incomplete and EPA will follow the procedures in § 725.33.
(2) If EPA has granted the submitter an exemption under section 4(c) of the Act from the requirement to conduct tests and submit data, the person may not file a MCAN or TERA until EPA receives the test data.
(3) If EPA has granted the submitter an exemption under section 4(c) of the Act and if another person previously has submitted the test data to EPA, the exempted person may either submit the test data or provide the following information as part of the notice:
(i) The name, title, and address of the person who submitted the test data to EPA.
(ii) The date the test data were submitted to EPA.
(iii) A citation for the test rule.
(iv) A description of the exemption and a reference identifying it.
(g)
Microorganisms subject to a section 5(b)(4) rule.
(1) If a person:
(i) Intends to manufacture or import a microorganism which is subject to the notification requirements of this part and which is subject to a rule issued under section 5(b)(4) of the Act; and
(ii) Is not required by a rule issued under section 4 of the Act to submit test data for the microorganism before the filing of a submission, the person must submit to EPA data described in paragraph (g)(2) of this section at the time the submission is filed.
(2) Data submitted under paragraph (g)(1) of this section must be data which the person submitting the notice believes show that the manufacture, processing, distribution in commerce, use, and disposal of the microorganism, or any combination of such activities, will not present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment.
(h)
Data that need not be submitted.
Specific data requirements are listed in subparts D, E, F, G, and L of this part. The following is a list of data that need not be submitted under this part:
(1)
Data previously submitted to EPA.
(i) A person need not submit any data previously submitted to EPA with no claims of confidentiality if the new submission includes: the office or person to whom the data were submitted; the date of submission; and, if appropriate, a standard literature citation as specified in § 725.160(a)(3)(ii).
(ii) For data previously submitted to EPA with a claim of confidentiality, the person must resubmit the data with the new submission and any claim of confidentiality, under § 725.80.
(2)
Efficacy data.
This part does not require submission of any data related solely to product efficacy. However, including efficacy data will improve EPA's ability to assess the benefits of the use of the microorganism. This does not exempt a person from submitting any of the data specified in § 725.160 or § 725.260.
(3)
Non-U.S. exposure data.
This part does not require submission of any data which relates only to exposure of humans or the environment outside the United States. This does not exclude nonexposure data such as data on health effects (including epidemiological studies), ecological effects, physical and chemical properties, or environmental fate characteristics.
(i)
Fees.
Persons submitting MCANs and exemption requests to EPA under this part are subject to the applicable fees and conditions specified in §§ 700.40, 700.45(c), and 700.49 of this chapter.

# Subpart C—Confidentiality and Public Access to Information
§ 725.80
General provisions for confidentiality claims.
Claims of confidentiality must be made in accordance with the procedures described in 40 CFR part 703, except as modified in this paragraph. In general, references to “chemical” or “chemical identity” in part 703 are equivalent to “microorganism” or “microorganism identity” for the purposes of this part.
(a) In place of § 703.5(b)(3)(v) of this subchapter, the following question must be answered: Has EPA, another Federal agency, or court made any confidentiality determination regarding information associated with this microorganism? If yes, please provide the circumstances associated with the prior determination, whether the information was found to be entitled to confidential treatment, the entity that made the decision, and the date of the determination.
(b) In place of § 703.5(b)(4) of this subchapter, the following questions apply:
(1) Has the identity of the microorganism been kept confidential to the extent that competitors do not know it is being manufactured or imported into US commerce? If not, explain why the microorganism identity should still be afforded confidential status (e.g., the microorganism is publicly known only as being distributed in commerce for research and development purposes, but no other information about the current commercial distribution of the microorganism in the United States is publicly available).

# Subpart D—Microbial Commercial Activities Notification Requirements
§ 725.100
Scope and purpose.
(a) This subpart establishes procedures for submission of a notice to EPA under section 5(a) of the Act for persons who manufacture, import, or process microorganisms for commercial purposes. This notice is called a Microbial Commercial Activity Notice (MCAN). It is expected that MCANs will in general only be submitted for microorganisms intended for general commercial use. Persons who manufacture, import, or process a microorganism in small quantities solely for research and development as defined in § 725.3 are not required to submit a notice to EPA. Persons who manufacture, import, or process a microorganism for research and development activities that do not fit the definition of small quantities solely for research and development may nonetheless qualify for more limited reporting requirements in subpart E, including the TERA which can be used for review of research and development involving environmental release.
(b) Persons subject to MCAN submission are described in § 725.105.
(c) Exclusions and exemptions specific to MCAN submissions are described in § 725.110.
(d) Submission requirements applicable specifically to MCANs are described at § 725.150.
(e) Data requirements for MCANs are set forth in §§ 725.155 and 725.160.
(f) EPA review procedures specific to MCANs are set forth in § 725.170.

(a)
Manufacturers of new microorganisms.
(1) MCAN submission is required for any person who intends to manufacture for commercial purposes in the United States a new microorganism. Exclusions are described in § 725.110.
(2) If a person contracts with a manufacturer to produce or process a new microorganism and the manufacturer produces or processes the microorganism exclusively for that person, and that person specifies the identity of the microorganism, and controls the total amount produced and the basic technology for the plant process, then that person must submit the MCAN. If it is unclear who must report, EPA should be contacted to determine who must submit the MCAN.
(3) Only manufacturers that are incorporated, licensed, or doing business in the United States may submit a MCAN.
(b)
Importers of new microorganisms.
(1) MCAN submission is required for a person who intends to import into the United States for commercial purposes a new microorganism. Exclusions are described in § 725.110.
(2) When several persons are involved in an import transaction, the MCAN must be submitted by the principal importer. If no one person fits the principal importer definition in a particular transaction, the importer should contact EPA to determine who must submit the MCAN for that transaction.
(3) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, the provisions of this subpart D apply to each person who submits a MCAN for a new microorganism which such person intends to import for a commercial purpose. In addition, each importer must comply with paragraph (b)(4) of this section.
(4) EPA will hold the principal importer, or the importer that EPA determines must submit the MCAN when there is no principal importer under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, liable for complying with this part, for completing the MCAN, and for the completeness and truthfulness of all information which it submits.
(c)
Manufacturers, importers, or processors of microorganisms for a significant new use.
MCAN submission is required for any person who intends to manufacture, import, or process for commercial purposes a microorganism identified as
having one or more significant new uses in subpart M of this part, and who intends either to engage in a designated significant new use of the microorganism or intends to distribute it in commerce. Persons excluded from reporting on significant new uses of microorganisms and additional procedures for reporting are described in subpart L of this part.
§ 725.110
Persons not subject to this subpart.
Persons are not subject to the requirements of this subpart for the following activities:

§ 725.170
EPA review of the MCAN.
General procedures for review of all submissions under this part are contained in §§ 725.28 through 725.60. In addition, the following procedures apply to EPA review of MCANs submitted under this subpart:
(a)
Length of the review period.
The MCAN review period specified in section 5(a) of the Act runs for 90 days from the date EPA receives a complete MCAN, or the date EPA determines the MCAN is complete under § 725.33, unless the Agency extends the period under section 5(c) of the Act and § 725.56.
(b)
Determinations.
(1) Within the applicable review period, EPA will make one of the following five determinations on the microorganism, as set forth in section 5(a)(3) of the Act:
(i) The microorganism presents an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment, as set forth in section 5(a)(3)(A) of the Act.
(ii) Information available to EPA is insufficient to permit a reasoned evaluation of the health and the environmental effects of the microorganism, as set forth in section 5(a)(3)(B)(i) of the Act.
(iii) In the absence of sufficient information to permit EPA to make such an evaluation, the microorganism may present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment, as set forth in section 5(a)(3)(B)(ii)(I) of the Act.
(iv) The microorganism is or will be produced in substantial quantities, and such substance either enters or may reasonably be anticipated to enter the environment in substantial quantities or there is or may be significant or
substantial human exposure to the substance, as set forth in section 5(a)(3)(B)(ii)(II) of the Act.
(v) The microorganism is not likely to present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment, as set forth in section 5(a)(3)(C) of the Act.
(2) EPA will take the following actions required in association with the determination.
(i) For determinations described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, EPA will issue the submitter an order to prohibit or limit the manufacture, processing, distribution in commerce, use, or disposal of the microorganism, or any combination of such activities, to the extent necessary to protect against an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment, as set forth in section 5(f) of the Act, or will issue a proposed rule under section 6(a) of the Act, as set forth in section 5(f) of the Act.
(ii) For determinations described in paragraphs (b)(1)(ii), (iii), or (iv), EPA will issue the submitter an order to prohibit or limit the manufacture, processing, distribution in commerce, use, or disposal of the microorganism, or any combination of such activities, to the extent necessary to protect against an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment, as set forth in section 5(e) of the Act. EPA may issue an order under section 5(e) of the Act that requires certain testing to be conducted and presented to EPA after the applicable review period has concluded.
(iii) Following determinations described in paragraph (b)(1)(v) of this section, EPA will issue the submitter a document containing EPA's final determination and will submit for publication in the
Federal Register
a statement of the finding, as set forth in section 5(g) of the Act. Upon EPA's issuance of the determination document, the submitter may commence the manufacture of the microorganism without waiting for the end of the applicable review period.
(3) EPA may modify or revoke the prohibitions and limitations in an order issued under paragraph (b)(2)(i) or (ii) of this section after the applicable review period has ended if EPA receives additional information, testing, studies, or reports that EPA determines, upon review, demonstrate that such prohibitions or limitations are no longer necessary to protect against an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment. Where such information demonstrates that the prohibitions or limitations of the order are not sufficient to protect against an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment, EPA may modify the order or take other action, as appropriate, to the extent necessary to protect against such risk.
(4) No person submitting an MCAN in response to the requirements of this subpart may manufacture a microorganism subject to this subpart until EPA has issued a determination in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of this section and taken the associated action required under paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
[62 FR 17932, Apr. 11, 1997, as amended by 89 FR 102799, Dec. 18, 2024]
§ 725.190
Notice of commencement of manufacture or import.
(a)
Applicability.
Any person who commences the manufacture or import of a new microorganism for nonexempt, commercial purposes for which that person previously submitted a section 5(a) notice under this part must submit a notice of commencement (NOC) of manufacture or import.
(b)
When to report.
(1) If manufacture or import for nonexempt, commercial purposes begins on or after May 27, 1997, the submitter must submit the NOC to EPA no later than 30 calendar days after the first day of such manufacture or import.
(2) If manufacture or import for nonexempt, commercial purposes began or will begin before May 27, 1997, the submitter must submit the NOC by May 27, 1997.
(3) Submission of an NOC prior to the commencement of manufacture or import is a violation of section 15 of the Act.
(c)
Information to be reported.
The NOC must contain the following information: Specific microorganism identity, MCAN number, and the date when manufacture or import commences. If the person claims any information on
the form as confidential, the claim must be asserted and substantiated in accordance with the requirements described in part 703 of this subchapter and § 725.80, as indicated in EPA Form 7710-56. If the submitter wants the microorganism identity to be listed on the confidential portion of the TSCA Inventory, the microorganism identity must be claimed as confidential and also follow the certification, substantiation, and generic name requirements described in part 703 of this subchapter and paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section.
(d)
How to submit.
All notices of commencement must be generated, completed, and submitted to EPA (via CDX) using e-PMN software. See 40 CFR 720.40(a)(2)(ii) for information on how to obtain e-PMN software.
(e)
Requirements for assertion.
Any person who asserts a confidentiality claim for microorganism identity must:
(1) Comply with the requirements of paragraph (f) of this section regarding submission of a generic name.
(2) Agree that EPA may disclose to a person with a
bona fide
intent to manufacture or import the microorganism the fact that the particular microorganism is included on the confidential TSCA Inventory for purposes of notification under section 5(a)(1)(A) of the Act.
(3) Have available and agree to furnish to EPA upon request the taxonomic designations and supplemental information required by § 725.12.
(4) Make claims of confidentiality in accordance with the procedures described in 40 CFR part 703.
(f)
Generic name.
If a submitter asserts a claim of confidentiality for microorganism identity in a notice of commencement, they must provide a generic name.
(1) Generic names must:
(i) Be structurally descriptive (e.g., not a trade name); and
(ii) Be consistent with guidance on the determination of structurally descriptive generic names, developed in accordance with section 14(c)(4)(A) of the Act (e.g.,
Guidance for Creating Generic Names for Confidential Chemical Substance Identity Reporting under TSCA
). Generic names for microorganisms may only mask the portion of microorganism identity that the submitter believes is proprietary (considering that the identity of a microorganism to be listed on the TSCA Inventory must include taxonomic designations (genus, species, and strain), key phenotypic traits, key genotypic traits and modifications, genetic material that has been introduced or modified, any vector constructs used, cellular location of introduced or modified genes, number and type of genes introduced or modified, and method of construction or modification). Taxonomic designation (in most cases down to strain) must be included in the generic name except where the submitter claims the taxonomic designation confidential, in which case the person making such claim must provide an explanation of why such masking is necessary to protect proprietary information. Additionally, the generic microorganism identity must include a statement regarding the function and stability of the genetic construct. This includes an indication of whether the introduced or modified genes are present on the chromosome or extrachromosomal.
(2) Generic names will be reviewed by EPA at the time of submission.
(i) If EPA concludes that a proposed generic name meets the criteria in paragraph (f)(1) of this section, EPA will include that generic name in the public TSCA Inventory listing for that substance.
(ii) If the proposed generic name does not meet the criteria in paragraph (f)(1) of this section, EPA will notify the submitter concerning the deficiency via CDX, as described in § 703.5(h) of this subchapter. EPA will provide ten business days to correct the deficiency and provide an alternative generic name that would be acceptable to EPA. If the alternative generic name proposed by EPA is acceptable to the submitter (or if the submitter does not respond within the ten-day period), EPA will place that alternative generic name on the public TSCA Inventory. If the alternative generic name proposed by EPA is not acceptable to the submitter, the submitter must submit a revised generic
name that meets the criteria in paragraph (f)(1) of this section and an explanation of how EPA's proposed generic name reveals confidential information. If EPA concludes that the revised generic name also does not meet the criteria in paragraph (f)(1) of this section, EPA will hold the notice of commencement for a period of up to 10 business days. Reporting requirements will not be considered to have been met and the microorganism will not be added to the TSCA Inventory during this period. If the submission remains deficient after this 10-day period, EPA will proceed with CBI review of the microorganism identity claim and will likely deny the claim.

§ 725.421
Introduced genetic material.
For a new microorganism to qualify for either exemption under this subpart, introduced genetic material must meet all of the criteria listed in this section.
(a)
Limited in size.
The introduced genetic material must consist only of the following:
(1) The structural gene(s) of interest.
(2) The regulatory sequences permitting the expression of solely the gene(s) of interest.
(3) Associated nucleotide sequences needed to move genetic material, including linkers, homopolymers, adaptors, transposons, insertion sequences, and restriction enzyme sites.
(4) The nucleotide sequences needed for vector transfer.
(5) The nucleotide sequences needed for vector maintenance.
(b)
Well-characterized.
For introduced genetic material, well-characterized means that the following have been determined:
(1) The function of all of the products expressed from the structural gene(s).
(2) The function of sequences that participate in the regulation of expression of the structural gene(s).
(3) The presence or absence of associated nucleotide sequences and their associated functions, where associated nucleotide sequences are those sequences needed to move genetic material including linkers, homopolymers, adaptors, transposons, insertion sequences, and restriction enzyme sites.
(c)
Poorly mobilizable.
The ability of the introduced genetic material to be transferred and mobilized is inactivated, with a resulting frequency of transfer of less than 10
−8
transfer events per recipient.
(d)
Free of certain sequences.
(1) The introduced genetic material must not contain a functional portion of any of the toxin-encoding sequences described in this paragraph (d).
(i) For the purposes of this section, a functional portion of a toxin-encoding sequence means any sequence which codes for a polypeptide that has one of the following effects:
(A) It directly or indirectly contributes to toxic effects in humans. Directly contributes to toxic effects in humans means those sequences encoding polypeptides that have direct toxicity to target cells. An example of a sequence which directly contributes to toxic effects in humans is one which encodes the portion of diphtheria toxin, listed in paragraph (d)(2) of this
section, capable of interacting with elongation factor 2, leading to inhibition of protein synthesis in target respiratory, heart, kidney, and nerve tissues. Indirectly contributes to toxic effects in humans means a sequence whose encoded polypeptide is not directly toxic to target cells, yet still adversely affects humans. An example of a sequence which indirectly contributes to toxic effects is the sequence which encodes the portion of the botulinum toxin, listed in paragraph (d)(3) of this section, capable of blocking the release of acetylcholine from gangliosides. Botulinum toxin affects neuromuscular junctions by its blockage of acetylcholine release, leading to irreversible relaxation of muscles and respiratory arrest.

§ 725.975
EPA approval of alternative control measures.
(a) In certain sections of subpart M of this part, significant new uses for the identified microorganisms are described as the failure to establish and implement programs providing for the use of either: specific measures to control worker exposure to or release of microorganisms which are identified in such sections, or alternative measures to control worker exposure or environmental release which EPA has determined provide substantially the same degree of protection as the specified control measures. Persons who manufacture, import, or process a microorganism identified in such sections and who intend to employ alternative measures to control worker exposure or environmental release must submit a request to EPA for a determination of equivalency before commencing manufacture, import, or processing involving the alternative control measures.
(b) Persons submitting a request for a determination of equivalency to EPA under this part must submit the request to EPA (via CDX) using e-PMN software. See 40 CFR 720.40(a)(2)(ii) for information on how to obtain e-PMN software. Support documents related to these requests must also be submitted to EPA via CDX using e-PMN software. A request for a determination of equivalency must contain:
(1) The name of the submitter.
(2) The specific identity of the microorganism.
(3) The citation for the specific section in subpart M of this part which pertains to the microorganism for which the request is being submitted.
(4) A detailed description of the activities involved.
(5) The specifications of the alternative worker exposure control measures or environmental release control measures.
(6) A detailed analysis explaining why such alternative control measures provide substantially the same degree of protection as the specific control measures identified in the specific section in subpart M of this part which pertains to the microorganism for which the request is being submitted.
(7) The data and information described in §§ 725.155 and 725.160. If such data and information have already been submitted to EPA's Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics, the submitter need only document that it was previously submitted, to whom, and the date it was submitted.
(c) Requests for determinations of equivalency will be reviewed by EPA within 45 days. Determinations under this paragraph will be made by the Director, or a designee. Notice of the results of such determinations will be mailed to the submitter.
(d) If EPA notifies the submitter under paragraph (c) of this section that EPA has determined that the alternative control measures provide substantially the same degree of protection as the specified control measures identified in the specific section of subpart M of this part which pertains to the microorganism for which the request is being submitted, the submitter may commence manufacture, import, or processing in accordance with the specifications for alternative worker exposure control measures or environmental release control measures identified in the submitter's request, and may alter any corresponding notification to workers to reflect such alternative controls. Deviations from the activities described in the EPA notification constitute a significant new use and are subject to the requirements of this part.
[62 FR 17932, Apr. 11, 1997, as amended at 75 FR 790, Jan. 6, 2010; 78 FR 72828, Dec. 4, 2013]
§ 725.980
Expedited procedures for issuing significant new use rules for microorganisms subject to section 5(e) orders.
(a)
Selection of microorganisms.
(1) In accordance with the expedited process specified in this section, EPA will issue significant new use notification requirements for each new microorganism that, after MCAN review under subpart D of this part, becomes subject to a final order issued under section 5(e) of the Act, except for an order that prohibits manufacture and import of the microorganism, unless EPA determines that significant new use notification requirements are not needed for the microorganism.
(2) If EPA determines that significant new use notifications requirements are not needed for a microorganism that is subject to a final order issued under section 5(e) of the Act, EPA will issue a notice in the
Federal Register
explaining why the significant new use requirements are not needed.
(b)
Designation of requirements.
(1) The significant new use notification and other specific requirements will be based on and be consistent with the provisions included in the final order issued for the microorganism under section 5(e) of the Act. EPA may also designate additional activities as significant new uses which will be subject to notification.
(2) Significant new use requirements and other specific requirements designated under this section will be listed in subpart M of this part. For each microorganism, subpart M of this part will identify:
(i) The microorganism name.
(ii) The activities designated as significant new uses.
(iii) Other specific requirements applicable to the microorganism, including recordkeeping requirements or any other requirements included in the final section 5(e) order.
(c)
Procedures for issuing significant new use rules
—(1)
Possible processes.
EPA will issue significant new use rules (SNURs) under this section by one of the following three processes: direct final rulemaking, interim final rulemaking, or notice and comment rulemaking. EPA will use the direct final rulemaking process to issue significant new use rules unless it determines that, in a particular case, one of the other processes is more appropriate.
(2)
Notice in the Federal Register.
Federal Register
documents issued to propose or establish significant new uses under this section will contain the following:
(i) The microorganism identity or, if its specific identity is claimed confidential, an appropriate generic microorganism name and an accession number assigned by EPA.
(ii) The MCAN number.
(iii) A summary of EPA's findings under section 5(e)(1)(A) of the Act for the final order issued under section 5(e).
(iv) Designation of the significant new uses subject to, or proposed to be subject to, notification and any other applicable requirements.
(v) Any modification of subpart L of this part applicable to the specific microorganism and significant new uses.
(vi) If the
Federal Register
document establishes a final rule, or notifies the public that a final rule will not be issued after public comment has been received, the document will describe comments received and EPA's response.
(3)
Direct final rulemaking.
(i) EPA will use direct final rulemaking to issue a significant new use rule, when specific requirements will be based on and be consistent with the provisions included in the final order issued for the microorganism under section 5(e) of the Act. EPA will issue a final rule in the
Federal Register
following its decision to develop a significant new use rule under this section for a specific new microorganism.
(ii) The
Federal Register
document will state that, unless written notice is received by EPA within 30 days of publication that someone wishes to submit adverse or critical comments, the rule will be effective 60 days from the date of publication. The written notice of intent to submit adverse or critical comments should state which SNUR(s) will be the subject of the adverse or critical comments, if several SNURs are established through the direct final rule. If notice is received within 30 days that someone wishes to submit adverse or critical comments, the section(s) of the direct final rule containing the SNUR(s) for which a notice of intent to comment was received will be withdrawn by EPA issuing a document in the final rule section of the
Federal Register,
and a proposal will be published in the proposed rule section of the
Federal Register.
The proposal will establish a 30-day comment period.
(iii) If EPA, having considered any timely comments submitted in response to the proposal, decides to establish notification requirements under this section, EPA will issue a
final rule adding the microorganism to subpart M of this part and designating the significant new uses subject to notification.
(4)
Interim final rulemaking.
(i) EPA will use the interim final rulemaking procedure to issue a significant new use rule, when specific requirements will be based on and be consistent with the provisions included in the final order issued for the microorganism under section 5(e) of the Act. The Agency will issue an interim final rule in the
Federal Register
following its decision to develop a significant new use rule for a specific new microorganism. The document will state EPA's reasons for using the interim final rulemaking procedure.
(A) The significant new use rule will take effect on the date of publication.
(B) Persons will be given 30 days from the date of publication to submit comments.
(ii) Interim final rules issued under this section shall cease to be in effect 180 days after publication unless, within the 180-day period, EPA issues a final rule in the
Federal Register
responding to any written comments received during the 30-day comment period specified in paragraph (c)(4)(i)(B) of this section and promulgating final significant new use notification requirements and other requirements for the microorganism.
(5)
Notice and comment rulemaking.
(i) EPA will use a notice and comment procedure to issue a significant new use rule, when EPA is designating additional activities which are not provisions included in the final order issued for the microorganism under section 5(e) of the Act as significant new uses which will be subject to notification. EPA will issue a proposal in the
Federal Register
following its decision to develop a significant new use rule under this section for a specific new microorganism. Persons will be given 30 days to comment on whether EPA should establish notification requirements for the microorganism under this part.
(ii) If EPA, having considered any timely comments, decides to establish notification requirements under this section, EPA will issue a final rule adding the microorganism to subpart M of this part and designating the significant new uses subject to notification.
(d)
Schedule for issuing significant new use rules.
(1) Unless EPA determines that a significant new use rule should not be issued under this section, EPA will issue a proposed rule, a direct final rule, or an interim final rule within 180 days of receipt of a valid notice of commencement under § 725.190.
(2) If EPA receives adverse or critical significant comments following publication of a proposed or interim final rule, EPA will either withdraw the rule or issue a final rule addressing the comments received.
§ 725.984
Modification or revocation of certain notification requirements.
(a)
Criteria for modification or revocation.
EPA may at any time modify or revoke significant new use notification requirements for a microorganism which has been added to subpart M of this part using the procedures of § 725.980. Such action may be taken under this section if EPA makes one of the following determinations, unless other information shows that the requirements should be retained:
(1) Test data or other information obtained by EPA provide a reasonable basis for concluding that activities designated as significant new uses of the microorganism will not present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment.
(2) EPA has promulgated a rule under section 4 or 6 of the Act, or EPA or another agency has taken action under another law, for the microorganism that eliminates the need for significant new use notification under section 5(a)(2) of the Act.
(3) EPA has received MCANs for some or all of the activities designated as significant new uses of the microorganism and, after reviewing such MCANs, concluded that there is no need to require additional notice from persons who propose to engage in identical or similar activities.
(4) EPA has examined new information, or has reexamined the test data or other information supporting its finding under section 5(e)(1)(A)(ii)(I) of the Act and has concluded that a rational basis no longer exists for the findings that activities involving the
microorganism may present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment required under section 5(e)(1)(A) of the Act.
(5) Certain activities involving the microorganism have been designated as significant new uses pending the completion of testing, and adequate test data developed in accordance with applicable procedures and criteria have been submitted to EPA.
(b)
Procedures for limitation or revocation.
Modification or revocation of significant new use notification requirements for a microorganism that has been added to subpart M of this part using the procedures described in § 725.980 may occur either at EPA's initiative or in response to a written request.
(1) Any affected person may request modification or revocation of significant new use notification requirements for a microorganism that has been added to subpart M of this part using the procedures described in § 725.980. The request must be accompanied by information sufficient to support the request. Persons submitting a request to EPA under this part must submit the request to EPA (via CDX) using e-PMN software. See 40 CFR 720.40(a)(2)(ii) for information on how to obtain e-PMN software. Support documents related to these requests must also be submitted to EPA via CDX using e-PMN software.
(2) The Director, or a designee, will consider the request, make a determination whether to initiate rulemaking to modify the requirements, and notify the requester of that determination by certified letter. If the request is denied, the letter will explain why EPA has concluded that the significant new use notification requirements for that microorganism should remain in effect.
(3) If EPA concludes that significant new use notification requirements for a microorganism should be limited or revoked, EPA will propose the changes in a notice in the
Federal Register,
briefly describe the grounds for the action, and provide interested parties an opportunity to comment.

[66 FR 1237, Jan. 5, 2001, as amended at 89 FR 89456, Nov. 12, 2024]
§ 745.63
Definitions.
The following definitions apply to part 745.
Arithmetic mean
means the algebraic sum of data values divided by the number of data values (e.g., the sum of the concentration of lead in several soil samples divided by the number of samples).
Chewable surface
means an interior or exterior surface painted with lead-based paint that a young child can mouth or chew. A chewable surface is the same as an “accessible surface” as defined in 42 U.S.C. 4851b(2)). Hard metal substrates and other materials that cannot be dented by the bite of a young child are not considered chewable.
Common area group
means a group of common areas that are similar in design, construction, and function. Common area groups include, but are not limited to hallways, stairwells, and laundry rooms.
Concentration
means the relative content of a specific substance contained within a larger mass, such as the amount of lead (in micrograms per gram or parts per million by weight) in a sample of dust or soil.
Deteriorated paint
means any interior or exterior paint or other coating that is peeling, chipping, chalking or cracking, or any paint or coating located on an interior or exterior surface or fixture that is otherwise damaged or separated from the substrate.
Dripline
means the area within 3 feet surrounding the perimeter of a building.
Friction surface
means an interior or exterior surface that is subject to abrasion or friction, including, but not limited to, certain window, floor, and stair surfaces.
Impact surface
means an interior or exterior surface that is subject to damage by repeated sudden force such as certain parts of door frames.
Interior window sill
means the portion of the horizontal window ledge that protrudes into the interior of the room.
Lead-based paint hazard
means hazardous lead-based paint, dust-lead hazard or soil-lead hazard as identified in § 745.65.
Loading
means the quantity of a specific substance present per unit of surface area, such as the amount of lead in micrograms contained in the dust collected from a certain surface area divided by the surface area in square feet or square meters.
Mid-yard
means an area of a residential yard approximately midway between the dripline of a residential building and the nearest property boundary or between the driplines of a residential building and another building on the same property.
Play area
means an area of frequent soil contact by children of less than 6 years of age as indicated by, but not limited to, such factors including the following: the presence of play equipment (e.g., sandboxes, swing sets, and sliding boards), toys, or other children's possessions, observations of play patterns, or information provided by parents, residents, care givers, or property owners.
Reportable level
means the lowest analyte concentration (or amount) that does not contain a “less than” qualifier and that is reported with confidence for a specific method by a laboratory recognized by EPA under TSCA section 405(b).
Residential building
means a building containing one or more residential dwellings.
Room
means a separate part of the inside of a building, such as a bedroom, living room, dining room, kitchen, bathroom, laundry room, or utility room. To be considered a separate room, the room must be separated from adjoining rooms by built-in walls or archways that extend at least 6 inches from an intersecting wall. Half walls or bookcases count as room separators if built-in. Movable or collapsible partitions or partitions consisting solely of shelves or cabinets are not considered built-in walls. A screened in porch that is used as a living area is a room.
Soil sample
means a sample collected in a representative location using ASTM E1727, “Standard Practice for Field Collection of Soil Samples for Lead Determination by Atomic Spectrometry Techniques,” or equivalent method.
Weighted arithmetic mean
means the arithmetic mean of sample results weighted by the number of subsamples in each sample. Its purpose is to give
influence to a sample relative to the surface area it represents. A single surface sample is comprised of a single subsample. A composite sample may contain from two to four subsamples of the same area as each other and of each single surface sample in the composite. The weighted arithmetic mean is obtained by summing, for all samples, the product of the sample's result multiplied by the number of subsamples in the sample, and dividing the sum by the total number of subsamples contained in all samples. For example, the weighted arithmetic mean of a single surface sample containing 60 µg/ft
2
, a composite sample (three subsamples) containing 100 µg/ft
2
, and a composite sample (4 subsamples) containing 110 µg/ft
2
is 100 µg/ft
2
. This result is based on the equation [60 + (3*100) + (4*110)]/(1 + 3 + 4).
Window trough
means, for a typical double-hung window, the portion of the exterior window sill between the interior window sill (or stool) and the frame of the storm window. If there is no storm window, the window trough is the area that receives both the upper and lower window sashes when they are both lowered. The window trough is sometimes referred to as the window “well.”
Wipe sample
means a sample collected by wiping a representative surface of known area, as determined by ASTM E1728, “Standard Practice for Field Collection of Settled Dust Samples Using Wipe Sampling Methods for Lead Determination by Atomic Spectrometry Techniques, or equivalent method, with an acceptable wipe material as defined in ASTM E 1792, “Standard Specification for Wipe Sampling Materials for Lead in Surface Dust.”
Wipe sample
means a sample collected by wiping a representative surface of known area, as determined by ASTM E1728/E1728M-20 (incorporated by reference, see § 745.67), or equivalent method, with an acceptable wipe material as defined in ASTM E1792-20 (incorporated by reference, see § 745.67).
[66 FR 1237, Jan. 5, 2001, as amended at 89 FR 89456, Nov. 12, 2024]
§ 745.65
Lead-based paint hazards.
(a)
Paint-lead hazard.
A paint-lead hazard is any of the following:
(1) Any lead-based paint on a friction surface that is subject to abrasion and where the lead dust levels on the nearest horizontal surface underneath the friction surface (e.g., the window sill, or floor) are equal to or greater than the dust-lead hazard levels identified in paragraph (b) of this section.
(2) Any damaged or otherwise deteriorated lead-based paint on an impact surface that is caused by impact from a related building component (such as a door knob that knocks into a wall or a door that knocks against its door frame.
(3) Any chewable lead-based painted surface on which there is evidence of teeth marks.
(4) Any other deteriorated lead-based paint in any residential building or child-occupied facility or on the exterior of any residential building or child-occupied facility.
(b)
Dust-lead hazard.
Before January 12, 2026, a dust-lead hazard is surface dust in a residential dwelling or child-occupied facility that contains a mass-per-area concentration of lead equal to or exceeding 10 µg/ft
2
for floors or 100 µg/ft
2
for interior window sills based on wipe samples. On or after January 12, 2026, a dust-lead hazard is surface dust in a residential dwelling or child-occupied facility that contains a mass-per-area concentration of any reportable level of lead for floors or for interior window sills based on wipe samples analyzed by an NLLAP-recognized laboratory.
(c)
Soil-lead hazard.
A soil-lead hazard is bare soil on residential real property or on the property of a child-occupied facility that contains total lead equal to or exceeding 400 parts per million (µg/g) in a play area or average of 1,200 parts per million of bare soil in the rest of the yard based on soil samples.
(d)
Work practice requirements.
Applicable certification, occupant protection, and clearance requirements and work practice standards are found in regulations issued by EPA at 40 CFR part 745, subpart L and in regulations issued by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) at 24 CFR part 35, subpart R. The work practice standards in those regulations do not apply when treating paint-lead hazards of less than:
(1) Two square feet of deteriorated lead-based paint per room or equivalent,
(2) Twenty square feet of deteriorated paint on the exterior building, or
(3) Ten percent of the total surface area of deteriorated paint on an interior or exterior type of component with a small surface area.

(1) Renovations in target housing or child-occupied facilities in which a written determination has been made by an inspector or risk assessor (certified pursuant to either Federal regulations at § 745.226 or a State or Tribal certification program authorized pursuant to § 745.324) that the components affected by the renovation are free of paint or other surface coatings that contain lead equal to or in excess of 1.0 milligrams/per square centimeter (mg/cm
2
) or 0.5% by weight, where the firm performing the renovation has obtained a copy of the determination.
(2) Renovations in target housing or child-occupied facilities in which a certified renovator, using an EPA recognized test kit as defined in § 745.83 and following the kit manufacturer's instructions, has tested each component affected by the renovation and determined that the components are free of paint or other surface coatings that contain lead equal to or in excess of 1.0 mg/cm
2
or 0.5% by weight. If the components make up an integrated whole, such as the individual stair treads and risers of a single staircase, the renovator is required to test only one of the individual components, unless the individual components appear to have been repainted or refinished separately.
(3) Renovations in target housing or child-occupied facilities in which a certified renovator has collected a paint chip sample from each painted component affected by the renovation and a laboratory recognized by EPA pursuant to section 405(b) of TSCA as being capable of performing analyses for lead compounds in paint chip samples has determined that the samples are free of paint or other surface coatings that contain lead equal to or in excess of 1.0 mg/cm
2
or 0.5% by weight. If the components make up an integrated whole, such as the individual stair treads and risers of a single staircase, the renovator is required to test only one of the individual components, unless the individual components appear to have been repainted or refinished separately.
(b) The information distribution requirements in § 745.84 do not apply to emergency renovations, which are renovation activities that were not planned but result from a sudden, unexpected event (such as non-routine
failures of equipment) that, if not immediately attended to, presents a safety or public health hazard, or threatens equipment and/or property with significant damage. Interim controls performed in response to an elevated blood lead level in a resident child are also emergency renovations. Emergency renovations other than interim controls are also exempt from the warning sign, containment, waste handling, training, and certification requirements in §§ 745.85, 745.89, and 745.90 to the extent necessary to respond to the emergency. Emergency renovations are not exempt from the cleaning requirements of § 745.85(a)(5), which must be performed by certified renovators or individuals trained in accordance with § 745.90(b)(2), the cleaning verification requirements of § 745.85(b), which must be performed by certified renovators, and the recordkeeping requirements of § 745.86(b)(6) and (b)(7).

§ 745.85
Work practice standards.
(a)
Standards for renovation activities.
Renovations must be performed by certified firms using certified renovators as directed in § 745.89. The responsibilities of certified firms are set forth in § 745.89(d) and the responsibilities of certified renovators are set forth in § 745.90(b).
(1)
Occupant protection.
Firms must post signs clearly defining the work area and warning occupants and other persons not involved in renovation activities to remain outside of the work area. To the extent practicable, these signs must be in the primary language of the occupants. These signs must be posted before beginning the renovation and must remain in place and readable until the renovation and the post-renovation cleaning verification have been completed. If warning signs have been posted in accordance with 24 CFR 35.1345(b)(2) or 29 CFR 1926.62(m), additional signs are not required by this section.
(2)
Containing the work area.
Before beginning the renovation, the firm must isolate the work area so that no dust or debris leaves the work area while the renovation is being performed. In addition, the firm must maintain the integrity of the containment by ensuring that any plastic or other impermeable materials are not torn or displaced, and taking any other steps necessary to ensure that no dust or debris leaves the work area while the renovation is being performed. The firm must also ensure that containment is installed in such a manner that it does not interfere with occupant and worker egress in an emergency.
(i)
Interior renovations.
The firm must:
(A) Remove all objects from the work area, including furniture, rugs, and window coverings, or cover them with plastic sheeting or other impermeable material with all seams and edges taped or otherwise sealed.
(B) Close and cover all ducts opening in the work area with taped-down plastic sheeting or other impermeable material.
(C) Close windows and doors in the work area. Doors must be covered with plastic sheeting or other impermeable material. Doors used as an entrance to the work area must be covered with plastic sheeting or other impermeable material in a manner that allows workers to pass through while confining dust and debris to the work area.
(D) Cover the floor surface, including installed carpet, with taped-down plastic sheeting or other impermeable material in the work area 6 feet beyond the perimeter of surfaces undergoing renovation or a sufficient distance to contain the dust, whichever is greater. Floor containment measures may stop at the edge of the vertical barrier when using a vertical containment system consisting of impermeable barriers that extend from the floor to the ceiling and are tightly sealed at joints with the floor, ceiling and walls.
(E) Use precautions to ensure that all personnel, tools, and other items, including the exteriors of containers of waste, are free of dust and debris before leaving the work area.
(ii)
Exterior renovations.
The firm must:
(A) Close all doors and windows within 20 feet of the renovation. On multi-story buildings, close all doors and windows within 20 feet of the renovation on the same floor as the renovation, and close all doors and windows on all floors below that are the same horizontal distance from the renovation.
(B) Ensure that doors within the work area that will be used while the job is being performed are covered with plastic sheeting or other impermeable material in a manner that allows workers to pass through while confining dust and debris to the work area.
(C) Cover the ground with plastic sheeting or other disposable impermeable material extending 10 feet beyond the perimeter of surfaces undergoing renovation or a sufficient distance to collect falling paint debris, whichever is greater, unless the property line prevents 10 feet of such ground covering. Ground containment measures may stop at the edge of the vertical barrier when using a vertical containment system.
(D) If the renovation will affect surfaces within 10 feet of the property line, the renovation firm must erect vertical containment or equivalent extra precautions in containing the work area to ensure that dust and debris from the renovation does not contaminate adjacent buildings or migrate to adjacent properties. Vertical containment or equivalent extra precautions in containing the work area may also be necessary in other situations in order to prevent contamination of other buildings, other areas of the property, or adjacent buildings or properties.
(3)
Prohibited and restricted practices.
The work practices listed below are prohibited or restricted during a renovation as follows:
(i) Open-flame burning or torching of painted surfaces is prohibited.
(ii) The use of machines designed to remove paint or other surface coatings through high speed operation such as sanding, grinding, power planing, needle gun, abrasive blasting, or sandblasting, is prohibited on painted surfaces unless such machines have shrouds or containment systems and are equipped with a HEPA vacuum attachment to collect dust and debris at the point of generation. Machines must be operated so that no visible dust or release of air occurs outside the shroud or containment system.
(iii) Operating a heat gun on painted surfaces is permitted only at temperatures below 1,100 degrees Fahrenheit.
(4)
Waste from renovations.
(i) Waste from renovation activities must be contained to prevent releases of dust and debris before the waste is removed from the work area for storage or disposal. If a chute is used to remove waste from the work area, it must be covered.
(ii) At the conclusion of each work day and at the conclusion of the renovation, waste that has been collected from renovation activities must be stored under containment, in an enclosure, or behind a barrier that prevents release of dust and debris out of the work area and prevents access to dust and debris.
(iii) When the firm transports waste from renovation activities, the firm must contain the waste to prevent release of dust and debris.
(5)
Cleaning the work area.
After the renovation has been completed, the firm must clean the work area until no dust, debris or residue remains.
(i)
Interior and exterior renovations.
The firm must:
(A) Collect all paint chips and debris and, without dispersing any of it, seal this material in a heavy-duty bag.
(B) Remove the protective sheeting. Mist the sheeting before folding it, fold the dirty side inward, and either tape shut to seal or seal in heavy-duty bags. Sheeting used to isolate contaminated rooms from non-contaminated rooms must remain in place until after the cleaning and removal of other sheeting. Dispose of the sheeting as waste.
(ii)
Additional cleaning for interior renovations.
The firm must clean all objects and surfaces in the work area and within 2 feet of the work area in the
following manner, cleaning from higher to lower:
(A)
Walls.
Clean walls starting at the ceiling and working down to the floor by either vacuuming with a HEPA vacuum or wiping with a damp cloth.
(B)
Remaining surfaces.
Thoroughly vacuum all remaining surfaces and objects in the work area, including furniture and fixtures, with a HEPA vacuum. The HEPA vacuum must be equipped with a beater bar when vacuuming carpets and rugs.
(C) Wipe all remaining surfaces and objects in the work area, except for carpeted or upholstered surfaces, with a damp cloth. Mop uncarpeted floors thoroughly, using a mopping method that keeps the wash water separate from the rinse water, such as the 2-bucket mopping method, or using a wet mopping system.
(b)
Standards for post-renovation cleaning verification
—(1)
Interiors.
(i) A certified renovator must perform a visual inspection to determine whether dust, debris or residue is still present. If dust, debris or residue is present, these conditions must be removed by re-cleaning and another visual inspection must be performed.
(ii) After a successful visual inspection, a certified renovator must:
(A) Verify that each windowsill in the work area has been adequately cleaned, using the following procedure.
(
1
) Wipe the windowsill with a wet disposable cleaning cloth that is damp to the touch. If the cloth matches or is lighter than the cleaning verification card, the windowsill has been adequately cleaned.
(
2
) If the cloth does not match and is darker than the cleaning verification card, re-clean the windowsill as directed in paragraphs (a)(5)(ii)(B) and (a)(5)(ii)(C) of this section, then either use a new cloth or fold the used cloth in such a way that an unused surface is exposed, and wipe the surface again. If the cloth matches or is lighter than the cleaning verification card, that windowsill has been adequately cleaned.
(
3
) If the cloth does not match and is darker than the cleaning verification card, wait for 1 hour or until the surface has dried completely, whichever is longer.
(
4
)After waiting for the windowsill to dry, wipe the windowsill with a dry disposable cleaning cloth. After this wipe, the windowsill has been adequately cleaned.
(B) Wipe uncarpeted floors and countertops within the work area with a wet disposable cleaning cloth. Floors must be wiped using an application device with a long handle and a head to which the cloth is attached. The cloth must remain damp at all times while it is being used to wipe the surface for post-renovation cleaning verification. If the surface within the work area is greater than 40 square feet, the surface within the work area must be divided into roughly equal sections that are each less than 40 square feet. Wipe each such section separately with a new wet disposable cleaning cloth. If the cloth used to wipe each section of the surface within the work area matches the cleaning verification card, the surface has been adequately cleaned.
(
1
) If the cloth used to wipe a particular surface section does not match the cleaning verification card, re-clean that section of the surface as directed in paragraphs (a)(5)(ii)(B) and (a)(5)(ii)(C) of this section, then use a new wet disposable cleaning cloth to wipe that section again. If the cloth matches the cleaning verification card, that section of the surface has been adequately cleaned.
(
2
) If the cloth used to wipe a particular surface section does not match the cleaning verification card after the surface has been re-cleaned, wait for 1 hour or until the entire surface within the work area has dried completely, whichever is longer.
(
3
) After waiting for the entire surface within the work area to dry, wipe each section of the surface that has not yet achieved post-renovation cleaning verification with a dry disposable cleaning cloth. After this wipe, that section of the surface has been adequately cleaned.
(iii) When the work area passes the post-renovation cleaning verification, remove the warning signs.
(2)
Exteriors.
A certified renovator must perform a visual inspection to determine whether dust, debris or residue is still present on surfaces in and below the work area, including windowsills
and the ground. If dust, debris or residue is present, these conditions must be eliminated and another visual inspection must be performed. When the area passes the visual inspection, remove the warning signs.
(c)
Optional dust clearance testing.
Cleaning verification need not be performed if the contract between the renovation firm and the person contracting for the renovation or another Federal, State, Territorial, Tribal, or local law or regulation requires:
(1) The renovation firm to perform dust clearance sampling at the conclusion of a renovation covered by this subpart.
(2) The dust clearance samples are required to be collected by a certified inspector, risk assessor or dust sampling technician.
(3) The renovation firm is required to re-clean the work area until the dust sample results are below the dust-lead action levels in § 745.227(e)(8) or any applicable State, Territorial, Tribal, or local standard.
(d)
Activities conducted after post-renovation cleaning verification.
Activities that do not disturb paint, such as applying paint to walls that have already been prepared, are not regulated by this subpart if they are conducted after post-renovation cleaning verification has been performed.
[73 FR 21761, Apr. 22, 2008, as amended at 76 FR 47938, Aug. 5, 2011; 89 FR 89457, Nov. 12, 2024]

Firm certification.
(a)
Initial certification.
(1) Firms that perform renovations for compensation must electronically apply to EPA for certification to perform renovations or dust sampling. To apply, a firm must submit to EPA a completed “Application for Firms,” signed by an authorized agent of the firm, and pay electronically at least the correct amount of fees. If a firm pays more than the correct amount of fees, EPA will reimburse the firm for the excess amount.
(2) After EPA receives a firm's application, EPA will take one of the following actions within 90 days of the date the application is received:
(i) EPA will approve a firm's application if EPA determines that it is complete and that the environmental compliance history of the firm, its principals, or its key employees does not show an unwillingness or inability to maintain compliance with environmental statutes or regulations. An application is complete if it contains all of the information requested on the form and includes at least the correct amount of fees. When EPA approves a firm's application, EPA will issue the firm a certificate with an expiration date not more than 5 years from the date the application is approved. EPA certification allows the firm to perform renovations covered by this section in any State or Indian Tribal area that does not have a renovation program that is authorized under subpart Q of this part.
(ii) EPA will request a firm to supplement its application if EPA determines that the application is incomplete. If EPA requests a firm to supplement its application, the firm must submit the requested information or pay the additional fees within 30 days of the date of the request.
(iii) EPA will not approve a firm's application if the firm does not supplement its application in accordance with paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section or if EPA determines that the environmental compliance history of the firm, its principals, or its key employees demonstrates an unwillingness or inability to maintain compliance with environmental statutes or regulations. EPA will send the firm a letter giving the reason for not approving the application. EPA will not refund the application fees. A firm may reapply for certification at any time by filing a new, complete application that includes the correct amount of fees.
(b)
Re-certification.
To maintain its certification, a firm must be re-certified by EPA every 5 years.
(1)
Timely and complete application.
To be re-certified, a firm must submit a complete electronic application for re-certification. A complete application for re-certification includes a completed “Application for Firms” which contains all of the information requested by the form and is signed by an authorized agent of the firm, noting on the form that it is submitted as a re-certification. A complete application must also include at least the correct amount of fees. If a firm pays more than the correct amount of fees, EPA will reimburse the firm for the excess amount.
(i) An application for re-certification is timely if it is electronically submitted 90 days or more before the date the firm's current certification expires. If the firm's application is complete and timely, the firm's current certification will remain in effect until its expiration date or until EPA has made a final decision to approve or disapprove the re-certification application, whichever is later.
(ii) If the firm submits a complete re-certification application less than 90 days before its current certification expires, and EPA does not approve the application before the expiration date, the firm's current certification will expire and the firm will not be able to conduct renovations until EPA approves its re-certification application.
(iii) If the firm fails to obtain recertification before the firm's current certification expires, the firm must not perform renovations or dust sampling until it is certified anew pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section.
(2)
EPA action on an application.
After EPA receives a firm's application for re-certification, EPA will review the
application and take one of the following actions within 90 days of receipt:
(i) EPA will approve a firm's application if EPA determines that it is timely and complete and that the environmental compliance history of the firm, its principals, or its key employees does not show an unwillingness or inability to maintain compliance with environmental statutes or regulations. When EPA approves a firm's application for re-certification, EPA will issue the firm a new certificate with an expiration date 5 years from the date that the firm's current certification expires. EPA certification allows the firm to perform renovations or dust sampling covered by this section in any State or Indian Tribal area that does not have a renovation program that is authorized under subpart Q of this part.
(ii) EPA will request a firm to supplement its application if EPA determines that the application is incomplete.
(iii) EPA will not approve a firm's application if it is not received or is not complete as of the date that the firm's current certification expires, or if EPA determines that the environmental compliance history of the firm, its principals, or its key employees demonstrates an unwillingness or inability to maintain compliance with environmental statutes or regulations. EPA will send the firm a letter giving the reason for not approving the application. EPA will not refund the application fees. A firm may reapply for certification at any time by filing a new application and paying the correct amount of fees.
(c)
Amendment of certification.
A firm must amend its certification within 90 days of the date a change occurs to information included in the firm's most recent application. If the firm fails to amend its certification within 90 days of the date the change occurs, the firm may not perform renovations or dust sampling until its certification is amended.
(1) To amend certification, a firm must electronically submit a completed “Application for Firms,” signed by an authorized agent of the firm, noting on the form that it is submitted as an amendment and indicating the information that has changed. The firm must also pay at least the correct amount of fees.
(2) If additional information is needed to process the amendment, or the firm did not pay the correct amount of fees, EPA will request the firm to submit the necessary information or fees. The firm's certification is not amended until the firm complies with the request.
(3) Amending a certification does not affect the certification expiration date.

(3) Individuals who have successfully completed an accredited lead-based paint inspector or risk assessor course before October 4, 2011 may take an accredited refresher dust sampling technician course in lieu of the initial training to become a certified dust sampling technician. Individuals who are currently certified as lead-based paint inspectors or risk assessors may act as certified dust sampling technicians without further training.
(4) To maintain renovator certification or dust sampling technician certification, an individual must complete a renovator or dust sampling technician refresher course accredited by EPA under § 745.225 or by a State or Tribal program that is authorized under Subpart Q of this part within 5 years of the date the individual completed the initial course described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. If the individual does not complete a refresher course within this time, the individual must re-take the initial course to become certified again. Individuals who take a renovator refresher course that does not include hands-on training will be certified for 3 years from the date they complete the training. Individuals who take a refresher training course that includes hands-on training will be certified for 5 years. Individuals who take the renovator refresher without hands-on training must, for their next refresher course, take a refresher course that includes hands-on training to maintain renovator certification.
(b)
Renovator responsibilities.
Certified renovators are responsible for ensuring compliance with § 745.85 at all renovations to which they are assigned. A certified renovator:

Such an order is a final agency action which may be subject to judicial review. The order must contain the commencement date and duration of the suspension, revocation, or modification.
(4) If EPA determines that the public health, interest, or welfare warrants immediate action to suspend the certification of any individual or firm prior to the opportunity for a hearing, it will:
(i) Notify the affected entity in accordance with paragraph (b)(1)(i) through (b)(1)(iii) of this section, explaining why it is necessary to suspend the entity's certification before an opportunity for a hearing.
(ii) Notify the affected entity of its right to request a hearing on the immediate suspension within 15 days of the suspension taking place and the procedures for the conduct of such a hearing.
(5) Any notice, decision, or order issued by EPA under this section, any transcript or other verbatim record of oral testimony, and any documents filed by a certified individual or firm in
a hearing under this section will be available to the public, except as otherwise provided by section 14 of TSCA or by part 2 of this title. Any such hearing at which oral testimony is presented will be open to the public, except that the Presiding Officer may exclude the public to the extent necessary to allow presentation of information which may be entitled to confidential treatment under section 14 of TSCA or part 2 of this title.
(6) EPA will maintain a publicly available list of entities whose certification has been suspended, revoked, modified, or reinstated.
(7) Unless the decision and order issued under paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section specify otherwise:

If the residual lead level in a single surface dust sample equals or exceeds the applicable action level or if the residual lead level in a composite dust sample equals or exceeds the applicable action level divided by half the number of subsamples in the composite sample, the components represented by the failed sample shall be recleaned and retested.
(viii) Before January 12, 2026, the action levels for lead in dust are 10 µg/ft
2
for floors, 100 µg/ft
2
for interior window sills, and 400 µg/ft
2
for window troughs. On or after January 12, 2026, the action levels for lead in dust are 5 µg/ft
2
for floors, 40 µg/ft
2
for interior window sills, and 100 µg/ft
2
for window troughs.
(9) In a multi-family dwelling with similarly constructed and maintained residential dwellings, random sampling for the purposes of post-abatement testing may be conducted provided:
(i) The certified individuals who abate or clean the residential dwellings do not know which residential dwelling will be selected for the random sample.
(ii) A sufficient number of residential dwellings are selected for dust sampling to provide a 95 percent level of confidence that no more than 5 percent or 50 of the residential dwellings (whichever is smaller) in the randomly sampled population exceed the appropriate action levels.
(iii) The randomly selected residential dwellings shall be sampled and evaluated according to the post-abatement testing procedures found in paragraph (e)(8) of this section.
(10) An abatement report shall be prepared by a certified supervisor or project designer. The abatement report shall include the following information:

(v) The results of post-abatement dust-lead testing and all soil analyses (if applicable) and the name of each recognized laboratory that conducted the analyses.
(vi) A detailed written description of the abatement, including abatement methods used, locations of rooms and/or components where abatement occurred, reason for selecting particular abatement methods for each component, and any suggested monitoring of encapsulants or enclosures.
(vii) On or after January 12, 2026, when post-abatement dust-lead testing results are below the dust-lead action levels and at or above the dust-lead reportable levels, a dust-lead hazard statement with the following language must be included:
Although the completed abatement project achieved dust-lead below action levels, some dust-lead hazards remain because any reportable level of dust-lead is considered a dust-lead hazard by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in a residential dwelling or child-occupied facility. In order for abatement work to be considered complete under EPA regulations, dust-lead levels must be
below the action levels, which are established based on reliability, effectiveness and safety. To continue to reduce lead exposure from dust, the EPA pamphlet entitled
Protect Your Family From Lead in Your Home
includes recommendations such as: using a vacuum with a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter on furniture and other items returned to the work area, and regularly cleaning hard surfaces with a damp cloth or sponge and a general all-purpose cleaner. For more information on how to continue to reduce lead exposure, see
Protect Your Family From Lead in Your Home.
(f)
Collection and laboratory analysis of samples.

# Subpart Q—State and Indian Tribal Programs

# Source:
61 FR 45825, Aug. 29, 1996, unless otherwise noted.
§ 745.320
Scope and purpose.
(a) This subpart establishes the requirements that State or Tribal programs must meet for authorization by the Administrator to administer and enforce the standards, regulations, or other requirements established under TSCA section 402 and/or section 406 and establishes the procedures EPA will follow in approving, revising, and withdrawing approval of State or Tribal programs.
(b) For State or Tribal lead-based paint training and certification programs, a State or Indian Tribe may seek authorization to administer and enforce §§ 745.225, 745.226, and 745.227. The provisions of §§ 745.220, 745.223, 745.233, 745.235, 745.237, and 745.239 shall be applicable for the purposes of such program authorization.
(c) A State or Indian Tribe may seek authorization to administer and enforce all of the provisions of subpart E of this part, just the pre-renovation education provisions of subpart E of this part, or just the training, certification, accreditation, and work practice provisions of subpart E of this part. The provisions of §§ 745.324 and 745.326 apply for the purposes of such program authorizations.
(d) A State or Indian Tribe applying for program authorization may seek either interim approval or final approval of the compliance and enforcement portion of the State or Tribal lead-based paint program pursuant to the procedures at § 745.327(a).
(e) State or Tribal submissions for program authorization shall comply with the procedures set out in this subpart.
(f) Any State or Tribal program approved by the Administrator under this subpart shall at all times comply with the requirements of this subpart.
(g) In many cases States will lack authority to regulate activities in Indian Country. This lack of authority does not impair a State's ability to obtain full program authorization in accordance with this subpart. EPA will administer the program in Indian Country if neither the State nor Indian Tribe has been granted program authorization by EPA.

Beginning September 20, 2027 for Federal agencies and Federal contractors acting for or on behalf of the Federal government, or by September 15, 2025 for non-Federal owners and operators, or beginning 120 days after introduction of TCE into the workplace if TCE use commences after June 16, 2025, the owner or operator must ensure that no person is exposed to an airborne concentration of TCE in excess of the interim ECEL, consistent with the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section and, if necessary, paragraph (e)(1) of this section.
(3)
Exposure monitoring
—(i)
General.
(A) Owners or operators must determine each potentially exposed person's exposure, without regard to respiratory protection, by either:
(
1
) Taking a personal breathing zone air sample of each potentially exposed person's exposure; or
(
2
) Taking personal breathing zone air samples that are representative of the 8-hour TWA of each exposure group.
(B) Personal breathing zone air samples are representative of the 8-hour TWA of all potentially exposed persons in an exposure group if the samples are of at least one person's work-shift exposure who represents the highest potential TCE exposures in that exposure group. Personal breathing zone air samples taken during one work shift may be used to represent potentially exposed person exposures on other work shifts where the owner or operator can document that the tasks performed and conditions in the workplace are similar across shifts.
(C) Exposure samples must be analyzed using an appropriate analytical method by a laboratory that complies with the Good Laboratory Practice Standards in 40 CFR part 792 or a laboratory accredited by the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) or another industry-recognized program.
(D) Owners or operators must ensure that methods used to perform exposure monitoring produce results that are accurate, to a confidence level of 95 percent, to within plus or minus 25 percent for airborne concentrations of TCE.
(E) Owners and operators must re-monitor within 15 working days after receipt of any exposure monitoring when results indicate non-detect unless an Environmental Professional as defined at 40 CFR 312.10 or a Certified Industrial Hygienist reviews the monitoring results and determines re-monitoring is not necessary.
(ii)
Initial monitoring.
By June 21, 2027 for Federal agencies and Federal contractors acting for or on behalf of the Federal government, or by June 16, 2025 for non-Federal owners and operators or within 30 days of introduction of TCE into the workplace, whichever is later, each owner or operator covered by this section must perform initial monitoring of potentially exposed persons. Where the owner or operator has monitoring results from monitoring conducted within five years prior to February 18, 2025 and the monitoring satisfies all other requirements of this section, the owner or operator may rely on such earlier monitoring results to satisfy the requirements of this paragraph.
(iii)
Periodic monitoring.
The owner or operator must establish an exposure
monitoring program for periodic monitoring of exposure to TCE in accordance with Table 1.
Table 1 to § 751.311(
b
)(3)(
iii
)—Periodic Monitoring Requirements
Air concentration condition
Periodic monitoring requirement
If initial exposure monitoring is below the interim ECEL action level (
0.1 ppm 8-hour TWA)
Periodic exposure monitoring is required at least once every five years.
If the most recent exposure monitoring indicates that airborne exposure is at or above the interim ECEL action level but at or below the interim ECEL (≥0.1 ppm 8-hour TWA, ≤0.2 ppm 8-hour TWA)
Periodic exposure monitoring is required within 180 days of the most recent exposure monitoring.
If the most recent exposure monitoring indicates that airborne exposure is above the interim ECEL (
0.2 ppm 8-hour TWA)

If the two most recent (non-initial) exposure monitoring measurements, taken at least seven days apart within a six-month period, indicate that airborne exposure is below the interim ECEL action level (
0.1 ppm 8-hour TWA)
Periodic exposure monitoring is required within five years of the most recent exposure monitoring.
If the owner or operator engages in a condition of use for which compliance with the WCPP is required but does not manufacture, process, use, or dispose of TCE in that condition of use over the entirety of time since the last required monitoring event
The owner or operator may forgo the next periodic monitoring event. However, documentation of cessation of use of TCE is required; and periodic monitoring is required when the owner or operator resumes the condition of use.
(iv)
Additional monitoring.
(A) The owner or operator must conduct the exposure monitoring required by paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section within 30 days after there has been a change in the production, process, control equipment, personnel or work practices that may reasonably be expected to result in new or additional exposures above the interim ECEL action level or when the owner or operator has any reason to believe that new or additional exposures above the interim ECEL action level have occurred. Prior monitoring data cannot be used to meet this requirement.
(B) Whenever start-ups or shutdown, or spills, leaks, ruptures, or other breakdowns or unexpected releases occur that may lead to exposure to potentially exposed persons, the owner or operator must conduct the exposure monitoring required by paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section within 30 days after the conclusion of the start-up or shut down and/or the cleanup of the spill or repair of the leak, rupture, or other breakdown.

Interim workplace controls of chrysotile asbestos exposures.
(a)
Applicability.
This section applies to processing and commercial use of chrysotile asbestos, including any chrysotile asbestos-containing products or articles, for chrysotile asbestos diaphragms in the chlor-alkali industry; and to the commercial use of chrysotile asbestos sheet gaskets for titanium dioxide production.
(b)
Interim Existing Chemical Exposure Limit (ECEL).
Beginning November 25, 2024, the owner or operator must ensure that no person is exposed to an airborne concentration of chrysotile asbestos in excess of the interim ECEL for chrysotile asbestos of 0.005 fibers (f)/cubic centimeter (cc) as an eight (8)-hour time-weighted average (TWA). Where an owner or operator cannot demonstrate exposure at or below the ECEL, including through the use of all technically feasible engineering controls or work practices as described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, and has not demonstrated that it has appropriately supplemented with respiratory protection that complies with the requirements of paragraph (f) of this section, this will constitute a failure to comply with the ECEL.
(c)
Exposure monitoring
—(1)
In general.
(i) Owners or operators must determine each potentially exposed person's exposure from personal breathing zone air samples that are representative of the 8-hour TWA exposure of each potentially exposed person.
(ii) Representative 8-hour TWA of a potentially exposed person's exposure must be determined on the basis of one or more samples representing full-shift exposures for each shift for each potentially exposed person in each job classification in each work area.
(2)
Initial exposure monitoring.
No later than November 25, 2024 each owner or operator covered by paragraph (a) of this section as of May 28, 2024, must perform initial exposure monitoring of all potentially exposed persons.
(3)
Periodic exposure monitoring.
The owner or operator must establish an exposure monitoring program for periodic monitoring of exposure to chrysotile asbestos. If one or more samples representing full-shift exposures from the most recent exposure monitoring exceeds the ECEL (
0.005 f/cc 8-hour TWA), periodic exposure monitoring is required within three months of the most recent exposure monitoring. Otherwise, periodic exposure monitoring is required within six months of the most recent exposure monitoring.
(4)
Additional exposure monitoring.
The owner or operator must conduct additional exposure monitoring within a reasonable timeframe after there has been a change in the production, process, control equipment, personnel or work practices that may result in new or additional exposures above the ECEL or the owner or operator has any reason to suspect that a change may result in new or additional exposures above the ECEL.
(5)
Method of monitoring.
(i) Exposure monitoring samples must be personal breathing zone samples collected and analyzed using methods and quality control procedures described in Appendix A to 29 CFR 1910.1001, or as referenced in Appendix A to 29 CFR 1910.1001 (Appendix B to 29 CFR 1910.1001, OSHA method ID-160, or the NIOSH 7400 method).
(ii) Owners or operators must use exposure monitoring methods that conform with the OSHA Reference Method specified in Appendix A of 29 CFR 1910.1001 or an equivalent method. If an equivalent method is used, the owner or operator must ensure that the method meets the following criteria:
(A) Replicate exposure data used to establish equivalency are collected in side-by-side field and laboratory comparisons; and
(B) The comparison indicates that 90% of the samples collected in the range 0.5 to 2.0 times the ECEL or the lowest concentration possible have an accuracy range of plus or minus 25 percent of the OSHA Reference Method specified in Appendix A of 29 CFR 1910.1001 at a 95 percent confidence level as demonstrated by a statistically valid protocol. The NIOSH 7402 analytical method may be applied to adjust the analytical result to include only chrysotile asbestos.
(6)
Notification of exposure monitoring results.
(i) The owner or operator must, within 15 business days of receipt of monitoring results, notify each potentially exposed person of these results either individually in writing or by posting the results in an appropriate location that is accessible to all potentially exposed persons. The notice must be in plain language and understandable to all potentially exposed persons.
(ii) The written notification required by paragraph (c)(6)(i) of this section must include the corrective action being taken by the owner or operator to reduce exposure to or below the ECEL, wherever monitoring results indicated that the ECEL had been exceeded.
(d)
Regulated areas
—(1)
Establishment.
Beginning November 25, 2024 the owner or operator must establish regulated areas wherever airborne concentrations of chrysotile asbestos exceed, or there is a reasonable possibility that they may exceed, the ECEL.
(2)
Demarcation.
The owner or operator must demarcate regulated areas from the rest of the workplace in a manner that minimizes the number of persons who will be exposed to chrysotile asbestos.
(3)
Access.
The owner or operator must limit access to regulated areas to
authorized persons or other persons required by work duties to be present in regulated areas.
(4)
Provision of respirators.
The owner or operator must supply a respirator selected in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section to each person entering a regulated area and must require the use of such respirator.
(5)
Prohibited activities.
The owner or operator must ensure that persons do not eat, drink, smoke, chew tobacco or gum, or apply cosmetics in the regulated area.
(e)
Exposure Control Procedures and Plan
—(1)
Exposure Controls.
(A) The owner or operator must institute engineering controls and work practices to reduce and maintain airborne chrysotile asbestos concentrations to or below the ECEL, except to the extent that the owner or operator can demonstrate that such controls are not feasible.
(B) Wherever the feasible engineering controls and work practices that can be instituted are not sufficient to reduce airborne chrysotile asbestos concentrations to or below the ECEL, the owner or operator must use them to reduce exposures to the lowest levels achievable by these controls. If the feasible engineering controls and work practices cannot reduce exposures to or below the ECEL, the owner or operator must supplement the controls by providing and requiring the use of respiratory protection that complies with the requirements of paragraph (f) of this section.
(2)
Exposure Control Plan Requirements.
(i) Beginning March 28, 2025, when the airborne chrysotile asbestos concentrations exceed the ECEL, or are reasonably expected to exceed the ECEL, owners and operators must establish and implement an exposure control plan to reduce exposures to all potentially exposed persons to or below the ECEL by means of engineering controls and work practices, and by the use of respiratory protection where required under paragraph (e)(1)(B) of this section. The exposure control plan must be available to persons exposed to chrysotile asbestos.
(ii) The exposure control plan must be reviewed and updated as necessary, but at least annually, to reflect any significant changes in the status of the owner or operator's compliance with the requirements of this section.
(iii) The owner or operator must not implement a schedule of personnel rotation as a means of compliance with the ECEL.
(iv) The exposure control plan must include:
(A) An explanation of the exposure controls considered, a rationale for why exposure controls were selected or not selected, based on feasibility, effectiveness, and other relevant considerations;
(B) Descriptions of actions the owner or operator must take to implement the exposure controls selected, including proper installation, maintenance, training, or other actions, and the estimated timeline for implementing such controls;
(C) Description of activities conducted by the owner or operator to review and update the exposure control plan to ensure effectiveness of the exposure controls, identify any necessary updates to the exposure controls, and confirm that all persons are properly implementing the exposure controls; and
(D) An explanation of the procedures for responding to any change that may reasonably be expected to introduce additional sources of exposure to chrysotile asbestos, or otherwise result in increased exposure to chrysotile asbestos, including procedures for implementing corrective actions to mitigate exposure to chrysotile asbestos.

For purposes of this paragraph (f)(2), the cross-referenced provisions in 29 CFR 1910.134 applying to an “employee” also apply equally to potentially exposed persons, and provisions applying to an “employer” also apply equally to owners or operators.
(i) Owners and operators must select respiratory protection that properly
fits each affected person and communicate respirator selections to each affected person consistent with the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.134(f) and 1910.134 App. A.
(ii) Owners and operators must provide, ensure use of, and maintain (in a sanitary, reliable, and undamaged condition) respiratory protection that is of safe design and construction for the applicable condition of use consistent with the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.134(g) through (j) and 1910.134 App. B-1 to B-2.
(iii) Prior to or at the time of initial assignment to a job involving potential exposure to chrysotile asbestos, owners and operators must provide training and retraining to all persons required to use respiratory protection consistent with 29 CFR 1910.134(k).
(3)
Respirator selection.
Owners or operators must select and provide appropriate respirators based on the most recent exposure monitoring. The minimum respiratory protection that must be provided is as follows:
(i) If the most recent exposure monitoring indicates that the exposure concentration is at or below the 0.005 f/cc (ECEL): no respiratory protection is required.
(ii) If the most recent exposure monitoring indicates that the exposure concentration is above 0.005 f/cc (ECEL) and less than or equal to 0.05 f/cc (10 times the ECEL):
(A) A half-mask supplied-air respirator (SAR) or airline respirator operated in demand mode; or
(B) A half-mask self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) respirator operated in demand mode (Assigned Protection Factor 10).
(iii) If the most recent exposure monitoring indicates that the exposure concentration is above 0.05 f/cc (10 times the ECEL) and less than or equal to 0.125 f/cc (25 times the ECEL): A loose fitting facepiece supplied-air respirator (SAR) or airline respirator operated in continuous flow mode (Assigned Protection Factor 25).
(iv) If the most recent exposure monitoring indicates that the exposure concentration is above 0.125 f/cc (25 times the ECEL) and less than or equal to 0.25 f/cc (50 times the ECEL):
(A) A full facepiece supplied-air respirator (SAR) or airline respirator operated in demand mode; or
(B) A half-mask supplied-air respirator (SAR) or airline respirator operated in continuous flow mode; or
(C) A half-mask supplied-air respirator (SAR) or airline respirator operated in pressure-demand or other positive-pressure mode; or
(D) A full facepiece self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) respirator operated in demand mode; or
(E) A helmet/hood self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) respirator operated in demand mode (Assigned Protection Factor 50).
(v) If the most recent exposure monitoring indicates that the exposure concentration is above 0.25 f/cc (50 times the ECEL) and less than or equal to 5 f/cc (1,000 times the ECEL): A full-facepiece supplied-air respirator (SAR) or airline respirator operated in pressure-demand or other positive-pressure mode (Assigned Protection Factor 1,000).
(vi) If the most recent exposure monitoring indicates that the exposure concentration is above 5 f/cc (1,000 times the ECEL) and less than or equal to 50 f/cc (10,000 times the ECEL):
(A) A full-facepiece self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) respirator operated in pressure-demand or other positive-pressure mode; or
(B) A helmet/hood self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) respirator operated in pressure-demand or other positive-pressure mode (Assigned Protection Factor 10,000).
(vii) The respiratory protection requirements in paragraph (f)(3) of this section represent the minimum respiratory protection requirements, such that any respirator affording a higher degree of protection than the required respirator may be used.
(g)
Workplace information and training.
(1) By November 25, 2024, the owner or operator must institute a training program and ensure that persons potentially exposed to chrysotile asbestos participate in the program according to the requirements of this paragraph (g).
(2) The owner or operator must train each potentially exposed person prior or at the time of a potential exposure
to chrysotile asbestos and at least annually thereafter.
(3) The owner or operator must ensure that information and training is presented in a manner that is understandable to each person required to be trained.
(4) The following information and training must be provided to all persons potentially exposed to chrysotile asbestos:
(i) The health effects associated with exposure to chrysotile asbestos, based on the most recent publication by EPA, OSHA, NIOSH, and/or CDC;
(ii) The quantity, location, manner of use, release, and storage of chrysotile asbestos and the specific operations in the workplace that could result in exposure to chrysotile asbestos, noting where each regulated area is located;

Exposure monitoring
—(i)
General.
(A) Owners or operators must determine each potentially exposed person's exposure, without regard to respiratory protection, by either:
(
1
) Taking a personal breathing zone air sample of each potentially exposed person's exposure; or
(
2
) Taking personal breathing zone air samples that are representative of the 8-hour TWA of each exposure group.
(B) Personal breathing zone air samples are representative of the 8-hour TWA of all potentially exposed persons in an exposure group if the samples are of at least one person's full-shift exposure who represents the highest potential PCE exposures in that exposure group. Personal breathing zone air samples taken during one work shift may be used to represent potentially exposed person exposures on other work shifts where the owner or operator can document that the tasks performed and conditions in the workplace are similar across shifts.
(C) Exposure samples must be analyzed using an appropriate analytical method by a laboratory that complies with the Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) Standards in 40 CFR part 792 or a laboratory accredited by the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) or another industry-recognized program.
(D) Owners or operators must ensure that methods used to perform exposure monitoring produce results that are accurate, to a confidence level of 95 percent, to within plus or minus 25 percent for airborne concentrations of PCE.
(E) Owners and operators must re-monitor within 15 working days after receipt of any exposure monitoring when results indicate non-detect, unless an Environmental Professional as defined at 40 CFR 312.10 or a Certified Industrial Hygienist reviews the monitoring results and determines re-monitoring is not necessary.
(ii)
Initial monitoring.
By June 21, 2027 for Federal agencies and Federal contractors acting for or on behalf of the Federal government, by December 15, 2025 for non-Federal owners and operators, or within 30 days of introduction of PCE into the workplace, whichever is later, each owner or operator covered by this section must perform initial monitoring of potentially exposed persons. Where the owner or operator has monitoring results from monitoring conducted within five years prior to February 18, 2025 and the monitoring satisfies all other requirements of this section, the owner or operator may rely on such earlier monitoring results to satisfy the requirements of this paragraph.
(iii)
Periodic monitoring.
The owner or operator must establish an exposure monitoring program for periodic monitoring of exposure to PCE in accordance with table 1.
Table 1 to § 751.607(
b

If initial exposure monitoring is below ECEL action level (
0.10 ppm 8-hour TWA)
Periodic exposure monitoring is required at least once every five years.
If the most recent exposure monitoring indicates that airborne exposure is above the ECEL (
0.14 ppm 8-hour TWA)
Periodic exposure monitoring is required within three months of the most recent exposure monitoring.
If the most recent exposure monitoring indicates that airborne exposure is at or above the ECEL action level but at or below the ECEL (≥0.10 ppm 8-hour TWA, ≤0.14 ppm 8-hour TWA)
Periodic exposure monitoring is required within six months of the most recent exposure monitoring.

Beginning September 20, 2027 for Federal agencies or Federal contractors acting for or on behalf of the Federal government, or by September 9, 2026 for non-Federal owners and operators, or beginning four months after introduction of carbon tetrachloride into the workplace if carbon tetrachloride commences after June 11, 2026, the owner or operator must ensure that no person is exposed to an airborne concentration of carbon tetrachloride in excess of the ECEL, consistent with the requirements of paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section and, if necessary, paragraph (f) of this section.
(2)
Exposure monitoring
—(i)
General.
(A) Owners or operators must determine each potentially exposed person's exposure, without regard to respiratory protection, by either:
(
1
) Taking a personal breathing zone air sample of each potentially exposed person's exposure; or
(
2
) Taking personal breathing zone air samples that are representative of the 8-hour TWA of each exposure group.
(B) Personal breathing zone air samples are representative of the 8-hour TWA of all potentially exposed persons in an exposure group if the samples are of at least one person's full-shift exposure who represents the highest potential carbon tetrachloride exposures in that exposure group. Personal breathing zone air samples taken during one work shift may be used to represent potentially exposed person exposures on other work shifts where the owner or operator can document that the tasks performed and conditions in the workplace are similar across shifts.
(C) Exposure samples must be analyzed using an appropriate analytical method by a laboratory that complies with the Good Laboratory Practice Standards in 40 CFR part 792 or a laboratory accredited by the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) or another industry-recognized program.
(D) Owners or operators must ensure that methods used to perform exposure monitoring produce results that are accurate, to a confidence level of 95 percent, to within plus or minus 25 percent for airborne concentrations of carbon tetrachloride.
(E) Owners and operators must re-monitor within 15 working days after receipt of any exposure monitoring when results indicate non-detect, unless an Environmental Professional as defined at 40 CFR 312.10 or a Certified Industrial Hygienist reviews the exposure monitoring results and determines re-monitoring is not necessary.
(ii)
Initial monitoring.
By June 21, 2027 for Federal agencies and Federal contractors acting for or on behalf of the Federal government, or by June 11, 2026 for non-Federal owners and operators, or within 30 days of introduction of carbon tetrachloride into the workplace, whichever is later, each owner or operator covered by this section must perform initial monitoring of potentially exposed persons. Where the owner or operator has monitoring results from monitoring conducted within five years prior to February 18, 2025 and the monitoring satisfies all other requirements of this section, the owner or operator may rely on such earlier monitoring results to satisfy the requirements of this paragraph (b)(2)(ii).
(iii)
Periodic monitoring.
The owner or operator must establish an exposure monitoring program for periodic monitoring of exposure to carbon tetrachloride in accordance with Table 1.
Table 1 to § 751.707(
b
)(3)(
iii
)—Periodic Monitoring Requirements
Air concentration condition
Periodic exposure monitoring requirement
If all initial exposure monitoring is below the ECEL action level (
0.02 ppm 8-hour TWA)
Periodic exposure monitoring is required at least once every five years.
If the most recent exposure monitoring indicates that airborne exposure is above the ECEL (
0.03 ppm 8-hour TWA)
Periodic exposure monitoring is required within three months of the most recent exposure monitoring.
If the most recent exposure monitoring indicates that airborne exposure is at or above the ECEL action level but at or below the ECEL (≥0.02 ppm 8-hour TWA, ≤0.03 ppm 8-hour TWA)
Periodic exposure monitoring is required within six months of the most recent exposure monitoring.
If the two most recent (non-initial) exposure monitoring measurements, taken at least seven days apart within a 6-month period, indicate exposure is below the ECEL action level (
0.02 ppm 8-hour TWA)
Periodic exposure monitoring is required within five years of the most recent exposure monitoring.
If the owner or operator engages in a condition of use for which WCPP ECEL would be required but does not manufacture, process, use, or dispose of carbon tetrachloride in that condition of use over the entirety of time since the last required monitoring event
The owner or operator may forgo the next periodic exposure monitoring event. However, documentation of cessation of use of carbon tetrachloride is required; and periodic monitoring would be required when the owner or operator resumes the condition of use.
(iv)
Additional exposure monitoring.
(A) The owner or operator must conduct additional exposure monitoring within a reasonable timeframe whenever there has been a change in the production, process, control equipment, personnel or work practices that may reasonably be expected to result in new or additional exposures above the ECEL or when the owner or operator has any reason to believe that new or additional exposures above the ECEL action level have occurred.
(B) Whenever start-ups or shutdowns, or ruptures, malfunctions or other breakdowns or unexpected releases occur that may lead to exposure to potentially exposed persons, the owner or operator must conduct the additional exposure monitoring within a reasonable timeframe after the conclusion of the start-up or shutdown and/or the cleanup, repair or remedial action of the malfunction or other breakdown or unexpected release. Prior monitoring data cannot be used to meet this requirement.

# Subpart A—General
§ 761.1
Applicability.
(a) This part establishes prohibitions of, and requirements for, the manufacture, processing, distribution in commerce, use, disposal, storage, and marking of PCBs and PCB Items.
(b)(1) This part applies to all persons who manufacture, process, distribute in commerce, use, or dispose of PCBs or PCB Items. Substances that are regulated by this part include, but are not limited to: dielectric fluids; solvents; oils; waste oils; heat transfer fluids; hydraulic fluids; paints or coatings; sludges; slurries; sediments; dredge spoils; soils; materials containing PCBs as a result of spills; and other chemical substances or combinations of substances, including impurities and byproducts and any byproduct, intermediate, or impurity manufactured at any point in a process.
(2) Unless otherwise noted, PCB concentrations shall be determined on a weight-per-weight basis (e.g., milligrams per kilogram), or for liquids, on a weight-per-volume basis (e.g., milligrams per liter) if the density of the liquid is also reported. Unless otherwise provided, PCBs are quantified based on the formulation of PCBs present in the material analyzed. For example, measure Aroclor
TM
1242 PCBs based on a comparison with Aroclor
TM
1242 standards. Measure individual congener PCBs based on a comparison with individual PCB congener standards.
(3) Most provisions in this part apply only if PCBs are present in concentrations above a specified level. Provisions that apply to PCBs at concentrations of
50 ppm apply also to contaminated surfaces at PCB concentrations of ≤10 µg/100 cm
2
. Provisions that apply to PCBs at concentrations of ≥50 to
500 ppm apply also to contaminated surfaces at PCB concentrations of
10 µg/100 cm
2
to
100 µg/100 cm
2
. Provisions that apply to PCBs at concentrations of ≥500 ppm apply also to contaminated surfaces at PCB concentrations of ≥100 µg/100 cm
2
.
(4) PCBs can be found in liquid, non-liquid and multi-phasic (combinations of liquid and non-liquid) forms. A person should use the following criteria to determine PCB concentrations to determine which provisions of this part apply to such PCBs.
(i) Any person determining PCB concentrations for non-liquid PCBs must do so on a dry weight basis.
(ii) Any person determining PCB concentrations for liquid PCBs must do so on a wet weight basis. Liquid PCBs containing more than 0.5 percent by weight non-dissolved material shall be
analyzed as multi-phasic non-liquid/liquid mixtures.
(iii) Any person determining the PCB concentration of samples containing PCBs and non-dissolved non-liquid materials ≥0.5 percent, must separate the non-dissolved materials into non-liquid PCBs and liquid PCBs. For multi-phasic non-liquid/liquid or liquid/liquid mixtures, the phases shall be separated before chemical analysis. Following phase separation, the PCB concentration in each non-liquid phase shall be determined on a dry weight basis and the PCB concentration in each liquid phase shall be determined separately on a wet weight basis.
(iv) Any person disposing of multi-phasic non-liquid/liquid or liquid/liquid mixtures must use the PCB disposal requirements that apply to the individual phase with the highest PCB concentration except where otherwise noted. Alternatively, phases may be separated and disposed of using the PCB disposal requirements that apply to each separated, single-phase material.
(5) No person may avoid any provision specifying a PCB concentration by diluting the PCBs, unless otherwise specifically provided.
(6) Unless otherwise specified, references to weights or volumes of PCBs in this part apply to the total weight or total volume of the material (oil, soil, debris, etc.) that contains regulated concentrations of PCBs, not the calculated weight or volume of only the PCB molecules contained in the material.
(c) Definitions of the terms used in these regulations are in subpart A. The basic requirements applicable to disposal and marking of PCBs and PCB Items are set forth in subpart D—Disposal of PCBs and PCB Items and in subpart C—Marking of PCBs and PCB Items. Prohibitions applicable to PCB activities are set forth in subpart B—Manufacture, Processing, Distribution in Commerce, and Use of PCBs and PCB Items. Subpart B also includes authorizations from the prohibitions. Subparts C and D set forth the specific requirements for disposal and marking of PCBs and PCB Items.
(d) Section 15 of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) states that failure to comply with these regulations is unlawful. Section 16 imposes liability for civil penalties upon any person who violates these regulations, and the Administrator can establish appropriate remedies for any violations subject to any limitations included in section 16 of TSCA. Section 16 also subjects a person to criminal prosecution for a violation which is knowing or willful. In addition, section 17 authorizes Federal district courts to enjoin activities prohibited by these regulations, compel the taking of actions required by these regulations, and issue orders to seize PCBs and PCB Items manufactured, processed or distributed in violation of these regulations.
(e) These regulations do not preempt other more stringent Federal statutes and regulations.
(f) Unless and until superseded by any new more stringent regulations issued under EPA authorities, or any permits or any pretreatment requirements issued by EPA, a state or local government that affect release of PCBs to any particular medium:
(1) Persons who inadvertently manufacture or import PCBs generated as unintentional impurities in excluded manufacturing processes, as defined in § 761.3, are exempt from the requirements of subpart B of this part, provided that such persons comply with subpart J of this part, as applicable.
(2) Persons who process, distribute in commerce, or use products containing PCBs generated in excluded manufacturing processes defined in § 761.3 are exempt from the requirements of subpart B provided that such persons comply with subpart J of this part, as applicable.
(3) Persons who process, distribute in commerce, or use products containing recycled PCBs defined in § 761.3, are exempt from the requirements of subpart B of this part, provided that such persons comply with subpart J of this part, as applicable.
(4) Except as provided in § 761.20 (d) and (e), persons who process, distribute
in commerce, or use products containing excluded PCB products as defined in § 761.3, are exempt from the requirements of subpart B of this part.

PCB concentration assumptions for use.
(a)(1) Any person may assume that transformers with
3 pounds (1.36 kilograms (kgs)) of fluid, circuit breakers, reclosers, oil-filled cable, and rectifiers whose PCB concentration is not established contain PCBs at
50 ppm.
(2) Any person must assume that mineral oil-filled electrical equipment that was manufactured before July 2, 1979, and whose PCB concentration is not established is PCB-Contaminated Electrical Equipment (i.e., contains ≥50 ppm PCB, but

50 ppm PCBs). If the date of manufacture of mineral oil-filled electrical equipment is unknown, any person must assume it to be PCB-Contaminated.
(3) Any person must assume that a transformer manufactured prior to July 2, 1979, that contains 1.36 kg (3 pounds) or more of fluid other than mineral oil and whose PCB concentration is not established, is a PCB Transformer (i.e., ≥500 ppm). If the date of manufacture and the type of dielectric fluid are unknown, any person must assume the transformer to be a PCB Transformer.
(4) Any person must assume that a capacitor manufactured prior to July 2, 1979, whose PCB concentration is not established contains ≥500 ppm PCBs. Any person may assume that a capacitor manufactured after July 2, 1979, is non-PCB (i.e.,

Annual report
means the completed EPA Form 6200-025 submitted each year by each disposer and commercial storer of PCB waste to the Director, Office of Resource Conservation and Recovery. The annual report is a brief summary of the information included in the annual document log.
As-found concentration
means the concentration measured in samples collected in-situ (
i.e.,
prior to being moved or disturbed for cleanup and/or disposal) from environmental media or material, unless otherwise specifically provided. For example, media must not be disturbed, nor may they be diluted (e.g., excavated, placed on a pile, and sampled after such placement), before characterization sampling is conducted. Sampling media in piles and
existing accumulations would be considered “as-found” if the media were already in piles when the site was first visited by the responsible party, such as during the redevelopment of abandoned properties with historic PCB contamination. The as-found concentration is distinct from the source concentration, which is the concentration of the PCBs in the material that was originally spilled, released, or otherwise disposed of at the site.

A generator who only stores its own waste is subject to the storage requirements of § 761.65, but is not required to obtain approval as a commercial storer. If a facility's storage of PCB waste generated by others at no time exceeds a total of 500 gallons of liquid and/or non-liquid material containing PCBs at regulated levels, the owner or operator is a commercial storer but is not required to seek EPA approval as a commercial storer of PCB waste. Storage of one company's PCB waste by a related company is not considered commercial storage. A “related company” includes, but is not limited to: a parent company and its subsidiaries; sibling companies owned by the same parent company; companies owned by a common holding company; members of electric cooperatives; entities within the same Executive agency as defined at 5 U.S.C. 105; and a company having a joint ownership interest in a facility from which PCB waste is generated (such as a jointly owned electric power generating station) where the PCB waste is stored by one of the co-owners of the facility.

# Subpart B—Manufacturing, Processing, Distribution in Commerce, and Use of PCBs and PCB Items
§ 761.20
Prohibitions and exceptions.
Except as authorized in § 761.30, the activities listed in paragraphs (a) and (d) of this section are prohibited pursuant to section 6(e)(2) of TSCA. The requirements set forth in paragraph (c) of this section and subpart F of this part concerning export and import of PCBs and PCB Items for disposal are established pursuant to section 6(e)(1) of TSCA. Subject to any exemptions granted pursuant to section 6(e)(3)(B) of TSCA, the activities listed in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section are prohibited pursuant to section (6)(e)(3)(A) of TSCA. In addition, the Administrator hereby finds, under the authority of section 12(a)(2) of TSCA, that the manufacture, processing, and distribution in commerce of PCBs at concentrations of 50 ppm or greater and PCB Items with PCB concentrations of 50 ppm or greater present an unreasonable risk of injury to health within the United States. This finding is based upon the well-documented human health and environmental hazard of PCB exposure, the high probability of human and environmental exposure to PCBs and PCB Items from manufacturing, processing, or distribution activities; the potential hazard of PCB exposure posed by the transportation of PCBs or PCB Items within the United States; and the evidence that contamination of the environment by PCBs is spread far beyond the areas where they are used. In addition, the Administrator hereby finds, for purposes of section 6(e)(2)(C) of TSCA, that any exposure of human beings or the environment to PCBs, as measured or detected by any scientifically acceptable analytical method, may be significant, depending on such factors as the quantity of PCBs involved in the exposure, the likelihood of exposure to humans and the environment, and the effect of exposure. For purposes of determining which PCB Items are totally enclosed, pursuant to section 6(e)(2)(C) of TSCA, since exposure to such Items may be significant, the Administrator further finds that a totally enclosed manner is a manner which results in no exposure to humans or the environment to PCBs. The following activities are considered totally enclosed: distribution in commerce of intact, nonleaking electrical equipment such as transformers (including transformers used in railway locomotives and self-propelled cars), capacitors, electromagnets, voltage regulators, switches (including sectionalizers and motor starters), circuit breakers, reclosers, and cable that contain PCBs at any concentration and processing and distribution in commerce of PCB Equipment containing an intact, nonleaking PCB Capacitor. See paragraph (c)(1) of this section for provisions allowing the distribution in commerce of PCBs and PCB Items.
(a) No persons may use any PCB, or any PCB Item regardless of concentration, in any manner other than in a totally enclosed manner within the United States unless authorized under § 761.30, except that:
(1) An authorization is not required to use those PCBs or PCB Items which consist of excluded PCB products as defined in § 761.3.
(2) An authorization is not required to use those PCBs or PCB Items resulting from an excluded manufacturing process or recycled PCBs as defined in § 761.3, provided all applicable conditions of § 761.1(f) are met.
(3) An authorization is not required to use those PCB Items which contain or whose surfaces have been in contact with excluded PCB products as defined in § 761.3.
(4) An authorization is not required to use sewage sludge where the uses are regulated at parts 257, 258, and 503 of this chapter. No person may blend or otherwise dilute PCBs regulated for disposal, including PCB sewage sludge and sewage sludge not used pursuant to parts 257, 258, and 503 of this chapter, for purposes of use or to avoid disposal requirements under this part. Except as explicitly provided in subpart D of this part, no person may dispose of regulated PCB wastes including, but not limited to, PCB remediation waste, PCB bulk product waste, PCBs, and PCB industrial sludges, into treatment works, as defined in § 503.9(aa) of this chapter.
(b) No person may manufacture PCBs for use within the United States or manufacture PCBs for export from the United States without an exemption, except that: an exemption is not required for PCBs manufactured in an excluded manufacturing process as defined in § 761.3, provided all applicable conditions of § 761.1(f) are met.
(c) No persons may process or distribute in commerce any PCB, or any PCB Item regardless of concentration, for use within the United States or for export from the United States without an exemption, except that an exemption is not required to process or distribute in commerce PCBs or PCB Items resulting from an excluded manufacturing process as defined in § 761.3, or to process or distribute in commerce recycled PCBs as defined in § 761.3, or to process or distribute in commerce excluded PCB products as defined in § 761.3, provided that all applicable conditions of § 761.1(f) are met. In addition, the activities described in paragraphs (c) (1) through (5) of this section may also be conducted without an exemption, under the conditions specified therein.
(1) PCBs at concentrations of 50 ppm or greater, or PCB Items with PCB concentrations of 50 ppm or greater, sold before July 1, 1979 for purposes other than resale may be distributed in commerce only in a totally enclosed manner after that date.
(2) Any person may process and distribute in commerce for disposal PCBs at concentrations of ≥50 ppm, or PCB Items with PCB concentrations of ≥50 ppm, if they comply with the applicable provisions of this part.
(i) Processing activities which are primarily associated with and facilitate storage or transportation for disposal do not require a TSCA PCB storage or disposal approval.
(ii) Processing activities which are primarily associated with and facilitate treatment, as defined in § 260.10 of this chapter, or disposal require a TSCA PCB disposal approval unless they are part of an existing approval, are part of a self-implementing activity under § 761.61(a) or § 761.79 (b) or (c), or are otherwise specifically allowed under subpart D of this part.
(iii) With the exception of provisions in § 761.60 (a)(2) and (a)(3), in order to meet the intent of § 761.1(b), processing, diluting, or otherwise blending of waste prior to being introduced into a disposal unit for purposes of meeting a PCB concentration limit shall be done in accordance with a TSCA PCB disposal approval or comply with the requirements of § 761.79.
(iv) Where the rate of delivering liquids or non-liquids into a PCB disposal unit is an operating parameter, this rate shall be a condition of the TSCA PCB disposal approval for the unit when an approval is required.
(3) PCBs and PCB Items may be exported for disposal in accordance with the requirements of subpart F of this part.
(4) PCBs, at concentrations of less than 50 ppm, or PCB Items, with concentrations of less than 50 ppm, may be processed and distributed in commerce for purposes of disposal.
(5) Decontaminated materials. Any person may distribute in commerce equipment, structures, or other liquid or non-liquid materials that were contaminated with PCBs ≥50 ppm, including those not otherwise authorized for distribution in commerce under this part, provided that one of the following applies:
(i) The materials were decontaminated in accordance with a TSCA PCB disposal approval issued under subpart D of this part, with § 761.79, or with applicable EPA PCB spill cleanup policies in effect at the time of the decontamination.
(ii) If not previously decontaminated, the materials now meet an applicable decontamination standard in § 761.79(b).
(d) The use of waste oil that contains any detectable concentration of PCB as a sealant, coating, or dust control agent is prohibited. Prohibited uses include, but are not limited to, road oiling, general dust control, use as a pesticide or herbicide carrier, and use as a rust preventative on pipes.
(e) In addition to any applicable requirements under 40 CFR part 279, subparts G and H, marketers and burners of used oil who market (process or distribute in commerce) for energy recovery, used oil containing any quantifiable level of PCBs are subject to the following requirements:
(1)
Restrictions on marketing.
Used oil containing any quantifiable level of PCBs (2 ppm) may be marketed only to:
(i) Qualified incinerators as defined in 40 CFR 761.3.
(ii) Marketers who market off-specification used oil for energy recovery only to other marketers who have notified EPA of their used oil management activities, and who have an EPA identification number where an identification number is required by 40 CFR 279.73. This would include persons who market off-specification used oil who are subject to the requirements at 40 CFR part 279 and the notification requirements of 40 CFR 279.73.
(iii) Burners identified in 40 CFR 279.61(a)(1) and (2). Only burners in the automotive industry may burn used oil generated from automotive sources in used oil-fired space heaters provided the provisions of 40 CFR 279.23 are met. The Regional Administrator may grant a variance for a boiler that does not meet the 40 CFR 279.61(a)(1) and (2) criteria after considering the criteria listed in 40 CFR 260.32 (a) through (f). The applicant must address the relevant criteria contained in 40 CFR 260.32 (a) through (f) in an application to the Regional Administrator.
(2)
Testing of used oil fuel.
Used oil to be burned for energy recovery is presumed to contain quantifiable levels (2 ppm) of PCB unless the marketer obtains analyses (testing) or other information that the used oil fuel does not contain quantifiable levels of PCBs.
(i) The person who first claims that a used oil fuel does not contain quantifiable level (2 ppm) PCB must obtain analyses or other information to support that claim.
(ii) Testing to determine the PCB concentration in used oil may be conducted on individual samples, or in accordance with the testing procedures described in § 761.60(g)(2). However, for purposes of this part, if any PCBs at a concentration of 50 ppm or greater have been added to the container or equipment, then the total container contents must be considered as having a PCB concentration of 50 ppm or greater for purposes of complying with the disposal requirements of this part.
(iii) Other information documenting that the used oil fuel does not contain quantifiable levels (2 ppm) of PCBs may consist of either personal, special knowledge of the source and composition of the used oil, or a certification from the person generating the used oil claiming that the oil contains no detectable PCBs.
(3)
Restrictions on burning.
(i) Used oil containing any quantifiable levels of PCB may be burned for energy recovery only in the combustion facilities identified in paragraph (e)(1) of this section when such facilities are operating at normal operating temperatures (this prohibits feeding these fuels during either startup or shutdown operations). Owners and operators of such facilities are “burners” of used oil fuels.
(ii) Before a burner accepts from a marketer the first shipment of used oil fuel containing detectable PCBs (2 ppm), the burner must provide the marketer a one-time written and signed notice certifying that:
(A) The burner has complied with any notification requirements applicable to “qualified incinerators” (§ 761.3) or to “burners” regulated under 40 CFR part 279, subpart G.
(B) The burner will burn the used oil only in a combustion facility identified in paragraph (e)(1) of this section and identify the class of burner they qualify under.
(4)
Recordkeeping requirements.
The following recordkeeping requirements are in addition to the recordkeeping requirements for marketers found in 40 CFR 279.72(b), 279.74(a), (b) and (c), and 279.75, and for burners found in 40 CFR 279.65 and 279.66.
(i)
Marketers.
Marketers who first claim that the used oil fuel contains no detectable PCBs must include among the records required by 40 CFR 279.72(b) and 279.74(b) and (c), copies of the analysis or other information documenting their claim, and they must include among the records required by 40 CFR 279.74(a) and (c) and 279.75, a copy of each certification notice received or prepared relating to transactions involving PCB-containing used oil.
(ii)
Burners.
Burners must include among the records required by 40 CFR 279.65 and 279.66, a copy of each certification notice required by paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section that they send to a marketer.

§ 761.30
Authorizations.
The following non-totally enclosed PCB activities are authorized pursuant to section 6(e)(2)(B) of TSCA:
(a)
Use in and servicing of transformers (other than railroad transformers).
PCBs at any concentration may be used in transformers (other than in railroad locomotives and self-propelled railroad cars) and may be used for purposes of servicing including rebuilding these transformers for the remainder of their useful lives, subject to the following conditions:
(1)
Use conditions.
(i) As of October 1, 1985, the use and storage for reuse of PCB Transformers that pose an exposure risk to food or feed is prohibited.
(ii) As of October 1, 1990, the use of network PCB Transformers with higher secondary voltages (secondary voltages equal to or greater than 480 volts, including 480/277 volt systems) in or near commercial buildings is prohibited. Network PCB Transformers with higher secondary voltages which are removed from service in accordance with this requirement must either be reclassified to PCB Contaminated or non PCB status, placed into storage for disposal, or disposed.
(iii) Except as otherwise provided, as of October 1, 1985, the installation of PCB Transformers, which have been placed into storage for reuse or which have been removed from another location, in or near commercial buildings is prohibited.
(A) Retrofilled mineral oil PCB Transformers may be installed for reclassification purposes indefinitely after October 1, 1990.
(B) Once a retrofilled transformer has been installed for reclassification purposes, it must be tested 3 months after installation to ascertain the concentration of PCBs. If the PCB concentration is below 50 ppm, the transformer can be reclassified as a non-PCB Transformer. If the PCB concentration is between 50 and 500 ppm, the transformer can be reclassified as a PCB-Contaminated transformer. If the PCB concentration remains at 500 ppm or greater, the entire process must either be repeated until the transformer has been reclassified to a non-PCB or PCB-Contaminated transformer in accordance with paragraph (a)(2)(v) of this section or the transformer must be removed from service.

As of February 25, 1991, all lower secondary voltage radial PCB Transformers, in use in or near commercial buildings, must be equipped with electrical protection to avoid transformer ruptures caused by high current faults.
(A) Current-limiting fuses or other equivalent technology must be used to detect sustained high current faults and provide for the complete deenergization of the transformer (within several hundredths of a second in the case of higher secondary voltage radial PCB Transformers and within tenths of a second in the case of lower secondary voltage network PCB Transformers), before transformer rupture occurs. Lower secondary voltage radial PCB Transformers must be equipped with electrical protection as provided in paragraph (a)(1)(iv)(E) of this section. The installation, setting, and maintenance of current-limiting fuses or other equivalent technology to avoid PCB Transformer ruptures from sustained high current faults must be completed in accordance with good engineering practices.

(ix) A visual inspection of each PCB Transformer (as defined in the definition of “PCB Transformer” under § 761.3) in use or stored for reuse shall be performed at least once every 3 months. These inspections may take place any time during the 3-month periods: January-March, April-June, July-September, and October-December as long as there is a minimum of 30 days between inspections. The visual inspection must include investigation for any leak of dielectric fluid on or around the transformer. The extent of the visual inspections will depend on the physical constraints of each transformer installation and should not require an electrical shutdown of the transformer being inspected.
(x) If a PCB Transformer is found to have a leak which results in any quantity of PCBs running off or about to run off the external surface of the transformer, then the transformer must be repaired or replaced to eliminate the source of the leak. In all cases any leaking material must be cleaned up and properly disposed of according to disposal requirements of subpart D of this part. Cleanup of the released PCBs must be initiated as soon as possible, but in no case later than 48 hours of its discovery. Until appropriate action is completed, any active leak of PCBs must be contained to prevent exposure of humans or the environment and inspected daily to verify containment of the leak. Trenches, dikes, buckets, and pans are examples of proper containment measures.
(xi) If a PCB Transformer is involved in a fire-related incident, the owner of the transformer must immediately report the incident to the National Response Center (toll-free 1-800-424-8802; in Washington, DC 202-426-2675). A fire-related incident is defined as any incident involving a PCB Transformer which involves the generation of sufficient heat and/or pressure (by any source) to result in the violent or non-violent rupture of a PCB Transformer and the release of PCBs. Information must be provided regarding the type of PCB Transformer installation involved in the fire-related incident (e.g., high or low secondary voltage network transformer, high or low secondary voltage simple radial system, expanded radial system, primary selective system, primary loop system, or secondary selective system or other systems) and the readily ascertainable cause of the fire-related incident (e.g., high current fault in the primary or secondary or low current fault in secondary). The owner of the PCB Transformer must also take measures as soon as practically and safely possible to contain and control any potential releases of PCBs and incomplete combustion products into water. These measures include, but are not limited to:
(A) The blocking of all floor drains in the vicinity of the transformer.
(B) The containment of water runoff.
(C) The control and treatment (prior to release) of any water used in subsequent cleanup operations.
(xii) Records of inspection and maintenance history shall be maintained at least 3 years after disposing of the transformer and shall be made available for inspection, upon request by EPA. Such records shall contain the following information for each PCB Transformer:

(A) A PCB Transformer which has impervious, undrained, secondary containment capacity of at least 100 percent of the total dielectric fluid volume of all transformers so contained or
(B) A PCB Transformer which has been tested and found to contain less than 60,000 ppm PCBs (after 3 months of in service use if the transformer has been serviced for purposes of reducing the PCB concentration).
(xiv) An increased visual inspection frequency of at least once every week applies to any PCB Transformer in use or stored for reuse which poses an exposure risk to food or feed. The user of a PCB Transformer posing an exposure risk to food is responsible for the inspection, recordkeeping, and maintenance requirements under this section until the user notifies the owner that the transformer may pose an exposure risk to food or feed. Following such notification, it is the owner's ultimate responsibility to determine whether the PCB Transformer poses an exposure risk to food or feed.
(xv) In the event a mineral oil transformer, assumed to contain less than 500 ppm of PCBs as provided in § 761.2, is tested and found to be contaminated at 500 ppm or greater PCBs, it will be subject to all the requirements of this part 761. In addition, efforts must be initiated immediately to bring the transformer into compliance in accordance with the following schedule:

(iii) PCBs removed during any servicing activity must be captured and either reused as dielectric fluid or disposed of in accordance with the requirements of § 761.60. PCBs from PCB Transformers must not be mixed with or added to dielectric fluid from PCB-Contaminated Electrical Equipment.
(iv) Regardless of its PCB concentration, dielectric fluids containing less than 500 ppm PCB that are mixed with fluids that contain 500 ppm or greater PCB must not be used as dielectric fluid in any electrical equipment. The entire mixture of dielectric fluid must be considered to be greater than 500 ppm PCB and must be disposed of in an incinerator that meets the requirements in § 761.70.
(v) You may reclassify a PCB Transformer that has been tested and determined to have a concentration of ≥500 ppm PCBs to a PCB-Contaminated transformer (≥50 but
500 ppm) or to a non-PCB transformer (
50 ppm), and you may reclassify a PCB-Contaminated transformer that has been tested and determined to have a concentration of ≥50 ppm but
500 ppm to a non-PCB transformer, as follows:
(A) Remove the free-flowing PCB dielectric fluid from the transformer. Flushing is not required. Either test the fluid or assume it contains ≥1,000 ppm PCBs. Retrofill the transformer with fluid containing known PCB levels according to the following table. Determine the transformer's reclassified status according to the following table (if following this process does not result in the reclassified status you desire, you may repeat the process):
If test results show the PCB concentration (ppm) in the transformer prior to retrofill is . . .
and you retrofill the transformer with dielectric fluid containing . . .
and you . . .
and test results show the PCB concentration (ppm) after retrofill is . . .
then the transformer's reclassified status is. . .
≥1,000 (or untested)
50 ppm PCBs
operate the transformer electrically under loaded conditions for at least 90-continuous days after retrofill, then test the fluid for PCBs
≥50 but
500
PCB-contaminated
50 ppm PCBs
operate the transformer electrically under loaded conditions for at least 90-continuous days after retrofill, then test the fluid for PCBs

(B) If you discover that the PCB concentration of the fluid in a reclassified transformer has changed, causing the reclassified status to change, the transformer is regulated based on the actual concentration of the fluid. For example, a transformer that was reclassified to non-PCB status is regulated as a PCB-Contaminated transformer if you discover that the concentration of the fluid has increased to ≥50 but
500 ppm PCBs. If you discover that the PCB concentration of the fluid has risen to ≥500 ppm, the transformer is regulated as a PCB Transformer. Follow paragraphs (a)(1)(xv)(A) through (J) of this section to come into compliance with the regulations applicable to PCB Transformers. You also have the option of repeating the reclassification process.
(C) The Director, National Program Chemicals Division, may, without further rulemaking, grant approval on a case-by-case basis for the use of alternative methods to reclassify transformers. You may request an approval by writing to the Director, National Program Chemicals Division (7404), Environmental Protection Agency, 1200 Pennsylvania Ave., NW., Washington, DC 20460.
