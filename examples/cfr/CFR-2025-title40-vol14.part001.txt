# What This Subpart Covers
§ 63.1930
What is the purpose of this subpart?
This subpart establishes national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants for existing and new municipal solid waste (MSW) landfills.
(a) Before September 28, 2021, all landfills described in § 63.1935 must meet the requirements of 40 CFR part 60, subpart WWW, or an approved state or federal plan that implements 40 CFR part 60, subpart Cc, and requires timely control of bioreactors and additional reporting requirements. Landfills must also meet the startup, shutdown, and malfunction (SSM) requirements of the general provisions as specified in Table 1 to subpart AAAA of this part and must demonstrate compliance with the operating conditions by parameter monitoring results that are within the specified ranges. Specifically, landfills must meet the following requirements of this subpart that apply before September 28, 2021, as set out in: §§ 63.1955(a), 63.1955(b), 63.1965(a), 63.1965(c), 63.1975, 63.1981(a), 63.1981(b), and 63.1982, and the definitions of “Controlled landfill” and “Deviation” in § 63.1990.
(b) Beginning no later than September 27, 2021, all landfills described in § 63.1935 must meet the requirements of this subpart. A landfill may choose to meet the requirements of this subpart rather than the requirements identified in § 63.1930(a) at any time before September 27, 2021. The requirements of this subpart apply at all times, including during periods of SSM, and the SSM requirements of the
General Provisions of this part do not apply.

# Standards
§ 63.1955
What requirements must I meet?
(a) Before September 28, 2021, if alternatives to the operational standards, test methods, procedures, compliance measures, monitoring, recordkeeping, or reporting provisions have already been approved under 40 CFR part 60, subpart WWW; subpart XXX; a federal plan; or an EPA-approved and effective state or tribal plan, these alternatives can be used to comply with this subpart, except that all affected sources must comply with the SSM requirements in subpart A of this part as specified in Table 1 of this subpart and all affected sources must submit compliance reports every 6 months as specified in § 63.1981(h), including information on all deviations that occurred during the 6-month reporting period. Deviations for continuous emission monitors or numerical continuous parameter monitors must be determined using a 3-hour monitoring block average. Beginning no later than September 28, 2021, the collection and control system design plan may include for approval collection and control systems that include any alternatives to the operational standards, test methods, procedures, compliance measures, monitoring, recordkeeping, or reporting provisions, as provided in § 63.1981(d)(2).
(b) If you own or operate a bioreactor that is located at an MSW landfill that is not permanently closed and has a design capacity equal to or greater than 2.5 million Mg and 2.5 million m
3
, then you must meet the requirements of this subpart, including requirements in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section.
(1) You must comply with this subpart starting on the date you are required to install the gas collection and control system.
(2) You must extend the collection and control system into each new cell or area of the bioreactor prior to initiating liquids addition in that area.
(c) At all times, beginning no later than September 27, 2021, the owner or operator must operate and maintain any affected source, including associated air pollution control equipment and monitoring equipment, in a manner consistent with safety and good air pollution control practices for minimizing emissions. The general duty to minimize emissions does not require the owner or operator to make any further efforts to reduce emissions if the requirements of this subpart have been achieved. Determination of whether a source is operating in compliance with operation and maintenance requirements will be based on information available to the Administrator which may include, but is not limited to, monitoring results, review of operation and maintenance procedures, review of operation and maintenance records, and inspection of the source.
§ 63.1957
Requirements for gas collection and control system installation and removal.
(a)
Operation.
Operate the collection and control device in accordance with the provisions of §§ 63.1958, 63.1960, and 63.1961.
(b)
Removal criteria.
The collection and control system may be capped, removed, or decommissioned if the following criteria are met:
(1) The landfill is a closed landfill (as defined in § 63.1990). A closure report must be submitted to the Administrator as provided in § 63.1981(f);
(2) The gas collection and control system has been in operation a minimum of 15 years or the landfill owner or operator demonstrates that the gas collection and control system will be unable to operate for 15 years due to declining gas flow; and
(3) Following the procedures specified in § 63.1959(c), the calculated NMOC emission rate at the landfill is less than 50 Mg/yr on three successive test dates. The test dates must be no less than 90 days apart, and no more than 180 days apart.
§ 63.1958
Operational standards for collection and control systems.
Each owner or operator of an MSW landfill with a gas collection and control system used to comply with the provisions of § 63.1957 must:
(a) Operate the collection system such that gas is collected from each area, cell, or group of cells in the MSW landfill in which solid waste has been in place for:
(1) 5 years or more if active; or
(2) 2 years or more if closed or at final grade;
(b) Operate the collection system with negative pressure at each wellhead except under the following conditions:
(1) A fire or increased well temperature. The owner or operator must record instances when positive pressure occurs in efforts to avoid a fire. These records must be submitted with the semi-annual reports as provided in § 63.1981(h);
(2) Use of a geomembrane or synthetic cover. The owner or operator must develop acceptable pressure limits in the design plan;
(3) A decommissioned well. A well may experience a static positive pressure after shut down to accommodate for declining flows. All design changes must be approved by the Administrator as specified in § 63.1981(d)(2);
(c) Operate each interior wellhead in the collection system as specified in 40 CFR 60.753(c), until the landfill owner or operator elects to meet the operational standard for temperature in paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
(1) Beginning no later than September 27, 2021, operate each interior wellhead in the collection system with a landfill gas temperature less than 62.8 degrees Celsius (145 degrees Fahrenheit).
(2) The owner or operator may establish a higher operating temperature value at a particular well. A higher operating value demonstration must be submitted to the Administrator for approval and must include supporting data demonstrating that the elevated
parameter neither causes fires nor significantly inhibits anaerobic decomposition by killing methanogens. The demonstration must satisfy both criteria in order to be approved (
i.e.,
neither causing fires nor killing methanogens is acceptable).
(d)(1) Operate the collection system so that the methane concentration is less than 500 parts per million (ppm) above background at the surface of the landfill. To determine if this level is exceeded, the owner or operator must conduct surface testing around the perimeter of the collection area and along a pattern that traverses the landfill at no more than 30-meter intervals and where visual observations indicate elevated concentrations of landfill gas, such as distressed vegetation and cracks or seeps in the cover. The owner or operator may establish an alternative traversing pattern that ensures equivalent coverage. A surface monitoring design plan must be developed that includes a topographical map with the monitoring route and the rationale for any site-specific deviations from the 30-meter intervals. Areas with steep slopes or other dangerous areas may be excluded from the surface testing.
(2) Beginning no later than September 27, 2021, the owner or operator must:
(i) Conduct surface testing using an organic vapor analyzer, flame ionization detector, or other portable monitor meeting the specifications provided in § 63.1960(d).
(ii) Conduct surface testing at all cover penetrations. Thus, the owner or operator must monitor any cover penetrations that are within an area of the landfill where waste has been placed and a gas collection system is required.
(iii) Determine the latitude and longitude coordinates of each exceedance using an instrument with an accuracy of at least 4 meters. The coordinates must be in decimal degrees with at least five decimal places.
(e) Operate the system as specified in § 60.753(e) of this chapter, except:
(1) Beginning no later than September 27, 2021, operate the system in accordance to § 63.1955(c) such that all collected gases are vented to a control system designed and operated in compliance with § 63.1959(b)(2)(iii). In the event the collection or control system is not operating:
(i) The gas mover system must be shut down and all valves in the collection and control system contributing to venting of the gas to the atmosphere must be closed within 1 hour of the collection or control system not operating; and
(ii) Efforts to repair the collection or control system must be initiated and completed in a manner such that downtime is kept to a minimum, and the collection and control system must be returned to operation.
(2) [Reserved]
(f) Operate the control system at all times when the collected gas is routed to the system.
(g) If monitoring demonstrates that the operational requirements in paragraph (b), (c), or (d) of this section are not met, corrective action must be taken as specified in § 63.1960(a)(3) and (5) or (c). If corrective actions are taken as specified in § 63.1960, the monitored exceedance is not a deviation of the operational requirements in this section.

(a) Calculate the NMOC emission rate using the procedures specified in § 60.754(a) of this chapter, except:
(1)
NMOC emission rate.
Beginning no later than September 27, 2021 the landfill owner or operator must calculate the NMOC emission rate using either Equation 1 provided in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section or Equation 2 provided in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section. Both Equation 1 and Equation 2 may be used if the actual year-to-year solid waste acceptance rate is known, as specified in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, for part of the life of the landfill and the actual year-to-year solid waste acceptance rate is unknown, as specified in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section, for part of the life of the landfill. The values to be used in both Equation 1 and Equation 2 are 0.05 per year for k, 170 cubic meters per megagram (m

/Mg) for L
O
, and 4,000 parts per million by volume (ppmv) as
hexane for the C
NMOC
. For landfills located in geographical areas with a 30-year annual average precipitation of less than 25 inches, as measured at the nearest representative official meteorologic site, the k value to be used is 0.02 per year.

Tier 1.
The owner or operator must compare the calculated NMOC mass emission rate to the standard of 50 Mg/yr.
(i) If the NMOC emission rate calculated in paragraph (a)(1) of this section is less than 50 Mg/yr, then the landfill owner or operator must submit an NMOC emission rate report according to § 63.1981(c) and must recalculate the NMOC mass emission rate annually as required under paragraph (b) of this section.
(ii) If the calculated NMOC emission rate as calculated in paragraph (a)(1) of this section is equal to or greater than 50 Mg/yr, then the landfill owner must either:
(A) Submit a gas collection and control system design plan within 1 year as specified in § 63.1981(d) and install and operate a gas collection and control system within 30 months of the first annual report in which the NMOC emission rate equals or exceeds 50 Mg/yr, according to paragraphs (b)(2)(ii) and (iii) of this section;
(B) Determine a site-specific NMOC concentration and recalculate the NMOC emission rate using the Tier 2 procedures provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this section; or
(C) Determine a site-specific methane generation rate constant and recalculate the NMOC emission rate using the Tier 3 procedures provided in paragraph (a)(4) of this section.
(3)
Tier 2.
The landfill owner or operator must determine the site-specific
NMOC concentration using the following sampling procedure. The landfill owner or operator must install at least two sample probes per hectare, evenly distributed over the landfill surface that has retained waste for at least 2 years. If the landfill is larger than 25 hectares in area, only 50 samples are required. The probes should be evenly distributed across the sample area. The sample probes should be located to avoid known areas of nondegradable solid waste. The owner or operator must collect and analyze one sample of landfill gas from each probe to determine the NMOC concentration using EPA Method 25 or 25C of appendix A-7 to part 60. Taking composite samples from different probes into a single cylinder is allowed; however, equal sample volumes must be taken from each probe. For each composite, the sampling rate, collection times, beginning and ending cylinder vacuums, or alternative volume measurements must be recorded to verify that composite volumes are equal. Composite sample volumes should not be less than one liter unless evidence can be provided to substantiate the accuracy of smaller volumes. Terminate compositing before the cylinder approaches ambient pressure where measurement accuracy diminishes. If more than the required number of samples are taken, all samples must be used in the analysis. The landfill owner or operator must divide the NMOC concentration from EPA Method 25 or 25C of appendix A-7 to part 60 by 6 to convert from C
NMOC
as carbon to C
NMOC
as hexane. If the landfill has an active or passive gas removal system in place, EPA Method 25 or 25C samples may be collected from these systems instead of surface probes provided the removal system can be shown to provide sampling as representative as the two sampling probe per hectare requirement. For active collection systems, samples may be collected from the common header pipe. The sample location on the common header pipe must be before any gas moving, condensate removal, or treatment system equipment. For active collection systems, a minimum of three samples must be collected from the header pipe.
(i) Within 60 days after the date of completing each performance test (as defined in § 63.7 of subpart A), the owner or operator must submit the results according to § 63.1981(l)(1).
(ii) The landfill owner or operator must recalculate the NMOC mass emission rate using Equation 1 or Equation 2 provided in paragraph (a)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section and use the average site-specific NMOC concentration from the collected samples instead of the default value provided in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
(iii) If the resulting NMOC mass emission rate is less than 50 Mg/yr, then the owner or operator must submit a periodic estimate of NMOC emissions in an NMOC emission rate report according to § 63.1981(c) and must recalculate the NMOC mass emission rate annually as required under paragraph (b) of this section. The site-specific NMOC concentration must be retested every 5 years using the methods specified in this section.
(iv) If the NMOC mass emission rate as calculated using the Tier 2 site-specific NMOC concentration is equal to or greater than 50 Mg/yr, the landfill owner or operator must either:
(A) Submit a gas collection and control system design plan within 1 year as specified in § 63.1981(d) and install and operate a gas collection and control system within 30 months according to paragraphs (b)(2)(ii) and (iii) of this section; or
(B) Determine a site-specific methane generation rate constant and recalculate the NMOC emission rate using the site-specific methane generation rate using the Tier 3 procedures specified in paragraph (a)(4) of this section.
(4)
Tier 3.
The site-specific methane generation rate constant must be determined using the procedures provided in EPA Method 2E of appendix A-1 to part 60 of this chapter. The landfill owner or operator must estimate the NMOC mass emission rate using Equation 1 or Equation 2 in paragraph (a)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section and using a site-specific methane generation rate constant, and the site-specific NMOC concentration as determined in paragraph (a)(3) of this section instead of the default values provided in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. The landfill
owner or operator must compare the resulting NMOC mass emission rate to the standard of 50 Mg/yr.
(i) If the NMOC mass emission rate as calculated using the Tier 2 site-specific NMOC concentration and Tier 3 site-specific methane generation rate is equal to or greater than 50 Mg/yr, the owner or operator must:
(A) Submit a gas collection and control system design plan within 1 year as specified in § 63.1981(d) and install and operate a gas collection and control system within 30 months of the first annual report in which the NMOC emission rate equals or exceeds 50 Mg/yr, according to paragraphs (b)(2)(ii) and (iii) of this section.
(B) [Reserved]
(ii) If the NMOC mass emission rate is less than 50 Mg/yr, then the owner or operator must recalculate the NMOC mass emission rate annually using Equation 1 or Equation 2 in paragraph (a)(1) of this section and using the site-specific Tier 2 NMOC concentration and Tier 3 methane generation rate constant and submit a periodic NMOC emission rate report as provided in § 63.1981(c). The calculation of the methane generation rate constant is performed only once, and the value obtained from this test must be used in all subsequent annual NMOC emission rate calculations.
(5)
Other methods.
The owner or operator may use other methods to determine the NMOC concentration or a site-specific methane generation rate constant as an alternative to the methods required in paragraphs (a)(3) and (4) of this section if the method has been approved by the Administrator.
(b) Each owner or operator of an affected source having a design capacity equal to or greater than 2.5 million Mg and 2.5 million m
3
must either comply with paragraph (b)(2) of this section or calculate an NMOC emission rate for the landfill using the procedures specified in paragraph (a) of this section. The NMOC emission rate must be recalculated annually, except as provided in § 63.1981(c)(1)(ii)(A).
(1) If the calculated NMOC emission rate is less than 50 Mg/yr, the owner or operator must:
(i) Submit an annual NMOC emission rate emission report to the Administrator, except as provided for in § 63.1981(c)(1)(ii); and
(ii) Recalculate the NMOC emission rate annually using the procedures specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section until such time as the calculated NMOC emission rate is equal to or greater than 50 Mg/yr, or the landfill is closed.
(A) If the calculated NMOC emission rate, upon initial calculation or annual recalculation required in paragraph (b) of this section, is equal to or greater than 50 Mg/yr, the owner or operator must either: comply with paragraph (b)(2) of this section or calculate NMOC emissions using the next higher tier in paragraph (a) of this section.
(B) If the landfill is permanently closed, a closure report must be submitted to the Administrator as provided for in § 63.1981(f).
(2) If the calculated NMOC emission rate is equal to or greater than 50 Mg/yr using Tier 1, 2, or 3 procedures, the owner or operator must either:
(i) Submit a collection and control system design plan prepared by a professional engineer to the Administrator within 1 year as specified in § 63.1981(d) or calculate NMOC emissions using the next higher tier in paragraph (a) of this section. The collection and control system must meet the requirements in paragraphs (b)(2)(ii) and (iii) of this section.
(ii) Collection system. Install and start up a collection and control system that captures the gas generated within the landfill as required by paragraphs (b)(2)(ii)(B) or (C) and (b)(2)(iii) of this section within 30 months after:
(A) The first annual report in which the NMOC emission rate equals or exceeds 50 Mg/yr, unless Tier 2 or Tier 3 sampling demonstrates that the NMOC emission rate is less than 50 Mg.

) Be designed to handle the maximum expected gas flow rate from the entire area of the landfill that warrants control over the intended use period of the gas control system equipment;
(
2
) Collect gas from each area, cell, or group of cells in the landfill in which the initial solid waste has been placed for a period of 5 years or more if
active; or 2 years or more if closed or at final grade;

1
) Comply with the provisions specified in paragraphs (b)(2)(ii)(B)(1), (2), and (3) of this section; and
(
2
) Be installed with liners on the bottom and all sides in all areas in which gas is to be collected. The liners must be installed as required under § 258.40 of this chapter.
(iii) Control system. Route all the collected gas to a control system that complies with the requirements in either paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(A), (B), or (C) of this section.
(A) A non-enclosed flare designed and operated in accordance with the parameters established in § 63.11(b) except as noted in paragraph (e) of this section; or

1
) If a boiler or process heater is used as the control device, the landfill gas stream must be introduced into the flame zone.
(
2
) The control device must be operated within the parameter ranges established during the initial or most recent performance test. The operating parameters to be monitored are specified in §§ 63.1961(b) through (e);
(C) A treatment system that processes the collected gas for subsequent sale or beneficial use such as fuel for combustion, production of vehicle fuel, production of high-British thermal unit (Btu) gas for pipeline injection, or use as a raw material in a chemical manufacturing process. Venting of treated landfill gas to the ambient air is not allowed. If the treated landfill gas cannot be routed for subsequent sale or beneficial use, then the treated landfill gas must be controlled according to either paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(A) or (B) of this section.
(D) All emissions from any atmospheric vent from the gas treatment system are subject to the requirements of paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(A) or (B) of this section. For purposes of this subpart, atmospheric vents located on the condensate storage tank are not part of the treatment system and are exempt from the requirements of paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(A) or (B) of this section.
(c) After the installation and startup of a collection and control system in compliance with this subpart, the owner or operator must calculate the NMOC emission rate for purposes of determining when the system can be capped, removed, or decommissioned as provided in § 63.1957(b)(3), using Equation 3:
ER26MR20.009
Where:
M
NMOC
= Mass emission rate of NMOC, Mg/yr.
Q
LFG
= Flow rate of landfill gas, m

per minute.
C
NMOC
= Average NMOC concentration, ppmv as hexane.
1.89 × 10
−3
= Conversion factor.
(1) The flow rate of landfill gas, Q
LFG
, must be determined by measuring the total landfill gas flow rate at the common header pipe that leads to the control system using a gas flow measuring device calibrated according to the provisions of section 10 of EPA Method 2E of appendix A-1 of part 60.
(2) The average NMOC concentration, C
NMOC
, must be determined by collecting and analyzing landfill gas sampled from the common header pipe before the gas moving or condensate removal equipment using the procedures in EPA Method 25 or 25C of appendix A-7 to part 60 of this chapter. The sample location on the common header pipe must be before any condensate removal or other gas refining units. The landfill owner or operator must divide the NMOC concentration from EPA Method 25 or 25C of appendix A-7 to part 60 by 6 to convert from C
NMOC
as carbon to C
NMOC
as hexane.
(3) The owner or operator may use another method to determine landfill gas flow rate and NMOC concentration if the method has been approved by the Administrator.
(i) Within 60 days after the date of completing each performance test (as defined in § 63.7), the owner or operator must submit the results of the performance test, including any associated fuel analyses, according to § 63.1981(l)(1).
(ii) [Reserved]
(d) For the performance test required in § 63.1959(b)(2)(iii)(B), EPA Method 25 or 25C (EPA Method 25C of appendix A-7 to part 60 of this chapter may be used at the inlet only) of appendix A of this part must be used to determine compliance with the 98 weight-percent efficiency or the 20- ppmv outlet concentration level, unless another method to demonstrate compliance has been approved by the Administrator as provided by § 63.1981(d)(2). EPA Method 3, 3A, or 3C of appendix A-7 to part 60 must be used to determine oxygen for correcting the NMOC concentration as hexane to 3 percent. In cases where the outlet concentration is less than 50 ppm NMOC as carbon (8 ppm NMOC as hexane), EPA Method 25A should be used in place of EPA Method 25. EPA Method 18 may be used in conjunction with EPA Method 25A on a limited basis (compound specific,
e.g.,
methane) or EPA Method 3C may be used to determine methane. The methane as carbon should be subtracted from the EPA Method 25A total hydrocarbon value as carbon to give NMOC concentration as carbon. The landowner or operator must divide the NMOC concentration as carbon by 6 to convert from the C
NMOC
as carbon to C
NMOC
as hexane. Equation 4 must be used to calculate efficiency:
ER26MR20.012
Where:
NMOC
in
= Mass of NMOC entering control device.
NMOC
out
= Mass of NMOC exiting control device.
(e) For the performance test required in § 63.1959(b)(2)(iii)(A), the net heating value of the combusted landfill gas as determined in § 63.11(b)(6)(ii) is calculated from the concentration of methane in the landfill gas as measured by EPA Method 3C of appendix A to part 60 of this chapter. A minimum of three 30-minute EPA Method 3C samples are determined. The measurement of other organic components, hydrogen, and carbon monoxide is not applicable. EPA Method 3C may be used to determine the landfill gas molecular weight for calculating the flare gas exit velocity under § 63.11(b)(7) of subpart A.
(1) Within 60 days after the date of completing each performance test (as defined in § 63.7), the owner or operator must submit the results of the performance tests, including any associated fuel analyses, required by § 63.1959(c) or (e) according to § 63.1981(l)(1).
(2) [Reserved]
(f) The performance tests required in §§ 63.1959(b)(2)(iii)(A) and (B), must be conducted under such conditions as the Administrator specifies to the owner or operator based on representative performance of the affected source for the period being tested. Representative conditions exclude periods of startup and shutdown unless specified by the Administrator. The owner or operator
may not conduct performance tests during periods of malfunction. The owner or operator must record the process information that is necessary to document operating conditions during the test and include in such record an explanation to support that such conditions represent normal operation. Upon request, the owner or operator shall make available to the Administrator such records as may be necessary to determine the conditions of performance tests.

§ 63.1960
Compliance provisions.
(a) Except as provided in § 63.1981(d)(2), the specified methods in paragraphs (a)(1) through (5) of this section must be used to determine whether the gas collection system is in compliance with § 63.1959(b)(2)(ii).
(1) For the purposes of calculating the maximum expected gas generation flow rate from the landfill to determine compliance with § 63.1959(b)(2)(ii)(C)(1), either Equation 5 or Equation 6 must be used. The owner or operator may use another method to determine the maximum gas generation flow rate, if the method has been approved by the Administrator. The methane generation rate constant (k) and methane generation potential (L
o
) kinetic factors should be those published in the most recent
Compilation of Air Pollutant Emission Factors
(AP-42) or other site-specific values demonstrated to be appropriate and approved by the Administrator. If k has been determined as specified in § 63.1959(a)(4), the value of k determined from the test must be used. A value of no more than 15 years must be used for the intended use period of the gas mover equipment. The active life of the landfill is the age of the landfill plus the estimated number of years until closure.
(i) For sites with unknown year-to-year solid waste acceptance rate:
ER26MR20.013
Where:
Qm = Maximum expected gas generation flow rate, m

/Mg solid waste.
R = Average annual acceptance rate, Mg/yr.
k = Methane generation rate constant, year

.
t = Age of the landfill at equipment installation plus the time the owner or operator intends to use the gas mover equipment or active life of the landfill, whichever is less. If the equipment is installed after closure, t is the age of the landfill at installation, years.
c = Time since closure, years (for an active landfill c = 0 and e
−kc
= 1).
2 = Constant.
(ii) For sites with known year-to-year solid waste acceptance rate:

= Mass of solid waste in the ith section, Mg.
t
i
= Age of the ith section, years.
(iii) If a collection and control system has been installed, actual flow data may be used to project the maximum expected gas generation flow rate instead of, or in conjunction with, Equation 5 or Equation 6 in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section. If the landfill is still accepting waste, the actual measured flow data will not equal the maximum expected gas generation rate, so calculations using Equation 5
or Equation 6 in paragraph (a)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section or other methods must be used to predict the maximum expected gas generation rate over the intended period of use of the gas control system equipment.
(2) For the purposes of determining sufficient density of gas collectors for compliance with § 63.1959(b)(2)(ii)(B)(
2
), the owner or operator must design a system of vertical wells, horizontal collectors, or other collection devices, satisfactory to the Administrator, capable of controlling and extracting gas from all portions of the landfill sufficient to meet all operational and performance standards.
(3) For the purpose of demonstrating whether the gas collection system flow rate is sufficient to determine compliance with § 63.1959(b)(2)(ii)(B)(
3
), the owner or operator must measure gauge pressure in the gas collection header applied to each individual well monthly. Any attempted corrective measure must not cause exceedances of other operational or performance standards. An alternative timeline for correcting the exceedance may be submitted to the Administrator for approval. If a positive pressure exists, follow the procedures as specified in § 60.755(a)(3), except:
(i) Beginning no later than September 27, 2021, if a positive pressure exists, action must be initiated to correct the exceedance within 5 days, except for the three conditions allowed under § 63.1958(b).
(A) If negative pressure cannot be achieved without excess air infiltration within 15 days of the first measurement of positive pressure, the owner or operator must conduct a root cause analysis and correct the exceedance as soon as practicable, but no later than 60 days after positive pressure was first measured. The owner or operator must keep records according to § 63.1983(e)(3).
(B) If corrective actions cannot be fully implemented within 60 days following the positive pressure measurement for which the root cause analysis was required, the owner or operator must also conduct a corrective action analysis and develop an implementation schedule to complete the corrective action(s) as soon as practicable, but no more than 120 days following the positive pressure measurement. The owner or operator must submit the items listed in § 63.1981(h)(7) as part of the next semi-annual report. The owner or operator must keep records according to § 63.1983(e)(4).
(C) If corrective action is expected to take longer than 120 days to complete after the initial exceedance, the owner or operator must submit the root cause analysis, corrective action analysis, and corresponding implementation timeline to the Administrator, according to § 63.1981(j). The owner or operator must keep records according to § 63.1983(e)(5).
(ii) [Reserved]
(4) Where an owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart seeks to demonstrate compliance with the temperature and nitrogen or oxygen operational standards in introductory paragraph § 63.1958(c), for the purpose of identifying whether excess air infiltration into the landfill is occurring, the owner or operator must follow the procedures as specified in § 60.755(a)(5) of this chapter, except:
(i) Once an owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart seeks to demonstrate compliance with the operational standard for temperature in § 63.1958(c)(1), the owner or operator must monitor each well monthly for temperature for the purpose of identifying whether excess air infiltration exists. If a well exceeds the operating parameter for temperature as provided in § 63.1958(c)(1), action must be initiated to correct the exceedance within 5 days. Any attempted corrective measure must not cause exceedances of other operational or performance standards.
(A) If a landfill gas temperature less than or equal to 62.8 degrees Celsius (145 degrees Fahrenheit) cannot be achieved within 15 days of the first measurement of landfill gas temperature greater than 62.8 degrees Celsius (145 degrees Fahrenheit), the owner or operator must conduct a root cause analysis and correct the exceedance as soon as practicable, but no later than 60 days after a landfill gas temperature greater than 62.8 degrees Celsius (145 degrees Fahrenheit) was first measured. The owner or operator must keep records according to § 63.1983(e)(3).
(B) If corrective actions cannot be fully implemented within 60 days following the temperature measurement for which the root cause analysis was required, the owner or operator must also conduct a corrective action analysis and develop an implementation schedule to complete the corrective action(s) as soon as practicable, but no more than 120 days following the measurement of landfill gas temperature greater than 62.8 degrees Celsius (145 degrees Fahrenheit). The owner or operator must submit the items listed in § 63.1981(h)(7) as part of the next semi-annual report. The owner or operator must keep records according to § 63.1983(e)(4).
(C) If corrective action is expected to take longer than 120 days to complete after the initial exceedance, the owner or operator must submit the root cause analysis, corrective action analysis, and corresponding implementation timeline to the Administrator, according to § 63.1981(h)(7) and (j). The owner or operator must keep records according to § 63.1983(e)(5).
(D) If a landfill gas temperature measured at either the wellhead or at any point in the well is greater than or equal to 76.7 degrees Celsius (170 degrees Fahrenheit) and the carbon monoxide concentration measured, according to the procedures in § 63.1961(a)(5)(vi) is greater than or equal to 1,000 ppmv the corrective action(s) for the wellhead temperature standard (62.8 degrees Celsius or 145 degrees Fahrenheit) must be completed within 15 days.
(5) An owner or operator seeking to demonstrate compliance with § 63.1959(b)(2)(ii)(B)(
4
) through the use of a collection system not conforming to the specifications provided in § 63.1962 must provide information satisfactory to the Administrator as specified in § 63.1981(d)(3) demonstrating that off-site migration is being controlled.
(b) For purposes of compliance with § 63.1958(a), each owner or operator of a controlled landfill must place each well or design component as specified in the approved design plan as provided in § 63.1981(d). Each well must be installed no later than 60 days after the date on which the initial solid waste has been in place for a period of:
(1) 5 years or more if active; or
(2) 2 years or more if closed or at final grade.
(c) The following procedures must be used for compliance with the surface methane operational standard as provided in § 63.1958(d).

As long as the specified actions are taken, the exceedance is not a violation of the operational requirements of § 63.1958(d).
(i) The location of each monitored exceedance must be marked and the location and concentration recorded. Beginning no later than September 27, 2021, the location must be recorded using an instrument with an accuracy of at least 4 meters. The coordinates must be in decimal degrees with at least five decimal places.
(ii) Cover maintenance or adjustments to the vacuum of the adjacent wells to increase the gas collection in
the vicinity of each exceedance must be made and the location must be re-monitored within 10 days of detecting the exceedance.
(iii) If the re-monitoring of the location shows a second exceedance, additional corrective action must be taken and the location must be monitored again within 10 days of the second exceedance. If the re-monitoring shows a third exceedance for the same location, the action specified in paragraph (c)(4)(v) of this section must be taken, and no further monitoring of that location is required until the action specified in paragraph (c)(4)(v) of this section has been taken.
(iv) Any location that initially showed an exceedance but has a methane concentration less than 500 ppm methane above background at the 10-day re-monitoring specified in paragraph (c)(4)(ii) or (iii) of this section must be re-monitored 1 month from the initial exceedance. If the 1-month re-monitoring shows a concentration less than 500 ppm above background, no further monitoring of that location is required until the next quarterly monitoring period. If the 1-month re-monitoring shows an exceedance, the actions specified in paragraph (c)(4)(iii) or (v) of this section must be taken.
(v) For any location where monitored methane concentration equals or exceeds 500 ppm above background three times within a quarterly period, a new well or other collection device must be installed within 120 days of the initial exceedance. An alternative remedy to the exceedance, such as upgrading the blower, header pipes or control device, and a corresponding timeline for installation may be submitted to the Administrator for approval.
(5) The owner or operator must implement a program to monitor for cover integrity and implement cover repairs as necessary on a monthly basis.
(d) Each owner or operator seeking to comply with the provisions in paragraph (c) of this section must comply with the following instrumentation specifications and procedures for surface emission monitoring devices:
(1) The portable analyzer must meet the instrument specifications provided in section 6 of EPA Method 21 of appendix A of part 60 of this chapter, except that “methane” replaces all references to “VOC”.

(3) Where an owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart seeks to demonstrate compliance with the temperature and nitrogen or oxygen operational standards in introductory paragraph § 63.1958(c), the owner or operator must follow the procedures as specified in § 60.756(a)(2) and (3) of this chapter. Monitor temperature of the landfill gas on a monthly basis as provided in § 63.1960(a)(4). The temperature measuring device must be calibrated annually using the procedure in Section 10.3 of EPA Method 2 of appendix A-1 to part 60 of this chapter.
(4) Where an owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart seeks to demonstrate compliance with the operational standard for temperature in § 63.1958(c)(1), monitor temperature of the landfill gas on a monthly basis as provided in § 63.1960(a)(4). The temperature measuring device must be calibrated annually using the procedure in Section 10.3 of EPA Method 2 of appendix A-1 to part 60 of this chapter. Keep records specified in § 63.1983(e).
(5) Where an owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart seeks to demonstrate compliance with the operational standard for temperature in § 63.1958(c)(1), unless a higher operating temperature value has been approved by the Administrator under this subpart or under 40 CFR part 60, subpart WWW; 40 CFR part 60, subpart XXX; or a federal plan or EPA-approved and effective state plan or tribal plan that implements either 40 CFR part 60, subpart Cc or 40 CFR part 60, subpart Cf, you must initiate enhanced monitoring at each well with a measurement of landfill gas temperature greater than 62.8 degrees Celsius (145 degrees Fahrenheit) as follows:

(C) When sampling directly from the wellhead, you must sample for 5 minutes plus twice the response time of the analyzer. These values must be recorded. The five 1-minute averages are then averaged to give you the carbon monoxide reading at the wellhead.
(D) When collecting samples in a passivated canister or multi-layer foil sampling bag, you must sample for the period of time needed to assure that enough sample is collected to provide five (5) consecutive, 1-minute samples during the analysis of the canister or bag contents, but no less than 5 minutes plus twice the response time of the analyzer. The five (5) consecutive, 1-minute averages are then averaged together to give you a carbon monoxide value from the wellhead.
(vii) The enhanced monitoring described in this paragraph (a)(5) must begin 7 calendar days after the first measurement of landfill gas temperature greater than 62.8 degrees Celsius (145 degrees Fahrenheit); and
(viii) The enhanced monitoring in this paragraph (a)(5) must be conducted on a weekly basis. If four consecutive weekly carbon monoxide readings are under 100 ppmv, then enhanced monitoring may be decreased to monthly. However, if carbon monoxide readings exceed 100 ppmv again, the landfill must return to weekly monitoring.
(ix) The enhanced monitoring in this paragraph (a)(5) can be stopped once a higher operating value is approved, at which time the monitoring provisions issued with the higher operating value should be followed, or once the measurement of landfill gas temperature at the wellhead is less than or equal to 62.8 degrees Celsius (145 degrees Fahrenheit).
(6) For each wellhead with a measurement of landfill gas temperature greater than or equal to 73.9 degrees Celsius (165 degrees Fahrenheit), annually monitor temperature of the landfill gas every 10 vertical feet of the well. This temperature can be monitored either with a removable thermometer, or using temporary or permanent thermocouples installed in the well.
(b) Each owner or operator seeking to comply with § 63.1959(b)(2)(iii) using an enclosed combustor must calibrate, maintain, and operate according to the manufacturer's specifications, the following equipment:
(1) A temperature monitoring device equipped with a continuous recorder and having a minimum accuracy of ±1 percent of the temperature being measured expressed in degrees Celsius or ±0.5 degrees Celsius, whichever is greater. A temperature monitoring device is not required for boilers or process heaters with design heat input capacity equal to or greater than 44 megawatts.
(2) A device that records flow to the control device and bypass of the control device (if applicable). The owner or operator must:
(i) Install, calibrate, and maintain a gas flow rate measuring device that must record the flow to the control device at least every 15 minutes; and
(ii) Secure the bypass line valve in the closed position with a car-seal or a lock-and-key type configuration. A visual inspection of the seal or closure mechanism must be performed at least once every month to ensure that the valve is maintained in the closed position and that the gas flow is not diverted through the bypass line.
(c) Each owner or operator seeking to comply with § 63.1959(b)(2)(iii) using a non-enclosed flare must install, calibrate, maintain, and operate according to the manufacturer's specifications the following equipment:
(1) A heat sensing device, such as an ultraviolet beam sensor or thermocouple, at the pilot light or the flame itself to indicate the continuous presence of a flame; and
(2) A device that records flow to the flare and bypass of the flare (if applicable). The owner or operator must:
(i) Install, calibrate, and maintain a gas flow rate measuring device that records the flow to the control device at least every 15 minutes; and
(ii) Secure the bypass line valve in the closed position with a car-seal or a
lock-and-key type configuration. A visual inspection of the seal or closure mechanism must be performed at least once every month to ensure that the valve is maintained in the closed position and that the gas flow is not diverted through the bypass line.
(d) Each owner or operator seeking to demonstrate compliance with § 63.1959(b)(2)(iii) using a device other than a non-enclosed flare or an enclosed combustor or a treatment system must provide information satisfactory to the Administrator as provided in § 63.1981(d)(2) describing the operation of the control device, the operating parameters that would indicate proper performance, and appropriate monitoring procedures. The Administrator must review the information and either approve it, or request that additional information be submitted. The Administrator may specify additional appropriate monitoring procedures.
(e) Each owner or operator seeking to install a collection system that does not meet the specifications in § 63.1962 or seeking to monitor alternative parameters to those required by §§ 63.1958 through 63.1961 must provide information satisfactory to the Administrator as provided in § 63.1981(d)(2) and (3) describing the design and operation of the collection system, the operating parameters that would indicate proper performance, and appropriate monitoring procedures. The Administrator may specify additional appropriate monitoring procedures.
(f) Each owner or operator seeking to demonstrate compliance with the 500-ppm surface methane operational standard in § 63.1958(d) must monitor surface concentrations of methane according to the procedures in § 63.1960(c) and the instrument specifications in § 63.1960(d). If you are complying with the 500-ppm surface methane operational standard in § 63.1958(d)(2), for location, you must determine the latitude and longitude coordinates of each exceedance using an instrument with an accuracy of at least 4 meters and the coordinates must be in decimal degrees with at least five decimal places. In the semi-annual report in § 63.1981(h), you must report the location of each exceedance of the 500-ppm methane concentration as provided in § 63.1958(d) and the concentration recorded at each location for which an exceedance was recorded in the previous month. Any closed landfill that has no monitored exceedances of the operational standard in three consecutive quarterly monitoring periods may skip to annual monitoring. Any methane reading of 500 ppm or more above background detected during the annual monitoring returns the frequency for that landfill to quarterly monitoring.
(g) Each owner or operator seeking to demonstrate compliance with § 63.1959(b)(2)(iii)(C) using a landfill gas treatment system must calibrate, maintain, and operate according to the manufacturer's specifications a device that records flow to the treatment system and bypass of the treatment system (if applicable). Beginning no later than September 27, 2021, each owner or operator must maintain and operate all monitoring systems associated with the treatment system in accordance with the site-specific treatment system monitoring plan required in § 63.1983(b)(5)(ii). The owner or operator must:
(1) Install, calibrate, and maintain a gas flow rate measuring device that records the flow to the treatment system at least every 15 minutes; and
(2) Secure the bypass line valve in the closed position with a car-seal or a lock-and-key type configuration. A visual inspection of the seal or closure mechanism must be performed at least once every month to ensure that the valve is maintained in the closed position and that the gas flow is not diverted through the bypass line.
(h) The monitoring requirements of paragraphs (a), (b), (c), (d), and (g) of this section apply at all times the affected source is operating, except for periods of monitoring system malfunctions, repairs associated with monitoring system malfunctions, and required monitoring system quality assurance or quality control activities. A monitoring system malfunction is any sudden, infrequent, not reasonably preventable failure of the monitoring system to provide valid data. Monitoring system failures that are caused in part
by poor maintenance or careless operation are not malfunctions. You are required to complete monitoring system repairs in response to monitoring system malfunctions and to return the monitoring system to operation as expeditiously as practicable. Where an owner or operator subject to the provisions of this subpart seeks to demonstrate compliance with the temperature and nitrogen or oxygen operational standards in introductory paragraph § 63.1958(c)(1), (d)(2), and (e)(1), the standards apply at all times.

§ 63.1962
Specifications for active collection systems.
(a) Each owner or operator seeking to comply with § 63.1959(b)(2)(i) must site active collection wells, horizontal collectors, surface collectors, or other extraction devices at a sufficient density throughout all gas producing areas using the following procedures unless alternative procedures have been approved by the Administrator as provided in § 63.1981(d)(2) and (3):
(1) The collection devices within the interior must be certified to achieve comprehensive control of surface gas emissions by a professional engineer. The following issues must be addressed in the design: Depths of refuse, refuse gas generation rates and flow characteristics, cover properties, gas system expandability, leachate and condensate management, accessibility, compatibility with filling operations, integration with closure end use, air intrusion control, corrosion resistance, fill settlement, resistance to the refuse decomposition heat, and ability to isolate individual components or sections for repair or troubleshooting without shutting down entire collection system.
(2) The sufficient density of gas collection devices determined in paragraph (a)(1) of this section must address landfill gas migration issues and augmentation of the collection system through the use of active or passive systems at the landfill perimeter or exterior.
(3) The placement of gas collection devices determined in paragraph (a)(1) of this section must control all gas producing areas, except as provided by paragraphs (a)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section.
(i) Any segregated area of asbestos or nondegradable material may be excluded from collection if documented as provided under § 63.1983(d). The documentation must provide the nature, date of deposition, location and amount of asbestos or nondegradable material deposited in the area and must be provided to the Administrator upon request.
(ii) Any nonproductive area of the landfill may be excluded from control, provided that the total of all excluded areas can be shown to contribute less than 1 percent of the total amount of NMOC emissions from the landfill. The amount, location, and age of the material must be documented and provided to the Administrator upon request. A separate NMOC emissions estimate must be made for each section proposed for exclusion, and the sum of all such sections must be compared to the NMOC emissions estimate for the entire landfill.
(A) The NMOC emissions from each section proposed for exclusion must be computed using Equation 7:

(B) If the owner/operator is proposing to exclude, or cease gas collection and
control from, nonproductive physically separated (
e.g.,
separately lined) closed areas that already have gas collection systems, NMOC emissions from each physically separated closed area must be computed using either Equation 3 in § 63.1959(c) or Equation 7 in paragraph (a)(3)(ii)(A) of this section.
(iii) The values for k and C
NMOC
determined in field testing must be used if field testing has been performed in determining the NMOC emission rate or the radii of influence (the distance from the well center to a point in the landfill where the pressure gradient applied by the blower or compressor approaches zero). If field testing has not been performed, the default values for k, L
o
and C
NMOC
provided in § 63.1959(a)(1) or the alternative values from § 63.1959(a)(5) must be used. The mass of nondegradable solid waste contained within the given section may be subtracted from the total mass of the section when estimating emissions provided the nature, location, age, and amount of the nondegradable material is documented as provided in paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section.
(b) Each owner or operator seeking to comply with § 63.1959(b)(2)(ii) must construct the gas collection devices using the following equipment or procedures:
(1) The landfill gas extraction components must be constructed of polyvinyl chloride (PVC), high density polyethylene (HDPE) pipe, fiberglass, stainless steel, or other nonporous corrosion resistant material of suitable dimensions to: Convey projected amounts of gases; withstand installation, static, and settlement forces; and withstand planned overburden or traffic loads. The collection system must extend as necessary to comply with emission and migration standards. Collection devices such as wells and horizontal collectors must be perforated to allow gas entry without head loss sufficient to impair performance across the intended extent of control. Perforations must be situated with regard to the need to prevent excessive air infiltration.
(2) Vertical wells must be placed so as not to endanger underlying liners and must address the occurrence of water within the landfill. Holes and trenches constructed for piped wells and horizontal collectors must be of sufficient cross-section so as to allow for their proper construction and completion including, for example, centering of pipes and placement of gravel backfill. Collection devices must be designed so as not to allow indirect short circuiting of air into the cover or refuse into the collection system or gas into the air. Any gravel used around pipe perforations should be of a dimension so as not to penetrate or block perforations.
(3) Collection devices may be connected to the collection header pipes below or above the landfill surface. The connector assembly must include a positive closing throttle valve, any necessary seals and couplings, access couplings and at least one sampling port. The collection devices must be constructed of PVC, HDPE, fiberglass, stainless steel, or other nonporous material of suitable thickness.
(c) Each owner or operator seeking to comply with § 63.1959(b)(2)(iii) must convey the landfill gas to a control system in compliance with § 63.1959(b)(2)(iii) through the collection header pipe(s). The gas mover equipment must be sized to handle the maximum gas generation flow rate expected over the intended use period of the gas moving equipment using the following procedures:
(1) For existing collection systems, the flow data must be used to project the maximum flow rate. If no flow data exists, the procedures in paragraph (c)(2) of this section must be used.
(2) For new collection systems, the maximum flow rate must be in accordance with § 63.1960(a)(1).

# General and Continuing Compliance Requirements
§ 63.1964
How is compliance determined?
Compliance is determined using performance testing, collection system monitoring, continuous parameter monitoring, and other credible evidence. In addition, continuous parameter monitoring data collected under § 63.1961(b)(1), (c)(1), and (d) are used to demonstrate compliance with the operating standards for control systems. If a deviation occurs, you have failed to
meet the control device operating standards described in this subpart and have deviated from the requirements of this subpart.
(a) Before September 28, 2021, you must develop a written SSM plan according to the provisions in § 63.6(e)(3) of subpart A. A copy of the SSM plan must be maintained on site. Failure to write or maintain a copy of the SSM plan is a deviation from the requirements of this subpart.
(b) After September 27, 2021, the SSM provisions of § 63.6(e) of subpart A no longer apply to this subpart and the SSM plan developed under paragraph (a) of this section no longer applies. Compliance with the emissions standards and the operating standards of § 63.1958 of this subpart is required at all times.
§ 63.1965
What is a deviation?
A deviation is defined in § 63.1990. For the purposes of the landfill monitoring and SSM plan requirements, deviations include the items in paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section.
(a) A deviation occurs when the control device operating parameter boundaries described in § 63.1983(c)(1) are exceeded.
(b) A deviation occurs when 1 hour or more of the hours during the 3-hour block averaging period does not constitute a valid hour of data. A valid hour of data must have measured values for at least three 15-minute monitoring periods within the hour.
(c) Before September 28, 2021, a deviation occurs when a SSM plan is not developed or maintained on site and when an affected source fails to meet any emission limitation, (including any operating limit), or work practice requirement in this subpart during SSM, regardless of whether or not such failure is permitted by this subpart.
§ 63.1975
How do I calculate the 3-hour block average used to demonstrate compliance?
Before September 28, 2021, averages are calculated in the same way as they are calculated in § 60.758(b)(2)(i) of this subchapter for average combustion temperature and § 60.758(c) for 3-hour average combustion temperature for enclosed combustors, except that the data collected during the events listed in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section are not to be included in any average computed under this subpart. Beginning no later than September 27, 2021, averages are calculated according to § 63.1983(b)(2)(i) for average combustion temperature and § 63.1983(c)(1)(i) for 3-hour average combustion temperature for enclosed combustors, except that the data collected during the event listed in paragraph (a) of this section are not to be included in any average computed under this subpart.
(a) Monitoring system breakdowns, repairs, calibration checks, and zero (low-level) and high-level adjustments.
(b) Startups.
(c) Shutdowns.
(d) Malfunctions.

If you have previously submitted a design capacity report, amended design capacity report, initial NMOC emission rate report, initial or revised collection and control system design plan, closure report, equipment removal report, or initial performance test under 40 CFR part 60, subpart WWW; 40 CFR part 60, subpart XXX; or a federal plan or EPA-approved and effective state plan or tribal plan that implements either 40 CFR part 60, subpart Cc or 40 CFR part 60, subpart Cf, then that submission constitutes compliance with the design capacity report in paragraph (a) of this section, the amended design capacity report in paragraph (b) of this section, the initial NMOC emission rate report in paragraph (c) of this section, the initial collection and control system design plan in paragraph (d) of this section, the revised design plan in paragraph (e) of this section, the closure report in paragraph (f) of this section, the equipment removal report in paragraph (g) of this section, and the initial performance test report in paragraph (i) of this section. You do not need to re-submit the report(s). However, you must include a statement certifying
prior submission of the respective report(s) and the date of submittal in the first semi-annual report required in this section.
(a)
Initial design capacity report.
The initial design capacity report must contain the information specified in § 60.757(a)(2) of this chapter, except beginning no later than September 28, 2021, the report must contain:
(1) A map or plot of the landfill, providing the size and location of the landfill, and identifying all areas where solid waste may be landfilled according to the permit issued by the state, local, or tribal agency responsible for regulating the landfill.
(2) The maximum design capacity of the landfill. Where the maximum design capacity is specified in the permit issued by the state, local, or tribal agency responsible for regulating the landfill, a copy of the permit specifying the maximum design capacity may be submitted as part of the report. If the maximum design capacity of the landfill is not specified in the permit, the maximum design capacity must be calculated using good engineering practices. The calculations must be provided, along with the relevant parameters as part of the report. The landfill may calculate design capacity in either Mg or m
3
for comparison with the exemption values. If the owner or operator chooses to convert the design capacity from volume to mass or from mass to volume to demonstrate its design capacity is less than 2.5 million Mg or 2.5 million m
3
, the calculation must include a site-specific density, which must be recalculated annually. Any density conversions must be documented and submitted with the design capacity report. The state, tribal, local agency or Administrator may request other reasonable information as may be necessary to verify the maximum design capacity of the landfill.
(b)
Amended design capacity report.
An amended design capacity report must be submitted to the Administrator providing notification of an increase in the design capacity of the landfill, within 90 days of an increase in the maximum design capacity of the landfill to meet or exceed 2.5 million Mg and 2.5 million m
3
. This increase in design capacity may result from an increase in the permitted volume of the landfill or an increase in the density as documented in the annual recalculation required in § 63.1983(f).
(c)
NMOC emission rate report.
Each owner or operator subject to the requirements of this subpart must submit a copy of the latest NMOC emission rate report that was submitted according to § 60.757(b) of this chapter or submit an NMOC emission rate report to the Administrator initially and annually thereafter, except as provided for in paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(A) of this section. The Administrator may request such additional information as may be necessary to verify the reported NMOC emission rate. If you have submitted an annual report under 40 CFR part 60, subpart WWW; 40 CFR part 60, subpart XXX; or a Federal plan or EPA-approved and effective state plan or tribal plan that implements either 40 CFR part 60, subpart Cc or 40 CFR part 60, subpart Cf, then that submission constitutes compliance with the annual NMOC emission rate report in this paragraph. You do not need to re-submit the annual report for the current year. Beginning no later than September 27, 2021, the report must meet the following requirements:

(ii) Subsequent NMOC emission rate reports must be submitted annually thereafter, except as provided for in paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(A) of this section.
(A) If the estimated NMOC emission rate as reported in the annual report to the Administrator is less than 50 Mg/yr in each of the next 5 consecutive years, the owner or operator may elect to submit, an estimate of the NMOC emission rate for the next 5-year period in lieu of the annual report. This estimate must include the current amount of solid waste-in-place and the estimated
waste acceptance rate for each year of the 5 years for which an NMOC emission rate is estimated. All data and calculations upon which this estimate is based must be provided to the Administrator. This estimate must be revised at least once every 5 years. If the actual waste acceptance rate exceeds the estimated waste acceptance rate in any year reported in the 5-year estimate, a revised 5-year estimate must be submitted to the Administrator. The revised estimate must cover the 5-year period beginning with the year in which the actual waste acceptance rate exceeded the estimated waste acceptance rate.
(B) The report must be submitted following the procedure specified in paragraph (l)(2) of this section.
(2) The NMOC emission rate report must include all the data, calculations, sample reports and measurements used to estimate the annual or 5-year emissions.
(3) Each owner or operator subject to the requirements of this subpart is exempted from the requirements to submit an NMOC emission rate report, after installing a collection and control system that complies with § 63.1959(b)(2), during such time as the collection and control system is in operation and in compliance with §§ 63.1958 and 63.1960.
(d)

(2) The collection and control system design plan must include any alternatives to the operational standards, test methods, procedures, compliance measures, monitoring, recordkeeping or reporting provisions of §§ 63.1957 through 63.1983 proposed by the owner or operator.
(3) The collection and control system design plan must either conform with specifications for active collection systems in § 63.1962 or include a demonstration to the Administrator's satisfaction of the sufficiency of the alternative provisions to § 63.1962.
(4) Each owner or operator of an MSW landfill affected by this subpart must submit a collection and control system design plan to the Administrator for approval within 1 year of becoming subject to this subpart.
(5) The landfill owner or operator must notify the Administrator that the design plan is completed and submit a copy of the plan's signature page. The Administrator has 90 days to decide whether the design plan should be submitted for review. If the Administrator chooses to review the plan, the approval process continues as described in paragraph (d)(6) of this section. In the event that the design plan is required to be modified to obtain approval, the owner or operator must take any steps necessary to conform any prior actions to the approved design plan and any failure to do so could result in an enforcement action.
(6) Upon receipt of an initial or revised design plan, the Administrator must review the information submitted under paragraphs (d)(1) through (3) of this section and either approve it, disapprove it, or request that additional information be submitted. Because of the many site-specific factors involved with landfill gas system design, alternative systems may be necessary. A wide variety of system designs are possible, such as vertical wells, combination horizontal and vertical collection systems, or horizontal trenches only, leachate collection components, and passive systems.
(e)
Revised design plan.
Beginning no later than September 27, 2021, the owner or operator who has already been required to submit a design plan under paragraph (d) of this section must submit a revised design plan to the Administrator for approval as follows:

Closed area
means a separately lined area of an MSW landfill in which solid waste is no longer being placed. If additional solid waste is placed in that area of the landfill, that landfill area is no longer closed. The area must be separately lined to ensure that the landfill gas does not migrate between open and closed areas.
Closed landfill
means a landfill in which solid waste is no longer being placed, and in which no additional solid wastes will be placed without first filing a notification of modification as prescribed under § 63.9(b).

An MSW landfill may also receive other types of RCRA Subtitle D wastes (§ 257.2 of this chapter) such as commercial solid waste, nonhazardous sludge, conditionally exempt small quantity generator waste, and industrial solid waste. Portions of an MSW landfill may be separated by access roads. An MSW landfill may be publicly or privately owned. An MSW landfill may be a new MSW landfill, an existing MSW landfill, or a lateral expansion.
Municipal solid waste landfill emissions
or
MSW landfill emissions
means gas generated by the decomposition of organic waste deposited in an MSW landfill or derived from the evolution of organic compounds in the waste.
NMOC
means nonmethane organic compounds, as measured according to the provisions of § 63.1959.
Nondegradable waste
means any waste that does not decompose through chemical breakdown or microbiological activity. Examples are, but are not limited to, concrete, municipal waste combustor ash, and metals.
Passive collection system
means a gas collection system that solely uses positive pressure within the landfill to move the gas rather than using gas mover equipment.
Root cause analysis
means an assessment conducted through a process of investigation to determine the primary cause, and any other contributing causes, of an exceedance of a standard operating parameter at a wellhead.
Segregated yard waste
means vegetative matter resulting exclusively from the cutting of grass, the pruning and/or removal of bushes, shrubs, and trees, the weeding of gardens, and other landscaping maintenance activities.
Sludge
means the term sludge as defined in § 258.2 of this chapter.
Solid waste

Sufficient extraction rate
means a rate sufficient to maintain a negative pressure at all wellheads in the collection system without causing air infiltration, including any wellheads connected to the system as a result of expansion or excess surface emissions, for the life of the blower.
Treated landfill gas
means landfill gas processed in a treatment system as defined in this subpart.
Treatment system
means a system that filters, de-waters, and compresses landfill gas for sale or beneficial use.
Untreated landfill gas
means any landfill gas that is not treated landfill gas.

# Subpart CCCC—National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants: Manufacturing of Nutritional Yeast

# Source:
82 FR 48178, Oct. 16, 2017, unless otherwise noted.

# What This Subpart Covers
§ 63.2130
What is the purpose of this subpart?
This subpart establishes national emission limitations for hazardous air pollutants (HAP) emitted from manufacturers of nutritional yeast. This subpart also establishes requirements to demonstrate initial and continuous compliance with the emission limitations.
§ 63.2131
Am I subject to this subpart?
(a) You are subject to this subpart if you own or operate a nutritional yeast manufacturing facility that is, is located at, or is part of a major source of HAP emissions.
(1) A manufacturer of nutritional yeast is a facility that makes yeast for the purpose of becoming an ingredient in dough for bread or any other yeast-raised baked product, or for becoming a nutritional food additive intended for consumption by humans. A manufacturer of nutritional yeast does not include production of yeast intended for consumption by animals, such as an additive for livestock feed.
(2) A major source of HAP emissions is any stationary source or group of stationary sources located within a contiguous area and under common control that emits or has the potential to emit, considering controls, any single HAP at a rate of 9.07 megagrams (10 tons) or more per year or any combination of HAP at a rate of 22.68 megagrams (25 tons) or more per year.
(b) [Reserved]
§ 63.2132
What parts of my plant does this subpart cover?
(a) This subpart applies to each new, reconstructed, or existing “affected source” that produces
Saccharomyces cerevisiae
at a nutritional yeast manufacturing facility.
(b) The affected source is the collection of equipment used in the manufacture of the nutritional yeast species
Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
This collection of equipment includes fermentation vessels (fermenters), as described in paragraph (c) of this section. The collection of equipment used in the manufacture of the nutritional yeast species
Candida utilis
(torula yeast) is not part of the affected source.
(c) The emission limitations in this subpart apply to fermenters in the affected source that meet all of the criteria listed in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section.
(1) The fermenters are “fed-batch” as defined in § 63.2192.
(2) The fermenters are used to support one of the last three fermentation stages in a production run (
i.e.,
third-to-last stage, second-to-last stage, and last stage), which may be referred to as “stock, first generation, and trade,” “seed, semi-seed, and commercial,” or “CB4, CB5, and CB6” stages.
(d) The emission limitations in this subpart do not apply to flask, pure-culture, yeasting-tank, or any other set-batch (as defined in § 63.2192) fermentation, and they do not apply to any operations after the last dewatering operation, such as filtration.
(e) The emission limitations in Table 1 to this subpart do not apply to fermenters during the production of specialty yeast (defined in § 63.2192).
(f) An affected source is a “new affected source” if you commenced construction of the affected source after October 19, 1998, and you met the applicability criteria in § 63.2131 at the time you commenced construction.
(g) An affected source is “reconstructed” if it meets the criteria for reconstruction as defined in § 63.2.
(h) An affected source is “existing” if it is not new or reconstructed.
§ 63.2133
When do I have to comply with this subpart?
(a) If you have a new or reconstructed affected source, then you must comply with paragraph (a)(1) or (2) of this section.
(1) If you start up your affected source before May 21, 2001, then you must comply with this subpart no later than May 21, 2001.
(2) If you start up your affected source on or after May 21, 2001, then you must comply with this subpart upon startup of your affected source.
(b) If you have an existing affected source, then you must comply with this subpart no later than May 21, 2004.
(c) If you have an area source that increases its emissions, or its potential to emit, so that it becomes a major source of HAP, then paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section apply.
(1) Any portion of the existing facility that is a new affected source or a new reconstructed source must be in compliance with this subpart upon startup.
(2) All other parts of the affected source must be in compliance with this subpart by no later than 1 year after it becomes a major source.
(d) You must meet the notification requirements in § 63.2180 according to the schedule in § 63.2180 and in subpart A of this part.

# Emission Limitations
§ 63.2140
What emission limitations must I meet?
You must meet the applicable emission limitations in Table 1 to this subpart, according to the timeline provided in Table 7 to this subpart.

# General Compliance Requirements
§ 63.2150
What are my general requirements for complying with this subpart?
(a) You must be in compliance with the applicable emission limitations in Table 1 to this subpart at all times, and demonstrate compliance according to paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this section.
(1) To demonstrate compliance with emission limitations by using the 98-Percent Option, you must follow the procedures of § 63.2171(b).
(2) To demonstrate compliance with emission limitations by using the Average Option, you must follow the procedures of § 63.2171(c).
(3) To demonstrate compliance with emission limitations by using the Batch Option, you must follow the procedures of § 63.2171(d).
(b) You must monitor VOC concentration continuously for each batch by using the applicable monitoring method in Table 8 to this subpart.
(c) If the date upon which you must demonstrate initial compliance as specified in § 63.2160 falls after the compliance date specified for your affected source in § 63.2133, then you must maintain a log detailing the operation and maintenance of the continuous emission monitoring systems and the process and emissions control equipment during the period between those dates.
(d) At all times, you must operate and maintain any affected source, including associated air pollution control equipment and monitoring equipment, in a manner consistent with safety and
good air pollution control practices for minimizing emissions. The general duty to minimize emissions does not require you to make any further efforts to reduce emissions if levels required by the applicable standard have been achieved. Determination of whether an affected source is operating in compliance with operation and maintenance requirements will be based on information available to the Administrator that may include, but is not limited to, monitoring results, review of operation and maintenance procedures, review of operation and maintenance records, and inspection of the affected source.

# Testing and Initial Compliance Requirements
§ 63.2160
By what date must I conduct an initial compliance demonstration?
(a) For each emission limitation in Table 1 to this subpart for which you demonstrate compliance using the Average Option, you must demonstrate initial compliance for the period ending on the last day of the month that is 12 calendar months (or 11 calendar months, if the compliance date for your affected source is the first day of the month) after the compliance date that is specified for your affected source in § 63.2133.
(b) For each emission limitation in Table 1 to this subpart for which you demonstrate compliance using the Batch Option, you must demonstrate initial compliance for the period ending June 30 or December 31 (use whichever date is the first date following the compliance date that is specified for your affected source in § 63.2133).
§ 63.2161
What performance tests and other procedures must I use if I monitor brew ethanol?
(a) You must conduct each performance test in Table 2 to this subpart that applies to you, as specified in paragraphs (b) through (f) of this section.
(b) You must conduct performance tests under such conditions as the Administrator specifies, based on representative performance of the affected source for the period being tested, and under the specific conditions that this subpart specifies in Table 2 to this subpart and in paragraphs (b)(1) through (4) of this section. You must record the process information that is necessary to document operating conditions during the test and include in such record an explanation to support that such conditions represent normal operation. Upon request, you must make available to the Administrator such records as may be necessary to determine the conditions of performance tests.
(1) You must conduct each performance test concurrently with brew ethanol monitoring to establish a brew-to-exhaust correlation as specified in paragraph (e) of this section.
(2) For each fermentation stage, you must conduct one run of the EPA Test Method 25A of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7, over the entire length of a batch. The three fermentation stages do not have to be from the same production run.
(3) You must obtain your test sample at a point in the exhaust-gas stream before you inject any dilution air. For fermenters, dilution air is any air not needed to control fermentation.
(4) You must record the results of the test for each fermentation stage.
(c) You may not conduct performance tests during periods of malfunction.
(d) You must collect data to correlate the brew ethanol concentration to the VOC concentration in the fermenter exhaust according to paragraphs (d)(1) through (3) of this section.
(1) You must collect a separate set of brew ethanol concentration data for each fed-batch fermentation stage while manufacturing the product that constitutes the largest percentage (by mass) of average annual production.
(2) You must measure brew ethanol as specified in § 63.2164 concurrently with conducting a performance test for VOC in fermenter exhaust as specified in paragraph (b) of this section. You must measure brew ethanol at least once during each successive 30-minute period over the entire period of the performance test for VOC in fermenter exhaust.
(3) You must keep a record of the brew ethanol concentration data for each fermentation stage over the period of EPA Test Method 25A of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7, performance test.
(e) For each set of data that you collected under paragraphs (b) and (d) of this section, you must perform a linear regression of brew ethanol concentration (percent) on VOC fermenter exhaust concentration (parts per million by volume (ppmv) measured as propane). You must ensure the correlation between the brew ethanol concentration, as measured by the brew ethanol monitor, and the VOC fermenter exhaust concentration, as measured by EPA Test Method 25A of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7, is linear with a correlation coefficient of at least 0.90.
(f) You must calculate the VOC concentration in the fermenter exhaust for each batch using the brew ethanol concentration data according to Equation 1 of this section, and using the constants (CF and y) calculated by the applicable linear regression performed under paragraph (e) of this section.
ER16OC17.000
Where:
BAVOC = Batch-average concentration of VOC in fermenter exhaust (ppmv measured as propane), calculated for compliance demonstration
BAE = Batch-average concentration of brew ethanol in fermenter liquid (percent), measured by the brew ethanol monitor
CF = Constant established at performance test and representing the slope of the regression line
y = Constant established at performance test and representing the y-intercept of the regression line
§ 63.2162
When must I conduct subsequent performance tests if I monitor brew ethanol?
(a) For each emission limitation in Table 1 to this subpart for which compliance is demonstrated by monitoring brew ethanol concentration and calculating VOC concentration in the fermenter exhaust according to the procedures in § 63.2161, you must conduct an EPA Test Method 25A of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7, performance test and establish a brew-to-exhaust correlation according to the procedures in Table 2 to this subpart and in § 63.2161, at least once every year.
(b) The first subsequent performance test must be conducted no later than 365 calendar days after the initial performance test conducted according to § 63.2160. Each subsequent performance test must be conducted no later than 365 calendar days after the previous performance test. You must conduct a performance test for each 365 calendar day period during which you demonstrate compliance using the brew ethanol correlation developed according to § 63.2161.
§ 63.2163
If I monitor fermenter exhaust, what are my monitoring installation, operation, and maintenance requirements?
(a) You must install and certify a CEMS that generates a single combined response value for VOC concentration (VOC CEMS) according to the procedures and requirements in Performance Specification 8—Performance Specifications for Volatile Organic Compound Continuous Emission Monitoring Systems in Stationary Sources in appendix B to part 60 of this chapter.
(b) You must operate and maintain your VOC CEMS according to the procedures and requirements in Procedure 1—Quality Assurance Requirements for Gas Continuous Emission Monitoring Systems Used for Compliance Determination in appendix F to part 60 of this chapter, except with regard to provisions concerning relative accuracy test audit (RATA), cylinder gas audit (CGA), and relative accuracy audit (RAA) frequencies; out of control period definition; and CEMS data status during out of control periods; which are instead specified in this paragraph for frequencies; and § 63.8(c)(7) for the definition of and status of CEMS data during out of control periods.
(1) You must conduct a RATA at least once every 12 calendar quarters, in accordance with sections 8 and 11, as applicable, of Performance Specification 8.
(2) You must conduct a CGA or RAA in the calendar quarters during which a RATA is not conducted, but in no more than 11 quarters in succession.
(3) As necessary, rather than relying on citation 2 of Procedure 1 of appendix F to 40 CFR part 60, you must rely on EPA/600/R-12/531 (incorporated by reference, see § 63.14).
(4) Your affected source must meet the criteria of Performance Specification 8, section 13.2.
(c) You must use Method 25A in appendix A-7 to part 60 of this chapter as the Reference Method.
(d) You must calibrate your VOC CEMS with propane.
(e) You must set your VOC CEMS span at less than 5 times the relevant VOC emission limitation given in Table 1 of this subpart. Note that the EPA considers 1.5 to 2.5 times the relevant VOC emission limitation to be the optimum range, in general.
(f) You must complete the performance evaluation and submit the performance evaluation report before the compliance date that is specified for your affected source in § 63.2133.
(g) You must monitor VOC concentration in fermenter exhaust at any point prior to dilution of the exhaust stream.
(h) You must collect data using the VOC CEMS at all times during each batch monitoring period, except for periods of monitoring system malfunctions, required monitoring system quality assurance or quality control activities (including, as applicable, calibration checks and required zero and span adjustments), and any scheduled maintenance.
(i) For each CEMS, you must record the results of each inspection, calibration, and validation check.
(j) You must check the zero (low-level) and high-level calibration drifts for each CEMS in accordance with the applicable Performance Specification of 40 CFR part 60, appendix B. You must adjust the zero (low-level) and high-level calibration drifts, at a minimum, whenever the zero (low-level) drift exceeds 2 times the limits of the applicable Performance Specification. You must perform the calibration drift checks at least once daily except under the conditions of paragraphs (j)(1) through (3) of this section.
(1) If a 24-hour calibration drift check for your CEMS is performed immediately prior to, or at the start of, a batch monitoring period of a duration exceeding 24 hours, then you are not required to perform 24-hour-interval calibration drift checks during that batch monitoring period.
(2) If the 24-hour calibration drift exceeds 2.5 percent of the span value in fewer than 5 percent of the checks over a 1-month period, and the 24-hour calibration drift never exceeds 7.5 percent of the span value, then you may reduce the frequency of calibration drift checks to at least weekly (once every 7 days).
(3) If, during two consecutive weekly checks, the weekly calibration drift exceeds 5 percent of the span value, then you must resume a frequency of at least 24-hour interval calibration checks until the 24-hour calibration checks meet the test of paragraph (j)(2) of this section.
§ 63.2164
If I monitor brew ethanol, what are my monitoring installation, operation, and maintenance requirements?
(a) You must install, operate, and maintain each brew ethanol monitor according to the manufacturer's specifications and in accordance with § 63.2150(d).
(b) Each of your brew ethanol monitors must complete a minimum of one cycle of operation (sampling, analyzing, and data recording) for each successive 30-minute period within each batch monitoring period. Except as specified in paragraph (c) of this section, you must have a minimum of two cycles of operation in a 1-hour period to have a valid hour of data.
(c) You must reduce the brew ethanol monitor data to arithmetic batch averages computed from two or more data points over each 1-hour period, except during periods when calibration, quality assurance, or maintenance activities pursuant to provisions of this part are being performed. During these periods, a valid hour of data must consist of at least one data point representing a 30-minute period.
(d) You must have valid brew ethanol monitor data from all operating hours over the entire batch monitoring period.
(e) You must set the brew ethanol monitor span to correspond to not greater than 5 times the relevant emission limitation; note that we consider 1.5 to 2.5 times the relevant emission limitation to be the optimum range, in general. You must use the brew-to-exhaust correlation equation established under § 63.2161(f) to determine the span value for your brew ethanol monitor that corresponds to the relevant emission limitation.
(f) For each brew ethanol monitor, you must record the results of each inspection, calibration, and validation check.
(g) The gas chromatograph (GC) that you use to calibrate your brew ethanol monitor must meet the requirements of paragraphs (g)(1) through (3) of this section.
(1) You must calibrate the GC at least daily, by analyzing standard solutions of ethanol in water (0.05 percent, 0.15 percent, and 0.3 percent).
(2) For use in calibrating the GC, you must prepare the standard solutions of ethanol using the procedures listed in paragraphs (g)(2)(i) through (vi) of this section.
(i) Starting with 100-percent ethanol, you must dry the ethanol by adding a small amount of anhydrous magnesium sulfate (granular) to 15-20 milliliters (ml) of ethanol.
(ii) You must place approximately 50 ml of water into a 100-ml volumetric flask and place the flask on a balance. You must tare the balance. You must weigh 2.3670 grams of the dry (anhydrous) ethanol into the volumetric flask.
(iii) You must add the 100-ml volumetric flask contents to a 1000-ml volumetric flask. You must rinse the 100-ml volumetric flask with water into the 1000-ml flask. You must bring the volume to 1000 ml with water.
(iv) You must place an aliquot into a sample bottle labeled “0.3% Ethanol.”

At the end of each calendar month, you must determine the percentage of batches that were in compliance with the applicable maximum concentration in the 12-month calculation period. The total number of batches in the calculation period is the sum of the numbers of batches of each fermentation stage for which emission limitations apply. To determine which batches are in the 12-month calculation period, you must include those batches for which the batch monitoring period ended at or after midnight on the first day of the period and exclude those batches for which the batch monitoring period did not end before midnight on the last day of the period.
(c) To demonstrate compliance with emission limitations by using the Average Option, you must follow the procedures in this paragraph and paragraphs (e)(1) and (2) of this section. At the end of each calendar month, you must determine the average VOC concentration from all batches in each fermentation stage in a 12-month calculation period. To determine which batches are in a 12-month calculation period, you must include those batches for which the batch monitoring period ended at or after midnight on the first day of the period and exclude those batches for which the batch monitoring period did not end before midnight on the last day of the period.
(d) To demonstrate compliance with emission limitations by using the Batch Option, you must determine the average VOC concentration in the fermenter exhaust for each batch of each fermentation stage in a semiannual reporting period (
i.e.,
January 1 through June 30 or July 1 through December 31). To determine which batches are in the semiannual reporting period, you must include those batches for which the batch monitoring period ended at or after midnight on the first day of
the period and exclude those batches for which the batch monitoring period did not end before midnight on the last day of the period.
(e) To demonstrate compliance with an emission limitation using a 12-month calculation period, you must follow the procedures in paragraphs (e)(1) and (2) of this section.
(1) The first 12-month calculation period begins on the compliance date that is specified for your affected source in § 63.2133 and ends on the last day of the month that includes the date 1 year after your compliance date, unless the compliance date for your affected source is the first day of the month, in which case the first 12-month calculation period ends on the last day of the month that is 11 calendar months after the compliance date.
(2) The second 12-month calculation period and each subsequent 12-month calculation period begins on the first day of the month following the first full month of the previous 12-month calculation period and ends on the last day of the month 11 calendar months later.

# Compliance Options, Operating Requirements, and Work Practice Requirements
§ 63.2240
What are the compliance options and operating requirements and how must I meet them?
You must meet the compliance options and operating requirements described in Tables 1A, 1B, and 2 to this subpart and in paragraph (c) of this section by using one or more of the compliance options listed in paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section. The process units subject to the compliance options are listed in Tables 1A and 1B to this subpart and are defined in § 63.2292. You need only to meet one of the compliance options outlined in paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section for each process unit. You cannot combine compliance options in paragraph (a), (b), or (c) for a single process unit. (For example, you cannot use a production-based compliance option in paragraph (a) for one vent of a veneer dryer and an add-on control system compliance option in paragraph (b) for another vent on the same veneer dryer. You must use either the production-based compliance option or an add-on control system compliance option for the entire dryer.)
(a)
Production-based compliance options.
You must meet the production-based total HAP compliance options in Table 1A to this subpart and the applicable operating requirements in Table 2 to this subpart. You may not use an add-on control system or wet control device to meet the production-based compliance options.
(b)
Compliance options for add-on control systems.
You must use an emissions control system and demonstrate that the resulting emissions meet the compliance options and operating requirements in Tables 1B and 2 to this subpart. If you own or operate a reconstituted wood product press at a new or existing affected source or a reconstituted wood product board cooler at a new affected source, and you choose to
comply with one of the concentration-based compliance options for a control system outlet (presented as option numbers 2, 4, and 6 in Table 1B to this subpart), you must have a capture device that either meets the definition of wood products enclosure in § 63.2292 or achieves a capture efficiency of greater than or equal to 95 percent.
(c)
Emissions averaging compliance option (for existing sources only).
Using the procedures in paragraphs (c)(1) through (3) of this section, you must demonstrate that emissions included in the emissions average meet the compliance options and operating requirements. New sources may not use emissions averaging to comply with this subpart.
(1)
Calculation of required and actual mass removal.
Limit emissions of total HAP, as defined in § 63.2292, to include acetaldehyde, acrolein, formaldehyde, methanol, phenol, and propionaldehyde from your affected source to the standard specified by Equations 1, 2, and 3 of this section.

CD
i
= control system efficiency for the emission point (i) for total HAP, expressed as a fraction, and not to exceed 90 percent, unitless (Note: To calculate the control system efficiency of biological treatment units that do not meet the definition of biofilter in § 63.2292, you must use 40 CFR part 63, appendix C, Determination of the Fraction Biodegraded (F
bio
) in a Biological Treatment Unit.);
OCEP
i
= mass of total HAP from a process unit (i) that generates credits (including credits from debit-generating process units that are under-controlled), pounds per hour;
0.90 = required control system efficiency of 90 percent multiplied, unitless.
(2)
Requirements for debits and credits.
You must calculate debits and credits as specified in paragraphs (c)(2)(i) through (vi) of this section.
(i) You must limit process units in the emissions average to those process units located at the existing affected source as defined in § 63.2292.
(ii) You cannot use nonoperating process units to generate emissions averaging credits. You cannot use process units that are shut down to generate emissions averaging debits or credits.
(iii) You may not include in your emissions average process units controlled to comply with a State, Tribal, or Federal rule other than this subpart.
(iv) You must use actual measurements of total HAP emissions from process units to calculate your required mass removal (RMR) and actual mass removal (AMR). The total HAP measurements must be obtained according to § 63.2262(b) through (d), (g), and (h), using the methods specified in Table 4 to this subpart.
(v) Your initial demonstration that the credit-generating process units will be capable of generating enough credits to offset the debits from the debit-generating process units must be made under representative operating conditions. After the compliance date, you must use actual operating data for all debit and credit calculations.
(vi) Do not include emissions from the following time periods in your emissions averaging calculations:
(A) Before August 13, 2021, emissions during periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction as described in the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan (SSMP). On and after August 13, 2021, emissions during safety-related shutdowns, pressurized refiner startups
and shutdowns, or startup and shutdown of direct-fired softwood veneer dryer gas-fired burners.
(B) Emissions during periods of monitoring malfunctions, associated repairs, and required quality assurance or control activities or during periods of control device maintenance covered in your routine control device maintenance exemption. No credits may be assigned to credit-generating process units, and maximum debits must be assigned to debit-generating process units during these periods.
(3)
Operating requirements.
You must meet the operating requirements in Table 2 to this subpart for each process unit or control device used in calculation of emissions averaging credits.
[69 FR 46011, July 30, 2004, as amended at 85 FR 49455, Aug. 13, 2020]
§ 63.2241
What are the work practice requirements and how must I meet them?
(a) You must meet each work practice requirement in Table 3 to this subpart that applies to you.
(b) As provided in § 63.6(g), we, the EPA, may choose to grant you permission to use an alternative to the work practice requirements in this section.
(c) If you have a dry rotary dryer, you may choose to designate your dry rotary dryer as a green rotary dryer and meet the more stringent compliance options and operating requirements in § 63.2240 for green rotary dryers instead of the work practices for dry rotary dryers. If you have a hardwood veneer dryer or veneer redryer, you may choose to designate your hardwood veneer dryer or veneer redryer as a softwood veneer dryer and meet the more stringent compliance options and operating requirements in § 63.2240 for softwood veneer dryer heated zones instead of the work practices for hardwood veneer dryers or veneer redryers.

# General Compliance Requirements

(a) To demonstrate initial compliance with the compliance options and operating requirements, you must conduct performance tests and establish each site-specific operating requirement in Table 2 to this subpart according to the requirements in § 63.2262 and Table 4 to this subpart. Combustion units that accept process exhausts into the flame zone are exempt from the initial performance testing and operating requirements for thermal oxidizers.
(b) You must demonstrate initial compliance with each compliance option, operating requirement, and work practice requirement that applies to you according to Tables 5 and 6 to this subpart and according to §§ 63.2260 through 63.2269 of this subpart.
(c) You must submit the Notification of Compliance Status containing the results of the initial compliance demonstration according to the requirements in § 63.2280(d).
§ 63.2261
By what date must I conduct performance tests or other initial compliance demonstrations?
(a) You must conduct performance tests upon initial startup or no later than 180 calendar days after the compliance date that is specified for your source in § 63.2233 and according to § 63.7(a)(2), whichever is later.
(b) You must conduct initial compliance demonstrations that do not require performance tests upon initial startup or no later than 30 calendar days after the compliance date that is specified for your source in § 63.2233, whichever is later.
§ 63.2262
How do I conduct performance tests and establish operating requirements?
(a)
Testing procedures.
You must conduct each performance test according to the requirements in paragraphs (b) through (o) of this section and according to the methods specified in Table 4 to this subpart.
(b)
Periods when performance tests must be conducted.
You must conduct each performance test based on representative performance (
i.e.,
performance based on representative operating conditions as defined in § 63.2292) of the affected source for the period being tested. Representative conditions exclude periods of startup and shutdown. You may not conduct performance tests during periods of malfunction. You must describe representative operating conditions in your performance test report for the process and control systems and explain why they are representative. You must record the process information that is necessary to document operating conditions during the test and include in such record an explanation to support that such conditions are representative. Upon request, you shall make available to the Administrator such records as may be necessary to determine the conditions of performance tests.
(c)
Number of test runs.
You must conduct three separate test runs for each performance test required in this section as specified in § 63.7(e)(3). Each test run must last at least 1 hour except for: testing of a temporary total enclosure (TTE) conducted using Methods 204A through 204F of 40 CFR part 51, appendix M, which require three separate test runs of at least 3 hours each; and testing of an enclosure conducted using the alternative tracer gas method in appendix A to this subpart, which requires a minimum of three separate runs of at least 20 minutes each.
(d)
Location of sampling sites.
(1) Sampling sites must be located at the inlet (if emission reduction testing or documentation of inlet methanol or formaldehyde concentration is required) and outlet of the control device (defined in § 63.2292) and prior to any releases to the atmosphere. For control sequences with wet control devices (defined in § 63.2292) followed by control devices (defined in § 63.2292), sampling sites may be located at the inlet and outlet of the control sequence and prior to any releases to the atmosphere.
(2) Sampling sites for process units meeting compliance options without a control device must be located prior to any releases to the atmosphere. Facilities demonstrating compliance with a production-based compliance option for a process unit equipped with a wet control device must locate sampling sites prior to the wet control device.
(e)
Collection of monitoring data.
You must collect operating parameter monitoring system or continuous emissions monitoring system (CEMS) data at least every 15 minutes during the entire performance test and determine the parameter or concentration value for the operating requirement during the performance test using the methods specified in paragraphs (k) through (o) of this section.
(f)
Collection of production data.
To comply with any of the production-based compliance options, you must measure and record the process unit throughput during each performance test.
(g)

When determining the control system efficiency for any control system included in your emissions averaging plan (not to exceed 90 percent) and when complying with any of the compliance options based on percent reduction across a
control system in Table 1B to this subpart, as part of the performance test, you must calculate the percent reduction using Equation 1 of this section:
ER72AD04.003
Where:
PR = percent reduction, percent;
CE = capture efficiency, percent (determined for reconstituted wood product presses and board coolers as required in Table 4 to this subpart);
ER
in
= emission rate of total HAP (calculated as the sum of the emission rates of acetaldehyde, acrolein, formaldehyde, methanol, phenol, and propionaldehyde), THC, formaldehyde, or methanol in the inlet vent stream of the control device, pounds per hour;
ER

ER72AD04.004
Where:
MP = mass per unit production, pounds per oven dried ton OR pounds per thousand square feet on a specified thickness basis (see paragraph (j) of this section if you need to convert from one thickness basis to another);
ER
HAP
= emission rate of total HAP (calculated as the sum of the emission rates of acetaldehyde, acrolein, formaldehyde, methanol, phenol, and propionaldehyde) in the stack, pounds per hour;
P = process unit production rate (throughput), oven dried tons per hour OR thousand square feet per hour on a specified thickness basis;
CE = capture efficiency, percent (determined for reconstituted wood product presses and board coolers as required in Table 4 to this subpart).
(j)
Thickness basis conversion.
Use Equation 3 of this section to convert from one thickness basis to another:
ER72AD04.005
Where:

A
= thousand square feet on an A-inch basis;
MSF
B
= thousand square feet on a B-inch basis;
A = old thickness you are converting from, inches;
B = new thickness you are converting to, inches.
(k)
Establishing thermal oxidizer operating requirements.
If you operate a thermal oxidizer, you must establish your thermal oxidizer operating parameters according to paragraphs (k)(1) through (3) of this section.
(1) During the performance test, you must continuously monitor the firebox temperature during each of the required 1-hour test runs. For regenerative thermal oxidizers, you may measure the temperature in multiple locations (
e.g.
, one location per burner) in the combustion chamber and calculate the average of the temperature measurements prior to reducing the temperature data to 15-minute averages for purposes of establishing your minimum firebox temperature. The minimum firebox temperature must then be established as the average of the three minimum 15-minute firebox temperatures monitored during the three test runs. Multiple three-run performance tests may be conducted to establish a range of parameter values under different operating conditions.
(2) You may establish a different minimum firebox temperature for your thermal oxidizer by submitting the notification specified in § 63.2280(g) and conducting a repeat performance test as specified in paragraph (k)(1) of this section that demonstrates compliance with the applicable compliance options of this subpart.
(3) If your thermal oxidizer is a combustion unit that accepts process exhaust into the flame zone, then you are exempt from the performance testing and monitoring requirements specified in paragraphs (k)(1) and (2) of this section. To demonstrate initial compliance, you must submit documentation with your Notification of Compliance Status showing that process exhausts
controlled by the combustion unit enter into the flame zone.
(l)

To monitor biofilter bed temperature, you may use multiple thermocouples in representative locations throughout the biofilter bed and calculate the average biofilter bed temperature across these thermocouples prior to reducing the temperature data to 15-minute averages for purposes of establishing biofilter bed temperature limits. The biofilter bed temperature range must be established as the temperature values 10 percent below the minimum and 10 percent (not to exceed 8 °F) above the maximum 15-minute biofilter bed temperatures monitored during the three test runs. You may base your biofilter bed temperature range on values recorded during previous performance tests provided that the data used to establish the temperature ranges have been obtained using the test methods required in this subpart. If you use data from previous performance tests, you must certify that the biofilter and associated process unit(s) have not been modified subsequent to the date of the performance tests. Replacement of the biofilter media with the same type of material is not considered a modification of the biofilter for purposes of this section.
(2) For a new biofilter installation, you will be allowed up to 180 days following the compliance date or 180 days following initial startup of the biofilter to complete the requirements in paragraph (m)(1) of this section.

If you operate a process unit that meets a compliance option in Table 1A to this subpart, or is a process unit that generates debits in an emissions average without the use of a control device, you must establish your process unit operating parameters according to paragraphs (n)(1) through (2) of this section.
(1) During the performance test, you must identify and document the process unit controlling parameter(s) that affect total HAP emissions during the three-run performance test. The controlling parameters you identify must coincide with the representative operating conditions you describe according to paragraph (b) of this section. For each parameter, you must specify appropriate monitoring methods, monitoring frequencies, and for continuously monitored parameters, averaging
times not to exceed 24 hours. The operating limit for each controlling parameter must then be established as the minimum, maximum, range, or average (as appropriate depending on the parameter) recorded during the performance test. Multiple three-run performance tests may be conducted to establish a range of parameter values under different operating conditions.
(2) You may establish different controlling parameter limits for your process unit by submitting the notification specified in § 63.2280(g) and conducting a repeat performance test as specified in paragraph (n)(1) of this section that demonstrates compliance with the compliance options in Table 1A to this subpart or is used to establish emission averaging debits for an uncontrolled process unit.
(o)
Establishing operating requirements using THC CEMS.
If you choose to meet the operating requirements by monitoring THC concentration instead of monitoring control device or process operating parameters, you must establish your THC concentration operating requirement according to paragraphs (o)(1) through (2) of this section.
(1) During the performance test, you must continuously monitor THC concentration using your CEMS during each of the required 1-hour test runs. The maximum THC concentration must then be established as the average of the three maximum 15-minute THC concentrations monitored during the three test runs. Multiple three-run performance tests may be conducted to establish a range of THC concentration values under different operating conditions.
(2) You may establish a different maximum THC concentration by submitting the notification specified in § 63.2280(g) and conducting a repeat performance test as specified in paragraph (o)(1) of this section that demonstrates compliance with the compliance options in Tables 1A and 1B to this subpart.

# Continuous Compliance Requirements
§ 63.2270
How do I monitor and collect data to demonstrate continuous compliance?
(a) You must monitor and collect data according to this section.
(b) Except for, as appropriate, monitor malfunctions, associated repairs, and required quality assurance or control activities (including, as applicable, calibration checks and required zero and span adjustments), you must conduct all monitoring in continuous operation at all times that the process unit is operating. For purposes of calculating data averages, you must not use data recorded during monitoring malfunctions, associated repairs, out-of-control periods, or required quality assurance or control activities. You must use all the data collected during all other periods in assessing compliance. A monitoring malfunction is any sudden, infrequent, not reasonably preventable failure of the monitoring to provide valid data. Monitoring failures that are caused in part by poor maintenance or careless operation are not malfunctions. Any period for which the monitoring system is out-of-control and data are not available for required calculations constitutes a deviation from the monitoring requirements.
(c) You may not use data recorded during monitoring malfunctions, associated repairs, and required quality assurance or control activities or data recorded during periods of safety-related shutdown, pressurized refiner startup or shutdown, startup and shutdown of direct-fired softwood veneer dryer gas-fired burners, or control device downtime covered in any approved routine control device maintenance exemption in data averages and calculations used to report emission or operating levels, nor may such data be used in fulfilling a minimum data availability requirement, if applicable. You must use all the data collected during all other periods in assessing the operation of the control system.
(d) Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, determine the 3-hour block average of all recorded readings, calculated after every 3 hours of operation as the average of the evenly spaced recorded readings in the previous 3 operating hours (excluding periods described in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section).
(e) For dry rotary dryer and veneer redryer wood moisture monitoring, dry rotary dryer temperature monitoring, biofilter bed temperature monitoring, and biofilter outlet THC monitoring, determine the 24-hour block average of all recorded readings, calculated after every 24 hours of operation as the average of the evenly spaced recorded readings in the previous 24 operating hours (excluding periods described in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section).
(f) To calculate the data averages for each 3-hour or 24-hour averaging period, you must have at least 75 percent of the required recorded readings for that period using only recorded readings that are based on valid data (
i.e.
, not from periods described in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section).

This includes periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction and periods of control device maintenance specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (4) of this section. These instances are deviations from the compliance options, operating requirements, and work practice requirements in this subpart. These deviations must be reported according to the requirements in § 63.2281.
(1)-(2) [Reserved]
(3) Deviations that occur during periods of control device maintenance covered by any approved routine control device maintenance exemption are not violations if you demonstrate to the EPA Administrator's satisfaction that you were operating in accordance with the approved routine control device maintenance exemption.
(4) Instances of safety-related shutdown, pressurized refiner startup and shutdown, and startup and shutdown of direct-fired softwood veneer dryer gas-fired burners subject to the work practice requirements in Table 3 to this subpart (rows 6 through 8) must be reported as required in § 63.2281(c)(4).

# Appendix A to Subpart DDDD of Part 63—Alternative Procedure To Determine Capture Efficiency From Enclosures Around Hot Presses in the Plywood and Composite Wood Products Industry Using Sulfur Hexafluoride Tracer Gas

# 1.0 Scope and Application
This procedure has been developed specifically for the rule for the plywood and composite wood products (PCWP) industry and is used to determine the capture efficiency of a partial hot press enclosure in that industry. This procedure is applicable for the determination of capture efficiency for enclosures around hot presses and is an alternative to the construction of temporary total enclosures (TTE). Sulfur hexafluoride (SF
6
) is used as a tracer gas (other tracer gases may be used if approved by the EPA Administrator). This gas is not indigenous to the ambient atmosphere and is nonreactive.
This procedure uses infrared spectrometry (IR) as the analytical technique. When the infrared spectrometer used is a Fourier-Transform Infrared spectrometer (FTIR), an alternate instrument calibration procedure may be used; the alternate calibration procedure is the calibration transfer standard (CTS) procedure of EPA Method 320 (appendix A to 40 CFR part 63). Other analytical techniques which are capable of equivalent Method Performance (Section 13.0) also may be used. Specifically, gas chromatography with electron capture detection (GC/ECD) is an applicable technique for analysis of SF
6
.

# 2.0 Summary of Method
A constant mass flow rate of SF
6
tracer gas is released through manifolds at multiple locations within the enclosure to mimic the release of hazardous air pollutants during the press process. This test method requires a minimum of three SF
6
injection points (two at the press unloader and one at the press) and provides details about considerations for locating the injection points. A GC/ECD is used to measure the concentration of SF
6
at the inlet duct to the control device (outlet duct from enclosure). Simultaneously, EPA Method 2 (appendix A to 40 CFR part 60) is used to measure the flow rate at the inlet duct to the control device. The concentration and flow rate measurements are used to calculate the mass emission rate of SF
6
at the control device inlet. Through calculation of the mass of SF
6
released through the manifolds and the mass of SF
6
measured at the inlet to the control device, the capture efficiency of the enclosure is calculated.
In addition, optional samples of the ambient air may be taken at locations around the perimeter of the enclosure to quantify the ambient concentration of SF
6
and to identify those areas of the enclosure that may be performing less efficiently; these samples would be taken using disposable syringes and would be analyzed using a GC/ECD.
Finally, in addition to the requirements specified in this procedure, the data quality objectives (DQO) or lower confidence limit (LCL) criteria specified in appendix A to 40 CFR part 63, subpart KK, Data Quality Objective and Lower Confidence Limit Approaches for Alternative Capture Efficiency Protocols and Test Methods, must also be satisfied. A minimum of three test runs are required for this procedure; however, additional test runs may be required based on the results of the DQO or LCL analysis.

# 3.0 Definitions
3.1 Capture efficiency (CE). The weight per unit time of SF
6
entering the control device divided by the weight per unit time of SF
6
released through manifolds at multiple locations within the enclosure.
3.2 Control device (CD). The equipment used to reduce, by destruction or removal, press exhaust air pollutants prior to discharge to the ambient air.
3.3 Control/destruction efficiency (DE). The volatile organic compound or HAP removal efficiency of the control device.
3.4 Data Quality Objective (DQO) Approach. A statistical procedure to determine the precision of the data from a test series and to qualify the data in the determination of capture efficiency for compliance purposes. If the results of the DQO analysis of the initial three test runs do not satisfy the DQO criterion, the LCL approach can be used or additional test runs must be conducted. If additional test runs are conducted, then the DQO or LCL analysis is conducted using the data from both the initial test runs and all additional test runs.
3.5 Lower Confidence Limit (LCL) Approach. An alternative statistical procedure that can be used to qualify data in the determination of capture efficiency for compliance purposes. If the results of the LCL approach produce a CE that is too low for demonstrating compliance, then additional test runs must be conducted until the LCL or DQO is met. As with the DQO, data from all valid test runs must be used in the calculation.
3.6 Minimum Measurement Level (MML). The minimum tracer gas concentration expected to be measured during the test series. This value is selected by the tester based on the capabilities of the IR spectrometer (or GC/ECD) and the other known or measured parameters of the hot press enclosure to be tested. The selected MML must be above the low-level calibration standard and preferably below the mid-level calibration standard.
3.7 Method 204. The U.S. EPA Method 204, “Criteria For and Verification of a Permanent or Temporary Total Enclosure” (40 CFR part 51, appendix M).
3.8 Method 205. The U.S. EPA Method 205, “Verification of Gas Dilution Systems for Field Instrument Calibrations” (40 CFR part 51, appendix M).
3.9 Method 320. The U.S. EPA Method 320, “Measurement of Vapor Phase Organic and Inorganic Emissions by Extractive Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectroscopy” (40 CFR part 63, appendix A).
3.10 Overall capture and control efficiency (CCE). The collection and control/destruction efficiency of both the PPE and CD combined. The CCE is calculated as the product of the CE and DE.
3.11 Partial press enclosure (PPE). The physical barrier that “partially” encloses the press equipment, captures a significant amount of the associated emissions, and transports those emissions to the CD.
3.12 Test series. A minimum of three test runs or, when more than three runs are conducted, all of the test runs conducted.

# 4.0 Interferences
There are no known interferences.

# 5.0 Safety
Sulfur hexafluoride is a colorless, odorless, nonflammable liquefied gas. It is stable and nonreactive and, because it is noncorrosive, most structural materials are compatible with it. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration Permissible Emission Limit-Time Weighted Average (PEL-TWA) and Threshold Limit Value-Time Weighted Average (TLV-TWA) concentrations are 1,000 parts per million. Sulfur hexafluoride is an asphyxiant. Exposure to an oxygen-deficient atmosphere (less than 19.5 percent oxygen) may cause dizziness, drowsiness, nausea, vomiting, excess salivation, diminished mental alertness, loss of consciousness, and death. Exposure to atmospheres containing less than 12 percent oxygen will bring about unconsciousness without warning and so quickly that the individuals cannot help themselves. Contact with liquid or cold vapor may cause frostbite. Avoid breathing sulfur hexafluoride gas. Self-contained breathing apparatus may be required by rescue workers. Sulfur hexafluoride is not listed as a carcinogen or a potential carcinogen.

# 6.0 Equipment and Supplies
This method requires equipment and supplies for: (a) the injection of tracer gas into the enclosure, (b) the measurement of the tracer gas concentration in the exhaust gas entering the control device, and (c) the measurement of the volumetric flow rate of the exhaust gas entering the control device. In addition, the requisite equipment needed for EPA Methods 1-4 in appendix A to 40 CFR part 60 will be required. Equipment and supplies for optional ambient air sampling are discussed in Section 8.6.
6.1 Tracer Gas Injection.
6.1.1 Manifolds. This method requires the use of tracer gas supply cylinder(s) along with the appropriate flow control elements. Figure 1 shows a schematic drawing of the injection system showing potential locations for the tracer gas manifolds. Figure 2 shows a schematic drawing of the recommended configuration of the injection manifold. Three tracer gas discharge manifolds are required at a minimum.
6.1.2 Flow Control Meter. Flow control and measurement meter for measuring the quantity of tracer gas injected. A mass flow, volumetric flow, or critical orifice control meter can be used for this method. The meter must be accurate to within ±5 percent at the flow rate used. This means that the flow meter must be calibrated against a primary standard for flow measurement at the appropriate flow rate.
6.2 Measurement of Tracer Gas Concentration.
6.2.1 Sampling Probes. Use Pyrex or stainless steel sampling probes of sufficient length to reach the traverse points calculated according to EPA Method 1 (appendix A to 40 CFR part 60).
6.2.2 Sampling Line. Use a heated Teflon sampling line to transport the sample to the analytical instrument.
6.2.3 Sampling Pump. Use a sampling pump capable of extracting sufficient sample from the duct and transporting to the analytical instrument.
6.2.4 Sample Conditioning System. Use a particulate filter sufficient to protect the sampling pump and analytical instrument. At the discretion of the tester and depending on the equipment used and the moisture content of the exhaust gas, it may be necessary to further condition the sample by removing moisture using a condenser.
6.2.5 Analytical Instrument. Use one of the following analytical instruments.
6.2.5.1 Spectrometer. Use an infrared spectrometer designed to measuring SF
6
tracer gas and capable of meeting or exceeding the specifications of this procedure. An FTIR meeting the specifications of Method 320 in appendix A to 40 CFR part 63 may be used.
6.2.5.2 GC/ECD. Use a GC/ECD designed to measure SF
6
tracer gas and capable of meeting or exceeding the specifications of this procedure.
6.2.6 Recorder. At a minimum, use a recorder with linear strip chart. An automated data acquisition system (DAS) is recommended.
6.3 Exhaust Gas Flow Rate Measurement. Use equipment specified for EPA Methods 2, 3, and 4 in appendix A to 40 CFR part 60 for
measuring flow rate of exhaust gas at the inlet to the control device.

# 7.0 Reagents and Standards
7.1 Tracer Gas. Use SF
6
as the tracer gas. The manufacturer of the SF
6
tracer gas should provide a recommended shelf life for the tracer gas cylinder over which the concentration does not change more than ±2 percent from the certified value. A gas mixture of SF
6
diluted with nitrogen should be used; based on experience and calculations, pure SF
6
gas is not necessary to conduct tracer gas testing. Select a concentration and flow rate that is appropriate for the analytical instrument's detection limit, the MML, and the exhaust gas flow rate from the enclosure (see section 8.1.1). You may use a tracer gas other than SF
6
with the prior approval of the EPA Administrator. If you use an approved tracer gas other than SF
6
, all references to SF
6
in this protocol instead refer to the approved tracer gas.
7.2 Calibration Gases. The SF
6
calibration gases required will be dependent on the selected MML and the appropriate span selected for the test. Commercial cylinder gases certified by the manufacturer to be accurate to within 1 percent of the certified label value are preferable, although cylinder gases certified by the manufacturer to 2 percent accuracy are allowed. Additionally, the manufacturer of the SF
6
calibration gases should provide a recommended shelf life for each calibration gas cylinder over which the concentration does not change more than ±2 percent from the certified value. Another option allowed by this method is for the tester to obtain high concentration certified cylinder gases and then use a dilution system meeting the requirements of EPA Method 205, 40 CFR part 51, appendix M, to make multi-level calibration gas standards. Low-level, mid-level, and high-level calibration gases will be required. The MML must be above the low-level standard, the high-level standard must be no more than four times the low-level standard, and the mid-level standard must be approximately halfway between the high- and low-level standards. See section 12.1 for an example calculation of this procedure.

# Note:
If using an FTIR as the analytical instrument, the tester has the option of following the CTS procedures of Method 320 in appendix A to 40 CFR part 63; the calibration standards (and procedures) specified in Method 320 may be used in lieu of the calibration standards and procedures in this protocol.
7.2.1 Zero Gas. High purity nitrogen.
7.2.2 Low-Level Calibration Gas. An SF
6
calibration gas in nitrogen with a concentration equivalent to 20 to 30 percent of the applicable span value.
7.2.3 Mid-Level Calibration Gas. An SF
6
calibration gas in nitrogen with a concentration equivalent to 45 to 55 percent of the applicable span value.
7.2.4 High-Level Calibration Gas. An SF
6
calibration gas in nitrogen with a concentration equivalent to 80 to 90 percent of the applicable span value.

# 8.0 Sample Collection, Preservation, Storage, and Transport
8.1 Test Design.
8.1.1 Determination of Minimum Tracer Gas Flow Rate.
8.1.1.1 Determine (via design calculations or measurements) the approximate flow rate of the exhaust gas through the enclosure, actual cubic feet per minute (acfm).
8.1.1.2 Calculate the minimum tracer gas injection rate necessary to assure a detectable SF
6
concentration at the exhaust gas measurement point (see section 12.1 for calculation).
8.1.1.3 Select a flow meter for the injection system with an operating range appropriate for the injection rate selected.
8.1.2 Determination of the Approximate Time to Reach Equilibrium.
8.1.2.1 Determine the volume of the enclosure.
8.1.2.2 Calculate the air changes per minute of the enclosure by dividing the approximate exhaust flow rate (8.1.1.1 above) by the enclosed volume (8.1.2.1 above).
8.1.2.3 Calculate the time at which the tracer concentration in the enclosure will achieve approximate equilibrium. Divide 3 by the air changes per minute (8.1.2.2 above) to establish this time. This is the approximate length of time for the system to come to equilibrium. Concentration equilibrium occurs when the tracer concentration in the enclosure stops changing as a function of time for a constant tracer release rate. Because the press is continuously cycling, equilibrium may be exhibited by a repeating, but stable, cyclic pattern rather than a single constant concentration value. Assure sufficient tracer gas is available to allow the system to come to equilibrium, and to sample for a minimum of 20 minutes and repeat the procedure for a minimum of three test runs. Additional test runs may be required based on the results of the DQO and LCL analyses described in 40 CFR part 63, subpart KK, appendix A.
8.1.3 Location of Injection Points. This method requires a minimum of three tracer gas injection points. The injection points should be located within leak prone, volatile organic compound/hazardous air pollutant (VOC/HAP) producing areas around the press, or horizontally within 12 inches of the defined equipment. One potential configuration of the injection points is depicted in Figure 1. The effect of wind, exfiltration through the building envelope, and air flowing through open building doors should be considered when locating tracer gas injection
points within the enclosure. The injection points should also be located at a vertical elevation equal to the VOC/HAP generating zones. The injection points should not be located beneath obstructions that would prevent a natural dispersion of the gas. Document the selected injection points in a drawing(s).
8.1.4 Location of Flow Measurement and Tracer Sampling. Accurate CD inlet gas flow rate measurements are critical to the success of this procedure. Select a measurement location meeting the criteria of EPA Method 1 (40 CFR part 60, appendix A), Sampling and Velocity Traverses for Stationary Sources. Also, when selecting the measurement location, consider whether stratification of the tracer gas is likely at the location (
e.g.
, do not select a location immediately after a point of air in-leakage to the duct).
8.2 Tracer Gas Release. Release the tracer gas at a calculated flow rate (see section 12.1 for calculation) through a minimum of three injection manifolds located as described above in 8.1.3. The tracer gas delivery lines must be routed into the enclosure and attached to the manifolds without violating the integrity of the enclosure.
8.3 Pretest Measurements.
8.3.1 Location of Sampling Point(s). If stratification is not suspected at the measurement location, select a single sample point located at the centroid of the CD inlet duct or at a point no closer to the CD inlet duct walls than 1 meter. If stratification is suspected, establish a “measurement line” that passes through the centroidal area and in the direction of any expected stratification. Locate three traverse points at 16.7, 50.0 and 83.3 percent of the measurement line and sample from each of these three points during each run, or follow the procedure in section 8.3.2 to verify whether stratification does or does not exist.
8.3.2 Stratification Verification. The presence or absence of stratification can be verified by using the following procedure. While the facility is operating normally, initiate tracer gas release into the enclosure. For rectangular ducts, locate at least nine sample points in the cross section such that the sample points are the centroids of similarly-shaped, equal area divisions of the cross section. Measure the tracer gas concentration at each point. Calculate the mean value for all sample points. For circular ducts, conduct a 12-point traverse (
i.e.
, six points on each of the two perpendicular diameters) locating the sample points as described in 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, Method 1. Perform the measurements and calculations as described above. Determine if the mean pollutant concentration is more than 10 percent different from any single point. If so, the cross section is considered to be stratified, and the tester may not use a single sample point location, but must use the three traverse points at 16.7, 50.0, and 83.3 percent of the entire measurement line. Other traverse points may be selected, provided that they can be shown to the satisfaction of the Administrator to provide a representative sample over the stack or duct cross section.
8.4 CD Inlet Gas Flow Rate Measurements. The procedures of EPA Methods 1-4 (40 CFR part 60, appendix A) are used to determine the CD inlet gas flow rate. Molecular weight (Method 3) and moisture (Method 4) determinations are only required once for each test series. However, if the test series is not completed within 24 hours, then the molecular weight and moisture measurements should be repeated daily. As a minimum, velocity measurements are conducted according to the procedures of Methods 1 and 2 before and after each test run, as close to the start and end of the run as practicable. A velocity measurement between two runs satisfies both the criterion of “after” the run just completed and “before” the run to be initiated. Accurate exhaust gas flow rate measurements are critical to the success of this procedure. If significant temporal variations of flow rate are anticipated during the test run under normal process operating conditions, take appropriate steps to accurately measure the flow rate during the test. Examples of steps that might be taken include: (1) conducting additional velocity traverses during the test run; or (2) continuously monitoring a single point of average velocity during the run and using these data, in conjunction with the pre- and post-test traverses, to calculate an average velocity for the test run.
8.5 Tracer Gas Measurement Procedure.
8.5.1 Calibration Error Test. Immediately prior to the emission test (within 2 hours of the start of the test), introduce zero gas and high-level calibration gas at the calibration valve assembly. Zero and calibrate the analyzer according to the manufacturer's procedures using, respectively, nitrogen and the calibration gases. Calculate the predicted response for the low-level and mid-level gases based on a linear response line between the zero and high-level response. Then introduce the low-level and mid-level calibration gases successively to the measurement system. Record the analyzer responses for the low-level and mid-level calibration gases and determine the differences between the measurement system responses and the predicted responses using the equation in section 12.3. These differences must be less than 5 percent of the respective calibration gas value. If not, the measurement system must be replaced or repaired prior to testing. No adjustments to the measurement system shall be conducted after the calibration and before the drift determination (section 8.5.4). If adjustments are necessary before the completion of the test series, perform the drift
checks prior to the required adjustments and repeat the calibration following the adjustments. If multiple electronic ranges are to be used, each additional range must be checked with a mid-level calibration gas to verify the multiplication factor.

# Note:
If using an FTIR for the analytical instrument, you may choose to follow the pretest preparation, evaluation, and calibration procedures of Method 320 (section 8.0) (40 CFR part 63, appendix A) in lieu of the above procedure.
8.5.2 Response Time Test. Conduct this test once prior to each test series. Introduce zero gas into the measurement system at the calibration valve assembly. When the system output has stabilized, switch quickly to the high-level calibration gas. Record the time from the concentration change to the measurement system response equivalent to 95 percent of the step change. Repeat the test three times and average the results.
8.5.3 SF
6
Measurement. Sampling of the enclosure exhaust gas at the inlet to the CD should begin at the onset of tracer gas release. If necessary, adjust the tracer gas injection rate such that the measured tracer gas concentration at the CD inlet is within the spectrometer's calibration range (
i.e.
, between the MML and the span value). Once the tracer gas concentration reaches equilibrium, the SF
6
concentration should be measured using the infrared spectrometer continuously for at least 20 minutes per run. Continuously record (
i.e.
, record at least once per minute) the concentration. Conduct at least three test runs. On the recording chart, in the data acquisition system, or in a log book, make a note of periods of process interruption or cyclic operation such as the cycles of the hot press operation. Table 1 to this appendix summarizes the physical measurements required for the enclosure testing.

# Note:
If a GC/ECD is used as the analytical instrument, a continuous record (at least once per minute) likely will not be possible; make a minimum of five injections during each test run. Also, the minimum test run duration criterion of 20 minutes applies.
8.5.4 Drift Determination. Immediately following the completion of the test run, reintroduce the zero and mid-level calibration gases, one at a time, to the measurement system at the calibration valve assembly. (Make no adjustments to the measurement system until both the zero and calibration drift checks are made.) Record the analyzer responses for the zero and mid-level calibration gases and determine the difference between the instrument responses for each gas prior to and after the emission test run using the equation in section 12.4. If the drift values exceed the specified limits (section 13), invalidate the test results preceding the check and repeat the test following corrections to the measurement system. Alternatively, recalibrate the test measurement system as in section 8.5.1 and report the results using both sets of calibration data (
i.e.
, data determined prior to the test period and data determined following the test period). Note: If using an FTIR for the analytical instrument, you may choose to follow the post-test calibration procedures of Method 320 in appendix A to 40 CFR part 63 (section 8.11.2) in lieu of the above procedures.
8.6 Ambient Air Sampling (Optional). Sampling the ambient air surrounding the enclosure is optional. However, taking these samples during the capture efficiency testing will identify those areas of the enclosure that may be performing less efficiently.
8.6.1 Location of Ambient Samples Outside the Enclosure (Optional). In selecting the sampling locations for collecting samples of the ambient air surrounding the enclosure, consider potential leak points, the direction of the release, and laminar flow characteristics in the area surrounding the enclosure. Samples should be collected from all sides of the enclosure, downstream in the prevailing room air flow, and in the operating personnel occupancy areas.
8.6.2 Collection of Ambient Samples (Optional). During the tracer gas release, collect ambient samples from the area surrounding the enclosure perimeter at predetermined location using disposable syringes or some other type of containers that are non-absorbent, inert, and that have low permeability (
i.e.
, polyvinyl fluoride film or polyester film sample bags or polyethylene, polypropylene, nylon or glass bottles). The use of disposable syringes allows samples to be injected directly into a gas chromatograph. Concentration measurements taken around the perimeter of the enclosure provide evidence of capture performance and will assist in the identification of those areas of the enclosure that are performing less efficiently.
8.6.3 Analysis and Storage of Ambient Samples (Optional). Analyze the ambient samples using an analytical instrument calibrated and operated according to the procedures in this appendix or ASTM E 260 and ASTM E 697. Samples may be analyzed immediately after a sample is taken, or they may be stored for future analysis. Experience has shown no degradation of concentration in polypropylene syringes when stored for several months as long as the needle or syringe is plugged. Polypropylene syringes should be discarded after one use to eliminate the possibility of cross contamination of samples.

# 9.0 Quality Control

# 10.0 Calibration and Standardization
10.1 Control Device Inlet Air Flow Rate Measurement Equipment. Follow the equipment calibration requirements specified in Methods 2, 3, and 4 (appendix A to 40 CFR part 60) for measuring the velocity, molecular weight, and moisture of the control device inlet air.
10.2 Tracer Gas Injection Rate. A dry gas volume flow meter, mass flow meter, or orifice can be used to measure the tracer gas injection flow rate. The selected flow measurement device must have an accuracy of greater than ±5 percent at the field operating range. Prior to the test, verify the calibration of the selected flow measurement device using either a wet test meter, spirometer, or liquid displacement meter as the calibration device. Select a minimum of two flow rates to bracket the expected field operating range of the flow meter. Conduct three calibration runs at each of the two selected flow rates. For each run, note the exact quantity of gas as determined by the calibration standard and the gas volume indicated by the flow meter. For each flow rate, calculate the average percent difference of the indicated flow compared to the calibration standard.
10.3 Spectrometer. Follow the calibration requirements specified by the equipment manufacturer for infrared spectrometer measurements and conduct the pretest calibration error test specified in section 8.5.1. Note: if using an FTIR analytical instrument see Method 320, section 10 (appendix A to 40 CFR part 63).
10.4 Gas Chromatograph. Follow the pre-test calibration requirements specified in section 8.5.1.
10.5 Gas Chromatograph for Ambient Sampling (Optional). For the optional ambient sampling, follow the calibration requirements specified in section 8.5.1 or ASTM E 260 and E 697 and by the equipment manufacturer for gas chromatograph measurements.

# 11.0 Analytical Procedures
The sample collection and analysis are concurrent for this method (see section 8.0).

# 12.0 Calculations and Data Analysis
12.1 Estimate MML and Span. The MML is the minimum measurement level. The selection of this level is at the discretion of the tester. However, the MML must be higher than the low-level calibration standard, and the tester must be able to measure at this level with a precision of ≤10 percent. As an example, select the MML as 10 times the instrument's published detection limit. The detection limit of one instrument is 0.01 parts per million by volume (ppmv). Therefore, the MML would be 0.10 ppmv. Select the low-level calibration standard as 0.08 ppmv. The high-level standard would be four times the low-level standard or 0.32 ppmv. A reasonable mid-level standard would then be 0.20 ppmv (halfway between the low-level standard and the high-level standard). Finally, the span value would be approximately 0.40 ppmv (the high-level value is 80 percent of the span). In this example, the following MML, calibration standards, and span values would apply:
MML = 0.10 ppmv
Low-level standard = 0.08 ppmv
Mid-level standard = 0.20 ppmv
High-level standard = 0.32 ppmv
Span value = 0.40 ppmv
12.2 Estimate Tracer Gas Injection Rate for the Given Span. To estimate the minimum and maximum tracer gas injection rate, assume a worst case capture efficiency of 80 percent, and calculate the tracer gas flow rate based on known or measured parameters. To estimate the minimum tracer gas injection rate, assume that the MML concentration (10 times the IR detection limit in this example) is desired at the measurement location. The following equation can be used to estimate the minimum tracer gas injection rate:

To estimate the maximum tracer gas injection rate, assume that the span value is desired at the measurement location. The following equation can be used to estimate the maximum tracer gas injection rate:

12.5 Calculate Capture Efficiency. The equation to calculate enclosure capture efficiency is provided below:
CE = (SF

) × 100
Where:
CE = capture efficiency;
SF
6-CD
= mass of SF

measured at the inlet to the CD;
SF
6-INJ
= mass of SF
6
injected from the tracer source into the enclosure.
Calculate the CE for each of the initial three test runs. Then follow the procedures outlined in section 12.6 to calculate the overall capture efficiency.
12.6 Calculate Overall Capture Efficiency. After calculating the capture efficiency for each of the initial three test runs, follow the procedures in 40 CFR part 63, subpart KK, appendix A, to determine if the results of the testing can be used in determining compliance with the requirements of the rule. There are two methods that can be used: the DQO and LCL methods. The DQO method is described in section 3 of 40 CFR part 63, subpart KK, appendix A, and provides a measure of the precision of the capture efficiency testing conducted. Section 3 of 40 CFR part 63, subpart KK, appendix A, provides an example calculation using results from a facility. If the DQO criteria are met using the first set of three test runs, then the facility can use the average capture efficiency of these test results to determine the capture efficiency of the enclosure. If the DQO criteria are not met, then the facility can conduct another set of three runs and run the DQO analysis again using the results from the six runs
OR
the facility can elect to use the LCL approach.
The LCL method is described in section 4 of 40 CFR part 63, subpart KK, appendix A, and provides sources that may be performing much better than their regulatory requirement, a screening option by which they can demonstrate compliance. The LCL approach compares the 80 percent lower confidence limit for the mean measured CE value to the applicable regulatory requirement. If the LCL capture efficiency is higher than the applicable limit, then the facility is in initial compliance and would use the LCL capture efficiency as the capture efficiency to determine compliance. If the LCL capture efficiency is lower than the applicable limit, then the facility must perform additional test runs and re-run the DQO or LCL analysis.

[69 FR 5063, Feb. 3, 2004, as amended at 71 FR 42904, July 28, 2006; 85 FR 40761, July 7, 2020]
§ 63.2342
When do I have to comply with this subpart?
(a) Except as specified in paragraph (e) of this section, if you have a new or reconstructed affected source, you must comply with this subpart according to the schedule identified in paragraph (a)(1), (2), or (3) of this section, as applicable.
(1)(i) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section, if you startup your new affected source on or before February 3, 2004 or if you reconstruct your affected source on or before February 3, 2004, you must comply with the emission limitations, operating limits, and work practice standards for new and reconstructed sources in this subpart no later than February 3, 2004.
(ii) For any emission source listed in paragraph § 63.2338(b) at an affected source that commenced construction or reconstruction after April 2, 2002, but before February 3, 2004, that is required to be controlled based on the applicability criteria in this subpart, but:
(A) Would not have been required to be controlled based on the applicability criteria as proposed for this subpart, you must comply with the emission limitations, operating limits, and work practice standards for each such emission source based on the schedule found in paragraph (b) of this section or at startup, whichever is later; or
(B) Would have been subject to a less stringent degree of control requirement as proposed for this subpart, you must comply with the emission limitations, operating limits, and work practice standards in this subpart for each such emission source based on the schedule found in paragraph (b) of this section or at startup, whichever is later, and if you start up your affected new or reconstructed source before February 5, 2007, you must comply with the emission limitations, operating limits, and work practice standards for
each such emission source as proposed for this subpart, until you are required to comply with the emission limitations, operating limits, and work practice standards in this subpart for each such emission source based on the schedule found in paragraph (b) of this section.
(2) If you commence construction of or reconstruct your affected source after February 3, 2004, you must comply with the emission limitations, operating limits, and work practice standards for new and reconstructed sources in this subpart upon startup of your affected source.
(3) If, after startup of a new affected source, the total actual annual facility-level organic liquid loading volume at that source exceeds the criteria for control in Table 2 to this subpart, items 9 and 10, the owner or operator must comply with the transfer rack requirements specified in § 63.2346(b) immediately; that is, be in compliance the first day of the period following the end of the 3-year period triggering the control criteria.
(b) Except as specified in paragraph (e) of this section, if you have an existing affected source, you must comply with this subpart according to the schedule identified in paragraph (b)(1), (2), or (3) of this section, as applicable.
(1) If you have an existing affected source, you must comply with the emission limitations, operating limits, and work practice standards for existing affected sources no later than February 5, 2007, except as provided in paragraphs (b)(2) and (3) of this section.
(2) Floating roof storage tanks at existing affected sources must be in compliance with the work practice standards in Table 4 to this subpart, item 1, at all times after the next degassing and cleaning activity or within 10 years after February 3, 2004, whichever occurs first. If the first degassing and cleaning activity occurs during the 3 years following February 3, 2004, the compliance date is February 5, 2007.
(3)(i) If an addition or change other than reconstruction as defined in § 63.2 is made to an existing affected facility that causes the total actual annual facility-level organic liquid loading volume to exceed the criteria for control in Table 2 to this subpart, items 7 and 8, the owner or operator must comply with the transfer rack requirements specified in § 63.2346(b) immediately; that is, be in compliance the first day of the period following the end of the 3-year period triggering the control criteria.
(ii) If the owner or operator believes that compliance with the transfer rack emission limits cannot be achieved immediately, as specified in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, the owner or operator may submit a request for a compliance extension, as specified in paragraphs (b)(3)(ii)(A) through (I) of this section. Subject to paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(B) of this section, until an extension of compliance has been granted by the Administrator (or a State with an approved permit program) under this paragraph (b)(3)(ii), the owner or operator of the transfer rack subject to the requirements of this section shall comply with all applicable requirements of this subpart. Advice on requesting an extension of compliance may be obtained from the Administrator (or the State with an approved permit program).
(A)
Submittal.
The owner or operator shall submit a request for a compliance extension to the Administrator (or a State, when the State has an approved 40 CFR part 70 permit program and the source is required to obtain a 40 CFR part 70 permit under that program, or a State, when the State has been delegated the authority to implement and enforce the emission standard for that source) seeking an extension allowing the source up to 1 additional year to comply with the transfer rack standard, if such additional period is necessary for the installation of controls. The owner or operator of the affected source who has requested an extension of compliance under this paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(A) and who is otherwise required to obtain a title V permit shall apply for such permit, or apply to have the source's title V permit revised to incorporate the conditions of the extension of compliance. The conditions of an extension of compliance granted under this paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(A) will be incorporated into the affected source's title V permit according to the provisions of 40 CFR part 70 or Federal
title V regulations in this chapter (42 U.S.C. 7661), whichever are applicable.
(B)
When to submit.
(
1
) Any request submitted under paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(A) of this section must be submitted in writing to the appropriate authority no later than 120 days prior to the affected source's compliance date (as specified in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section), except as provided for in paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(B)(
2
) of this section. Nonfrivolous requests submitted under this paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(B)(
1
) will stay the applicability of the rule as to the emission points in question until such time as the request is granted or denied. A denial will be effective as of the date of denial.
(
2
) An owner or operator may submit a compliance extension request after the date specified in paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(B)(
1
) of this section provided the need for the compliance extension arose after that date, and before the otherwise applicable compliance date and the need arose due to circumstances beyond reasonable control of the owner or operator. This request must include, in addition to the information required in paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(C) of this section, a statement of the reasons additional time is needed and the date when the owner or operator first learned of the problems. Nonfrivolous requests submitted under this paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(B)(
2
) will stay the applicability of the rule as to the emission points in question until such time as the request is granted or denied. A denial will be effective as of the original compliance date.
(C)
Information required.
The request for a compliance extension under paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(A) of this section shall include the following information:
(
1
) The name and address of the owner or operator and the address of the existing source if it differs from the address of the owner or operator;
(
2
) The name, address, and telephone number of a contact person for further information;
(
3
) An identification of the organic liquid distribution operation and of the specific equipment for which additional compliance time is required;
(
4
) A description of the controls to be installed to comply with the standard;
(
5
) Justification for the length of time being requested; and
(
6
) A compliance schedule, including the date by which each step toward compliance will be reached. At a minimum, the list of dates shall include:
(
i
) The date by which on-site construction, installation of emission control equipment, or a process change is planned to be initiated;
(
ii
) The date by which on-site construction, installation of emission control equipment, or a process change is to be completed; and
(
iii
) The date by which final compliance is to be achieved.
(D)
Approval of request for extension of compliance.
Based on the information provided in any request made under paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(C) of this section, or other information, the Administrator (or the State with an approved permit program) may grant an extension of compliance with the transfer rack emission standard, as specified in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section. The extension will be in writing and will—
(
1
) Identify each affected source covered by the extension;
(
2
) Specify the termination date of the extension;
(
3
) Specify the dates by which steps toward compliance are to be taken, if appropriate;
(
4
) Specify other applicable requirements to which the compliance extension applies (e.g., performance tests);
(
5
) Specify the contents of the progress reports to be submitted and the dates by which such reports are to be submitted, if required pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(E) of this section.
(
6
) Under paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section, specify any additional conditions that the Administrator (or the State) deems necessary to assure installation of the necessary controls and protection of the health of persons during the extension period.
(E)
Progress reports.
The owner or operator of an existing source that has been granted an extension of compliance under paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(D) of this section may be required to submit to the Administrator (or the State with an approved permit program) progress reports indicating whether the steps toward compliance outlined in
the compliance schedule have been reached.
(F)
Notification of approval or intention to deny.
(
1
) The Administrator (or the State with an approved permit program) will notify the owner or operator in writing of approval or intention to deny approval of a request for an extension of compliance within 30 calendar days after receipt of sufficient information to evaluate a request submitted under paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section. The Administrator (or the State) will notify the owner or operator in writing of the status of his/her application; that is, whether the application contains sufficient information to make a determination, within 30 calendar days after receipt of the original application and within 30 calendar days after receipt of any supplementary information that is submitted. The 30-day approval or denial period will begin after the owner or operator has been notified in writing that his/her application is complete. Failure by the Administrator to act within 30 calendar days to approve or disapprove a request submitted under paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section does not constitute automatic approval of the request.
(
2
) When notifying the owner or operator that his/her application is not complete, the Administrator will specify the information needed to complete the application and provide notice of opportunity for the applicant to present, in writing, within 30 calendar days after he/she is notified of the incomplete application, additional information or arguments to the Administrator to enable further action on the application.
(
3
) Before denying any request for an extension of compliance, the Administrator (or the State with an approved permit program) will notify the owner or operator in writing of the Administrator's (or the State's) intention to issue the denial, together with:
(
i
) Notice of the information and findings on which the intended denial is based; and
(
ii
) Notice of opportunity for the owner or operator to present in writing, within 15 calendar days after he/she is notified of the intended denial, additional information or arguments to the Administrator (or the State) before further action on the request.
(
4
) The Administrator's final determination to deny any request for an extension will be in writing and will set forth the specific grounds on which the denial is based. The final determination will be made within 30 calendar days after presentation of additional information or argument (if the application is complete), or within 30 calendar days after the final date specified for the presentation if no presentation is made.
(G)
Termination of extension of compliance.
The Administrator (or the State with an approved permit program) may terminate an extension of compliance at an earlier date than specified if any specification under paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(D)(
3
) or paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(D)(
4
) of this section is not met. Upon a determination to terminate, the Administrator will notify, in writing, the owner or operator of the Administrator's determination to terminate, together with:
(
1
) Notice of the reason for termination; and
(
2
) Notice of opportunity for the owner or operator to present in writing, within 15 calendar days after he/she is notified of the determination to terminate, additional information or arguments to the Administrator before further action on the termination.
(
3
) A final determination to terminate an extension of compliance will be in writing and will set forth the specific grounds on which the termination is based. The final determination will be made within 30 calendar days after presentation of additional information or arguments, or within 30 calendar days after the final date specified for the presentation if no presentation is made.
(H) The granting of an extension under this section shall not abrogate the Administrator's authority under section 114 of the CAA.
(I)
Limitation on use of compliance extension.
The owner or operator may request an extension of compliance under the provisions specified in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section only once for each facility.
(c) If you have an area source that does not commence reconstruction but
increases its emissions or its potential to emit such that it becomes a major source of HAP emissions and an existing affected source subject to this subpart, you must be in compliance by 3 years after the area source becomes a major source.
(d) You must meet the notification requirements in §§ 63.2343 and 63.2382(a), as applicable, according to the schedules in § 63.2382(a) and (b)(1) through (2) and in subpart A of this part. Some of these notifications must be submitted before the compliance dates for the emission limitations, operating limits, and work practice standards in this subpart.
(e) An affected source that commenced construction or reconstruction on or before October 21, 2019, must be in compliance with the requirements listed in paragraphs (e)(1) through (5) of this section upon initial startup or July 7, 2023, whichever is later. An affected source that commenced construction or reconstruction after October 21, 2019, must be in compliance with the requirements listed in paragraphs (e)(1) through (5) of this section upon initial startup or July 7, 2020, whichever is later.

§ 63.2343
What are my requirements for emission sources not requiring control?
This section establishes the notification, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements for emission sources identified in § 63.2338 that do not require control under this subpart (
i.e.,
under § 63.2346(a) through (e)). Such emission sources are not subject to any other notification, recordkeeping, or reporting sections in this subpart, including § 63.2350(c), except as indicated in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section.
(a) For each storage tank subject to this subpart having a capacity of less than 18.9 cubic meters (5,000 gallons) and for each transfer rack subject to this subpart that only unloads organic liquids (
i.e.,
no organic liquids are loaded at any of the transfer racks), you must keep documentation that verifies that each storage tank and transfer rack identified in this paragraph (a) is not required to be controlled. The documentation must be kept up-to-date (
i.e.,
all such emission sources at a facility are identified in the documentation regardless of when the documentation was last compiled) and must be in a form suitable and readily available for expeditious inspection and review according to § 63.10(b)(1), including records stored in electronic form in a separate location. The documentation may consist of identification of the tanks and transfer racks identified in this paragraph (a) on a plant site plan or process and instrumentation diagram (P
ID).
(b) Except as specified in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, for each storage tank subject to this subpart having a capacity of 18.9 cubic meters (5,000 gallons) or more that is not subject to control based on the criteria specified in Table 2 to this subpart, items 1 through 6, you must comply with the requirements specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (3) of this section.
(1)(i) You must submit the information in § 63.2386(c)(1), (2), (3), and (10)(i) in either the Notification of Compliance Status, according to the schedule specified in Table 12 to this subpart, or in your first Compliance report, according to the schedule specified in § 63.2386(b), whichever occurs first.
(ii)(A) If you submit your first Compliance report before your Notification of Compliance Status, the Notification of Compliance Status must contain the information specified in § 63.2386(d)(3) and (4) if any of the changes identified in paragraph (d) of this section have occurred since the filing of the first Compliance report. If none of the changes identified in paragraph (d) of this section have occurred since the filing of the first Compliance report, you do not need to report the information specified in § 63.2386(c)(10)(i) when you submit your Notification of Compliance Status.
(B) If you submit your Notification of Compliance Status before your first Compliance report, your first Compliance report must contain the information specified in § 63.2386(d)(3) and (4) if any of the changes specified in paragraph (d) of this section have occurred since the filing of the Notification of Compliance Status.
(iii) If you are already submitting a Notification of Compliance Status or a first Compliance report under § 63.2386(c), you do not need to submit a separate Notification of Compliance Status or first Compliance report for each storage tank that meets the conditions identified in paragraph (b) of this section (i.e., a single Notification of Compliance Status or first Compliance report should be submitted).

later date, the total actual annual facility-level organic liquid loading volume again becomes equal to or greater than the loading volume criteria for control in Table 2 to this subpart, the owner or operator must comply with paragraph (b)(1), (b)(2), or (b)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section immediately, as specified in § 63.2342(a)(3). For existing sources, as defined in § 63.2338(f), if at a later date, the total actual annual facility-level organic liquid loading volume again becomes equal to or greater than the loading volume criteria for control in Table 2 to this subpart, the owner or operator must comply with paragraph (b)(1), (b)(2), or (b)(3)(i) of this section immediately, as specified in § 63.2342(b)(3)(i), unless an alternative compliance schedule has been approved under § 63.2342(b)(3)(ii) and subject to the use limitation specified in § 63.2342(b)(3)(ii)(I).
(1) Meet the emission limits specified in Table 2 to this subpart and comply with paragraph (l) of this section and the applicable requirements for transfer racks specified in subpart SS of this part, for meeting emission limits.
(2) Route emissions to fuel gas systems or back into a process as specified in subpart SS of this part. If you comply with this paragraph, then you must also comply with the requirements specified in paragraph (l) of this section.
(3)(i) Use a vapor balancing system that routes organic HAP vapors displaced from the loading of organic liquids into transport vehicles to the storage tank from which the liquid being loaded originated or to another storage tank connected to a common header.
(ii) Use a vapor balancing system that routes the organic HAP vapors displaced from the loading of organic liquids into containers directly (e.g., no intervening tank or containment area such as a room) to the storage tank from which the liquid being loaded originated or to another storage tank connected to a common header.
(c)
Equipment leak components.
For each pump, valve, and sampling connection that operates in organic liquids service for at least 300 hours per year, you must comply with paragraph (l) of this section and the applicable requirements under subpart TT of this part (control level 1), subpart UU of this part (control level 2), or subpart H of this part. Pumps, valves, and sampling connectors that are insulated to provide protection against persistent sub-freezing temperatures are subject to the “difficult to monitor” provisions in the applicable subpart selected by the owner or operator. This paragraph only applies if the affected source has at least one storage tank or transfer rack that meets the applicability criteria for control in Table 2 or 2b to this subpart.
(d)

# General Compliance Requirements
§ 63.2350
What are my general requirements for complying with this subpart?
(a) You must be in compliance with the emission limitations, operating limits, and work practice standards in this subpart at all times when the equipment identified in § 63.2338(b)(1) through (5) is in OLD operation.
(b) Except as specified in paragraph (d) of this section, you must always operate and maintain your affected source, including air pollution control and monitoring equipment, according to the provisions in § 63.6(e)(1)(i).
(c) Except for emission sources not required to be controlled as specified in § 63.2343, you must develop a written startup, shutdown, and malfunction (SSM) plan according to the provisions in § 63.6(e)(3). Beginning no later than July 7, 2023, this paragraph no longer applies; however, for historical compliance purposes, a copy of the plan must be retained and available according to the requirements in § 63.2394(c) for five years after July 7, 2023.
(d) Beginning no later than the compliance dates specified in § 63.2342(e), paragraph (b) of this section no longer applies. Instead, at all times, you must operate and maintain any affected source, including associated air pollution control equipment and monitoring equipment, in a manner consistent with safety and good air pollution control practices for minimizing emissions. The general duty to minimize emissions does not require you to make any further efforts to reduce emissions if levels required by the applicable standard have been achieved. Determination of whether a source is operating in compliance with operation and maintenance requirements will be based on information available to the Administrator which may include, but is not limited to, monitoring results, review of operation and maintenance procedures, review of operation and maintenance records, and inspection of the source.
[85 FR 40763, July 7, 2020]

# Testing and Initial Compliance Requirements
§ 63.2354
What performance tests, design evaluations, and performance evaluations must I conduct?
(a)(1) For each performance test that you conduct, you must use the procedures specified in subpart SS of this part and the provisions specified in paragraph (b) of this section.
(2) For each design evaluation you conduct, you must use the procedures specified in subpart SS of this part. You must also comply with the requirements specified in § 63.2346(l).
(3) For each performance evaluation of a continuous emission monitoring system (CEMS) you conduct, you must follow the requirements in § 63.8(e) and paragraph (d) of this section. For CEMS installed after the compliance date specified in § 63.2342(e), conduct a performance evaluation of each CEMS within 180 days of installation of the monitoring system.
(b)(1) Except as specified in paragraph (b)(6) of this section, for nonflare control devices, you must conduct each performance test according to the requirements in § 63.7(e)(1), and either § 63.988(b), § 63.990(b), or § 63.995(b), using the procedures specified in § 63.997(e).
(2) You must conduct three separate test runs for each performance test on a nonflare control device as specified in §§ 63.7(e)(3) and 63.997(e)(1)(v). Each test run must last at least 1 hour, except as provided in § 63.997(e)(1)(v)(A) and (B).
(3)(i) In addition to Method 25 or 25A (40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7), to determine compliance with the TOC emission limit, you may use Method 18
(40 CFR part 60, appendix A-6) or Method 320 of appendix A to this part to determine compliance with the total organic HAP emission limit. You may not use Method 18 or Method 320 of appendix A to this part if the control device is a combustion device, and you must not use Method 320 of appendix A to this part if the gas stream contains entrained water droplets. All compounds quantified by Method 320 of appendix A to this part must be validated according to Section 13.0 of Method 320 of appendix A to this part. As an alternative to Method 18, for determining compliance with the total organic HAP emission limit, you may use ASTM D6420-18 (incorporated by reference, see § 63.14), under the conditions specified in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section.
(A) If you use Method 18 (40 CFR 60, appendix A-6) or Method 320 of appendix A to this part to measure compliance with the percentage efficiency limit, you must first determine which organic HAP are present in the inlet gas stream (
i.e.,
uncontrolled emissions) using knowledge of the organic liquids or the screening procedure described in Method 18. In conducting the performance test, you must analyze samples collected simultaneously at the inlet and outlet of the control device. Quantify the emissions for the same organic HAP identified as present in the inlet gas stream for both the inlet and outlet gas streams of the control device.
(B) If you use Method 18 (40 CFR part 60, appendix A-6) or Method 320 of appendix A to this part, to measure compliance with the emission concentration limit, you must first determine which organic HAP are present in the inlet gas stream using knowledge of the organic liquids or the screening procedure described in Method 18. In conducting the performance test, analyze samples collected as specified in Method 18 at the outlet of the control device. Quantify the control device outlet emission concentration for the same organic HAP identified as present in the inlet or uncontrolled gas stream.
(ii) You may use ASTM D6420-18 (incorporated by reference, see § 63.14), to determine compliance with the total organic HAP emission limit if the target concentration for each HAP is between 150 parts per billion by volume and 100 ppmv and either of the conditions specified in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A) or (B) of this section exists. For target compounds not listed in Section 1.1 of ASTM D6420-18 and not amenable to detection by mass spectrometry, you may not use ASTM D6420-18.
(A) The target compounds are those listed in Section 1.1 of ASTM D6420-18 (incorporated by reference, see § 63.14); or
(B) For target compounds not listed in Section 1.1 of ASTM D6420-18 (incorporated by reference, see § 63.14), but potentially detected by mass spectrometry, you must demonstrate recovery of the compound and the additional system continuing calibration check after each run, as detailed in ASTM D6420-18, Section 10.5.3, must be followed, met, documented, and submitted with the data report, even if there is no moisture condenser used or the compound is not considered water-soluble.
(iii) You may use ASTM D6348-12e1 (incorporated by reference, see § 63.14) instead of Method 320 of appendix A to this part under the conditions specified in footnote 4 of Table 5 to this subpart.
(4) If a principal component of the uncontrolled or inlet gas stream to the control device is formaldehyde, you must use Method 316 of appendix A to this part, Method 320 of appendix A to this part, or Method 323 of appendix A to this part for measuring the formaldehyde, except you must not use Method 320 or Method 323 of appendix A to this part if the gas stream contains entrained water droplets. If you use Method 320 of appendix A to this part, formaldehyde must be validated according to Section 13.0 of Method 320 of appendix A to this part. You must measure formaldehyde either at the inlet and outlet of the control device to determine control efficiency or at the outlet of a combustion device for determining compliance with the emission concentration limit. You may use ASTM D6348-12e1 (incorporated by reference, see § 63.14) instead of Method 320 of appendix A to this part under the conditions specified in footnote 4 of Table 5 to this subpart.
(5) Except as specified in paragraph (b)(6) of this section, you may not conduct performance tests during periods of SSM, as specified in § 63.7(e)(1).
(6) Beginning no later than the compliance dates specified in § 63.2342(e), paragraphs (b)(1) and (5) of this section no longer apply. Instead, you must conduct each performance test according to the requirements in paragraphs (b)(6)(i) and (ii) of this section.
(i) In lieu of the requirements specified in § 63.7(e)(1), you must conduct performance tests under such conditions as the Administrator specifies based on representative performance of the affected source for the period being tested. Representative conditions exclude periods of startup and shutdown. You may not conduct performance tests during periods of malfunction. You must record the process information that is necessary to document operating conditions during the test and include in such record an explanation to support that such conditions represent normal operation. Upon request, you must make available to the Administrator such records as may be necessary to determine the conditions of performance tests.
(ii) Pursuant to paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section, you must conduct each performance test according to the requirements in either § 63.988(b), § 63.990(b), or § 63.995(b), using the procedures specified in § 63.997(e). You must also comply with the requirements specified in § 63.2346(l).
(c) To determine the HAP content of the organic liquid, you may use Method 311 of appendix A to this part, ASTM D6886-18 (incorporated by reference, see § 63.14), or other method approved by the Administrator. If you use ASTM D6886-18 to determine the HAP content, you must use either Method B or Method B in conjunction with Method C, as described in section 4.3 of ASTM D6886-18. In addition, you may use other means, such as voluntary consensus standards, safety data sheets (SDS), or certified product data sheets, to determine the HAP content of the organic liquid. If the method you select to determine the HAP content provides HAP content ranges, you must use the upper end of each HAP content range in determining the total HAP content of the organic liquid. The EPA may require you to test the HAP content of an organic liquid using Method 311 of appendix A to this part or other method approved by the Administrator. For liquids that contain any amount of formaldehyde or carbon tetrachloride, you may not use Method 311of appendix A to this part. If the results of the Method 311 of appendix A to this part (or any other approved method) are different from the HAP content determined by another means, the Method 311 of appendix A to this part (or approved method) results will govern. For liquids that contain any amount of formaldehyde or carbon tetrachloride, if the results of ASTM D6886-18 using method B or C in section 4.3 (or any other approved method) are different from the HAP content determined by another means, ASTM D6886-18 using method B or C in section 4 (or approved method) results will govern.
(d) Each VOC CEMS must be installed, operated, and maintained according to the requirements of one of the following performance specifications in appendix B to part 60 of this chapter: Performance Specification 8, Performance Specification 8A, Performance Specification 9, or Performance Specification 15. You must also comply with the requirements of procedure 1 of appendix F to part 60 of this chapter, for CEMS using Performance Specification 8 or 8A.
(1) For CEMS using Performance Specification 9 or 15 (40 CFR part 60, appendix B), determine the target analyte(s) for calibration using either process knowledge or the screening procedures of Method 18 (40 CFR part 60, appendix A-6).
(2) For CEMS using Performance Specification 8A (40 CFR part 60, appendix B), conduct the relative accuracy test audits required under Procedure 1 (40 CFR part 60, appendix F) in accordance with Sections 8 and 11 of Performance Specification 8 (40 CFR part 60, appendix B). The relative accuracy must meet the criteria of Section 13.2 of Performance Speciation 8 (40 CFR part 60, appendix B).
(3) For CEMS using Performance Specification 8 or 8A of 40 CFR part 60, appendix B, calibrate the instrument on methane and report the results as
carbon (C1). Use Method 25A of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7 as the reference method for the relative accuracy tests.
(4) If you are required to monitor oxygen in order to conduct concentration corrections, you must use Performance Specification 3 (40 CFR part 60, appendix B), to certify your oxygen CEMS, and you must comply with procedure 1 (40 CFR part 60, appendix F). Use Method 3A (40 CFR part 60, appendix A-2), as the reference method when conducting a relative accuracy test audit.

[69 FR 5063, Feb. 3, 2004, as amended at 85 FR 40765, July 7, 2020]
§ 63.2378
How do I demonstrate continuous compliance with the emission limitations, operating limits, and work practice standards?
(a) You must demonstrate continuous compliance with each emission limitation, operating limit, and work practice standard in Tables 2 through 4 to this subpart that applies to you according to the methods specified in subpart SS of this part, and in Tables 8 through 10 to this subpart, as applicable. You must also comply with the requirements specified in § 63.2346(l).
(b) Except as specified in paragraph (e) of this section, you must follow the requirements in § 63.6(e)(1) and (3) during periods of startup, shutdown, malfunction, or nonoperation of the affected source or any part thereof. In addition, the provisions of paragraphs (b)(1) through (3) of this section apply.
(1) The emission limitations in this subpart apply at all times except during periods of nonoperation of the affected source (or specific portion thereof) resulting in cessation of the emissions to which this subpart applies. The emission limitations of this subpart apply during periods of SSM, except as provided in paragraphs (b)(2) and (3) of this section. However, if a SSM, or period of nonoperation of one portion of the affected source does not
affect the ability of a particular emission source to comply with the emission limitations to which it is subject, then that emission source is still required to comply with the applicable emission limitations of this subpart during the startup, shutdown, malfunction, or period of nonoperation.
(2) The owner or operator must not shut down control devices or monitoring systems that are required or utilized for achieving compliance with this subpart during periods of SSM while emissions are being routed to such items of equipment if the shutdown would contravene requirements of this subpart applicable to such items of equipment. This paragraph (b)(2) does not apply if the item of equipment is malfunctioning. This paragraph (b)(2) also does not apply if the owner or operator shuts down the compliance equipment (other than monitoring systems) to avoid damage due to a contemporaneous SSM of the affected source or portion thereof. If the owner or operator has reason to believe that monitoring equipment would be damaged due to a contemporaneous SSM of the affected source of portion thereof, the owner or operator must provide documentation supporting such a claim in the next Compliance report required in Table 11 to this subpart, item 1. Once approved by the Administrator, the provision for ceasing to collect, during a SSM, monitoring data that would otherwise be required by the provisions of this subpart must be incorporated into the SSM plan.
(3) During SSM, you must implement, to the extent reasonably available, measures to prevent or minimize excess emissions. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(3), the term “excess emissions” means emissions greater than those allowed by the emission limits that apply during normal operational periods. The measures to be taken must be identified in the SSM plan, and may include, but are not limited to, air pollution control technologies, recovery technologies, work practices, pollution prevention, monitoring, and/or changes in the manner of operation of the affected source. Back-up control devices are not required, but may be used if available.
(c) Except as specified in paragraph (e) of this section, periods of planned routine maintenance of a control device used to control storage tanks or transfer racks, during which the control device does not meet the emission limits in Table 2 to this subpart, must not exceed 240 hours per year.
(d) Except as specified in paragraph (e) of this section, if you elect to route emissions from storage tanks or transfer racks to a fuel gas system or to a process, as allowed by § 63.982(d), to comply with the emission limits in Table 2 to this subpart, the total aggregate amount of time during which the emissions bypass the fuel gas system or process during the calendar year without being routed to a control device, for all reasons (except SSM or product changeovers of flexible operation units and periods when a storage tank has been emptied and degassed), must not exceed 240 hours.
(e) Beginning no later than the compliance dates specified in § 63.2342(e), paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section no longer apply. Instead, you must be in compliance with each emission limitation, operating limit, and work practice standard specified in paragraph (a) of this section at all times, except during periods of nonoperation of the affected source (or specific portion thereof) resulting in cessation of the emissions to which this subpart applies and must comply with the requirements specified in paragraphs (e)(1) through (4) of this section, as applicable. Equipment subject to the work practice standards for equipment leak components in Table 4 to this subpart, item 4 are not subject to this paragraph (e).
(1) Except as specified in paragraphs (e)(3) and (4) of this section, the use of a bypass line at any time on a closed vent system to divert a vent stream to the atmosphere or to a control device not meeting the requirements specified in paragraph (a) of this section is an emissions standards deviation.
(2) If you are subject to the bypass monitoring requirements of § 63.983(a)(3), then you must continue to comply with the requirements in § 63.983(a)(3) and the recordkeeping and reporting requirements in
§§ 63.998(d)(1)(ii) and 63.999(c)(2), in addition to § 63.2346(l), the recordkeeping requirements specified in § 63.2390(g), and the reporting requirements specified in § 63.2386(c)(12).
(3) Periods of planned routine maintenance of a control device used to control storage tank breathing loss emissions, during which the control device does not meet the emission limits in Table 2 or 2b to this subpart, must not exceed 240 hours per year. The level of material in the storage tank shall not be increased during periods that the closed-vent system or control device is bypassed to perform planned routine maintenance.
(4) If you elect to route emissions from storage tanks to a fuel gas system or to a process, as allowed by § 63.982(d), to comply with the emission limits in Table 2 or 2b to this subpart, the total aggregate amount of time during which the breathing loss emissions bypass the fuel gas system or process during the calendar year without being routed to a control device, for all reasons (except product changeovers of flexible operation units and periods when a storage tank has been emptied and degassed), must not exceed 240 hours. The level of material in the storage tank shall not be increased during periods that the fuel gas system or process is bypassed.
(f) The CEMS data must be reduced to daily averages computed using valid data consistent with the data availability requirements specified in § 63.999(c)(6)(i)(B) through (D), except monitoring data also are sufficient to constitute a valid hour of data if measured values are available for at least two of the 15-minute periods during an hour when calibration, quality assurance, or maintenance activities are being performed. In computing daily averages to determine compliance with this subpart, you must exclude monitoring data recorded during CEMS breakdowns, out of control periods, repairs, maintenance periods, calibration checks, or other quality assurance activities.

Alexander Drive, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711. Electronic copies in lieu of hard copies may also be submitted to
oldrtr@epa.gov.
(j) If you choose to determine compositional analysis for net heating value with a continuous process mass spectrometer, then you must comply with the requirements specified in paragraphs (j)(1) through (7) of this section.
(1) You must meet the requirements in § 63.671(e)(2). You may augment the minimum list of calibration gas components found in § 63.671(e)(2) with compounds found during a pre-survey or known to be in the gas through process knowledge.
(2) Calibration gas cylinders must be certified to an accuracy of 2 percent and traceable to National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) standards.
(3) For unknown gas components that have similar analytical mass fragments to calibration compounds, you may report the unknowns as an increase in the overlapped calibration gas compound. For unknown compounds that produce mass fragments that do not overlap calibration compounds, you may use the response factor for the nearest molecular weight hydrocarbon in the calibration mix to quantify the unknown component's NHVvg.
(4) You may use the response factor for n-pentane to quantify any unknown components detected with a higher molecular weight than n-pentane.
(5) You must perform an initial calibration to identify mass fragment overlap and response factors for the target compounds.

You may use the alternative sampling line temperature allowed under Net Heating Value by Gas Chromatograph in Table 13 to subpart CC of this part.
(7) The average instrument calibration error (CE) for each calibration compound at any calibration concentration must not differ by more than 10 percent from the certified cylinder gas value. The CE for each component in the calibration blend must be calculated using the following equation:
ER07JY20.001
Where:
Cm = Average instrument response (ppm)
Ca = Certified cylinder gas value (ppm)
(k) If you use a gas chromatograph or mass spectrometer for compositional analysis for net heating value, then you may choose to use the CE of NHV measured versus the cylinder tag value NHV as the measure of agreement for daily calibration and quarterly audits in lieu of determining the compound-specific CE. The CE for NHV at any
calibration level must not differ by more than 10 percent from the certified cylinder gas value. The CE for must be calculated using the following equation:
ER07JY20.000
Where:
NHVmeasured = Average instrument response (Btu/scf)
NHVa = Certified cylinder gas value (Btu/scf)

Total actual annual facility-level organic liquid loading volume
means the total facility-level actual volume of organic liquid loaded for transport within or out of the facility through transfer racks that are part of the affected source into transport vehicles (for existing affected sources) or into transport vehicles and containers (for new affected sources) based on a 3-year rolling average, calculated annually.
(1) For existing affected sources, each 3-year rolling average is based on actual facility-level loading volume during each calendar year (January 1 through December 31) in the 3-year period. For calendar year 2004 only (the first year of the initial 3-year rolling average), if an owner or operator of an affected source does not have actual loading volume data for the time period from January 1, 2004, through February 2, 2004 (the time period prior to the effective date of the OLD NESHAP), the owner or operator shall compute a facility-level loading volume for this time period as follows: At the end of the 2004 calendar year, the owner or operator shall calculate a daily average facility-level loading volume (based on the actual loading volume for February 3, 2004, through December 31, 2004) and use that daily average to estimate the facility-level loading volume for the period of time from January 1, 2004, through February 2, 2004. The owner or operator shall then sum the estimated facility-level loading volume from January 1, 2004, through February 2, 2004, and the actual facility-level loading volume from February 3, 2004, through December 31, 2004, to calculate the annual facility-level loading volume for calendar year 2004.
(2)(i) For new affected sources, the 3-year rolling average is calculated as an average of three 12-month periods. An owner or operator must select as the beginning calculation date with which to start the calculations as either the initial startup date of the new affected source or the first day of the calendar month following the month in which startup occurs. Once selected, the date
with which the calculations begin cannot be changed.
(ii) The initial 3-year rolling average is based on the projected maximum facility-level annual loading volume for each of the 3 years following the selected beginning calculation date. The second 3-year rolling average is based on actual facility-level loading volume for the first year of operation plus a new projected maximum facility-level annual loading volume for second and third years following the selected beginning calculation date. The third 3-year rolling average is based on actual facility-level loading volume for the first 2 years of operation plus a new projected maximum annual facility-level loading volume for the third year following the beginning calculation date. Subsequent 3-year rolling averages are based on actual facility-level loading volume for each year in the 3-year rolling average.
Transfer rack
means a single system used to load organic liquids into, or unload organic liquids out of, transport vehicles or containers. It includes all loading and unloading arms, pumps, meters, shutoff valves, relief valves, and other piping and equipment necessary for the transfer operation. Transfer equipment and operations that are physically separate (i.e., do not share common piping, valves, and other equipment) are considered to be separate transfer racks.
Transport vehicle
means a cargo tank or tank car.
Vapor balancing system
means:
(1) A piping system that collects organic HAP vapors displaced from transport vehicles or containers during loading and routes the collected vapors to the storage tank from which the liquid being loaded originated or to another storage tank connected to a common header. For containers, the piping system must route the displaced vapors directly to the appropriate storage tank or to another storage tank connected to a common header in order to qualify as a vapor balancing system; or
(2) A piping system that collects organic HAP vapors displaced from the loading of a storage tank and routes the collected vapors to the transport vehicle from which the storage tank is filled.
Vapor collection system
means any equipment located at the source (i.e., at the OLD operation) that is not open to the atmosphere; that is composed of piping, connections, and, if necessary, flow-inducing devices; and that is used for:
(1) Containing and conveying vapors displaced during the loading of transport vehicles to a control device;
(2) Containing and directly conveying vapors displaced during the loading of containers; or
(3) Vapor balancing. This does not include any of the vapor collection equipment that is installed on the transport vehicle.
Vapor-tight transport vehicle
means a transport vehicle that has been demonstrated to be vapor-tight. To be considered vapor-tight, a transport vehicle equipped with vapor collection equipment must undergo a pressure change of no more than 250 pascals (1 inch of water) within 5 minutes after it is pressurized to 4,500 pascals (18 inches of water). This capability must be demonstrated annually using the procedures specified in Method 27 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-8. For all other transport vehicles, vapor tightness is demonstrated by performing the U.S. DOT pressure test procedures for tank cars and cargo tanks.
Work practice standard
means any design, equipment, work practice, or operational standard, or combination thereof, that is promulgated pursuant to section 112(h) of the CAA.

# Subpart FFFF—National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants: Miscellaneous Organic Chemical Manufacturing

# Source:
68 FR 63888, Nov. 10, 2003, unless otherwise noted.

# What This Subpart Covers
§ 63.2430
What is the purpose of this subpart?
This subpart establishes national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants (NESHAP) for miscellaneous organic chemical manufacturing. This subpart also establishes requirements to demonstrate initial and continuous compliance with the emission limits, operating limits, and work practice standards.
§ 63.2435
Am I subject to the requirements in this subpart?
(a) You are subject to the requirements in this subpart if you own or operate miscellaneous organic chemical manufacturing process units (MCPU) that are located at, or are part of, a major source of hazardous air pollutants (HAP) emissions as defined in section 112(a) of the Clean Air Act (CAA).
(b) An MCPU includes equipment necessary to operate a miscellaneous organic chemical manufacturing process, as defined in § 63.2550, that satisfies all of the conditions specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (3) of this section. An MCPU also includes any assigned storage tanks and transfer racks; equipment in open systems that is used to convey or store water having the same concentration and flow characteristics as wastewater; and components such as pumps, compressors, agitators, pressure relief devices, sampling connection systems, open-ended valves or lines, valves, connectors, and instrumentation systems that are used to manufacture any material or family of materials described in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (v) of this section.
(1) The MCPU produces material or family of materials that is described in paragraph (b)(1)(i), (ii), (iii), (iv), or (v) of this section.
(i) An organic chemical(s) classified using the 1987 version of SIC code 282, 283, 284, 285, 286, 287, 289, or 386, except as provided in paragraph (c)(5) of this section.
(ii) An organic chemical(s) classified using the 1997 version of NAICS code 325, except as provided in paragraph (c)(5) of this section.
(iii) Quaternary ammonium compounds and ammonium sulfate produced with caprolactam.
(iv) Hydrazine.
(v) Organic solvents classified in any of the SIC or NAICS codes listed in paragraph (b)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section that are recovered using nondedicated solvent recovery operations.
(2) The MCPU processes, uses, or generates any of the organic HAP listed in section 112(b) of the CAA or hydrogen halide and halogen HAP, as defined in § 63.2550.
(3) The MCPU is not an affected source or part of an affected source under another subpart of this part 63, except for process vents from batch operations within a chemical manufacturing process unit (CMPU), as identified in § 63.100(j)(4). For this situation, the MCPU is the same as the CMPU as defined in § 63.100, and you are subject only to the requirements for batch process vents in this subpart.
(c) The requirements in this subpart do not apply to the operations specified in paragraphs (c)(1) through (7) of this section.
(1) Research and development facilities, as defined in section 112(c)(7) of the CAA.
(2) The manufacture of ammonium sulfate as a by-product, if the slurry entering the by-product manufacturing process contains 50 parts per million by weight (ppmw) HAP or less or 10 ppmw benzene or less. You must retain information, data, and analysis to document the HAP concentration in the entering slurry in order to claim this exemption.
(3) The affiliated operations located at an affected source under subparts GG (National Emission Standards for Aerospace Manufacturing and Rework Facilities), KK (National Emission Standards for the Printing and Publishing Industry), JJJJ (NESHAP: Paper and Other Web Coating), MMMM (NESHAP: Surface Coating of Miscellaneous Metal Parts and Products), and
SSSS (NESHAP: Surface Coating of Metal Coil) of this part. Affiliated operations include, but are not limited to, mixing or dissolving of coating ingredients; coating mixing for viscosity adjustment, color tint or additive blending, or pH adjustment; cleaning of coating lines and coating line parts; handling and storage of coatings and solvent; and conveyance and treatment of wastewater.
(4) Fabricating operations (such as spinning or compressing a solid polymer into its end use); compounding operations (in which blending, melting, and resolidification of a solid polymer product occur for the purpose of incorporating additives, colorants, or stabilizers); and extrusion and drawing operations (converting an already produced solid polymer into a different shape by melting or mixing the polymer and then forcing it or pulling it through an orifice to create an extruded product). An operation is not exempt if it involves processing with HAP solvent or if an intended purpose of the operation is to remove residual HAP monomer.
(5) Production activities described using the 1997 version of NAICS codes 325131, 325181, 325188 (except the requirements do apply to hydrazine), 325314, 325991 (except the requirements do apply to reformulating plastics resins from recycled plastics products), and 325992 (except the requirements do apply to photographic chemicals).
(6) Tall oil recovery systems.
(7) Carbon monoxide production.
(d) If the predominant use of a transfer rack loading arm or storage tank (including storage tanks in series) is associated with a miscellaneous organic chemical manufacturing process, and the loading arm or storage tank is not part of an affected source under a subpart of this part 63, then you must assign the loading arm or storage tank to the MCPU for that miscellaneous organic chemical manufacturing process. If the predominant use cannot be determined, then you may assign the loading arm or storage tank to any MCPU that shares it and is subject to this subpart. If the use varies from year to year, then you must base the determination on the utilization that occurred during the year preceding November 10, 2003 or, if the loading arm or storage tank was not in operation during that year, you must base the use on the expected use for the first 5-year period after startup. You must include the determination in the notification of compliance status report specified in § 63.2520(d). You must redetermine the primary use at least once every 5 years, or any time you implement emissions averaging or pollution prevention after the compliance date.
(e) For nondedicated equipment used to create at least one MCPU, you may elect to develop process unit groups (PUG), determine the primary product of each PUG, and comply with the requirements of the subpart in 40 CFR part 63 that applies to that primary product as specified in § 63.2535(l).
[68 FR 63888, Nov. 10, 2003, as amended at 71 FR 40331, July 14, 2006; 85 FR 49132, Aug. 12, 2020]
§ 63.2440
What parts of my plant does this subpart cover?
(a) This subpart applies to each miscellaneous organic chemical manufacturing affected source.
(b) The miscellaneous organic chemical manufacturing affected source is the facilitywide collection of MCPU and heat exchange systems, wastewater, and waste management units that are associated with manufacturing materials described in § 63.2435(b)(1).
(c) A new affected source is described by either paragraph (c)(1) or (2) of this section.

# Emission Limits, Work Practice Standards, and Compliance Requirements
§ 63.2450
What are my general requirements for complying with this subpart?
(a)
General.
You must comply with paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section.
(1) Except as specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, you must be in compliance with the emission limits and work practice standards in Tables 1 through 7 to this subpart at all times, except during periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction (SSM), and you must meet the requirements specified in §§ 63.2455 through 63.2490 (or the alternative means of compliance in § 63.2495, § 63.2500, or § 63.2505), except as specified in paragraphs (b) through (s) of this section. You must meet the notification, reporting, and recordkeeping requirements specified in §§ 63.2515, 63.2520, and 63.2525.
(2) Beginning no later than the compliance dates specified in § 63.2445(g), paragraph (a)(1) of this section no longer applies. Instead, you must be in compliance with the emission limits and work practice standards in Tables 1 through 7 to this subpart at all times, and you must meet the requirements specified in §§ 63.2455 through 63.2490 (or the alternative means of compliance in § 63.2495, § 63.2500, or § 63.2505), except as specified in paragraphs (b) through (v) of this section. You must meet the notification, reporting, and recordkeeping requirements specified in §§ 63.2515, 63.2520, and 63.2525.
(b)
Determine halogenated vent streams.
You must determine if an emission stream is a halogenated vent stream, as defined in § 63.2550, by calculating the mass emission rate of halogen atoms in accordance with § 63.115(d)(2)(v). Alternatively, you may elect to designate the emission stream as halogenated.
(c)
Requirements for combined emission streams.
When organic HAP emissions from different emission types (
e.g.,
continuous process vents, batch process vents, storage tanks, transfer operations, and waste management units) are combined, you must comply with the requirements of either paragraph (c)(1) or (2) of this section.
(1) Comply with the applicable requirements of this subpart for each kind of organic HAP emissions in the stream (
e.g.,
the requirements of table 1 to this subpart for continuous process vents and the requirements of table 4 to this subpart for emissions from storage tanks).
(2) Determine the applicable requirements based on the hierarchy presented in paragraphs (c)(2)(i) through (vi) of this section. For a combined stream, the applicable requirements are specified in the highest-listed paragraph in the hierarchy that applies to
any of the individual streams that make up the combined stream. For example, if a combined stream consists of emissions from Group 1 batch process vents and any other type of emission stream, then you must comply with the requirements in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section for the combined stream; compliance with the requirements in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section constitutes compliance for the other emission streams in the combined stream. Two exceptions are that you must comply with the requirements in Table 3 to this subpart and § 63.2465 for all process vents with hydrogen halide and halogen HAP emissions, and recordkeeping requirements for Group 2 applicability or compliance are still required (
e.g.,
the requirement in § 63.2525(e)(3) and (4) to track the number of batches produced and calculate rolling annual emissions for processes with Group 2 batch process vents).
(i) The requirements of table 2 to this subpart and § 63.2460 for Group 1 batch process vents, including applicable monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting.
(ii) The requirements of table 1 to this subpart and § 63.2455 for continuous process vents that are routed to a control device, as defined in § 63.981, including applicable monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting.
(iii) The requirements of table 5 to this subpart and § 63.2475 for transfer operations, including applicable monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting.
(iv) The requirements of table 7 to this subpart and § 63.2485 for emissions from waste management units that are used to manage and treat Group 1 wastewater streams and residuals from Group 1 wastewater streams, including applicable monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting.
(v) The requirements of table 4 to this subpart and § 63.2470 for control of emissions from storage tanks, including applicable monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting.
(vi) The requirements of table 1 to this subpart and § 63.2455 for continuous process vents after a recovery device including applicable monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting.
(d) [Reserved]
(e)
Requirements for control devices.
(1) Except when complying with § 63.2485 or paragraph (e)(7) of this section, if you reduce organic HAP emissions by venting emissions through a closed-vent system to any combination of control devices (except a flare) or recovery devices, you must meet the requirements of paragraph (e)(4) of this section, and the requirements of § 63.982(c) and the requirements referenced therein.
(2) Except as specified in paragraph (e)(5) of this section or except when complying with § 63.2485, if you reduce organic HAP emissions by venting emissions through a closed-vent system to a flare, you must meet the requirements of paragraph (e)(4) of this section, and the requirements of § 63.982(b) and the requirements referenced therein.
(3) Except as specified in paragraphs (e)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section, if you use a halogen reduction device to reduce hydrogen halide and halogen HAP emissions from halogenated vent streams, you must meet the requirements of paragraph (e)(4) of this section, and the requirements of § 63.994 and the requirements referenced therein. If you use a halogen reduction device before a combustion device, you must determine the halogen atom emission rate prior to the combustion device according to the procedures in § 63.115(d)(2)(v).
(i) Beginning on and after October 13, 2020, performance test reports must be submitted according to the procedures in § 63.2520(f).
(ii) If you use a halogen reduction device other than a scrubber, then you must submit procedures for establishing monitoring parameters to the Administrator as part of your precompliance report as specified in § 63.2520(c)(8).
(4) Beginning no later than the compliance dates specified in § 63.2445(g), the referenced provisions specified in paragraphs (e)(4)(i) through (xvi) of this section do not apply when demonstrating compliance with subpart SS of this part.
(i) The phrase “Except for equipment needed for safety purposes such as pressure relief devices, low leg drains, high point bleeds, analyzer vents, and open-
ended valves or lines” in § 63.983(a)(3) of subpart SS.
(ii) The second sentence of § 63.983(a)(5) of subpart SS.

(5) For any flare that is used to reduce organic HAP emissions from an MCPU, you may elect to comply with the requirements in this paragraph in lieu of the requirements of § 63.982(b) and the requirements referenced therein. However, beginning no later than the compliance dates specified in § 63.2445(g), paragraphs (e)(2) and (f) of this section no longer apply to flares that control ethylene oxide emissions from affected sources in ethylene oxide service as defined in § 63.2550 and flares used to control emissions from MCPUs that produce olefins or polyolefins. Instead, if you reduce organic HAP emissions by venting emissions through a closed-vent system to a steam-assisted, air-assisted, non-assisted, or pressure-assisted multi-point flare that controls ethylene oxide emissions from affected sources in ethylene oxide service as defined in § 63.2550 or is used to control emissions from an MCPU that produces olefins or polyolefins, then you must meet the applicable requirements for flares as specified in §§ 63.670 and 63.671 of subpart CC, including the provisions in Tables 12 and 13 to subpart CC of this part, except as specified in paragraphs (e)(5)(i) through (xiii) of this section. This requirement in this paragraph (e)(5) also applies to any flare using fuel gas from a fuel gas system, of which 50 percent or more of the fuel gas is derived from an MCPU that has processes and/or equipment in ethylene oxide service or that produces olefins or polyolefins, as determined on an annual average basis. For purposes of compliance with this paragraph (e)(5), the following terms are defined in § 63.641 of subpart CC: Assist air, assist steam, center steam, combustion zone, combustion zone gas, flare, flare purge gas, flare supplemental gas, flare sweep gas, flare vent gas, lower steam, net heating value, perimeter assist air, pilot gas, premix assist air, total steam, and upper steam. Also, for purposes of compliance with this paragraph (e)(5), “MCPUs that produces olefins or polyolefins” includes only those MCPUs that manufacture ethylene, propylene, polyethylene, and/or polypropylene as a product. By-products and impurities as defined in § 63.101, as well as wastes and trace contaminants, are not considered products.
(i) When determining compliance with the pilot flame requirements specified in § 63.670(b) and (g), substitute “pilot flame or flare flame” for each occurrence of “pilot flame.”
(ii) When determining compliance with the flare tip velocity and combustion zone operating limits specified in § 63.670(d) and (e), the requirement effectively applies starting with the 15-minute block that includes a full 15 minutes of the flaring event. You are required to demonstrate compliance with the velocity and NHVcz requirements starting with the block that
contains the fifteenth minute of a flaring event. You are not required to demonstrate compliance for the previous 15-minute block in which the event started and contained only a fraction of flow.
(iii) Instead of complying with paragraph (o)(2)(i) of § 63.670 of subpart CC, you must develop and implement the flare management plan no later than the compliance dates specified in § 63.2445(g).
(iv) Instead of complying with paragraph (o)(2)(iii) of § 63.670 of subpart CC, if required to develop a flare management plan and submit it to the Administrator, then you must also submit all versions of the plan in portable document format (PDF) to the EPA following the procedure specified in § 63.9(k), except any medium submitted through mail must be sent to the attention of the Miscellaneous Organic Chemical Manufacturing Sector Lead.
(v) Section 63.670(o)(3)(ii) of subpart CC and all references to § 63.670(o)(3)(ii) of subpart CC do not apply. Instead, the owner or operator must comply with the maximum flare tip velocity operating limit at all times.
(vi) Substitute “MCPU” for each occurrence of “petroleum refinery.”
(vii) Each occurrence of “refinery” does not apply.
(viii) If a pressure-assisted multi-point flare is used as a control device, then you must meet the following conditions:
(A) You are not required to comply with the flare tip velocity requirements in paragraph (d) and (k) of § 63.670 of subpart CC;
(B) You must comply with the NHVcz requirements in paragraph (e)(2) of § 63.670 of subpart CC;
(C) You must determine the 15-minute block average NHVvg using only the direct calculation method specified in in paragraph (l)(5)(ii) of § 63.670 of subpart CC;
(D) Instead of complying with paragraph (b) and (g) of § 63.670 of subpart CC, if a pressure-assisted multi-point flare uses cross-lighting on a stage of burners rather than having an individual pilot flame on each burner, then you must operate each stage of the pressure-assisted multi-point flare with a flame present at all times when regulated material is routed to that stage of burners. Each stage of burners that cross-lights in the pressure-assisted multi-point flare must have at least two pilots with at least one continuously lit and capable of igniting all regulated material that is routed to that stage of burners. Each 15-minute block during which there is at least one minute where no pilot flame is present on a stage of burners when regulated material is routed to the flare is a deviation of the standard. Deviations in different 15-minute blocks from the same event are considered separate deviations. The pilot flame(s) on each stage of burners that use cross-lighting must be continuously monitored by a thermocouple or any other equivalent device used to detect the presence of a flame;
(E) Unless you choose to conduct a cross-light performance demonstration as specified in this paragraph (e)(5)(viii)(E), you must ensure that if a stage of burners on the flare uses cross-lighting, that the distance between any two burners in series on that stage is no more than 6 feet when measured from the center of one burner to the next burner. A distance greater than 6 feet between any two burners in series may be used provided you conduct a performance demonstration that confirms the pressure-assisted multi-point flare will cross-light a minimum of three burners and the spacing between the burners and location of the pilot flame must be representative of the projected installation. The compliance demonstration must be approved by the permitting authority and a copy of this approval must be maintained onsite. The compliance demonstration report must include: A protocol describing the test methodology used, associated test method QA/QC parameters, the waste gas composition and NHVcz of the gas tested, the velocity of the waste gas tested, the pressure-assisted multi-point flare burner tip pressure, the time, length, and duration of the test, records of whether a successful cross-light was observed over all of the burners and the length of time it took for the burners to cross-light, records of maintaining a stable flame after a successful cross-light and the duration for which this was observed, records of
any smoking events during the cross-light, waste gas temperature, meteorological conditions (
e.g.,
ambient temperature, barometric pressure, wind speed and direction, and relative humidity), and whether there were any observed flare flameouts; and
(F) You must install and operate pressure monitor(s) on the main flare header, as well as a valve position indicator monitoring system for each staging valve to ensure that the flare operates within the proper range of conditions as specified by the manufacturer. The pressure monitor must meet the requirements in Table 13 to subpart CC of this part.
(G) If a pressure-assisted multi-point flare is operating under the requirements of an approved alternative means of emission limitations, you must either continue to comply with the terms of the alternative means of emission limitations or comply with the provisions in paragraphs (e)(5)(viii)(A) through (F) of this section.
(ix) If you choose to determine compositional analysis for net heating value with a continuous process mass spectrometer, then you must comply with the requirements specified in paragraphs (e)(5)(ix)(A) through (G) of this section.
(A) You must meet the requirements in § 63.671(e)(2). You may augment the minimum list of calibration gas components found in § 63.671(e)(2) with compounds found during a pre-survey or known to be in the gas through process knowledge.
(B) Calibration gas cylinders must be certified to an accuracy of 2 percent and traceable to National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) standards.
(C) For unknown gas components that have similar analytical mass fragments to calibration compounds, you may report the unknowns as an increase in the overlapped calibration gas compound. For unknown compounds that produce mass fragments that do not overlap calibration compounds, you may use the response factor for the nearest molecular weight hydrocarbon in the calibration mix to quantify the unknown component's NHVvg.
(D) You may use the response factor for n-pentane to quantify any unknown components detected with a higher molecular weight than n-pentane.
(E) You must perform an initial calibration to identify mass fragment overlap and response factors for the target compounds.
(F) You must meet applicable requirements in Performance Specification 9 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix B, for continuous monitoring system acceptance including, but not limited to, performing an initial multi-point calibration check at three concentrations following the procedure in Section 10.1 and performing the periodic calibration requirements listed for gas chromatographs in Table 13 to subpart CC of this part, for the process mass spectrometer. You may use the alternative sampling line temperature allowed under Net Heating Value by Gas Chromatograph in Table 13 to subpart CC of this part.
(G) The average instrument calibration error (CE) for each calibration compound at any calibration concentration must not differ by more than 10 percent from the certified cylinder gas value. The CE for each component in the calibration blend must be calculated using Equation 1 to this paragraph (e)(5)(ix)(G).
ER12AU20.000
Where:
Cm = Average instrument response (ppm).
Ca = Certified cylinder gas value (ppm).
(x) If you use a gas chromatograph or mass spectrometer for compositional analysis for net heating value, then you may choose to use the CE of NHV

(xi) Instead of complying with paragraph (q) of § 63.670 of subpart CC, you must comply with the reporting requirements specified in § 63.2520(d)(3) and (e)(11).
(xii) Instead of complying with paragraph (p) of § 63.670 of subpart CC, you must keep the flare monitoring records specified in § 63.2525(m).
(xiii) You may elect to comply with the alternative means of emissions limitation requirements specified in paragraph (r) of § 63.670 of subpart CC in lieu of the requirements in paragraphs (d) through (f) of § 63.670 of subpart CC, as applicable. However, instead of complying with paragraph (r)(3)(iii) of § 63.670 of subpart CC, you must also submit the alternative means of emissions limitation request to the following address: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards, Sector Policies and Programs Division, U.S. EPA Mailroom (C404-02), Attention: Miscellaneous Organic Chemical Manufacturing Sector Lead, 4930 Old Page Rd., Durham, NC 27703.
(6) Beginning no later than the compliance dates specified in § 63.2445(g), the use of a bypass line at any time on a closed vent system to divert emissions subject to the requirements in Tables 1 through 7 to this subpart to the atmosphere or to a control device not meeting the requirements specified in Tables 1 through 7 to this subpart is an emissions standards deviation. You must also comply with the requirements specified in paragraphs (e)(6)(i) through (v) of this section, as applicable:

You must measure the concentration of HAP or TOC using either a portable analyzer, in accordance with Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7, using methane, propane, isobutylene, or the primary HAP being controlled as the calibration gas or Method 25A of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7, using methane, propane, or the primary HAP being controlled as the calibration gas.
(iii) Comply with paragraph (e)(7)(iii)(A) of this section, and comply with the monitoring frequency according to paragraph (e)(7)(iii)(B) of this section.
(A) The first adsorber in series must be replaced immediately when breakthrough, as defined in § 63.2550(i), is detected between the first and second adsorber. The original second adsorber (or a fresh canister) will become the new first adsorber and a fresh adsorber will become the second adsorber. For purposes of this paragraph (e)(7)(iii)(A), “immediately” means within 8 hours of the detection of a breakthrough for adsorbers of 55 gallons or less, and within 24 hours of the detection of a breakthrough for adsorbers greater than 55 gallons. You must monitor at the outlet of the first adsorber within 3 days of replacement to confirm it is performing properly.

(i) If you elect to comply with the percent reduction emission limits in tables 1 through 7 to this subpart, and carbon disulfide is the principal organic HAP component (
i.e.,
greater than 50 percent of the HAP in the stream by volume), then you must use Method 18, or Method 15 (40 CFR part 60, appendix A) to measure carbon disulfide at the inlet and outlet of the control device. Use the percent reduction in carbon disulfide as a surrogate for the percent reduction in total organic HAP emissions.
(ii) If you elect to comply with the outlet TOC concentration emission limits in Tables 1 through 7 to this subpart, and the uncontrolled or inlet gas stream to the control device contains greater than 10 percent (volume concentration) carbon disulfide, you must use Method 18 or Method 15 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, to separately determine the carbon disulfide concentration. Calculate the total HAP or TOC emissions by totaling the carbon disulfide emissions measured using Method 18 or 15 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, and the other HAP emissions measured using Method 18 or 25A of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A.
(4) As an alternative to using Method 18, Method 25/25A, or Method 26/26A of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, to comply with any of the emission limits specified in tables 1 through 7 to this subpart, you may use Method 320 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A. When using Method 320, you must follow the analyte spiking procedures of section 13 of Method 320, unless you demonstrate that the complete spiking procedure has been conducted at a similar source.

For the purposes of this subpart, results of all initial compliance demonstrations must be included in the notification of compliance status report, which is due 150 days after the compliance date, as specified in § 63.2520(d)(1). If the initial compliance demonstration includes a performance test and the results are submitted electronically via CEDRI in accordance with § 63.2520(f), the process unit(s) tested, the pollutant(s) tested, and the date that such performance test was conducted may be submitted in the notification of compliance status report in lieu of the performance test results. The performance test results must be submitted to CEDRI by the date the notification of compliance status report is submitted.
(6) Beginning no later than the compliance dates specified in § 63.2445(g), in lieu of the requirements specified in § 63.7(e)(1) of subpart A you must conduct performance tests under such conditions as the Administrator specifies based on representative performance of the affected source for the period being tested. Representative conditions exclude periods of startup and shutdown. You may not conduct performance tests during periods of malfunction. You must record the process information that is necessary to document operating conditions during the test and include in such record an explanation to support that such conditions represent normal operation. Upon request, you must make available to the Administrator such records as may be
necessary to determine the conditions of performance tests.
(7) Comply with the requirements in § 63.2450(e)(4), as applicable.

To determine the percent reduction of a small control device that is used to comply with an emission limit specified in Table 1, 2, 3, or 5 to this subpart, you may elect to conduct a design evaluation as specified in § 63.1257(a)(1) instead of a performance test as specified in subpart SS of this part. You must establish the value(s) and basis for the operating limits as part of the design evaluation. For continuous process vents, the design evaluation must be conducted at maximum representative operating conditions for the process, unless the Administrator specifies or approves alternate operating conditions. For transfer racks, the design evaluation must demonstrate that the control device achieves the required control efficiency during the reasonably expected maximum transfer loading rate. Beginning no later than the compliance dates specified in § 63.2445(i), this paragraph (h) does not apply to process vents in ethylene oxide service as defined in § 63.2550.

Except as specified in paragraph (i)(3) of this section, when § 63.997(e)(2)(iii)(C) requires you to correct the measured concentration at the outlet of a combustion device to 3-percent oxygen if you add supplemental combustion air, the requirements in either paragraph (i)(1) or (2) of this section apply for the purposes of this subpart.
(1) You must correct the concentration in the gas stream at the outlet of the combustion device to 3 percent oxygen if you add supplemental gases, as defined in § 63.2550, to the vent stream, or;
(2) You must correct the measured concentration for supplemental gases using Equation 1 in § 63.2460(c)(6); you may use process knowledge and representative operating data to determine the fraction of the total flow due to supplemental gas.
(3) Beginning no later than the compliance dates specified in § 63.2445(g), paragraphs (i)(1) and (2) of this section no longer apply. Instead, when § 63.997(e)(2)(iii)(C) requires you to correct the measured concentration at the outlet of a combustion device to 3-percent oxygen if you add supplemental combustion air, you must follow the procedures in § 63.997(e)(2)(iii)(C) to perform the concentration correction, except you may also use Method 3A of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-2, to determine the oxygen concentration.

Unless otherwise specified in this subpart, beginning on and after October 13, 2020, the results of the performance evaluation must be submitted in accordance with § 63.2520(g).
(4) The CEMS data must be reduced to operating day or operating block averages computed using valid data consistent with the data availability requirements specified in § 63.999(c)(6)(i)(B) through (D), except monitoring data also are sufficient to constitute a valid hour of data if measured values are available for at least two of the 15-minute periods during an hour when calibration, quality assurance, or maintenance activities are being performed. An operating block is a period of time from the beginning to end of batch operations within a process. Operating block averages may be used only for batch process vent data. In computing operating day or operating block averages to determine compliance with this subpart, you must exclude monitoring data recorded during CEMS breakdowns, out-of-control periods, repairs, maintenance periods, calibration checks, or other quality assurance activities.

If the performance evaluation plan is revised, you must keep previous (
i.e.,
superseded) versions of the performance evaluation plan on record to be made available for inspection, upon request, by the Administrator, for a period of 5 years after each revision to the plan. The program of corrective action should be included in the plan required
under § 63.8(d)(2) of subpart A. In addition to the information required in § 63.8(d)(2) of subpart A, your written procedures for CEMS must include the information in paragraphs (j)(6)(i) through (vi) of this section:
(i) Description of CEMS installation location.
(ii) Description of the monitoring equipment, including the manufacturer and model number for all monitoring equipment components and the span of the analyzer.

(i) Except as specified in paragraph (k)(1)(ii) of this section, record the results of each calibration check and all maintenance performed on the CPMS as specified in § 63.998(c)(1)(ii)(A).
(ii) Beginning no later than the compliance dates specified in § 63.2445(g), paragraph (k)(1)(i) of this section no longer applies. Instead, you must record the results of each calibration check and all maintenance performed on the CPMS as specified in § 63.998(c)(1)(ii)(A), except you must record all maintenance, not just preventative maintenance.
(2) When subpart SS of this part 63 uses the term “a range” or “operating range” of a monitored parameter, it means an “operating limit” for a monitored parameter for the purposes of this subpart.
(3) As an alternative to continuously measuring and recording pH as specified in §§ 63.994(c)(1)(i) and 63.998(a)(2)(ii)(D), you may elect to continuously monitor and record the caustic strength of the effluent. For halogen scrubbers used to control only batch process vents you may elect to monitor and record either the pH or the caustic strength of the scrubber effluent at least once per day.
(4) As an alternative to the inlet and outlet temperature monitoring requirements for catalytic incinerators as specified in § 63.988(c)(2) and the related recordkeeping requirements specified in § 63.998(a)(2)(ii)(B)(

You may elect to measure the same parameter(s) that is required for control devices that control inlet HAP emissions equal to or greater than 1 tpy. If the parameter will not be measured continuously, you must request approval of your proposed procedure in the precompliance report. You must identify the operating limit(s) and the measurement frequency, and you must provide rationale to support how these measurements demonstrate the control device is operating properly.
(7) Beginning no later than the compliance dates specified in § 63.2445(g), the manufacturer's specifications or your written procedures must include a schedule for calibrations, preventative maintenance procedures, a schedule for preventative maintenance, and corrective actions to be taken if a calibration fails. If a CPMS calibration fails, the CPMS is considered to be inoperative until you take corrective action and the system passes calibration. You must record the nature and cause of instances when the CPMS is inoperative and the corrective action taken.
(8) You must comply with the requirements in paragraph (e)(4) of this section, as applicable.

Startup, shutdown, and malfunction.
Sections 63.152(f)(7)(ii) through (iv) and 63.998(b)(2)(iii) and (b)(6)(i)(A), which apply to the exclusion of monitoring data collected during periods of SSM from daily averages, do not apply for the purposes of this subpart.
(m)
Reporting.
(1) When §§ 63.2455 through 63.2490 reference other subparts in this part 63 that use the term “periodic report,” it means “compliance report” for the purposes of this subpart. The compliance report must include the information specified in § 63.2520(e), as well as the information specified in referenced subparts.
(2) When there are conflicts between this subpart and referenced subparts for the due dates of reports required by this subpart, reports must be submitted according to the due dates presented in this subpart.
(3) Excused excursions, as defined in subparts G and SS of this part 63, are not allowed.
(n) [Reserved]

Except as specified in paragraph (t) of this section, opening a safety device, as defined in § 63.2550, is allowed at any time conditions require it to avoid unsafe conditions.
(q) If an emission stream contains energetics or organic peroxides that, for safety reasons, cannot meet an applicable emission limit specified in Tables 1 through 7 to this subpart, then you must submit documentation in your precompliance report explaining why an undue safety hazard would be created if the air emission controls were installed, and you must describe the procedures that you will implement to minimize HAP emissions from these vent streams.
(r)
Surge control vessels and bottoms receivers.
For each surge control vessel or bottoms receiver that meets the capacity and vapor pressure thresholds for a Group 1 storage tank, you must meet emission limits and work practice standards specified in Table 4 to this subpart. Beginning no later than the compliance dates specified in § 63.2445(i), for each surge control vessel and bottoms receiver in ethylene oxide service as defined in § 63.2550, you must also meet the applicable process vent requirements specified in §§ 63.2492 and 63.2493(a) through (c).
(s) For the purposes of determining Group status for continuous process vents, batch process vents, and storage tanks in §§ 63.2455, 63.2460, and 63.2470, hydrazine is to be considered an organic HAP.
(t)
New safety device requirements.
Beginning no later than the compliance dates specified in § 63.2445(g), paragraph (p) of this section no longer applies. Instead, you must comply with the requirements specified in § 63.2480(e).
(u)
General duty.
Beginning no later than the compliance dates specified in
§ 63.2445(g), at all times, you must operate and maintain any affected source, including associated air pollution control equipment and monitoring equipment, in a manner consistent with safety and good air pollution control practices for minimizing emissions. The general duty to minimize emissions does not require you to make any further efforts to reduce emissions if levels required by the applicable standard have been achieved. Determination of whether a source is operating in compliance with operation and maintenance requirements will be based on information available to the Administrator which may include, but is not limited to, monitoring results, review of operation and maintenance procedures, review of operation and maintenance records, and inspection of the source.
(v)
Maintenance vents.
Beginning no later than the compliance dates specified in § 63.2445(g), you may designate a process vent as a maintenance vent if the vent is only used as a result of startup, shutdown, maintenance, or inspection of equipment where equipment is emptied, depressurized, degassed, or placed into service. You must comply with the applicable requirements in paragraphs (v)(1) through (3) of this section for each maintenance vent. Any vent designated as a maintenance vent is only subject to the maintenance vent provisions in this paragraph (v) and the associated recordkeeping and reporting requirements in §§ 63.2525(p) and 63.2520(e)(14), respectively. You do not need to designate a maintenance vent as a Group 1 or Group 2 process vent nor identify maintenance vents in a Notification of Compliance Status report.
(1) Prior to venting to the atmosphere, remove process liquids from the equipment as much as practical and depressurize the equipment to either: A flare meeting the requirements of paragraph (e)(2) or (5) of this section, as applicable, or a non-flare control device meeting the requirements in paragraph (e)(4) of this section and the requirements specified in § 63.982(c)(2) of subpart SS until one of the following conditions, as applicable, is met.
(i) The vapor in the equipment served by the maintenance vent has a concentration less than 10 percent of its lower explosive limit (LEL) and has an outlet concentration less than or equal to 20 ppmv hydrogen halide and halogen HAP.
(ii) If there is no ability to measure the concentration of the vapor in the equipment based on the design of the equipment, the pressure in the equipment served by the maintenance vent is reduced to 5 pounds per square inch gauge (psig) or less. Upon opening the maintenance vent, active purging of the equipment cannot be used until the concentration of the vapors in the maintenance vent (or inside the equipment if the maintenance is a hatch or similar type of opening) is less than 10 percent of its LEL.
(iii) The equipment served by the maintenance vent contains less than 50 pounds of total volatile organic compounds (VOC).
(iv) If, after applying best practices to isolate and purge equipment served by a maintenance vent, none of the applicable criterion in paragraphs (v)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section can be met prior to installing or removing a blind flange or similar equipment blind, then the pressure in the equipment served by the maintenance vent must be reduced to 2 psig or less before installing or removing the equipment blind. During installation or removal of the equipment blind, active purging of the equipment may be used provided the equipment pressure at the location where purge gas is introduced remains at 2 psig or less.
(2) Except for maintenance vents complying with the alternative in paragraph (v)(1)(iii) of this section, you must determine the concentration of the vapor or, if applicable, equipment pressure using process instrumentation or portable measurement devices and follow procedures for calibration and maintenance according to manufacturer's specifications.
(3) For maintenance vents complying with the alternative in paragraph (v)(1)(iii) of this section, you must determine mass of VOC in the equipment served by the maintenance vent based on the equipment size and contents after considering any contents drained or purged from the equipment. Equipment size may be determined from
equipment design specifications. Equipment contents may be determined using process knowledge.

(b) For each continuous process vent, you must either designate the vent as a Group 1 continuous process vent or determine the total resource effectiveness (TRE) index value as specified in § 63.115(d), except as specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (3) of this section.
(1) You are not required to determine the Group status or the TRE index value for any continuous process vent that is combined with Group 1 batch process vents before a control device or recovery device because the requirements of § 63.2450(c)(2)(i) apply to the combined stream.
(2) When a TRE index value of 4.0 is referred to in § 63.115(d), TRE index values of 5.0 for existing affected sources and 8.0 for new and reconstructed affected sources apply for the purposes of this subpart.
(3) When § 63.115(d) refers to “emission reductions specified in § 63.113(a),” the reductions specified in Table 1 to this subpart apply for the purposes of this subpart.
(c) If you use a recovery device to maintain the TRE above a specified threshold, you must meet the requirements of § 63.982(e) and the requirements referenced therein, except as specified in § 63.2450 and paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
(1) When § 63.993 uses the phrase “the TRE index value is between the level specified in a referencing subpart and 4.0,” the phrase “the TRE index value is
1.9 but ≤5.0” applies for an existing affected source, and the phrase “the TRE index value is
5.0 but ≤8.0” applies for a new and reconstructed affected source, for the purposes of this subpart.

(b)
Group status.
If a process has batch process vents, as defined in § 63.2550, you must determine the group status of the batch process vents by determining and summing the uncontrolled organic HAP emissions from each of the batch process vents within the process using the procedures specified in § 63.1257(d)(2)(i) and (ii), except as specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (7) of this section.
(1) To calculate emissions caused by the heating of a vessel without a process condenser to a temperature lower than the boiling point, you must use the procedures in § 63.1257(d)(2)(i)(C)(
3
).
(2) To calculate emissions from depressurization of a vessel without a process condenser, you must use the procedures in § 63.1257(d)(2)(i)(D)(
10
).

P
system
= absolute pressure of the receiving vessel;
P
i
= partial pressure of the HAP determined at the exit temperature and exit pressure conditions of the condenser or at the conditions of the dedicated receiver;
P
j
= partial pressure of condensables (including HAP) determined at the exit temperature and exit pressure conditions of the condenser or at the conditions of the dedicated receiver;
MW
HAP
= molecular weight of the HAP determined at the exit temperature and exit pressure conditions of the
condenser or at the conditions of the dedicated receiver.
(4) To calculate uncontrolled emissions when a vessel is equipped with a process condenser, you must use the procedures in § 63.1257(d)(3)(i)(B), except as specified in paragraphs (b)(4)(i) through (vii) of this section.

(iii) You must perform a material balance for each component.
(iv) For the emissions from gas evolution, the term for time, t, must be used in Equation 12 to 40 CFR part 63, subpart GGG.
(v) Emissions from empty vessel purging shall be calculated using Equation 36 to 40 CFR part 63, subpart GGG and the exit temperature and exit pressure conditions of the condenser or the conditions of the dedicated receiver.
(vi) You must conduct an engineering assessment as specified in § 63.1257(d)(2)(ii) for each emission episode that is not due to vapor displacement, purging, heating, depressurization, vacuum operations, gas evolution, air drying, or empty vessel purging. The requirements of paragraphs (b)(3) through (4) of this section shall apply.
(vii) You may elect to conduct an engineering assessment if you can demonstrate to the Administrator that the methods in § 63.1257(d)(3)(i)(B) are not appropriate.
(5) You may elect to designate the batch process vents within a process as Group 1 and not calculate uncontrolled emissions if you comply with one of the situations in paragraph (b)(5)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this section.
(i) If you comply with the alternative standard specified in § 63.2505.
(ii) If all Group 1 batch process vents within a process are controlled; you conduct the performance test under hypothetical worst case conditions, as defined in § 63.1257(b)(8)(i)(B); and the emission profile is based on capture and control system limitations as specified in § 63.1257(b)(8)(ii)(C).
(iii) If you comply with an emission limit using a flare that meets the requirements specified in § 63.987 or § 63.2450(e)(5), as applicable.

(i) You may switch at any time after operating as Group 2 for at least 1 year so that you can show compliance with the 10,000 pounds per year (lb/yr) threshold for Group 2 batch process vents for at least 365 days before the switch. You may elect to start keeping records of emissions from Group 2 batch process vents before the compliance date. Report a switch based on this provision in your next compliance report in accordance with § 63.2520(e)(10)(i).
(ii) If the conditions in paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section are not applicable, you must provide a 60-day advance notice in accordance with § 63.2520(e)(10)(ii) before switching.
(7) As an alternative to determining the uncontrolled organic HAP emissions as specified in § 63.1257(d)(2)(i) and (ii), you may elect to demonstrate that non-reactive organic HAP are the only HAP used in the process and non-reactive HAP usage in the process is less than 10,000 lb/yr. You must provide data and supporting rationale in your notification of compliance status report explaining why the non-reactive organic HAP usage will be less than 10,000 lb/yr. You must keep records of the non-reactive organic HAP usage as specified in § 63.2525(e)(2) and include information in compliance reports as specified in § 63.2520(e)(5)(iv).
(c) Exceptions to the requirements in subparts SS and WW of this part 63 are specified in paragraphs (c)(1) through (9) of this section.
(1)
Process condensers.
Process condensers, as defined in § 63.2550(i), are not considered to be control devices for batch process vents. You must determine whether a condenser is a control device for a batch process vent or a process condenser from which the uncontrolled HAP emissions are evaluated as part of the initial compliance demonstration for each MCPU and report the results with supporting rationale in your notification of compliance status report.
(2)
Initial compliance.
(i) To demonstrate initial compliance with a percent reduction emission limit in Table 2 to this subpart, you must compare the sums of the controlled and uncontrolled emissions for the applicable Group 1 batch process vents within the process, and show that the specified reduction is met. This requirement does not apply if you comply with the emission limits of Table 2 to this subpart by using a flare that meets the requirements of § 63.987 or 63.2450(e)(5), as applicable.
(ii) When you conduct a performance test or design evaluation for a non-flare control device used to control emissions from batch process vents, you must establish emission profiles and conduct the test under worst-case conditions according to § 63.1257(b)(8) instead of under normal operating conditions as specified in § 63.7(e)(1) of subpart A or the conditions as specified in § 63.2450(g)(6). The requirements in § 63.997(e)(1)(i) and (iii) also do not apply for performance tests conducted to determine compliance with the emission limits for batch process vents. For purposes of this subpart, references in § 63.997(b)(1) to “methods specified in § 63.997(e)” include the methods specified in § 63.1257(b)(8).
(iii) As an alternative to conducting a performance test or design evaluation to demonstrate initial compliance with a percent reduction requirement for a condenser, you may determine controlled emissions using the procedures specified in § 63.1257(d)(3)(i)(B) and paragraphs (b)(3) through (4) of this section.
(iv) When § 63.1257(d)(3)(i)(B)(
7
) specifies that condenser-controlled emissions from an air dryer must be calculated using Equation 11 of 40 CFR part 63, subpart GGG, with “V equal to the air flow rate,” it means “V equal to the dryer outlet gas flow rate,” for the purposes of this subpart. Alternatively, you may use Equation 12 of 40 CFR part 63, subpart GGG, with V equal to the dryer inlet air flow rate. Account for time as appropriate in either equation.
(v) If a process condenser is used for boiling operations in which HAP (not as an impurity) is heated to the boiling point, you must demonstrate that it is properly operated according to the procedures specified in § 63.1257(d)(2)(i)(C)(
4
)(
ii
) and (d)(3)(iii)(B), and the demonstration must occur only during the boiling operation. The reference in § 63.1257(d)(3)(iii)(B) to the alternative standard in § 63.1254(c) means § 63.2505 for the purposes of this subpart. As an alternative to measuring the exhaust gas temperature, as required by § 63.1257(d)(3)(iii)(B), you may elect to measure the liquid temperature in the receiver.
(vi) You must conduct a subsequent performance test or compliance demonstration equivalent to an initial compliance demonstration within 180 days of a change in the worst-case conditions.
(3)
Establishing operating limits.
You must establish operating limits under the conditions required for your initial compliance demonstration, except you may elect to establish operating limit(s) for conditions other than those under which a performance test was conducted as specified in paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section and, if applicable, paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section.
(i) The operating limits may be based on the results of the performance test and supplementary information such as engineering assessments and manufacturer's recommendations. These limits may be established for conditions as unique as individual emission episodes for a batch process. You must provide rationale in the precompliance report for the specific level for each operating limit, including any data and calculations used to develop the limit and a description of why the limit indicates proper operation of the control device. The procedures provided in this paragraph (c)(3)(i) have not been approved
by the Administrator and determination of the operating limit using these procedures is subject to review and approval by the Administrator.
(ii) If you elect to establish separate monitoring levels for different emission episodes within a batch process, you must maintain records in your daily schedule or log of processes indicating each point at which you change from one operating limit to another, even if the duration of the monitoring for an operating limit is less than 15 minutes. You must maintain a daily schedule or log of processes according to § 63.2525(c).
(4)
Averaging periods.
As an alternative to the requirement for daily averages in § 63.998(b)(3), you may determine averages for operating blocks. An operating block is a period of time that is equal to the time from the beginning to end of batch process operations within a process.
(5) [Reserved]
(6)
Outlet concentration correction for supplemental gases.
If you use a control device other than a combustion device to comply with a TOC, organic HAP, or hydrogen halide and halogen HAP outlet concentration emission limit for batch process vents, you must correct the actual concentration for supplemental gases using Equation 1 to this paragraph (e)(6); you may use process knowledge and representative operating data to determine the fraction of the total flow due to supplemental gas.
ER10NO03.000
Where:
C
a
= corrected outlet TOC, organic HAP, or hydrogen halide and halogen HAP concentration, dry basis, ppmv;
C
m
= actual TOC, organic HAP, or hydrogen halide and halogen HAP concentration measured at control device outlet, dry basis, ppmv;
Q
a
= total volumetric flowrate of all gas streams vented to the control device, except supplemental gases;
Q
s
= total volumetric flowrate of supplemental gases.
(7) If flow to a control device could be intermittent, you must install, calibrate, and operate a flow indicator at the inlet or outlet of the control device to identify periods of no flow. Periods of no flow may not be used in daily or block averages, and it may not be used in fulfilling a minimum data availability requirement.
(8)
Terminology.
When the term “storage vessel” is used in subpart WW of this part 63, the term “process tank,” as defined in § 63.2550(i), applies for the purposes of this section.
(9)
Requirements for a biofilter.
If you use a biofilter to meet either the 95-percent reduction requirement or outlet concentration requirement specified in Table 2 to this subpart, you must meet the requirements specified in paragraphs (c)(9)(i) through (iv) of this section.
(i)
Operational requirements.
The biofilter must be operated at all times when emissions are vented to it.
(ii)
Performance tests.
To demonstrate initial compliance, you must conduct a performance test according to the procedures in §§ 63.2450(g) and 63.997 of subpart SS, and paragraphs (c)(9)(ii)(A) through (D) of this section. The design evaluation option for small control devices is not applicable if you use a biofilter.
(A) Keep up-to-date, readily accessible continuous records of either the biofilter bed temperature averaged over the full period of the performance test or the outlet total organic HAP or TOC concentration averaged over the full period of the performance test. Include these data in your notification of compliance status report as required by § 63.999(b)(3)(ii).
(B) Record either the percent reduction of total organic HAP achieved by the biofilter determined as specified in § 63.997(e)(2)(iv) or the concentration of TOC or total organic HAP determined as specified in § 63.997(e)(2)(iii) at the outlet of the biofilter, as applicable.
(C) If you monitor the biofilter bed temperature, you may elect to use multiple thermocouples in representative locations throughout the biofilter bed and calculate the average biofilter bed temperature across these thermocouples prior to reducing the temperature data to 15 minute (or shorter) averages for purposes of establishing operating limits for the biofilter. If you use multiple thermocouples, include your rationale
for their site selection in your notification of compliance status report.
(D) Before October 13, 2020, submit a performance test report as specified in § 63.999(a)(2)(i) and (ii) and include the records from paragraph (c)(9)(ii)(B) of this section. Beginning on and after October 13, 2020, you must submit a performance test report as specified in § 63.2520(f).
(iii)
Monitoring requirements.
Use either a biofilter bed temperature monitoring device (or multiple devices) capable of providing a continuous record or an organic monitoring device capable of providing a continuous record. Comply with the requirements in § 63.2450(e)(4), the general requirements for monitoring in § 63.996, and keep records of temperature or other parameter monitoring results as specified in § 63.998(b) and (c), as applicable. If you monitor temperature, the operating temperature range must be based on only the temperatures measured during the performance test; these data may not be supplemented by engineering assessments or manufacturer's recommendations as otherwise allowed in § 63.999(b)(3)(ii)(A). If you establish the operating range (minimum and maximum temperatures) using data from previous performance tests in accordance with § 63.996(c)(6), replacement of the biofilter media with the same type of media is not considered a process change under § 63.997(b)(1). You may expand your biofilter bed temperature operating range by conducting a repeat performance test that demonstrates compliance with the 95-percent reduction requirement or outlet concentration limit, as applicable.
(iv)

§ 63.2490
What requirements must I meet for heat exchange systems?
(a) You must comply with each requirement in Table 10 to this subpart that applies to your heat exchange systems, except as specified in paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section.
(b) Except as specified in paragraph (d) of this section, if you comply with the requirements of § 63.104 as specified in Table 10 to this subpart, then the phrase “a chemical manufacturing process unit meeting the conditions of § 63.100 (b)(1) through (b)(3) of this subpart” in § 63.104(a) means “an MCPU meeting the conditions of § 63.2435” for the purposes of this subpart.
(c) Except as specified in paragraph (d) of this section, if you comply with the requirements of § 63.104 as specified in Table 10 to this subpart, then the reference to “§ 63.100(c)” in § 63.104(a) does not apply for the purposes of this subpart.
(d) Unless one or more of the conditions specified in § 63.104(a)(1), (2), (5), and (6) or paragraph (e) of this section are met, beginning no later than the compliance dates specified in § 63.2445(g), the requirements of § 63.104 as specified in Table 10 to this subpart and paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section no longer apply. Instead, you must monitor the cooling water for the presence of total strippable hydrocarbons that indicate a leak according to paragraph (d)(1) of this section, and if you detect a leak, then you must repair it according to paragraphs (d)(2) and (3) of this section, unless repair is delayed according to paragraph (d)(4) of this section. At any time before the compliance dates specified in § 63.2445(g), you may choose to comply with the requirements in this paragraph (d) in lieu of the requirements of § 63.104 as specified in Table 10 to this subpart and paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section. The requirements in this paragraph (d) do not apply to heat exchange systems that have a maximum cooling water flow rate of 10 gallons per minute or less.
(1) You must perform monitoring to identify leaks of total strippable hydrocarbons from each heat exchange system subject to the requirements of this subpart according to the procedures in paragraphs (d)(1)(i) through (v) of this section.
(i)
Monitoring locations for closed-loop recirculation heat exchange systems.
For each closed loop recirculating heat exchange system, you must collect and analyze a sample from the location(s) described in either paragraph (d)(1)(i)(A) or (B) of this section.
(A) Each cooling tower return line or any representative riser within the cooling tower prior to exposure to air for each heat exchange system.
(B) Selected heat exchanger exit line(s), so that each heat exchanger or group of heat exchangers within a heat exchange system is covered by the selected monitoring location(s).
(ii)
Monitoring locations for once-through heat exchange systems.
For each once-through heat exchange system, you must collect and analyze a sample from the location(s) described in paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(A) of this section. You may also elect to collect and analyze an additional sample from the location(s) described in paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(B) of this section.
(A) Selected heat exchanger exit line(s), so that each heat exchanger or group of heat exchangers within a heat exchange system is covered by the selected monitoring location(s). The selected monitoring location may be at a point where discharges from multiple heat exchange systems are combined provided that the combined cooling water flow rate at the monitoring location does not exceed 40,000 gallons per minute.
(B) The inlet water feed line for a once-through heat exchange system prior to any heat exchanger. If multiple heat exchange systems use the same water feed (
i.e.,
inlet water from the same primary water source), you
may monitor at one representative location and use the monitoring results for that sampling location for all heat exchange systems that use that same water feed.
(iii)
Monitoring method.
If you comply with the total strippable hydrocarbon concentration leak action level as specified in paragraph (d)(1)(iv) of this section, you must comply with the requirements in paragraph (d)(1)(iii)(A) of this section. If you comply with the total hydrocarbon mass emissions rate leak action level as specified in paragraph (d)(1)(iv) of this section, you must comply with the requirements in paragraphs (d)(1)(iii)(A) and (B) of this section.
(A) You must determine the total strippable hydrocarbon concentration (in parts per million by volume (ppmv) as methane) at each monitoring location using the “Air Stripping Method (Modified El Paso Method) for Determination of Volatile Organic Compound Emissions from Water Sources” (incorporated by reference—see § 63.14) using a flame ionization detector (FID) analyzer for on-site determination as described in Section 6.1 of the Modified El Paso Method.
(B) You must convert the total strippable hydrocarbon concentration (in ppmv as methane) to a total hydrocarbon mass emissions rate (as methane) using the calculations in Section 7.0 of “Air Stripping Method (Modified El Paso Method) for Determination of Volatile Organic Compound Emissions from Water Sources” (incorporated by reference—see § 63.14).
(iv)
Monitoring frequency and leak action level.
For each heat exchange system, you must initially monitor monthly for 6-months beginning upon startup and monitor quarterly thereafter using a leak action level defined as a total strippable hydrocarbon concentration (as methane) in the stripping gas of 6.2 ppmv or, for heat exchange systems with a recirculation rate of 10,000 gallons per minute or less, you may monitor quarterly using a leak action level defined as a total hydrocarbon mass emissions rate from the heat exchange system (as methane) of 0.18 kg/hr. If a leak is detected as specified in paragraph (d)(1)(v) of this section, then you must monitor monthly until the leak has been repaired according to the requirements in paragraph (d)(2) or (3) of this section. Once the leak has been repaired according to the requirements in paragraph (d)(2) or (3) of this section, quarterly monitoring for the heat exchange system may resume. The monitoring frequencies specified in this paragraph (d)(1)(iv) also apply to the inlet water feed line for a once-through heat exchange system, if monitoring of the inlet water feed is elected as provided in paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(B) of this section.
(v)
Leak definition.
A leak is defined as described in paragraph (d)(1)(v)(A) or (B) of this section, as applicable.
(A) For once-through heat exchange systems for which the inlet water feed is monitored as described in paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(B) of this section, a leak is detected if the difference in the measurement value of the sample taken from a location specified in paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(A) of this section and the measurement value of the corresponding sample taken from the location specified in paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(B) of this section equals or exceeds the leak action level.
(B) For all other heat exchange systems, a leak is detected if a measurement value of the sample taken from a location specified in paragraph (d)(1)(i)(A) or (B) or (d)(1)(ii)(A) of this section equals or exceeds the leak action level.
(2) If a leak is detected using the methods described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, you must repair the leak to reduce the concentration or mass emissions rate to below the applicable leak action level as soon as practicable, but no later than 45 days after identifying the leak, except as specified in paragraph (d)(4) of this section. Repair must include re-monitoring at the monitoring location where the leak was identified according to the method specified in paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of this section to verify that the total strippable hydrocarbon concentration or total hydrocarbon mass emissions rate is below the applicable leak action level. Repair may also include performing the additional monitoring in paragraph (d)(3) of this section to
verify that the total strippable hydrocarbon concentration or total hydrocarbon mass emissions rate is below the applicable leak action level. Actions that can be taken to achieve repair include but are not limited to:
(i) Physical modifications to the leaking heat exchanger, such as welding the leak or replacing a tube;
(ii) Blocking the leaking tube within the heat exchanger;
(iii) Changing the pressure so that water flows into the process fluid;
(iv) Replacing the heat exchanger or heat exchanger bundle; or
(v) Isolating, bypassing, or otherwise removing the leaking heat exchanger from service until it is otherwise repaired.
(3) If you detect a leak when monitoring a cooling tower return line under paragraph (d)(1)(i)(A) of this section, you may conduct additional monitoring of each heat exchanger or group of heat exchangers associated with the heat exchange system for which the leak was detected, as provided in paragraph (d)(1)(i)(B) of this section. If no leaks are detected when monitoring according to the requirements of paragraph (d)(1)(i)(B) of this section, the heat exchange system is considered to have met the repair requirements through re-monitoring of the heat exchange system, as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.
(4) You may delay repair when one of the conditions in paragraph (d)(4)(i) or (ii) of this section is met and the leak is less than the delay of repair action level specified in paragraph (d)(4)(iii) of this section. You must determine if a delay of repair is necessary as soon as practicable, but no later than 45 days after first identifying the leak.
(i) If the repair is technically infeasible without a shutdown and the total strippable hydrocarbon concentration or total hydrocarbon mass emissions rate is initially and remains less than the delay of repair action level for all monitoring periods during the delay of repair, then you may delay repair until the next scheduled shutdown of the heat exchange system. If, during subsequent monitoring, the delay of repair action level is exceeded, then you must repair the leak within 30 days of the monitoring event in which the leak was equal to or exceeded the delay of repair action level.
(ii) If the necessary equipment, parts, or personnel are not available and the total strippable hydrocarbon concentration or total hydrocarbon mass emissions rate is initially and remains less than the delay of repair action level for all monitoring periods during the delay of repair, then you may delay the repair for a maximum of 120 calendar days. You must demonstrate that the necessary equipment, parts, or personnel were not available. If, during subsequent monitoring, the delay of repair action level is exceeded, then you must repair the leak within 30 days of the monitoring event in which the leak was equal to or exceeded the delay of repair action level.
(iii) The delay of repair action level is a total strippable hydrocarbon concentration (as methane) in the stripping gas of 62 ppmv or, for heat exchange systems with a recirculation rate of 10,000 gallons per minute or less, the delay of repair action level is a total hydrocarbon mass emissions rate (as methane) of 1.8 kg/hr. The delay of repair action level is assessed as described in paragraph (d)(4)(iii)(A) or (B) of this section, as applicable.
(A) For once-through heat exchange systems for which the inlet water feed is monitored as described in paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(B) of this section, the delay of repair action level is exceeded if the difference in the measurement value of the sample taken from a location specified in paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(A) of this section and the measurement value of the corresponding sample taken from the location specified in paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(B) of this section equals or exceeds the delay of repair action level.
(B) For all other heat exchange systems, the delay of repair action level is exceeded if a measurement value of the sample taken from a location specified in paragraph (d)(1)(i)(A) or (B) or (d)(1)(ii)(A) of this section equals or exceeds the delay of repair action level.
(e) If 99 percent by weight or more of the organic compounds that could leak into the heat exchange system are water soluble and have a Henry's Law Constant less than 5.0E-6 at 25 degrees Celsius (atmospheres-cubic meters/mol) and none of the conditions specified in
§ 63.104(a)(1), (2), (5), and (6) are met, beginning no later than the compliance dates specified in § 63.2445(g), you may monitor the cooling water for leaks according to the requirements in § 63.104(b) in lieu of using the Modified El Paso Method. If you detect a leak according to § 63.104(b), then you must repair it according to paragraph (e)(1) of this section, unless repair is delayed according to paragraph (e)(2) of this section.
(1) If a leak is detected using the methods described in paragraph (e) of this section, you must repair the leak as soon as practicable, but no later than 45 days after identifying the leak, except as specified in paragraph (e)(2) of this section. Repair must include re-monitoring at the monitoring location where the leak was identified to verify that the criteria in § 63.104(b)(6) is no longer met. Actions that can be taken to achieve repair include but are not limited to:
(i) Physical modifications to the leaking heat exchanger, such as welding the leak or replacing a tube;
(ii) Blocking the leaking tube within the heat exchanger;
(iii) Changing the pressure so that water flows into the process fluid;
(iv) Replacing the heat exchanger or heat exchanger bundle; or
(v) Isolating, bypassing, or otherwise removing the leaking heat exchanger from service until it is otherwise repaired.
(2) You may delay repair when the conditions in § 63.104(e) are met.

§ 63.2492
How do I determine whether my process vent, storage tank, or equipment is in ethylene oxide service?
To determine if process vents, storage tanks, and equipment leaks are in ethylene oxide service as defined in § 63.2550(i), you must comply with the requirements in paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section, as applicable.
(a) For each batch process vent or continuous process vent stream, you must measure the flow rate and concentration of ethylene oxide of each process vent as specified in paragraphs (a)(1) through (5) of this section.
(1) Measurements must be made prior to any dilution of the vent streams.
(2) Measurements may be made on the combined vent streams at an MCPU or for each separate vent stream.
(3) Method 1 or 1A of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-1, as appropriate, must be used for the selection of the sampling sites. For vents smaller than 0.10 meter in diameter, sample at one point at the center of the duct.
(4) The gas volumetric flow rate must be determined using Method 2, 2A, 2C, 2D, 2F, or 2G of 40 CFR part 60, appendices A-1 and A-2, as appropriate.
(5) The concentration of ethylene oxide must be determined using Method 18 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-6, or Method 320 of appendix A to this part.
(b) For storage tanks, you must determine the concentration of ethylene oxide of the fluid stored in the storage tanks by complying with the requirements in paragraph (b)(1) or (2) of this section.
(1) You must measure the concentration of ethylene oxide of the fluid stored in the storage tanks using Method 624.1 of 40 CFR part 136, appendix A, or preparation by Method 5031 and analysis by Method 8260D (both incorporated by reference, see § 63.14) in the SW-846 Compendium. In lieu of preparation by SW-846 Method 5031, you may use SW-846 Method 5030B (incorporated by reference, see § 63.14), as long as: You do not use a preservative in the collected sample; you store the sample with minimal headspace as cold as possible and at least below 4 degrees C; and you analyze the sample as soon as possible, but in no case longer than 7 days from the time the sample was collected. If you are collecting a sample from a pressure vessel, you must maintain the sample under pressure both during and following sampling.
(2) Unless specified by the Administrator, you may calculate the concentration of ethylene oxide of the fluid stored in the storage tanks if information specific to the fluid stored is available. Information specific to the fluid stored includes concentration data from safety data sheets.
(c) For equipment leaks, you must comply with the requirements in paragraphs (c)(1) through (4) of this section.
(1) Each piece of equipment within an MCPU that can reasonably be expected to contain equipment in ethylene oxide service is presumed to be in ethylene oxide service unless you demonstrate that the piece of equipment is not in ethylene oxide service. For a piece of equipment to be considered not in ethylene oxide service, it must be determined that the percent ethylene oxide content of the process fluid that is contained in or contacts equipment can be reasonably expected to not exceed 0.1 percent by weight on an annual average basis. For purposes of determining the percent ethylene oxide content of the process fluid, you must use Method 18 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-6, for gaseous process fluid, and Method 624.1 of 40 CFR part 136, appendix A, or preparation by Method 5031 and analysis by Method 8260D (both incorporated by reference, see § 63.14) in the SW-846 Compendium for liquid process fluid. In lieu of preparation by SW-846 Method 5031, you may use SW-846 Method 5030B (incorporated by reference, see § 63.14), as long as: You do not use a preservative in the collected sample; you store the sample with minimal headspace as cold as possible and at least below 4 degrees C; and you analyze the sample as soon as possible, but in no case longer than 7 days from the time the sample was collected.
(2) Unless specified by the Administrator, you may use good engineering judgment rather than the procedures specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section to determine that the percent ethylene oxide content of the process fluid that is contained in or contacts equipment does not exceed 0.1 percent by weight.
(3) You may revise your determination for whether a piece of equipment is in ethylene oxide service by following the procedures in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, or by documenting that a change in the process or raw materials no longer causes the equipment to be in ethylene oxide service.
(4) Samples used in determining the ethylene oxide content must be representative of the process fluid that is contained in or contacts the equipment.

# Alternative Means of Compliance
§ 63.2495
How do I comply with the pollution prevention standard?
(a) You may elect to comply with the pollution prevention alternative requirements specified in paragraphs (a) (1) and (2) of this section in lieu of the emission limitations and work practice standards contained in Tables 1 through 7 to this subpart for any MCPU for which initial startup occurred before April 4, 2002.
(1) You must reduce the production-indexed HAP consumption factor (HAP factor) by at least 65 percent from a 3-year average baseline beginning no earlier than the 1994 through 1996 calendar years. For any reduction in the HAP factor that you achieve by reducing HAP that are also volatile organic compounds (VOC), you must demonstrate an equivalent reduction in the production-indexed VOC consumption factor (VOC factor) on a mass basis. For any reduction in the HAP factor that you achieve by reducing a HAP
that is not a VOC, you may not increase the VOC factor.
(2) Any MCPU for which you seek to comply by using the pollution prevention alternative must begin with the same starting material(s) and end with the same product(s). You may not comply by eliminating any steps of a process by transferring the step offsite (to another manufacturing location). You may also not merge a solvent recovery step conducted offsite to onsite and as part of an existing process as a method of reducing consumption.
(3) You may comply with the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this section for a series of processes, including situations where multiple processes are merged, if you demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Administrator that the multiple processes were merged after the baseline period into an existing process or processes.
(b)
Exclusions.
(1) You must comply with the emission limitations and work practice standards contained in Tables 1 through 7 to this subpart for all HAP that are generated in the MCPU and that are not included in consumption, as defined in § 63.2550. If any vent stream routed to the combustion control is a halogenated vent stream, as defined in § 63.2550, then hydrogen halides that are generated as a result of combustion control must be controlled according to the requirements in § 63.2450(e)(4) and the requirements of § 63.994 and the requirements referenced therein.
(2) You may not merge nondedicated formulation or nondedicated solvent recovery processes with any other processes.
(c)
Initial compliance procedures.
To demonstrate initial compliance with paragraph (a) of this section, you must prepare a demonstration summary in accordance with paragraph (c) (1) of this section and calculate baseline and target annual HAP and VOC factors in accordance with paragraphs (c) (2) and (3) of this section.
(1)
Demonstration plan.
You must prepare a pollution prevention demonstration plan that contains, at a minimum, the information in paragraphs (c)(1) (i) through (iii) of this section for each MCPU for which you comply with paragraph (a) of this section.
(i) Descriptions of the methodologies and forms used to measure and record consumption of HAP and VOC compounds.
(ii) Descriptions of the methodologies and forms used to measure and record production of the product(s).
(iii) Supporting documentation for the descriptions provided in accordance with paragraphs (c)(1) (i) and (ii) of this section including, but not limited to, samples of operator log sheets and daily, monthly, and/or annual inventories of materials and products. You must describe how this documentation will be used to calculate the annual factors required in paragraph (d) of this section.
(2)
Baseline factors.
You must calculate baseline HAP and VOC factors by dividing the consumption of total HAP and total VOC by the production rate, per process, for the first 3-year period in which the process was operational, beginning no earlier than the period consisting of the 1994 through 1996 calendar years.
(3)
Target annual factors.
You must calculate target annual HAP and VOC factors. The target annual HAP factor must be equal to 35 percent of the baseline HAP factor. The target annual VOC factor must be lower than the baseline VOC factor by an amount equivalent to the reduction in any HAP that is also a VOC, on a mass basis. The target annual VOC factor may be the same as the baseline VOC factor if the only HAP you reduce is not a VOC.
(d)
Continuous compliance requirements.
You must calculate annual rolling average values of the HAP and VOC factors (annual factors) in accordance with the procedures specified in paragraphs (d) (1) through (3) of this section. To show continuous compliance, the annual factors must be equal to or less than the target annual factors calculated according to paragraph (c)(3) of this section.
(1) To calculate the annual factors, you must divide the consumption of both total HAP and total VOC by the production rate, per process, for 12-month periods at the frequency specified in either paragraph (d) (2) or (3) of this section, as applicable.
(2) For continuous processes, you must calculate the annual factors
every 30 days for the 12-month period preceding the 30th day (i.e., annual rolling average calculated every 30 days). A process with both batch and continuous operations is considered a continuous process for the purposes of this section.
(3) For batch processes, you must calculate the annual factors every 10 batches for the 12-month period preceding the 10th batch (
i.e.,
annual rolling average calculated every 10 batches), except as specified in paragraphs (d)(3) (i) and (ii) of this section.
(i) If you produce more than 10 batches during a month, you must calculate the annual factors at least once during that month.
(ii) If you produce less than 10 batches in a 12-month period, you must calculate the annual factors for the number of batches in the 12-month period since the previous calculations.
(e)
Records.
You must keep records of HAP and VOC consumption, production, and the rolling annual HAP and VOC factors for each MCPU for which you are complying with paragraph (a) of this section.
(f)
Reporting.
(1) You must include the pollution prevention demonstration plan in the precompliance report required by § 63.2520(c).
(2) You must identify all days when the annual factors were above the target factors in the compliance reports.

§ 63.2500
How do I comply with emissions averaging?
(a) For an existing source, you may elect to comply with the percent reduction emission limitations in Tables 1, 2, 4, 5, and 7 to this subpart by complying with the emissions averaging provisions specified in § 63.150, except as specified in paragraphs (b) through (g) of this section.
(b) The batch process vents in an MCPU collectively are considered one individual emission point for the purposes of emissions averaging, except that only individual batch process vents must be excluded to meet the requirements of § 63.150(d)(5).
(c) References in § 63.150 to §§ 63.112 through 63.130 mean the corresponding requirements in §§ 63.2450 through 63.2490, including applicable monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting.
(d) References to “periodic reports” in § 63.150 mean “compliance report” for the purposes of this subpart.
(e) For batch process vents, estimate uncontrolled emissions for a standard batch using the procedures in § 63.1257(d)(2)(i) and (ii) instead of the procedures in § 63.150(g)(2). Multiply the calculated emissions per batch by the number of batches per month when calculating the monthly emissions for use in calculating debits and credits.
(f) References to “storage vessels” in § 63.150 mean “storage tank” as defined in § 63.2550 for the purposes of this subpart.
(g) Beginning no later than the compliance dates specified in § 63.2445(g), § 63.150(f)(2) does not apply when demonstrating compliance with this section.

(A) If you comply with the total strippable hydrocarbon concentration leak action level, as specified in § 63.2490(d)(1)(iv), you must calculate the mass emissions rate by complying with the requirements of § 63.2490(d)(1)(iii)(B) or by determining the mass flow rate of the cooling water at the monitoring location where the leak was detected. If the monitoring location is an individual cooling tower riser, determine the total cooling water mass flow rate to the cooling tower. Cooling water mass flow rates may be determined using direct measurement, pump curves, heat balance calculations, or other engineering methods. If you determine the mass flow rate of the cooling water, calculate the mass emissions rate by converting the stripping gas leak concentration (in ppmv as methane) to an equivalent liquid concentration, in parts per million by weight (ppmw), using equation 7-1 from “Air Stripping Method (Modified El Paso Method) for Determination of Volatile Organic Compound Emissions from Water Sources” (incorporated by reference—see § 63.14) and multiply the equivalent liquid concentration by the mass flow rate of the cooling water.
(B) For delay of repair monitoring intervals prior to repair of the leak, calculate the potential total hydrocarbon emissions or monitored substance(s) emissions for the leaking heat exchange system or heat exchanger for the monitoring interval by multiplying the mass emissions rate, determined in § 63.2490(d)(1)(iii)(B) or paragraph (r)(4)(iv)(A) or (D) of this section, by the duration of the delay of repair monitoring interval. The duration of the delay of repair monitoring interval is the time period starting at midnight on the day of the previous monitoring event or at midnight on the day the repair would have had to be completed if the repair had not been delayed, whichever is later, and ending at midnight of the day the of the current monitoring event.
(C) For delay of repair monitoring intervals ending with a repaired leak, calculate the potential total hydrocarbon emissions or monitored substance(s) emissions for the leaking heat exchange system or heat exchanger for the final delay of repair monitoring interval by multiplying the duration of the final delay of repair monitoring interval by the mass emissions rate determined for the last monitoring event prior to the re-monitoring event used to verify the leak was repaired. The duration of the final delay of repair monitoring interval is the time period starting at midnight of the day of the last monitoring event prior to re-monitoring to verify the leak was repaired and ending at the time of the re-monitoring event that verified that the leak was repaired.
(D) If you monitor the cooling water for leaks according to § 63.2490(e), you must calculate the mass emissions rate by determining the mass flow rate of the cooling water at the monitoring location where the leak was detected. Cooling water mass flow rates may be determined using direct measurement, pump curves, heat balance calculations, or other engineering methods. Once determined, multiply the mass flow rate of the cooling water by the concentration of the measured substance(s).
(s) For process vents and storage tanks in ethylene oxide service subject to the requirements of § 63.2493, you must keep the records specified in paragraphs (s)(1) through (5) of this section in addition to those records specified in paragraph (a) of this section. Records for equipment in ethylene oxide service subject to the requirements of § 63.2493 are specified in paragraph (a) of this section.

(3) For equipment, records of the percent ethylene oxide content of the process fluid and the method used to determine it.
(4) If you vent emissions through a closed-vent system to a non-flare control device, then you must keep records of all periods during which operating values are outside of the applicable operating limits specified in § 63.2493(b)(4) through (6) when regulated material is being routed to the non-flare control device. The record must specify the operating parameter, the applicable limit, and the highest (for maximum operating limits) or lowest (for minimum operating limits) value recorded during the period.
(5) For pressure vessels subject to § 63.2493(c), records as specified in paragraphs (s)(5)(i) through (iv) of this section.
(i) The date of each performance test conducted according to § 63.2493(c)(2).
(ii) The instrument reading of each performance test conducted according to § 63.2493(c)(2), including the following:
(A) Date each defect was detected.

(C) Start and end dates of each period after the date in paragraph (s)(5)(ii)(A) of this section when the pressure vessel was completely empty.
(D) Estimated emissions from each defect.
(t) Any records required to be maintained by this part that are submitted electronically via the EPA's CEDRI may be maintained in electronic format. This ability to maintain electronic copies does not affect the requirement for facilities to make records, data, and reports available upon request to a delegated air agency or the EPA as part of an on-site compliance evaluation.
(u) Beginning no later than the compliance dates specified in § 63.2445(g), the referenced provisions specified in paragraphs (u)(1) through (8) of this section do not apply when demonstrating compliance with paragraph (a) of this section.

Ancillary activities
means boilers and incinerators (not used to comply with the emission limits in Tables 1 through 7 to this subpart), chillers and refrigeration systems, and other equipment and activities that are not directly involved (
i.e.,
they operate within a closed system and materials are not combined with process fluids) in the processing of raw materials or the manufacturing of a product or isolated intermediate.
Batch operation
means a noncontinuous operation involving intermittent or discontinuous feed into equipment, and, in general, involves the emptying of the equipment after the operation ceases and prior to beginning a new operation. Addition of raw material and withdrawal of product do not occur simultaneously in a batch operation.
Batch process vent
means a vent from a unit operation or vents from multiple unit operations within a process that are manifolded together into a common header, through which a HAP-containing gas stream is, or has the potential to be, released to the atmosphere. Examples of batch process vents include, but are not limited to, vents on condensers used for product recovery, reactors, filters, centrifuges, and process tanks. The following are not batch process vents for the purposes of this subpart:
(1) Continuous process vents;
(2) Bottoms receivers;
(3) Surge control vessels;
(4) Gaseous streams routed to a fuel gas system(s) unless on and after August 12, 2023, the fuel gas system(s) supplies a flare of which 50 percent or more of the fuel gas burned in the flare is derived from an MCPU that has processes and/or equipment in ethylene oxide service, or produces olefins or polyolefins;

the system is not ducted, piped, or otherwise connected to the unit operations) away from operators when vessels are opened; and
(8) Except for batch process vents in ethylene oxide service, emission streams from emission episodes that are undiluted and uncontrolled containing less than 50 ppmv HAP are not part of any batch process vent. A vent from a unit operation, or a vent from multiple unit operations that are manifolded together, from which total uncontrolled HAP emissions are less than 200 lb/yr is not a batch process vent; emissions for all emission episodes associated with the unit operation(s) must be included in the determination of the total mass emitted. The HAP concentration or mass emission rate may be determined using any of the following: Process knowledge that no HAP are present in the emission stream; an engineering assessment as discussed in § 63.1257(d)(2)(ii), except that you do not need to demonstrate that the equations in § 63.1257(d)(2)(i) do not apply, and the precompliance reporting requirements specified in § 63.1257(d)(2)(ii)(E) do not apply for the purposes of this demonstration; equations specified in § 63.1257(d)(2)(i), as applicable; test data using Method 18 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A; or any other test method that has been validated according to the procedures in EPA Method 301 of appendix A to this part.

typically include reagent feed vessels, a small reactor and associated product separator, recovery and holding equipment. These processes are only capable of producing small quantities of product.
Biofilter
means an enclosed control system such as a tank or series of tanks with a fixed roof that contact emissions with a solid media (such as bark) and use microbiological activity to transform organic pollutants in a process vent stream to innocuous compounds such as carbon dioxide, water, and inorganic salts. Wastewater treatment processes such as aeration lagoons or activated sludge systems are not considered to be biofilters.
Bottoms receiver
means a tank that collects bottoms from continuous distillation before the stream is sent for storage or for further downstream processing.
Breakthrough
means the time when the level of HAP or TOC, measured at the outlet of the first bed, has been detected is at the highest concentration allowed to be discharged from the adsorber system and indicates that the adsorber bed should be replaced.
Construction
means the onsite fabrication, erection, or installation of an affected source or MCPU. Addition of new equipment to an MCPU subject to existing source standards does not constitute construction, but it may constitute reconstruction of the affected source or MCPU if it satisfies the definition of reconstruction in § 63.2.
Consumption
means the quantity of all HAP raw materials entering a process in excess of the theoretical amount used as reactant, assuming 100 percent stoichiometric conversion. The raw materials include reactants, solvents, and any other additives. If a HAP is generated in the process as well as added as a raw material, consumption includes the quantity generated in the process.
Continuous operation
means any operation that is not a batch operation.
Continuous process vent
means the point of discharge to the atmosphere (or the point of entry into a control device, if any) of a gas stream if the gas stream has the characteristics specified in § 63.107(b) through (h), or meets the criteria specified in § 63.107(i), except:
(1) The reference in § 63.107(e) to a chemical manufacturing process unit that meets the criteria of § 63.100(b) means an MCPU that meets the criteria of § 63.2435(b);
(2) The reference in § 63.107(h)(4) to § 63.113 means Table 1 to this subpart;

(4) For the purposes of § 63.2455, all references to the characteristics of a process vent (
e.g.,
flowrate, total HAP concentration, or TRE index value) mean the characteristics of the gas stream.
(5) The reference to “total organic HAP” in § 63.107(d) means “total HAP” for the purposes of this subpart FFFF.
(6) The references to an “air oxidation reactor, distillation unit, or reactor” in § 63.107 mean any continuous operation for the purposes of this subpart.
(7) A separate determination is required for the emissions from each MCPU, even if emission streams from two or more MCPU are combined prior to discharge to the atmosphere or to a control device.
(8) On and after August 12, 2023, § 63.107(h)(3) applies unless the fuel gas system supplies a flare of which 50 percent or more of the fuel gas burned in the flare is derived from an MCPU that has processes and/or equipment in ethylene oxide service, or produces olefins or polyolefins.
(9) On and after August 12, 2023, § 63.107(h)(9) no longer applies.
(10) On and after August 12, 2023, § 63.107(i) no longer applies. Instead, a process vent is the point of discharge to the atmosphere (or the point of entry into a control device, if any) of a gas stream if the gas stream meets the criteria specified in this paragraph. The gas stream would meet the characteristics specified in § 63.107(b) through (g) of subpart F, but, for purposes of avoiding applicability, has been deliberately interrupted, temporarily liquefied, routed through any item of equipment for no process purpose, or disposed of in a flare that does not meet the criteria in § 63.11(b) of subpart A or
§ 63.2450(e)(5) as applicable, or an incinerator that does not reduce emissions of organic HAP by 98 percent or to a concentration of 20 parts per million by volume, whichever is less stringent.
(11) Section 63.107(d) does not apply to continuous process vents in ethylene oxide service.
Dedicated MCPU
means an MCPU that consists of equipment that is used exclusively for one process, except that storage tanks assigned to the process according to the procedures in § 63.2435(d) also may be shared by other processes.
Deviation
means any instance in which an affected source subject to this subpart, or an owner or operator of such a source:
(1) Fails to meet any requirement or obligation established by this subpart including, but not limited to, any emission limit, operating limit, or work practice standard; or
(2) Fails to meet any term or condition that is adopted to implement an applicable requirement in this subpart and that is included in the operating permit for any affected source required to obtain such a permit; or
(3) Before August 12, 2023, fails to meet any emission limit, operating limit, or work practice standard in this subpart during startup, shutdown, or malfunction, regardless of whether or not such failure is permitted by this subpart. On and after August 12, 2023, this paragraph (3) no longer applies.

means a grouping of materials with the same basic composition or the same basic end use or functionality produced using the same basic feedstocks with essentially identical HAP emission profiles (primary constituent and relative magnitude on a pound per product basis) and manufacturing equipment configuration. Examples of families of materials include multiple grades of the same product or different variations of a product (
e.g.,
blue, black, and red resins).
Force majeure
event means a release of HAP, either directly to the atmosphere from a pressure relief device or discharged via a flare, that is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Administrator to result from an event beyond the owner or operator's control, such as natural disasters; acts of war or terrorism; loss of a utility external to the MCPU (
e.g.,
external power curtailment), excluding power curtailment due to an interruptible service agreement; and fire or explosion originating at a near or adjoining facility outside of the miscellaneous organic chemical manufacturing process unit that impacts the miscellaneous organic chemical manufacturing process unit's ability to operate.

i.e.,
non-contact heat exchanger) and to transport and/or cool the water in a closed-loop recirculation system (cooling tower system) or a once-through system (
e.g.,
river or pond water). For closed-loop recirculation systems, the heat exchange system consists of a cooling tower, all miscellaneous organic chemical manufacturing process unit heat exchangers that are in organic HAP service, as defined in this subpart, serviced by that cooling tower, and all water lines to and from these miscellaneous organic chemical manufacturing process unit heat exchangers. For once-through systems, the heat exchange system consists of all heat exchangers that are in organic HAP service, as defined in this subpart, servicing an individual miscellaneous organic chemical manufacturing process unit and all water lines to and from these heat exchangers. Sample coolers or pump seal coolers are not considered heat exchangers for the purpose of this definition and are not part of the heat exchange system. Intentional direct contact with process fluids results in the formation of a wastewater.

means hydrogen chloride, hydrogen fluoride, and chlorine.
In ethylene oxide service
means the following:
(1) For equipment leaks, any equipment that contains or contacts a fluid (liquid or gas) that is at least 0.1 percent by weight of ethylene oxide. If information exists that suggests ethylene oxide could be present in equipment, the equipment is considered to be “in ethylene oxide service” unless sampling and analysis is performed as specified in § 63.2492 to demonstrate that the equipment does not meet the definition of being “in ethylene oxide service”. Examples of information that could suggest ethylene oxide could be present in equipment, include calculations based on safety data sheets, material balances, process stoichiometry, or previous test results provided the results are still relevant to the current operating conditions.
(2) For process vents, each batch and continuous process vent in a process that, when uncontrolled, contains a concentration of greater than or equal to 1 ppmv undiluted ethylene oxide, and when combined, the sum of all
these process vents would emit uncontrolled ethylene oxide emissions greater than or equal to 5 lb/yr (2.27 kg/yr). If information exists that suggests ethylene oxide could be present in a batch or continuous process vent, then the batch or continuous process vent is considered to be “in ethylene oxide service” unless an analysis is performed as specified in § 63.2492 to demonstrate that the batch or continuous process vent does not meet the definition of being “in ethylene oxide service”. Examples of information that could suggest ethylene oxide could be present in a batch or continuous process vent, include calculations based on safety data sheets, material balances, process stoichiometry, or previous test results provided the results are still relevant to the current operating conditions.
(3) For storage tanks, storage tanks of any capacity and vapor pressure storing a liquid that is at least 0.1 percent by weight of ethylene oxide. If knowledge exists that suggests ethylene oxide could be present in a storage tank, then the storage tank is considered to be “in ethylene oxide service” unless the procedures specified in § 63.2492 are performed to demonstrate that the storage tank does not meet the definition of being “in ethylene oxide service”. The exemptions for “vessels storing organic liquids that contain HAP only as impurities” and “pressure vessels designed to operate in excess of 204.9 kilopascals and without emissions to the atmosphere” listed in the definition of “storage tank” in this section do not apply for storage tanks that may be in ethylene oxide service. Examples of information that could suggest ethylene oxide could be present in a storage tank, include calculations based on safety data sheets, material balances, process stoichiometry, or previous test results provided the results are still relevant to the current operating conditions.

in excess of 204.9 kilopascals and without emissions to the atmosphere” listed in the definition of “storage tank” in this section do not apply for storage tanks that may be in ethylene oxide service. Examples of information that could suggest ethylene oxide could be present in a storage tank, include calculations based on safety data sheets, material balances, process stoichiometry, or previous test results provided the results are still relevant to the current operating conditions.
In organic HAP service
means that a piece of equipment either contains or contacts a fluid (liquid or gas) that is at least 5 percent by weight of total organic HAP as determined according to the provisions of § 63.180(d). The provisions of § 63.180(d) also specify how to determine that a piece of equipment is not in organic HAP service.
Isolated intermediate
means a product of a process that is stored before subsequent processing. An isolated intermediate is usually a product of a chemical synthesis, fermentation, or biological extraction process. Storage of an isolated intermediate marks the end of a process. Storage occurs at any time the intermediate is placed in equipment used solely for storage. The storage equipment is part of the MCPU that produces the isolated intermediate and is not assigned as specified in § 63.2435(d).
Large control device
means a control device that controls total HAP emissions of greater than or equal to 10 tpy, before control.
Loading rack
means a single system used to fill tank trucks and railcars at a single geographic site. Loading equipment and operations that are physically separate (
i.e.,
do not share common piping, valves, and other equipment) are considered to be separate loading racks.
Maintenance wastewater
means wastewater generated by the draining of process fluid from components in the MCPU into an individual drain system in preparation for or during maintenance activities. Maintenance wastewater can be generated during planned and unplanned shutdowns and during periods not associated with a shutdown. Examples of activities that can generate maintenance wastewater include descaling of heat exchanger tubing bundles, cleaning of distillation column traps, draining of pumps into an individual drain system, and draining of portions of the MCPU for repair. Wastewater from routine cleaning operations occurring as part of batch operations is not considered maintenance wastewater.
Maximum true vapor pressure
has the meaning given in § 63.111, except that it applies to all HAP rather than only organic HAP.
Miscellaneous organic chemical manufacturing process
means all equipment which collectively function to produce a product or isolated intermediate that are materials described in § 63.2435(b). For the purposes of this subpart, process includes any, all or a combination of reaction, recovery, separation, purification, or other activity, operation, manufacture, or treatment which are used to produce a product or isolated intermediate. A process is also defined by the following:
(1) Routine cleaning operations conducted as part of batch operations are considered part of the process;
(2) Each nondedicated solvent recovery operation is considered a single process;
(3) Each nondedicated formulation operation is considered a single process that is used to formulate numerous materials and/or products;
(4) Quality assurance/quality control laboratories are not considered part of any process; and
(5) Ancillary activities are not considered a process or part of any process.
(6) The end of a process that produces a solid material is either up to and including the dryer or extruder, or for a polymer production process without a dryer or extruder, it is up to and including the die plate or solid-state reactor, except in two cases. If the dryer, extruder, die plate, or solid-state reactor is followed by an operation that is designed and operated to remove HAP solvent or residual HAP monomer from the solid, then the solvent removal operation is the last step in the process. If the dried solid is diluted or mixed with a HAP-based solvent, then the solvent removal operation is the last step in the process.
Nondedicated solvent recovery operation
means a distillation unit or other purification equipment that receives used solvent from more than one MCPU.
Nonstandard batch
means a batch process that is operated outside of the range of operating conditions that are documented in an existing operating scenario but is still a reasonably anticipated event. For example, a nonstandard batch occurs when additional processing or processing at different operating conditions must be conducted to produce a product that is normally produced under the conditions described by the standard batch. A nonstandard batch may be necessary as a result of a malfunction, but it is not itself a malfunction.
On-site or on site
means, with respect to records required to be maintained by this subpart or required by another subpart referenced by this subpart, that records are stored at a location within a major source which encompasses the affected source. On-site includes, but is not limited to, storage at the affected source or MCPU to which the records pertain, or storage in central files elsewhere at the major source.
Operating scenario
means, for the purposes of reporting and recordkeeping, any specific operation of an MCPU as described by records specified in § 63.2525(b).
Organic group
means structures that contain primarily carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms.
Organic peroxides
means organic compounds containing the bivalent -o-o-structure which may be considered to be a structural derivative of hydrogen peroxide where one or both of the hydrogen atoms has been replaced by an organic radical.
Point of determination
means each point where process wastewater exits the MCPU or control device.

# Note to definition for point of determination:
The regulation allows determination of the characteristics of a wastewater stream: At the point of determination; or downstream of the point of determination if corrections are made for changes in flow rate and annual average concentration of soluble HAP and partially soluble HAP compounds as determined according to procedures in § 63.144 of subpart G in this part 63. Such changes include losses by air emissions; reduction of annual average concentration or changes in flow rate by mixing with other water or wastewater streams; and reduction in flow rate or annual average concentration by treating or otherwise handling the wastewater stream to remove or destroy HAP.
Predominant HAP
means as used in calibrating an analyzer, the single organic HAP that constitutes the largest percentage of the total organic HAP in the analyzed gas stream, by volume.
Pressure release
means the emission of materials resulting from the system pressure being greater than the set pressure of the pressure relief device. This release can be one release or a series of releases over a short time period.
Pressure relief device
means a valve, rupture disk, or similar device used only to release an unplanned, nonroutine discharge of gas from process equipment in order to avoid safety hazards or equipment damage. A pressure relief device discharge can result from an operator error, a malfunction such as a power failure or equipment failure, or other unexpected cause. Such devices include conventional, spring-actuated relief valves, balanced bellows relief valves, pilot-operated relief valves, rupture disks, and breaking, buckling, or shearing pin devices. Devices that are actuated either by a pressure of less than or equal to 2.5 pounds per square inch gauge or by a vacuum are not pressure relief devices.
Pressure vessel
means a storage vessel that is used to store liquids or gases and is designed not to vent to the atmosphere as a result of compression of the vapor headspace in the pressure vessel during filling of the pressure vessel to its design capacity.
Process condenser
means a condenser whose primary purpose is to recover material as an integral part of an MCPU. All condensers recovering condensate from an MCPU at or above the boiling point or all condensers in line prior to a vacuum source are considered process condensers. Typically, a primary condenser or condensers in series are considered to be integral to the MCPU if they are capable of and normally used for the purpose of recovering chemicals for fuel value (i.e., net positive heating value), use, reuse or for sale for fuel value, use, or reuse.
This definition does not apply to a condenser that is used to remove materials that would hinder performance of a downstream recovery device as follows:
(1) To remove water vapor that would cause icing in a downstream condenser, or
(2) To remove water vapor that would negatively affect the adsorption capacity of carbon in a downstream carbon adsorber, or
(3) To remove high molecular weight organic compounds or other organic compounds that would be difficult to remove during regeneration of a downstream carbon adsorber.
Process tank

For the purposes of this subpart, a safety device is not used for routine venting of gases or vapors from the vapor headspace underneath a cover such as during filling of the unit or to adjust the pressure in response to normal daily diurnal ambient temperature fluctuations. A safety device is designed to remain in a closed position during normal operations and open only when the internal pressure, or another relevant parameter, exceeds the device threshold setting applicable to the air emission control equipment as determined by the owner or operator based on manufacturer recommendations, applicable regulations, fire protection and prevention codes and practices, or other requirements for the safe handling of flammable, combustible, explosive, reactive, or hazardous materials.
Shutdown
means the cessation of operation of a continuous operation for any purpose. Shutdown also means the cessation of a batch operation, or any related individual piece of equipment required or used to comply with this subpart, if the steps taken to cease operation differ from those described in a standard batch or nonstandard batch. Shutdown also applies to emptying and degassing storage vessels. Shutdown
does not apply to cessation of batch operations at the end of a campaign or between batches within a campaign when the steps taken are routine operations.
Small control device
means a control device that controls total HAP emissions of less than 10 tpy, before control.
Standard batch

Emissions from a standard batch are based on the operating conditions that result in highest emissions. The standard batch defines the uncontrolled and controlled emissions for each emission episode defined under the operating scenario.
Startup
means the setting in operation of a continuous operation for any purpose; the first time a new or reconstructed batch operation begins production; for new equipment added, including equipment required or used to comply with this subpart, the first time the equipment is put into operation; or for the introduction of a new product/process, the first time the product or process is run in equipment. For batch operations, startup applies to the first time the equipment is put into operation at the start of a campaign to produce a product that has been produced in the past if the steps taken to begin production differ from those specified in a standard batch or nonstandard batch. Startup does not apply when the equipment is put into operation as part of a batch within a campaign when the steps taken are routine operations.

(2) Pressure vessels designed to operate in excess of 204.9 kilopascals and without emissions to the atmosphere;
(3) Vessels storing organic liquids that contain HAP only as impurities;
(4) Wastewater storage tanks;
(5) Bottoms receivers;
(6) Surge control vessels; and
(7) Process tanks.
Supplemental gases
means the air that is added to a vent stream after the vent stream leaves the unit operation. Air that is part of the vent stream as a result of the nature of the unit operation is not considered supplemental gases. Air required to operate combustion device burner(s) is not considered supplemental gases.
Surge control vessel
means feed drums, recycle drums, and intermediate vessels as part of any continuous operation. Surge control vessels are used within an MCPU when in-process storage, mixing, or management of flowrates or volumes is needed to introduce material into continuous operations.
Thermal expansion relief valve
means a pressure relief valve designed to protect equipment from excess pressure due to thermal expansion of blocked liquid-filled equipment or piping due to ambient heating or heat from a heat tracing system. Pressure relief valves designed to protect equipment from excess pressure due to blockage against a pump or compressor or due to fire contingency are not thermal expansion relief valves.
Total organic compounds or (TOC)
means the total gaseous organic compounds (minus methane and ethane) in a vent stream.
Transfer rack
means the collection of loading arms and loading hoses, at a single loading rack, that are assigned to an MCPU according to the procedures specified in § 63.2435(d) and are used to fill tank trucks and/or rail cars with organic liquids that contain one or more of the organic HAP listed in section 112(b) of the CAA of this subpart. Transfer rack includes the associated pumps, meters, shutoff valves, relief valves, and other piping and valves.
Unit operation
means those processing steps that occur within distinct equipment that are used, among other things, to prepare reactants, facilitate reactions, separate and purify products, and recycle materials.

# Subpart GGGG—National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants: Solvent Extraction for Vegetable Oil Production

# Source:
66 FR 19011, Apr. 12, 2001, unless otherwise noted.

# What This Subpart Covers
§ 63.2830
What is the purpose of this subpart?
This subpart establishes national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants (NESHAP) for emissions during vegetable oil production. This subpart limits hazardous air pollutant (HAP) emissions from specified vegetable oil production processes. This subpart also establishes requirements to demonstrate initial and continuous compliance with the emission standards.
§ 63.2831
Where can I find definitions of key words used in this subpart?
You can find definitions of key words used in this subpart in § 63.2872.
§ 63.2832
Am I subject to this subpart?
(a) You are an affected source subject to this subpart if you meet all of the criteria listed in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section:
(1) You own or operate a vegetable oil production process that is a major source of HAP emissions or is collocated within a plant site with other sources that are individually or collectively a major source of HAP emissions.
(i) A
vegetable oil production process
is defined in § 63.2872. In general, it is the collection of continuous process equipment and activities that produce crude vegetable oil and meal products by removing oil from oilseeds listed in Table 1 to § 63.2840 through direct contact with an organic solvent, such as a hexane isomer blend.
(ii) A major source of HAP emissions is a plant site that emits or has the potential to emit any single HAP at a rate of 10 tons (9.07 megagrams) or more per year or any combination of HAP at a rate of 25 tons (22.68 megagrams) or more per year.
(2) Your vegetable oil production process processes any combination of eight types of oilseeds listed in paragraphs (a)(2)(i) through (viii) of this section:
(i) Corn germ;
(ii) Cottonseed;
(iii) Flax;
(iv) Peanut;
(v) Rapeseed (for example, canola);
(vi) Safflower;
(vii) Soybean; and
(viii) Sunflower.
(b) You are not subject to this subpart if your vegetable oil production process meets any of the criteria listed in paragraphs (b)(1) through (4) of this section:
(1) It uses only mechanical extraction techniques that use no organic solvent to remove oil from a listed oilseed.
(2) It uses only batch solvent extraction and batch desolventizing equipment.
(3) It processes only agricultural products that are not listed oilseeds as defined in § 63.2872.
(4) It functions only as a research and development facility and is not a major source.
(c) As listed in § 63.1(c)(5) of the General Provisions, if your HAP emissions increase such that you become a major source, then you are subject to all of the requirements of this subpart.
§ 63.2833
Is my source categorized as existing or new?
(a) This subpart applies to each existing and new affected source. You must categorize your vegetable oil production process as either an existing or a new source in accordance with the criteria in Table 1 of this section, as follows:
Table 1 to § 63.2833—Categorizing Your Source as Existing or New
If your affected source. . .
And if. . .
Then your affected source. . .
(1) was constructed or began construction before May 26, 2000
reconstruction has not occurred
is an existing source.
(2) began reconstruction, as defined in § 63.2, on or after May 26, 2000
(i) reconstruction was part of a scheduled plan to comply with the existing source requirements of this subpart; and
(ii) reconstruction was completed no later than 3 years after the effective date of this subpart
remains an existing source.
(3) began a significant modification, as defined in § 63.2872, at any time on an existing source
the modification does not constitute reconstruction
remains an existing source.
(4) began a significant modification, as defined in § 63.2872, at any time on a new source
the modification does not constitute reconstruction
remains a new source.
(5) began reconstruction on or after May 26, 2000
reconstruction was completed later than 3 years after the effective date of this subpart
is a new source
(6) began construction on or after May 26, 2000
is a new source.
(b)
Reconstruction of a source.
Any affected source is reconstructed if components are replaced so that the criteria in the definition of
reconstruction
in § 63.2 are satisfied. In general, a vegetable oil production process is reconstructed if the fixed capital cost of the new components exceeds 50 percent of the fixed capital cost for constructing a new vegetable oil production process, and it is technically and economically feasible for the reconstructed source to meet the relevant new source requirements of this subpart. The effect of reconstruction on the categorization of your existing and new affected source is described in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section:
(1) After reconstruction of an existing source, the affected source is recategorized as a new source and becomes subject to the new source requirements of this subpart.
(2) After reconstruction of a new source, the affected source remains categorized as a new source and remains subject to the new source requirements of this subpart.
(c)
Significant modification of a source.
A significant modification to an affected source is a term specific to this subpart and is defined in § 63.2872.
(1) In general, a significant modification to your source consists of adding new equipment or the modification of existing equipment within the affected source that significantly affects solvent losses from the affected source. Examples include adding or replacing extractors, desolventizer-toasters (conventional and specialty), and meal dryer-coolers. All other significant modifications must meet the criteria listed in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section:
(i) The fixed capital cost of the modification represents a significant percentage of the fixed capital cost of building a comparable new vegetable oil production process.
(ii) It does not constitute reconstruction as defined in § 63.2.
(2) A significant modification has no effect on the categorization of your source as existing and new. An existing source remains categorized as an existing source and subject to the existing source requirements of this subpart. A new source remains categorized as a new source and subject to the new source requirements of this subpart.
(d) Changes in the type of oilseed processed by your affected source does not affect the categorization of your source as new or existing. Recategorizing an affected source from existing to new occurs only when you add or modify process equipment within the source which meets the definition of
reconstruction.
§ 63.2834
When do I have to comply with the standards in this subpart?
You must comply with this subpart in accordance with one of the schedules in Table 1 of this section, as follows:

# Standards
§ 63.2840
What emission requirements must I meet?
For each facility meeting the applicability criteria in § 63.2832, you must comply with either the requirements specified in paragraphs (a) through (d), or the requirements in paragraph (e) of this section. You must also comply with the requirements in paragraph (g) of this section. You must comply with the work practice standard provided in paragraph (h) of this section, if you choose to operate your source under an initial startup period subject to § 63.2850(c)(2) or (d)(2).
(a)(1) The emission requirements limit the number of gallons of HAP lost per ton of listed oilseeds processed. For each operating month, as defined in § 63.2872, you must calculate a compliance ratio which compares your actual HAP loss to your allowable HAP loss for the previous 12 operating months as shown in Equation 1 of this section. Equation 1 of this section follows:
ER12AP01.001
(2) Equation 1 of this section can also be expressed as a function of total solvent loss as shown in Equation 2 of this section. Equation 2 of this section follows:
ER12AP01.002
Where:
f = The weighted average volume fraction of HAP in solvent received during the previous 12 operating months, as determined in § 63.2854, dimensionless.
0.64 = The average volume fraction of HAP in solvent in the baseline performance data, dimensionless.
Actual Solvent Loss = Gallons of actual solvent loss during previous 12 operating months, as determined in § 63.2853.
Oilseed = Tons of each oilseed type “i” processed during the previous 12 operating months, as shown in § 63.2855.
SLF = The corresponding solvent loss factor (gal/ton) for oilseed “i” listed in Table 1 of this section, as follows:

(b) When your source has processed listed oilseed for 12 operating months, calculate the compliance ratio by the end of each calendar month following an operating month, as defined in § 63.2872, using Equation 2 of this section. When calculating your compliance ratio, consider the conditions and exclusions in paragraphs (b)(1) through (6) of this section:
(1) [Reserved]
(2) The 12-month compliance ratio may include operating months occurring prior to a source shutdown and operating months that follow after the source resumes operation.
(3) If your source shuts down and processes no listed oilseed for an entire calendar or accounting month, then you must categorize the month as a nonoperating month, as defined in § 63.2872. Exclude any nonoperating months from the compliance ratio determination.
(4) If your source is subject to an initial startup period as defined in § 63.2872, you may exclude from the compliance ratio determination any solvent and oilseed information recorded for the initial startup period, provided you meet the work practice standard in § 63.2850(c)(2) or (d)(2).
(5) Before September 15, 2020, if your source is subject to a malfunction period as defined in § 63.2872, exclude from the compliance ratio determination any solvent and oilseed information recorded for the malfunction period. The provisions of this paragraph (e) do not apply on and after September 15, 2020.
(6) For sources processing cottonseed or specialty soybean, the solvent loss factor you use to determine the compliance ratio may change each operating month depending on the tons of oilseed processed during all normal operating periods in a 12 operating month period.
(c) If the compliance ratio is less than or equal to 1.00, your source was in compliance with the HAP emission requirements for the previous operating month.
(d) To determine the compliance ratio in Equation 2 of this section, you must select the appropriate oilseed solvent loss factor from Table 1 of this section. First, determine whether your source is new or existing using Table 1 of § 63.2833. Then, under the appropriate existing or new source column, select the oilseed solvent loss factor that corresponds to each type oilseed or process operation for each operating month.
(e)
Low-HAP solvent option.
For all vegetable oil production processes subject to this subpart, you must exclusively use solvent where the volume fraction of each HAP comprises 1 percent or less by volume of the solvent (low-HAP solvent) in each delivery, and you must meet the requirements in paragraphs (e)(1) through (5) of this section. Your vegetable oil production process is not subject to the requirements in §§ 63.2850 through 63.2870 unless specifically referenced in paragraphs (e)(1) through (5) of this section.
(1) You shall determine the HAP content of your solvent in accordance with the specifications in § 63.2854(b)(1).
(2) You shall maintain documentation of the HAP content determination for each delivery of the solvent at the facility at all times.
(3) You must submit an initial notification for existing sources in accordance with § 63.2860(a).
(4) You must submit an initial notification for new and reconstructed sources in accordance with § 63.2860(b).
(5) You must submit an annual compliance certification in accordance with § 63.2861(a). The certification should only include the information required under § 63.2861(a)(1) and (2), and a certification indicating whether the source complied with all of the requirements in paragraph (e) of this section.
(f) You may change compliance options for your source if you submit a notice to the Administrator at least 60 days prior to changing compliance options. If your source changes from the low-HAP solvent option to the compliance ratio determination option, you must determine the compliance ratio for the most recent 12 operating months beginning with the first month after changing compliance options.
(g) On or after September 15, 2020, you must operate and maintain any affected source, including associated air pollution control equipment and monitoring equipment, at all times in a manner consistent with safety and good air pollution control practices for minimizing emissions. The general duty to minimize emissions does not require you to make any further efforts to reduce emissions if levels required by the applicable standard have been achieved. Determination of whether a source is operating in compliance with operation and maintenance requirements will be based on information available to the Administrator which may include, but is not limited to, monitoring results, review of operation and maintenance procedures, review of operation and maintenance records, and inspection of the source.
(h) On and after September 15, 2020, you must meet the requirements in paragraphs (h)(1) through (3) of this section if you choose to operate your source under an initial startup period subject to § 63.2850(c)(2) or (d)(2).
(1) You must operate the mineral oil absorption system at all times during the initial startup period unless doing so is not possible due to safety considerations;
(2) You must operate the solvent condensers at all times during the initial startup period unless doing so is not
possible due to safety considerations; and
(3) You must follow site-specific operating limits, established according to the requirements in paragraphs (h)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section, for temperature and pressure for the desolventizing and oil distillation units associated with solvent recovery at all times, unless doing so is not possible due to safety considerations.
(i) Your site-specific operating limits may be based on equipment design, manufacturer's recommendations, or other site-specific operating values established for normal operating periods.
(ii) The operating limits may be in the form of a minimum, maximum, or operating range.

(e)
Existing or new sources experiencing a malfunction.
A
malfunction
is defined in § 63.2. In general, it means any sudden, infrequent, and not reasonably preventable failure of air pollution control equipment, process equipment, or a process to function in a normal or usual manner. If your existing or new source experiences an unscheduled shutdown as a result of a malfunction, continues to operate during a malfunction (including the period reasonably necessary to correct the malfunction), or starts up after a shutdown resulting from a malfunction, then you must meet the requirements associated with one of two compliance options. Routine or scheduled process startups and shutdowns resulting from, but not limited to, market demands, maintenance activities, and switching types of oilseed processed, are not startups or shutdowns resulting from a malfunction and, therefore, do not qualify for this provision. Within 15 days of the beginning date of the malfunction, you must choose to comply with one of the options listed in paragraphs (e)(1) and (2) of this section. The provisions of this paragraph (e) do not apply on and after September 15, 2020.

§ 63.2851
What is a plan for demonstrating compliance?
(a) You must develop and implement a written plan for demonstrating compliance that provides the detailed procedures you will follow to monitor and record data necessary for demonstrating compliance with this subpart. Procedures followed for quantifying solvent loss from the source and amount of oilseed processed vary from source to source because of site-specific factors such as equipment design characteristics and operating conditions. Typical procedures include one or more accurate measurement methods such as weigh scales, volumetric displacement, and material mass balances. Because the industry does not have a uniform set of procedures, you
must develop and implement your own site-specific plan for demonstrating compliance before the compliance date for your source. You must also incorporate the plan for demonstrating compliance by reference in the source's title V permit and keep the plan on-site and readily available as long as the source is operational. If you make any changes to the plan for demonstrating compliance, then you must keep all previous versions of the plan and make them readily available for inspection for at least 5 years after each revision. The plan for demonstrating compliance must include the items in paragraphs (a)(1) through (8) of this section:
(1) The name and address of the owner or operator.
(2) The physical address of the vegetable oil production process.
(3) A detailed description of all methods of measurement your source will use to determine your solvent losses, HAP content of solvent, and the tons of each type of oilseed processed.
(4) When each measurement will be made.
(5) Examples of each calculation you will use to determine your compliance status. Include examples of how you will convert data measured with one parameter to other terms for use in compliance determination.
(6) Example logs of how data will be recorded.
(7) A plan to ensure that the data continue to meet compliance demonstration needs.
(8) On and after September 15, 2020, if you choose to operate your source under an initial start-up period subject to § 63.2850(c)(2) or (d)(2), the items in paragraphs (c)(8)(i) and (ii) of this section:
(i) Your site-specific operating limits, and their basis, for temperature and pressure for the desolventizing and oil distillation units associated with solvent recovery.
(ii) A detailed description of all methods of measurement your source will use to measure temperature and pressure, including the measurement frequency.
(b) The responsible agency of these NESHAP may require you to revise your plan for demonstrating compliance. The responsible agency may require reasonable revisions if the procedures lack detail, are inconsistent or do not accurately determine solvent loss, HAP content of the solvent, or the tons of oilseed processed.
[66 FR 19011, Apr. 12, 2001, as amended at 85 FR 15629, Mar. 18, 2020]
§ 63.2852
What is a startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan?
Before September 15, 2020, you must develop a written SSM plan in accordance with § 63.6(e)(3). You must complete the SSM plan before the compliance date for your source. You must also keep the SSM plan on-site and readily available as long as the source is operational. The SSM plan provides detailed procedures for operating and maintaining your source to minimize emissions during a qualifying SSM event for which the source chooses the § 63.2850(e)(2) malfunction period, or the § 63.2850(c)(2) or (d)(2) initial startup period. The SSM plan must specify a program of corrective action for malfunctioning process and air pollution control equipment and reflect the best practices now in use by the industry to minimize emissions. Some or all of the procedures may come from plans you developed for other purposes such as a Standard Operating Procedure manual or an Occupational Safety and Health Administration Process Safety Management plan. To qualify as a SSM plan, other such plans must meet all the applicable requirements of these NESHAP. The provisions of this section do not apply on and after September 15, 2020.
[85 FR 15629, Mar. 18, 2020]
§ 63.2853
How do I determine the actual solvent loss?
By the end of each calendar month following an operating month, you must determine the total solvent loss in gallons for the previous operating month. The total solvent loss for an operating month includes all solvent losses that occur during normal operating periods within the operating month. If you have determined solvent losses for 12 or more operating months, then you must also determine the 12 operating months rolling sum of actual solvent loss in gallons by summing the
monthly actual solvent loss for the previous 12 operating months. The 12 operating months rolling sum of solvent loss is the “actual solvent loss,” which is used to calculate your compliance ratio as described in § 63.2840.
(a) To determine the actual solvent loss from your source, follow the procedures in your plan for demonstrating compliance to determine the items in paragraphs (a)(1) through (7) of this section:
(1)
The dates that define each operating status period during a calendar month.
The dates that define each operating status period include the beginning date of each calendar month and the date of any change in the source operating status. If the source maintains the same operating status during an entire calendar month, these dates are the beginning and ending dates of the calendar month. If, prior to the effective date of this rule, your source determines the solvent loss on an
accounting month,
as defined in § 63.2872, rather than a calendar month basis, and you have 12 complete accounting months of approximately equal duration in a calendar year, you may substitute the accounting month time interval for the calendar month time interval. If you choose to use an accounting month rather than a calendar month, you must document this measurement frequency selection in your plan for demonstrating compliance, and you must remain on this schedule unless you request and receive written approval from the agency responsible for these NESHAP.
(2)
Source operating status.
You must categorize the operating status of your source for each recorded time interval in accordance with criteria in Table 1 or Table 2 of this section, as follows:
Table 1 of § 63.2853(
a
)(2)—Categorizing Your Source Operating Status Before September 15, 2020
If during a recorded time interval . . .
then your source operating status is . . .
(i) Your source processes any amount of listed oilseed and source is not operating under an initial startup operating period or a malfunction period subject to § 63.2850(c)(2), (d)(2), or (e)(2)
A normal operating period.
(ii) Your source processes no agricultural product and your source is not operating under an initial startup period or malfunction period subject to § 63.2850(c)(2), (d)(2), or (e)(2)
A nonoperating period.
(iii) You choose to operate your source under an initial startup period subject to § 63.2850(c)(2) or (d)(2)
An initial startup period.
(iv) You choose to operate your source under a malfunction period subject to § 63.2850(e)(2)
A malfunction period.
(v) Your source processes agricultural products not defined as listed oilseed
An exempt period.

If during a recorded time interval . . .
Then your source operating status is . . .
(vi) Your source processes any amount of listed oilseed and source is not operating under an initial startup operating period subject to § 63.2850(c)(2) or (d)(2)
A normal operating period.
(vii) Your source processes no agricultural product and your source is not operating under an initial startup period subject to § 63.2850(c)(2) or (d)(2)
A nonoperating period.
(viii) You choose to operate your source under an initial startup period subject to § 63.2850(c)(2) or (d)(2)
An initial startup period.
(ix) Your source processes agricultural products not defined as listed oilseed
An exempt period.
(3)
Measuring the beginning and ending solvent inventory.
You are required to measure and record the solvent inventory on the beginning and ending dates of each normal operating period that occurs during an operating month. You must consistently follow the procedures described in your plan for demonstrating compliance, as specified in § 63.2851, to determine the extraction
solvent inventory, and maintain readily available records of the actual solvent loss inventory, as described in § 63.2862(c)(1). In general, you must measure and record the solvent inventory only when the source is actively processing any type of agricultural product. When the source is not active, some or all of the solvent working capacity is transferred to solvent storage tanks which can artificially inflate the solvent inventory.
(4)
Gallons of extraction solvent received.
Record the total gallons of extraction solvent received in each shipment. For most processes, the gallons of solvent received represents purchases of delivered solvent added to the solvent storage inventory. However, if your process refines additional vegetable oil from off-site sources, recovers solvent from the off-site oil, and adds it to the on-site solvent inventory, then you must determine the quantity of recovered solvent and include it in the gallons of extraction solvent received.
(5)
Solvent inventory adjustments.
In some situations, solvent losses determined directly from the measured solvent inventory and quantity of solvent received is not an accurate estimate of the “actual solvent loss” for use in determining compliance ratios. In such cases, you may adjust the total solvent loss for each normal operating period as long as you provide a reasonable justification for the adjustment. Situations that may require adjustments of the total solvent loss include, but are not limited to, situations in paragraphs (a)(5)(i) and (ii) of this section:
(i)
Solvent destroyed in a control device.
You may use a control device to reduce solvent emissions to meet the emission standard. The use of a control device does not alter the emission limit for the source. If you use a control device that reduces solvent emissions through destruction of the solvent instead of recovery, then determine the gallons of solvent that enter the control device and are destroyed there during each normal operating period. All solvent destroyed in a control device during a normal operating period can be subtracted from the total solvent loss. Examples of destructive emission control devices include catalytic incinerators, boilers, or flares. Identify and describe, in your plan for demonstrating compliance, each type of reasonable and sound measurement method that you use to quantify the gallons of solvent entering and exiting the control device and to determine the destruction efficiency of the control device. You may use design evaluations to document the gallons of solvent destroyed or removed by the control device instead of performance testing under § 63.7. The design evaluations must be based on the procedures and options described in § 63.985(b)(1)(i)(A) through (C) or § 63.11, as appropriate. All data, assumptions, and procedures used in such evaluations must be documented and available for inspection. If you use performance testing to determine solvent flow rate to the control device or destruction efficiency of the device, follow the procedures as outlined in § 63.997(e)(1) and (2) and the requirements in paragraph (a)(5)(i)(A) of this section. Instead of periodic performance testing to demonstrate continued good operation of the control device, you may develop a monitoring plan, following the procedures outlined in § 63.988(c) and using operational parametric measurement devices such as fan parameters, percent measurements of lower explosive limits, and combustion temperature.
(A) On or after September 15, 2020, you must conduct all performance tests under such conditions as the Administrator specifies to you based on representative performance of the affected source for the period being tested. Representative conditions exclude periods of startup and shutdown unless specified by the Administrator. You may not conduct performance tests during periods of malfunction. You must record the process information that is necessary to document operating conditions during the test and include in such record an explanation to support that such conditions represent normal operation. Upon request, you shall make available to the Administrator such records as may be necessary to determine the conditions of performance tests.
(B) [Reserved]
(ii) Changes in solvent working capacity. In records you keep on-site,
document any process modifications resulting in changes to the solvent working capacity in your vegetable oil production process.
Solvent working capacity
is defined in § 63.2872. In general, solvent working capacity is the volume of solvent normally retained in solvent recovery equipment such as the extractor, desolventizer-toaster, solvent storage, working tanks, mineral oil absorber, condensers, and oil/solvent distillation system. If the change occurs during a normal operating period, you must determine the difference in working solvent volume and make a one-time documented adjustment to the solvent inventory.
(b) Use Equation 1 of this section to determine the actual solvent loss occurring from your affected source for all normal operating periods recorded within a calendar month. Equation 1 of this section follows:
ER12AP01.003
Where:
SOLV
B
= Gallons of solvent in the inventory at the beginning of normal operating period “i” as determined in paragraph (a)(3) of this section.
SOLV
E
= Gallons of solvent in the inventory at the end of normal operating period “i” as determined in paragraph (a)(3) of this section.
SOLV
R
= Gallons of solvent received between the beginning and ending inventory dates of normal operating period “i” as determined in paragraph (a)(4) of this section.
SOLV
A
= Gallons of solvent added or removed from the extraction solvent inventory during normal operating period “i” as determined in paragraph (a)(5) of this section.
n = Number of normal operating periods in a calendar month.
(c) The actual solvent loss is the total solvent losses during normal operating periods for the previous 12 operating months. You determine your actual solvent loss by summing the monthly actual solvent losses for the previous 12 operating months. You must record the actual solvent loss by the end of each calendar month following an operating month. Use the actual solvent loss in Equation 2 of § 63.2840 to determine the compliance ratio. Actual solvent loss does not include losses that occur during operating status periods listed in paragraphs (c)(1) through (4) of this section. If any one of these four operating status periods span an entire month, then the month is treated as nonoperating and there is no compliance ratio determination.
(1) Nonoperating periods as described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
(2) Initial startup periods as described in § 63.2850(c)(2) or (d)(2).
(3) Before September 15, 2020, malfunction periods as described in § 63.2850(e)(2).
(4) Exempt operation periods as described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.

(a) This section describes the information and procedures you must use to determine the weighted average volume fraction of HAP in extraction solvent received for use in your vegetable oil production process. By the end of each calendar month following an operating month, determine the weighted average volume fraction of HAP in extraction solvent received since the end of the previous operating month. If you have determined the monthly weighted average volume fraction of HAP in solvent received for 12 or more operating months, then also determine an overall weighted average volume fraction of HAP in solvent received for the previous 12 operating months. Use the volume fraction of HAP determined as a 12 operating months weighted average in
Equation 2 of § 63.2840 to determine the compliance ratio.
(b) To determine the volume fraction of HAP in the extraction solvent determined as a 12 operating months weighted average, you must comply with paragraphs (b)(1) through (3) of this section:
(1) Record the volume fraction of each HAP comprising more than 1 percent by volume of the solvent in each delivery of solvent, including solvent recovered from off-site oil. To determine the HAP content of the material in each delivery of solvent, the reference method is EPA Method 311 of appendix A of this part. You may use EPA Method 311, an approved alternative method, or any other reasonable means for determining the HAP content. Other reasonable means of determining HAP content include, but are not limited to, a material safety data sheet or a manufacturer's certificate of analysis. A certificate of analysis is a legal and binding document provided by a solvent manufacturer. The purpose of a certificate of analysis is to list the test methods and analytical results that determine chemical properties of the solvent and the volume percentage of all HAP components present in the solvent at quantities greater than 1 percent by volume. You are not required to test the materials that you use, but the Administrator may require a test using EPA Method 311 (or an approved alternative method) to confirm the reported HAP content. However, if the results of an analysis by EPA Method 311 are different from the HAP content determined by another means, the EPA Method 311 results will govern compliance determinations.
(2) Determine the weighted average volume fraction of HAP in the extraction solvent each operating month. The weighted average volume fraction of HAP for an operating month includes all solvent received since the end of the last operating month, regardless of the operating status at the time of the delivery. Determine the monthly weighted average volume fraction of HAP by summing the products of the HAP volume fraction of each delivery and the volume of each delivery and dividing the sum by the total volume of all deliveries as expressed in Equation 1 of this section. Record the result by the end of each calendar month following an operating month. Equation 1 of this section follows:
ER12AP01.004
Where:
Received
i
= Gallons of extraction solvent received in delivery “i.”
Content
i
= The volume fraction of HAP in extraction solvent delivery “i.”
Total Received = Total gallons of extraction solvent received since the end of the previous operating month.
n = Number of extraction solvent deliveries since the end of the previous operating month.
(3) Determine the volume fraction of HAP in your extraction solvent as a 12 operating months weighted average. When your source has processed oilseed for 12 operating months, sum the products of the monthly weighted average HAP volume fraction and corresponding volume of solvent received, and divide the sum by the total volume of solvent received for the 12 operating months, as expressed by Equation 2 of this section. Record the result by the end of each calendar month following an operating month and use it in Equation 2 of § 63.2840 to determine the compliance ratio. Equation 2 of this section follows:
ER12AP01.005
Where:
Received
i
= Gallons of extraction solvent received in operating month “i” as determined in accordance with § 63.2853(a)(4).
Content
i
= Average volume fraction of HAP in extraction solvent received in operating month “i” as determined in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
Total Received = Total gallons of extraction solvent received during the previous 12 operating months.
§ 63.2855
How do I determine the quantity of oilseed processed?
All oilseed measurements must be determined on an
as received
basis, as defined in § 63.2872. The as received basis refers to the oilseed chemical and physical characteristics as initially received by the source and prior to any oilseed handling and processing. By the end of each calendar month following an operating month, you must determine the tons as received of each listed oilseed processed for the operating month. The total oilseed processed for an operating month includes the total of each oilseed processed during all normal operating periods that occur within the operating month. If you have determined the tons of oilseed processed for 12 or more operating months, then you must also determine the 12 operating months rolling sum of each type oilseed processed by summing the tons of each type of oilseed processed for the previous 12 operating months. The 12 operating months rolling sum of each type of oilseed processed is used to calculate the compliance ratio as described in § 63.2840.
(a) To determine the tons as received of each type of oilseed processed at your source, follow the procedures in your plan for demonstrating compliance to determine the items in paragraphs (a)(1) through (5) of this section:
(1)
The dates that define each operating status period.
The dates that define each operating status period include the beginning date of each calendar month and the date of any change in the source operating status. If, prior to the effective date of this rule, your source determines the oilseed inventory on an accounting month rather than a calendar month basis, and you have 12 complete accounting months of approximately equal duration in a calendar year, you may substitute the accounting month time interval for the calendar month time interval. If you choose to use an accounting month rather than a calendar month, you must document this measurement frequency selection in your plan for demonstrating compliance, and you must remain on this schedule unless you request and receive written approval from the agency responsible for these NESHAP. The dates on each oilseed inventory log must be consistent with the dates recorded for the solvent inventory.
(2)
Source operating status.
You must categorize the source operation for each recorded time interval. The source operating status for each time interval recorded on the oilseed inventory for each type of oilseed must be consistent with the operating status recorded on the solvent inventory logs as described in § 63.2853(a)(2).
(3)
Measuring the beginning and ending inventory for each oilseed.
You are required to measure and record the oilseed inventory on the beginning and ending dates of each normal operating period that occurs during an operating month. You must consistently follow the procedures described in your plan for demonstrating compliance, as specified in § 63.2851, to determine the oilseed inventory on an as received basis and maintain readily available records of the oilseed inventory as described by § 63.2862(c)(3).
(4)
Tons of each oilseed received.
Record the type of oilseed and tons of each shipment of oilseed received and added to your on-site storage.
(5)
Oilseed inventory adjustments.
In some situations, determining the quantity of oilseed processed directly from the measured oilseed inventory and quantity of oilseed received is not an accurate estimate of the tons of oilseed processed for use in determining compliance ratios. For example, spoiled and molded oilseed removed from storage but not processed by your source will result in an overestimate of the quantity of oilseed processed. In such cases, you must adjust the oilseed inventory and provide a justification for the adjustment. Situations that may require oilseed inventory adjustments include, but are not limited to, the situations listed in paragraphs (a)(5)(i) through (v) of this section:
(i) Oilseed that molds or otherwise become unsuitable for processing.
(ii) Oilseed you sell before it enters the processing operation.
(iii) Oilseed destroyed by an event such as a process malfunction, fire, or natural disaster.
(iv) Oilseed processed through operations prior to solvent extraction such as screening, dehulling, cracking, drying, and conditioning; but that are not routed to the solvent extractor for further processing.
(v) Periodic physical measurements of inventory. For example, some sources periodically empty oilseed storage silos to physically measure the current oilseed inventory. This periodic measurement procedure typically results in a small inventory correction. The correction factor, usually less than 1 percent, may be used to make an adjustment to the source's oilseed inventory that was estimated previously with indirect measurement techniques. To make this adjustment, your plan for demonstrating compliance must provide for such an adjustment.
(b) Use Equation 1 of this section to determine the quantity of each oilseed type processed at your affected source during normal operating periods recorded within a calendar month. Equation 1 of this section follows:
ER12AP01.000
Where:
SEED
B
= Tons of oilseed in the inventory at the beginning of normal operating period “i” as determined in accordance with paragraph (a)(3) of this section.
SEED
E
= Tons of oilseed in the inventory at the end of normal operating period “i” as determined in accordance with paragraph (a)(3) of this section.
SEED
R
= Tons of oilseed received during normal operating period “i” as determined in accordance with paragraph (a)(4) of this section.
SEED
A
= Tons of oilseed added or removed from the oilseed inventory during normal operating period “i” as determined in accordance with paragraph (a)(5) of this section.
n = Number of normal operating periods in the calendar month during which this type oilseed was processed.
(c) The quantity of each oilseed processed is the total tons of each type of listed oilseed processed during normal operating periods in the previous 12 operating months. You determine the tons of each oilseed processed by summing the monthly quantity of each oilseed processed for the previous 12 operating months. You must record the 12 operating months quantity of each type of oilseed processed by the end of each calendar month following an operating month. Use the 12 operating months quantity of each type of oilseed processed to determine the compliance ratio as described in § 63.2840. The quantity of oilseed processed does not include oilseed processed during the operating status periods in paragraphs (c)(1) through (4) of this section:
(1) Nonoperating periods as described in § 63.2853 (a)(2)(ii).
(2) Initial startup periods as described in § 63.2850(c)(2) or (d)(2).
(3) Before September 15, 2020, malfunction periods as described in § 63.2850(e)(2).
(4) Exempt operation periods as described in § 63.2853 (a)(2)(v).
(5) If any one of these four operating status periods span an entire calendar month, then the calendar month is treated as a nonoperating month and there is no compliance ratio determination.

(b)
Initial notifications for new and reconstructed sources.
New or reconstructed sources must submit a series of notifications before, during, and after source construction per the schedule listed in § 63.9. The information requirements for the notifications are the same as those listed in the General Provisions with the exceptions listed in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section:
(1) The application for approval of construction does not require the specific HAP emission data required in § 63.5(d)(1)(ii)(H) and (iii), (d)(2) and (d)(3)(ii). The application for approval of construction would include, instead, a brief description of the source including the types of listed oilseeds processed, nominal operating capacity, and type of desolventizer(s) used.
(2) The notification of actual startup date must also include whether you have elected to operate under an initial startup period subject to § 63.2850(c)(2) and provide an estimate and justification for the anticipated duration of the initial startup period.
(c)
Significant modification notifications.
Any existing or new source that plans to undergo a significant modification as defined in § 63.2872 must submit two reports as described in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section:
(1) Initial notification. You must submit an initial notification to the agency responsible for these NESHAP 30 days prior to initial startup of the significantly modified source. The initial notification must demonstrate that the proposed changes qualify as a significant modification. The initial notification must include the items in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section:
(i) The expected startup date of the modified source.
(ii) A description of the significant modification including a list of the equipment that will be replaced or modified. If the significant modification involves changes other than adding or replacing extractors, desolventizer-toasters (conventional and specialty), and meal dryer-coolers, then you must also include the fixed capital cost of the new components, expressed as a percentage of the fixed capital cost to build a comparable new vegetable oil production process; supporting documentation for the cost estimate; and documentation that the proposed changes will significantly affect solvent losses.
(2) Notification of actual startup. You must submit a notification of actual startup date within 15 days after initial startup of the modified source. The notification must include the items in paragraphs (c)(2)(i) through (iv) of this section:

(d)
Notification of compliance status.
As an existing, new, or reconstructed source, you must submit a notification of compliance status report to the responsible agency no later than 60 days after determining your initial 12 operating months compliance ratio. If you are an existing source, you generally must submit this notification no later than 50 calendar months after the effective date of these NESHAP (36 calendar months for compliance, 12 operating months to record data, and 2 calendar months to complete the report). If you are a new or reconstructed source, the notification of compliance status is generally due no later than 20 calendar months after initial startup (6 calendar months for the initial startup period, 12 operating months to record data, and 2 calendar months to complete the report). The notification of compliance status must contain the items in paragraphs (d)(1) through (6) of this section:
(1) The name and address of the owner or operator.
(2) The physical address of the vegetable oil production process.
(3) Each listed oilseed type processed during the previous 12 operating months.
(4) Each HAP identified under § 63.2854(a) as being present in concentrations greater than 1 percent by volume in each delivery of solvent received during the 12 operating months period used for the initial compliance determination.
(5) A statement designating the source as a major source of HAP or a demonstration that the source qualifies as an area source. An area source is a source that is not a major source and is not collocated within a plant site with other sources that are individually or collectively a major source.
(6) A compliance certification indicating whether the source complied with all of the requirements of this subpart throughout the 12 operating months used for the initial source compliance determination. This certification must include a certification of the items in paragraphs (d)(6)(i) through (iii) of this section:

Complete both plans before the compliance date for your source and keep them on-site and readily available as long as the source is operational. On and after September 15, 2020, the requirement to prepare a SSM plan no longer applies, and the plan for demonstrating compliance must only describe the procedures you develop according to the requirements of § 63.2851.
(c) If your source processes any listed oilseed, record the items in paragraphs (c)(1) through (3) of this section:
(1) For the solvent inventory, record the information in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (vii) of this section in accordance with your plan for demonstrating compliance:
(i) Dates that define each operating status period during a calendar month.
(ii) The operating status of your source such as normal operation, nonoperating, initial startup period, malfunction period, or exempt operation for each recorded time interval.
(iii) Record the gallons of extraction solvent in the inventory on the beginning and ending dates of each normal operating period.
(iv) The gallons of all extraction solvent received, purchased, and recovered during each calendar month.
(v) All extraction solvent inventory adjustments, additions or subtractions. You must document the reason for the adjustment and justify the quantity of the adjustment.
(vi) The total solvent loss for each calendar month, regardless of the source operating status.
(vii) The actual solvent loss in gallons for each operating month.
(2) For the weighted average volume fraction of HAP in the extraction solvent, you must record the items in paragraphs (c)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section:
(i) The gallons of extraction solvent received in each delivery.
(ii) The volume fraction of each HAP exceeding 1 percent by volume in each delivery of extraction solvent.
(iii) The weighted average volume fraction of HAP in extraction solvent received since the end of the last operating month as determined in accordance with § 63.2854(b)(2).
(3) For each type of listed oilseed processed, record the items in paragraphs (c)(3)(i) through (vi) of this section, in accordance with your plan for demonstrating compliance:
(i) The dates that define each operating status period. These dates must be the same as the dates entered for the extraction solvent inventory.
(ii) The operating status of your source, as described in § 63.2853(a)(2). On the log for each type of listed oilseed that is not being processed during a normal operating period, you must record which type of listed oilseed is being processed in addition to the source operating status.
(iii) The oilseed inventory for the type of listed oilseed being processed on the beginning and ending dates of each normal operating period.
(iv) The tons of each type of listed oilseed received at the affected source each normal operating period.
(v) All listed oilseed inventory adjustments, additions or subtractions for normal operating periods. You must document the reason for the adjustment and justify the quantity of the adjustment.
(vi) The tons of each type of listed oilseed processed during each operating month.
(d) After your source has processed listed oilseed for 12 operating months, record the items in paragraphs (d)(1) through (5) of this section by the end of the calendar month following each operating month:
(1) The 12 operating months rolling sum of the actual solvent loss in gallons as described in § 63.2853(c).
(2) The weighted average volume fraction of HAP in extraction solvent received for the previous 12 operating months as described in § 63.2854(b)(3).
(3) The 12 operating months rolling sum of each type of listed oilseed processed at the affected source in tons as described in § 63.2855(c).
(4) A determination of the compliance ratio. Using the values from §§ 63.2853, 63.2854, 63.2855, and Table 1 of § 63.2840, calculate the compliance ratio using Equation 2 of § 63.2840.
(5) A statement of whether the source is in compliance with all of the requirements of this subpart. This includes a determination of whether you have met all of the applicable requirements in § 63.2850.
