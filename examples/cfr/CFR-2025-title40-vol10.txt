refers to title 40, part 61, section 01.

# Explanation
The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.
Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:
Title 1 through Title 16
as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27
as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41
as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50
as of October 1
The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.

# LEGAL STATUS
The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

# HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS
The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, July 1, 2025), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

# EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES
Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.

# OMB CONTROL NUMBERS
The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request.
Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.

# PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE
Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.

# “[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY
The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not dropped in error.

# INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE
What is incorporation by reference?
Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.
What is a proper incorporation by reference?
The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:
(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.
(b) The matter incorporated is adequately summarized in the preamble of the final rule and is available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.
(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?
If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or email fr.inspection@nara.gov.

# CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES
A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR
Index and Finding Aids.
This volume contains the Parallel Table of Authorities and Rules. A list of CFR titles, chapters, subchapters, and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in this volume.
An index to the text of “Title 3—The President” is carried within that volume.
The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. This index is based on a consolidation of the “Contents” entries in the daily Federal Register.
A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

# REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL
There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing in the Code of Federal Regulations.

# INQUIRIES

§ 61.02
Definitions.
The terms used in this part are defined in the Act or in this section as follows:
Act
means the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401
et seq.
).
Administrator
means the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency or his authorized representative.
Alternative method
means any method of sampling and analyzing for an air pollutant which is not a reference method but which has been demonstrated to the Administrator's satisfaction to produce results adequate for the Administrator's determination of compliance.
Approved permit program
means a State permit program approved by the Administrator as meeting the requirements of part 70 of this chapter or a Federal permit program established in this chapter pursuant to title V of the Act (42 U.S.C. 7661).
Capital expenditure
means an expenditure for a physical or operational change to a stationary source which exceeds the product of the applicable “annual asset guideline repair allowance percentage” specified in the latest edition of Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Publication 534 and the stationary source's basis, as defined by section 1012 of the Internal Revenue Code. However, the total expenditure for a physical or operational change to a stationary source must not be reduced by any “excluded additions” as defined for stationary sources constructed after December 31, 1981, in IRS Publication 534, as would be done for tax purposes. In addition, “annual asset guideline repair allowance” may be used even though it is excluded for tax purposes in IRS Publication 534.
Commenced
means, with respect to the definition of “new source” in section 111(a)(2) of the Act, that an owner or operator has undertaken a continuous program of construction or modification or that an owner or operator has entered into a contractual obligation to undertake and complete, within a reasonable time, a continuous program of construction or modification.
Compliance schedule
means the date or dates by which a source or category of sources is required to comply with the standards of this part and with any steps toward such compliance which are set forth in a waiver of compliance under § 61.11.
Construction
means fabrication, erection, or installation of an affected facility.
Effective date
is the date of promulgation in the
Federal Register
of an applicable standard or other regulation under this part.
Existing source
means any stationary source which is not a new source.
Force majeure
means, for purposes of § 61.13, an event that will be or has been caused by circumstances beyond the control of the affected facility, its contractors, or any entity controlled by the affected facility that prevents the owner or operator from complying with the regulatory requirement to conduct performance tests within the specified timeframe despite the affected facility's best efforts to fulfill the obligation. Examples of such events are acts of nature, acts of war or terrorism, or equipment failure or safety hazard beyond the control of the affected facility.
Issuance
of a part 70 permit will occur, if the State is the permitting authority, in accordance with the requirements of part 70 of this chapter and the applicable, approved State permit program. When the EPA is the permitting authority, issuance of a title V permit occurs immediately after the EPA takes final action on the final permit.
Monitoring system
means any system, required under the monitoring sections in applicable subparts, used to sample and condition (if applicable), to analyze, and to provide a record of emissions or process parameters.
New source
means any stationary source, the construction or modification of which is commenced after the publication in the
Federal Register
of proposed national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants which will be applicable to such source.
Owner or operator
means any person who owns, leases, operates, controls, or supervises a stationary source.
Part 70 permit
means any permit issued, renewed, or revised pursuant to part 70 of this chapter.
Permit program
means a comprehensive State operating permit system established pursuant to title V of the Act (42 U.S.C. 7661) and regulations codified in part 70 of this chapter and applicable State regulations, or a comprehensive Federal operating permit system established pursuant to title V of the Act and regulations codified in this chapter.
Permitting authority
means:
(1) The State air pollution control agency, local agency, other State agency, or other agency authorized by the Administrator to carry out a permit program under part 70 of this chapter; or
(2) The Administrator, in the case of EPA-implemented permit programs under title V of the Act (42 U.S.C. 7661).
Reference method
means any method of sampling and analyzing for an air pollutant, as described in appendix B to this part.
Run
means the net period of time during which an emission sample is collected. Unless otherwise specified, a run may be either intermittent or continuous within the limits of good engineering practice.
Standard
means a national emission standard including a design, equipment, work practice or operational standard for a hazardous air pollutant proposed or promulgated under this part.
Startup
means the setting in operation of a stationary source for any purpose.
State
means all non-Federal authorities, including local agencies, interstate associations, and State-wide programs, that have delegated authority to implement:
(1) The provisions of this part; and/or
(2) The permit program established under part 70 of this chapter. The term State shall have its conventional meaning where clear from the context.
Stationary source
means any building, structure, facility, or installation which emits or may emit any air pollutant which has been designated as hazardous by the Administrator.
Title V permit
means any permit issued, renewed, or revised pursuant to Federal or State regulations established to implement title V of the Act (42 U.S.C. 7661). A title V permit issued by a State permitting authority is called a part 70 permit in this part.

(2) A notification of the actual date of initial startup of the source within 15 days after that date.
(b) If any State or local agency requires a notice which contains all the information required in the notification in paragraph (a) of this section, sending the Administrator a copy of that notification will satisfy paragraph (a) of this section.
[50 FR 46291, Nov. 7, 1985]
§ 61.10
Source reporting and waiver request.
(a) The owner or operator of each existing source or each new source which had an initial startup before the effective date shall provide the following information in writing to the Administrator within 90 days after the effective date:
(1) Name and address of the owner or operator.
(2) The location of the source.
(3) The type of hazardous pollutants emitted by the stationary source.
(4) A brief description of the nature, size, design, and method of operation of the stationary source including the operating design capacity of the source. Identify each point of emission for each hazardous pollutant.

(6) A description of the existing control equipment for each emission point including—
(i) Each control device for each hazardous pollutant; and
(ii) Estimated control efficiency (percent) for each control device.
(7) A statement by the owner or operator of the source as to whether the source can comply with the standards within 90 days after the effective date.
(b) The owner or operator of an existing source unable to comply with an applicable standard may request a waiver of compliance with that standard for a period not exceeding 2 years after the effective date. Any request shall be in writing and shall include the following information:
(1) A description of the controls to be installed to comply with the standard.
(2) A compliance schedule, including the date each step toward compliance will be reached. The list shall include as a minimum the following dates:
(i) Date by which contracts for emission control systems or process changes for emission control will be awarded, or date by which orders will
be issued for the purchase of component parts to accomplish emission control or process changes;
(ii) Date of initiation of onsite construction or installation of emission control equipment or process change;
(iii) Date by which onsite construction or installation of emission control equipment or process change is to be completed; and
(iv) Date by which final compliance is to be achieved.
(3) A description of interim emission control steps which will be taken during the waiver period.
(c) Any change in the information provided under paragraph (a) of this section or § 61.07(b) shall be provided to the Administrator within 30 days after the change. However, if any change will result from modification of the source, §§ 61.07(c) and 61.08 apply.
(d) A possible format for reporting under this section is included as appendix A of this part. Advice on reporting the status of compliance may be obtained from the Administrator.
(e) For the purposes of this part, time periods specified in days shall be measured in calendar days, even if the word “calendar” is absent, unless otherwise specified in an applicable requirement.
(f) For the purposes of this part, if an explicit postmark deadline is not specified in an applicable requirement for the submittal of a notification, application, report, or other written communication to the Administrator, the owner or operator shall postmark the submittal on or before the number of days specified in the applicable requirement. For example, if a notification must be submitted 15 days before a particular event is scheduled to take place, the notification shall be postmarked on or before 15 days preceding the event; likewise, if a notification must be submitted 15 days after a particular event takes place, the notification shall be postmarked on or before 15 days following the end of the event. The use of reliable non-Government mail carriers that provide indications of verifiable delivery of information required to be submitted to the Administrator, similar to the postmark provided by the U.S. Postal Service, or alternative means of delivery agreed to by the permitting authority, is acceptable.
(g) Notwithstanding time periods or postmark deadlines specified in this part for the submittal of information to the Administrator by an owner or operator, or the review of such information by the Administrator, such time periods or deadlines may be changed by mutual agreement between the owner or operator and the Administrator. Procedures governing the implementation of this provision are specified in paragraph (j) of this section.
(h) If an owner or operator of a stationary source in a State with delegated authority is required to submit reports under this part to the State, and if the State has an established timeline for the submission of reports that is consistent with the reporting frequency(ies) specified for such source under this part, the owner or operator may change the dates by which reports under this part shall be submitted (without changing the frequency of reporting) to be consistent with the State's schedule by mutual agreement between the owner or operator and the State. The allowance in the previous sentence applies in each State beginning 1 year after the source is required to be in compliance with the applicable subpart in this part. Procedures governing the implementation of this provision are specified in paragraph (j) of this section.
(i) If an owner or operator supervises one or more stationary sources affected by standards set under this part and standards set under part 60, part 63, or both such parts of this chapter, he/she may arrange by mutual agreement between the owner or operator and the Administrator (or the State with an approved permit program) a common schedule on which reports required by each applicable standard shall be submitted throughout the year. The allowance in the previous sentence applies in each State beginning 1 year after the source is required to be in compliance with the applicable subpart in this part, or 1 year after the source is required to be in compliance with the applicable part 60 or part 63 standard,
whichever is latest. Procedures governing the implementation of this provision are specified in paragraph (j) of this section.
(j)(1)(i) Until an adjustment of a time period or postmark deadline has been approved by the Administrator under paragraphs (j)(2) and (j)(3) of this section, the owner or operator of an affected source remains strictly subject to the requirements of this part.
(ii) An owner or operator shall request the adjustment provided for in paragraphs (j)(2) and (j)(3) of this section each time he or she wishes to change an applicable time period or postmark deadline specified in this part.
(2) Notwithstanding time periods or postmark deadlines specified in this part for the submittal of information to the Administrator by an owner or operator, or the review of such information by the Administrator, such time periods or deadlines may be changed by mutual agreement between the owner or operator and the Administrator. An owner or operator who wishes to request a change in a time period or postmark deadline for a particular requirement shall request the adjustment in writing as soon as practicable before the subject activity is required to take place. The owner or operator shall include in the request whatever information he or she considers useful to convince the Administrator that an adjustment is warranted.
(3) If, in the Administrator's judgment, an owner or operator's request for an adjustment to a particular time period or postmark deadline is warranted, the Administrator will approve the adjustment. The Administrator will notify the owner or operator in writing of approval or disapproval of the request for an adjustment within 15 calendar days of receiving sufficient information to evaluate the request.
(4) If the Administrator is unable to meet a specified deadline, he or she will notify the owner or operator of any significant delay and inform the owner or operator of the amended schedule.
[38 FR 8826, Apr. 6, 1973, as amended at 50 FR 46292, Nov. 7, 1985; 59 FR 12430, Mar. 16, 1994]
§ 61.11

(1) Identify the stationary source covered;
(2) Specify the termination date of the waiver;
(3) Specify dates by which steps toward compliance are to be taken; and
(4) Specify any additional conditions which the Administrator determines necessary to assure installation of the necessary controls within the waiver period and to assure protection of the health of persons during the waiver period.
(c) The Administrator may terminate the waiver at an earlier date than specified if any specification under paragraphs (b)(3) and (b)(4) of this section are not met.
(d) Before denying any request for a waiver, the Administrator will notify the owner or operator making the request of the Administrator's intention to issue the denial, together with—
(1) Notice of the information and findings on which the intended denial is based; and
(2) Notice of opportunity for the owner or operator to present, within the time limit the Administrator specifies, additional information or arguments to the Administrator before final action on the request.
(e) A final determination to deny any request for a waiver will be in writing and will set forth the specific grounds on which the denial is based. The final determination will be made within 60 days after presentation of additional information or argument; or within 60 days after the final date specified for the presentation if no presentation is made.
(f) The granting of a waiver under this section shall not abrogate the Administrator's authority under section 114 of the Act.

§ 61.12
Compliance with standards and maintenance requirements.
(a) Compliance with numerical emission limits shall be determined in accordance with emission tests established in § 61.13 or as otherwise specified in an individual subpart.
(b) Compliance with design, equipment, work practice or operational standards shall be determined as specified in an individual subpart.
(c) The owner or operator of each stationary source shall maintain and operate the source, including associated equipment for air pollution control, in a manner consistent with good air pollution control practice for minimizing emissions. Determination of whether acceptable operating and maintenance procedures are being used will be based on information available to the Administrator which may include, but is not limited to, monitoring results, review of operating and maintenance procedures, and inspection of the source.
(d)(1) If, in the Administrator's judgment, an alternative means of emission limitation will achieve a reduction in emissions of a pollutant from a source at least equivalent to the reduction in emissions of that pollutant from that source achieved under any design, equipment, work practice or operational standard, the Administrator will publish in the
Federal Register
a notice permitting the use of the alternative means for purposes of compliance with the standard. The notice will restrict the permission to the source(s) or category(ies) of sources on which the alternative means will achieve equivalent emission reductions. The notice may condition permission on requirements related to the operation and maintenance of the alternative means.
(2) Any notice under paragraph (d)(1) shall be published only after notice and an opportunity for a hearing.
(3) Any person seeking permission under this subsection shall, unless otherwise specified in the applicable subpart, submit a proposed test plan or the results of testing and monitoring, a description of the procedures followed in testing or monitoring, and a description of pertinent conditions during testing or monitoring.
(e) For the purpose of submitting compliance certifications or establishing whether or not a person has violated or is in violation of any standard in this part, nothing in this part shall preclude the use, including the exclusive use, of any credible evidence or information, relevant to whether a source would have been in compliance with applicable requirements if the appropriate performance or compliance test had been performed.

§ 61.13
Emission tests and waiver of emission tests.
(a) Except as provided in paragraphs (a)(3), (a)(4), (a)(5), and (a)(6) of this section, if required to do emission testing by an applicable subpart and unless a waiver of emission testing is obtained under this section, the owner or operator shall test emissions from the source:
(1) Within 90 days after the effective date, for an existing source or a new source which has an initial startup date before the effective date.
(2) Within 90 days after initial startup, for a new source which has an initial startup date after the effective date.
(3) If a force majeure is about to occur, occurs, or has occurred for which the affected owner or operator intends to assert a claim of force majeure, the owner or operator shall notify the Administrator, in writing as soon as practicable following the date the owner or operator first knew, or through due diligence should have known that the event may cause or caused a delay in testing beyond the regulatory deadline specified in paragraphs (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section or beyond a deadline established pursuant to the requirements under paragraph (b) of this section, but the notification must occur before the performance test deadline unless the initial force majeure or a subsequent force majeure event delays the notice, and in such cases, the notification shall occur as soon as practicable.
(4) The owner or operator shall provide to the Administrator a written description of the force majeure event and a rationale for attributing the
delay in testing beyond the regulatory deadline to the force majeure; describe the measures taken or to be taken to minimize the delay; and identify a date by which the owner or operator proposes to conduct the performance test. The performance test shall be conducted as soon as practicable after the force majeure occurs.
(5) The decision as to whether or not to grant an extension to the performance test deadline is solely within the discretion of the Administrator. The Administrator will notify the owner or operator in writing of approval or disapproval of the request for an extension as soon as practicable.
(6) Until an extension of the performance test deadline has been approved by the Administrator under paragraphs (a)(3), (a)(4), and (a)(5) of this section, the owner or operator of the affected facility remains strictly subject to the requirements of this part.
(b) The Administrator may require an owner or operator to test emissions from the source at any other time when the action is authorized by section 114 of the Act.
(c) The owner or operator shall notify the Administrator of the emission test at least 30 days before the emission test to allow the Administrator the opportunity to have an observer present during the test.
(d) If required to do emission testing, the owner or operator of each new source and, at the request of the Administrator, the owner or operator of each existing source shall provide emission testing facilities as follows:
(1) Sampling ports adequate for test methods applicable to each source.
(2) Safe sampling platform(s).
(3) Safe access to sampling platform(s).
(4) Utilities for sampling and testing equipment.
(5) Any other facilities that the Administrator needs to safely and properly test a source.
(e) Each emission test shall be conducted under such conditions as the Administrator shall specify based on design and operational characteristics of the source.
(1) The performance testing shall include a test method performance audit (PA) during the performance test. The PAs consist of blind audit samples supplied by an accredited audit sample provider and analyzed during the performance test in order to provide a measure of test data bias. Gaseous audit samples are designed to audit the performance of the sampling system as well as the analytical system and must be collected by the sampling system during the compliance test just as the compliance samples are collected. If a liquid or solid audit sample is designed to audit the sampling system, it must also be collected by the sampling system during the compliance test. If multiple sampling systems or sampling trains are used during the compliance test for any of the test methods, the tester is only required to use one of the sampling systems per method to collect the audit sample. The audit sample must be analyzed by the same analyst using the same analytical reagents and analytical system and at the same time as the compliance samples. Retests are required when there is a failure to produce acceptable results for an audit sample. However, if the audit results do not affect the compliance or noncompliance status of the affected facility, the compliance authority may waive the reanalysis requirement, further audits, or retests and accept the results of the compliance test. Acceptance of the test results shall constitute a waiver of the reanalysis requirement, further audits, or retests. The compliance authority may also use the audit sample failure and the compliance test results as evidence to determine the compliance or noncompliance status of the affected facility. A blind audit sample is a sample whose value is known only to the sample provider and is not revealed to the tested facility until after they report the measured value of the audit sample. For pollutants that exist in the gas phase at ambient temperature, the audit sample shall consist of an appropriate concentration of the pollutant in air or nitrogen that can be introduced into the sampling system of the test method at or near the same entry point as a sample from the emission source. If no gas phase audit samples are available, an acceptable alternative is a sample of the pollutant in the same matrix that would be produced
when the sample is recovered from the sampling system as required by the test method. For samples that exist only in a liquid or solid form at ambient temperature, the audit sample shall consist of an appropriate concentration of the pollutant in the same matrix that would be produced when the sample is recovered from the sampling system as required by the test method. An accredited audit sample provider (AASP) is an organization that has been accredited to prepare audit samples by an independent, third party accrediting body.
(i) The source owner, operator, or representative of the tested facility shall obtain an audit sample, if commercially available, from an AASP for each test method used for regulatory compliance purposes. No audit samples are required for the following test methods: Methods 3A and 3C of appendix A-3 of part 60 of this chapter; Methods 6C, 7E, 9, and 10 of appendix A-4 of part 60; Method 18 and 19 of appendix A-6 of part 60; Methods 20, 22, and 25A of appendix A-7 of part 60; Methods 30A and 30B of appendix A-8 of part 60; and Methods 303, 318, 320, and 321 of appendix A of part 63 of this chapter. If multiple sources at a single facility are tested during a compliance test event, only one audit sample is required for each method used during a compliance test. The compliance authority responsible for the compliance test may waive the requirement to include an audit sample if they believe that an audit sample is not necessary. “Commercially available” means that two or more independent AASPs have blind audit samples available for purchase. If the source owner, operator, or representative cannot find an audit sample for a specific method, the owner, operator, or representative shall consult the EPA Web site at the following URL,
www.epa.gov/ttn/emc,
to confirm whether there is a source that can supply an audit sample for that method. If the EPA Web site does not list an available audit sample at least 60 days prior to the beginning of the compliance test, the source owner, operator, or representative shall not be required to include an audit sample as part of the quality assurance program for the compliance test. When ordering an audit sample, the source owner, operator, or representative shall give the sample provider an estimate for the concentration of each pollutant that is emitted by the source or the estimated concentration of each pollutant based on the permitted level and the name, address, and phone number of the compliance authority. The source owner, operator, or representative shall report the results for the audit sample along with a summary of the emission test results for the audited pollutant to the compliance authority and shall report the results of the audit sample to the AASP. The source owner, operator, or representative shall make both reports at the same time and in the same manner or shall report to the compliance authority first and then report to the AASP. If the method being audited is a method that allows the samples to be analyzed in the field and the tester plans to analyze the samples in the field, the tester may analyze the audit samples prior to collecting the emission samples provided a representative of the compliance authority is present at the testing site. The tester may request, and the compliance authority may grant, a waiver to the requirement that a representative of the compliance authority must be present at the testing site during the field analysis of an audit sample. The source owner, operator, or representative may report the results of the audit sample to the compliance authority and then report the results of the audit sample to the AASP prior to collecting any emission samples. The test protocol and final test report shall document whether an audit sample was ordered and utilized and the pass/fail results as applicable.
(ii) An AASP shall have and shall prepare, analyze, and report the true value of audit samples in accordance with a written technical criteria document that describes how audit samples will be prepared and distributed in a manner that will ensure the integrity of the audit sample program. An acceptable technical criteria document shall contain standard operating procedures for all of the following operations:
(A) Preparing the sample;
(B) Confirming the true concentration of the sample;
(C) Defining the acceptance limits for the results from a well qualified tester. This procedure must use well established statistical methods to analyze historical results from well qualified testers. The acceptance limits shall be set so that there is 95 percent confidence that 90 percent of well qualified labs will produce future results that are within the acceptance limit range;
(D) Providing the opportunity for the compliance authority to comment on the selected concentration level for an audit sample;
(E) Distributing the sample to the user in a manner that guarantees that the true value of the sample is unknown to the user;
(F) Recording the measured concentration reported by the user and determining if the measured value is within acceptable limits;
(G) Reporting the results from each audit sample in a timely manner to the compliance authority and to the source owner, operator, or representative by the AASP. The AASP shall make both reports at the same time and in the same manner or shall report to the compliance authority first and then report to the source owner, operator, or representative. The results shall include the name of the facility tested, the date on which the compliance test was conducted, the name of the company performing the sample collection, the name of the company that analyzed the compliance samples including the audit sample, the measured result for the audit sample, and whether the testing company passed or failed the audit. The AASP shall report the true value of the audit sample to the compliance authority. The AASP may report the true value to the source owner, operator, or representative if the AASP's operating plan ensures that no laboratory will receive the same audit sample twice.
(H) Evaluating the acceptance limits of samples at least once every two years to determine in consultation with the voluntary consensus standard body if they should be changed;
(I) Maintaining a database, accessible to the compliance authorities, of results from the audit that shall include the name of the facility tested, the date on which the compliance test was conducted, the name of the company performing the sample collection, the name of the company that analyzed the compliance samples including the audit sample, the measured result for the audit sample, the true value of the audit sample, the acceptance range for the measured value, and whether the testing company passed or failed the audit.
(iii) The accrediting body shall have a written technical criteria document that describes how it will ensure that the AASP is operating in accordance with the AASP technical criteria document that describes how audit or samples are to be prepared and distributed. This document shall contain standard operating procedures for all of the following operations:
(A) Checking audit samples to confirm their true value as reported by the AASP.
(B) Performing technical systems audits of the AASP's facilities and operating procedures at least once every two years.
(C) Providing standards for use by the voluntary consensus standard body to approve the accrediting body that will accredit the audit sample providers.
(iv) The technical criteria documents for the accredited sample providers and the accrediting body shall be developed through a public process guided by a voluntary consensus standards body (VCSB). The VCSB shall operate in accordance with the procedures and requirements in the Office of Management and Budget
Circular A-119.
A copy of Circular A-119 is available upon request by writing the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, 725 17th Street, NW., Washington, DC 20503, by calling (202) 395-6880 or downloading online at
http://standards.gov/standards_gov/a119.cfm.
The VCSB shall approve all accrediting bodies. The Administrator will review all technical criteria documents. If the technical criteria documents do not meet the minimum technical requirements in paragraphs (e)(1)(ii) through (iv) of this
section, the technical criteria documents are not acceptable and the proposed audit sample program is not capable of producing audit samples of sufficient quality to be used in a compliance test. All acceptable technical criteria documents shall be posted on the EPA Web site at the following URL,
http://www.epa.gov/ttn/emc.
(2) [Reserved]
(f) Unless otherwise specified in an applicable subpart, samples shall be analyzed and emissions determined within 30 days after each emission test has been completed. The owner or operator shall report the determinations of the emission test to the Administrator by a registered letter sent before the close of business on the 31st day following the completion of the emission test.
(g) The owner or operator shall retain at the source and make available, upon request, for inspection by the Administrator, for a minimum of 2 years, records of emission test results and other data needed to determine emissions.
(h)(1) Emission tests shall be conducted as set forth in this section, the applicable subpart and appendix B unless the Administrator—
(i) Specifies or approves the use of a reference method with minor changes in methodology; or
(ii) Approves the use of an alternative method; or
(iii) Waives the requirement for emission testing because the owner or operator of a source has demonstrated by other means to the Administrator's satisfaction that the source is in compliance with the standard.
(2) If the Administrator finds reasonable grounds to dispute the results obtained by an alternative method, he may require the use of a reference method. If the results of the reference and alternative methods do not agree, the results obtained by the reference method prevail.
(3) The owner or operator may request approval for the use of an alternative method at any time, except—
(i) For an existing source or a new source that had an initial startup before the effective date, any request for use of an alternative method during the initial emission test shall be submitted to the Administrator within 30 days after the effective date, or with the request for a waiver of compliance if one is submitted under § 60.10(b); or
(ii) For a new source that has an initial startup after the effective date, any request for use of an alternative method during the initial emission test shall be submitted to the Administrator no later than with the notification of anticipated startup required under § 60.09.
(i)(1) Emission tests may be waived upon written application to the Administrator if, in the Administrator's judgment, the source is meeting the standard, or the source is being operated under a waiver or compliance, or the owner or operator has requested a waiver of compliance and the Administrator is still considering that request.
(2) If application for waiver of the emission test is made, the application shall accompany the information required by § 61.10 or the notification of startup required by § 61.09, whichever is applicable. A possible format is contained in appendix A to this part.
(3) Approval of any waiver granted under this section shall not abrogate the Administrator's authority under the Act or in any way prohibit the Administrator from later cancelling the waiver. The cancellation will be made only after notice is given to the owner or operator of the source.

§ 61.14
Monitoring requirements.
(a) Unless otherwise specified, this section applies to each monitoring system required under each subpart which requires monitoring.
(b) Each owner or operator shall maintain and operate each monitoring system as specified in the applicable subpart and in a manner consistent with good air pollution control practice for minimizing emissions. Any unavoidable breakdown or malfunction of the monitoring system should be repaired or adjusted as soon as practicable after its occurrence. The Administrator's determination of whether acceptable operating and maintenance procedures are being used will be based
on information which may include, but not be limited to, review of operating and maintenance procedures, manufacturer recommendations and specifications, and inspection of the monitoring system.
(c) When required by the applicable subpart, and at any other time the Administrator may require, the owner or operator of a source being monitored shall conduct a performance evaluation of the monitoring system and furnish the Administrator with a copy of a written report of the results within 60 days of the evaluation. Such a performance evaluation shall be conducted according to the applicable specifications and procedures described in the applicable subpart. The owner or operator of the source shall furnish the Administrator with written notification of the date of the performance evaluation at least 30 days before the evaluation is to begin.
(d) When the effluents from a single source, or from two or more sources subject to the same emission standards, are combined before being released to the atmosphere, the owner or operator shall install a monitoring system on each effluent or on the combined effluent. If two or more sources are not subject to the same emission standards, the owner or operator shall install a separate monitoring system on each effluent, unless otherwise specified. If the applicable standard is a mass emission standard and the effluent from one source is released to the atmosphere through more than one point, the owner or operator shall install a monitoring system at each emission point unless the installation of fewer systems is approved by the Administrator.
(e) The owner or operator of each monitoring system shall reduce the monitoring data as specified in each applicable subpart. Monitoring data recorded during periods of unavoidable monitoring system breakdowns, repairs, calibration checks, and zero and span adjustments shall not be included in any data average.
(f) The owner or operator shall maintain records of monitoring data, monitoring system calibration checks, and the occurrence and duration of any period during which the monitoring system is malfunctioning or inoperative. These records shall be maintained at the source for a minimum of 2 years and made available, upon request, for inspection by the Administrator.
(g)(1) Monitoring shall be conducted as set forth in this section and the applicable subpart unless the Administrator—
(i) Specifies or approves the use of the specified monitoring requirements and procedures with minor changes in methodology; or
(ii) Approves the use of alternatives to any monitoring requirements or procedures.
(2) If the Administrator finds reasonable grounds to dispute the results obtained by an alternative monitoring method, the Administrator may require the monitoring requirements and procedures specified in this part.

§ 61.15
Modification.
(a) Except as provided under paragraph (d) of this section, any physical or operational change to a stationary source which results in an increase in the rate of emission to the atmosphere of a hazardous pollutant to which a standard applies shall be considered a modification.
(b) Upon modification, an existing source shall become a new source for each hazardous pollutant for which the rate of emission to the atmosphere increases and to which a standard applies.
(c) Emission rate shall be expressed as kg/hr of any hazardous pollutant discharged into the atmosphere for which a standard is applicable. The Administrator shall use the following to determine the emission rate:
(1) Emission factors as specified in the background information document (BID) for the applicable standard, or in the latest issue of “Compilation of Air Pollutant Emission Factors,” EPA Publication No. AP-42, or other emission factors determined by the Administrator to be superior to AP-42 emission factors, in cases where use of emission factors demonstrates that the emission rate will clearly increase or clearly not increase as a result of the physical or operational change.
(2) Material balances, monitoring data, or manual emission tests in cases where use of emission factors, as referenced in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, does not demonstrate to the Administrator's satisfaction that the emission rate will clearly increase or clearly not increase as a result of the physical or operational change, or where an interested person demonstrates to the Administrator's satisfaction that there are reasonable grounds to dispute the result obtained by the Administrator using emission factors. When the emission rate is based on results from manual emission tests or monitoring data, the procedures specified in appendix C of 40 CFR part 60 shall be used to determine whether an increase in emission rate has occurred. Tests shall be conducted under such conditions as the Administrator shall specify to the owner or operator. At least three test runs must be conducted before and at least three after the physical or operational change. If the Administrator approves, the results of the emission tests required in § 61.13(a) may be used for the test runs to be conducted before the physical or operational change. All operating parameters which may affect emissions must be held constant to the maximum degree feasible for all test runs.
(d) The following shall not, by themselves, be considered modifications under this part:
(1) Maintenance, repair, and replacement which the Administrator determines to be routine for a source category.
(2) An increase in production rate of a stationary source, if that increase can be accomplished without a capital expenditure on the stationary source.
(3) An increase in the hours of operation.
(4) Any conversion to coal that meets the requirements specified in section 111(a)(8) of the Act.
(5) The relocation or change in ownership of a stationary source. However, such activities must be reported in accordance with § 61.10(c).

State authority.
(a) This part shall not be construed to preclude any State or political subdivision thereof from—
(1) Adopting and enforcing any emission limiting regulation applicable to a stationary source, provided that such emission limiting regulation is not less stringent than the standards prescribed under this part; or
(2) Requiring the owner or operator of a stationary source to obtain permits, licenses, or approvals prior to initiating construction, modification, or operation of the source.

§ 61.19
Circumvention.
No owner or operator shall build, erect, install, or use any article machine, equipment, process, or method, the use of which conceals an emission which would otherwise constitute a violation of an applicable standard. Such concealment includes, but is not limited to, the use of gaseous dilutants to achieve compliance with a visible emissions standard, and the piecemeal carrying out of an operation to avoid coverage by a standard that applies only to operations larger than a specified size.

(1) The owner or operator of each mercury cell chlor-alkali plant shall, within 1 year of the date of publication of these amendments or within 1 year of startup for a plant with initial startup after the date of publication, perform a mercury emission test that demonstrates compliance with the emission limits in § 61.52, on the hydrogen stream by Method 102 and on the end-box stream by Method 101 for the purpose of establishing limits for parameters to be monitored.
(2) During tests specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the following control device parameters shall be monitored, except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, and recorded manually or automatically at least once every 15 minutes:
(i) The exit gas temperature from uncontrolled streams;
(ii) The outlet temperature of the gas stream for the final (i.e., the farthest downstream) cooling system when no control devices other than coolers and demisters are used;
(iii) The outlet temperature of the gas stream from the final cooling system when the cooling system is followed by a molecular sieve or carbon adsorber;

(3) The recorded parameters in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through (b)(2)(vi) of this section shall be averaged over the test period (a minimum of 6 hours) to provide an average number. The highest temperature reading that is measured in paragraph (b)(2)(vii) of this section is to be identified as the reference temperature for use in paragraph (b)(6)(ii) of this section.
(4)(i) Immediately following completion of the emission tests specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the owner or operator of a mercury cell chlor-alkali plant shall monitor and record manually or automatically at least once per hour the same parameters specified in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through (b)(2)(vi) of this section.
(ii) Immediately following completion of the emission tests specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the owner or operator shall monitor and record manually or automatically, during each heating phase of the regeneration cycle, the temperature specified in paragraph (b)(2)(vii) of this section.
(5) Monitoring devices used in accordance with paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(4) of this section shall be certified by their manufacturer to be accurate to within 10 percent, and shall be operated, maintained, and calibrated according to the manufacturer's instructions. Records of the certifications and calibrations shall be retained at the chlor-alkali plant and made available for inspection by the Administrator as follows: Certification, for as long as the device is used for this purpose; calibration for a minimum of 2 years.
(6)(i) When the hourly value of a parameter monitored in accordance with paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section exceeds, or in the case of liquid flow rate and available chlorine falls below the
value of that same parameter determined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section for 24 consecutive hours, the Administrator is to be notified within the next 10 days.
(ii) When the maximum hourly value of the temperature measured in accordance with paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section is below the reference temperature recorded according to paragraph (b)(3) of this section for three consecutive regeneration cycles, the Administrator is to be notified within the next 10 days.

Parameter excursions will be considered unacceptable operation and maintenance of the emission control system. In addition, while compliance with the emission limits is determined primarily by conducting a performance test according to the procedures in § 61.53(b), reports of parameter excursions may be used as evidence in judging the duration of a violation that is determined by a performance test.
(8) Semiannual reports required in paragraph (b)(7) of this section shall be submitted to the Administrator on September 15 and March 15 of each year. The first semiannual report is to be submitted following the first full 6 month reporting period.

To be approved, such a plan must ensure not only compliance with the emission limits of § 61.52(a) but also proper operation and maintenance of emissions control systems. Any site-specific monitoring plan submitted must, at a minimum, include the following:
(1) Identification of the critical parameter or parameters for the hydrogen stream and for the end-box ventilation stream that are to be monitored and an explanation of why the critical parameter(s) selected is the best indicator of proper control system performance and of mercury emission rates.
(2) Identification of the maximum or minimum value of each parameter (e.g., degrees temperature, concentration of mercury) that is not to be exceeded. The level(s) is to be directly correlated to the results of a performance test, conducted no more than 180 days prior to submittal of the plan, when the facility was in compliance with the emission limits of § 61.52(a).
(3) Designation of the frequency for recording the parameter measurements, with justification if the frequency is less than hourly. A longer recording frequency must be justified on the basis of the amount of time that could elapse during periods of process or control system upsets before the emission limits would be exceeded, and consideration is to be given to the time that would be necessary to repair the failure.
(4) Designation of the immediate actions to be taken in the event of an excursion beyond the value of the parameter established in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
(5) Provisions for reporting, semiannually, parameter excursions and the corrective actions taken, and provisions for reporting within 10 days any significant excursion.
(6) Identification of the accuracy of the monitoring device(s) or of the readings obtained.
(7) Recordkeeping requirements for certifications and calibrations.
(d)
Mercury cell chlor-alkali plants—cell room ventilation system.

Leak detection and elimination.
Vinyl chloride emissions due to leaks from equipment in vinyl chloride service are to be minimized as follows:
(i) A reliable and accurate vinyl chloride monitoring system shall be operated for detection of major leaks and identification of the general area of the plant where a leak is located. A vinyl chloride monitoring system means a device which obtains air samples from one or more points on a continuous sequential basis and analyzes the samples with gas chromatography or, if the owner or operator assumes that all hydrocarbons measured are vinyl chloride, with infrared spectrophotometry, flame ion detection, or an equivalent or alternative method. The vinyl chloride monitoring system shall be operated according to a program developed by the plant owner or operator. The owner or operator shall submit a description of the program to the Administrator within 45 days of the effective date of these regulations, unless a waiver of compliance is granted under § 61.11, or the program has been approved and the Administrator does not request a review of the program. Approval of a program will be granted by the Administrator provided he finds:
(A) The location and number of points to be monitored and the frequency of monitoring provided for in the program are acceptable when they are compared with the number of pieces of equipment in vinyl chloride service and size and physical layout of the plant.
(B) It contains a definition of leak which is acceptable when compared with the background concentrations of vinyl chloride in the areas of the plant to be monitored by the vinyl chloride monitoring system. Measurements of background concentrations of vinyl chloride in the areas of the plant to be monitored by the vinyl chloride monitoring system are to be included with the description of the program. The definition of leak for a given plant may vary among the different areas within the plant and is also to change over time as background concentrations in the plant are reduced.
(C) It contains an acceptable plan of action to be taken when a leak is detected.
(D) It provides for an acceptable calibration and maintenance schedule for the vinyl chloride monitoring system and portable hydrocarbon detector. For the vinyl chloride monitoring system, a daily span check is to be conducted with a concentration of vinyl chloride equal to the concentration defined as a leak according to paragraph (b)(8)(i)(B) of this section. The calibration is to be done with either:
(
1
) A calibration gas mixture prepared from the gases specified in sections 7.2.1 and 7.2.2 of Method 106 and in accordance with section 10.1 of Method 106, or
(
2
) A calibration gas cylinder standard containing the appropriate concentration of vinyl chloride. The gas composition of the calibration gas cylinder standard is to have been certified by the manufacturer. The manufacturer must have recommended a maximum shelf life for each cylinder so that the concentration does not change greater than ±5 percent from the certified value. The date of gas cylinder preparation, certified vinyl chloride concentration, and recommended maximum shelf life must have been affixed to the cylinder before shipment from the manufacturer to the buyer. If a gas chromatograph is used as the vinyl chloride monitoring system, these gas mixtures may be directly used to prepare a chromatograph calibration curve as described in Sections 8.1 and 9.2 of Method 106. The requirements in Sections 7.2.3.1 and 7.2.3.2 of Method 106 for certification of cylinder standards and for establishment and verification of calibration standards are to be followed.
(ii) For each process unit subject to this subpart, a formal leak detection
and repair program shall be implemented consistent with subpart V of this part, except as provided in paragraph (b)(8)(iii) of this section. This program is to be implemented within 90 days of the effective date of these regulations, unless a waiver of compliance is granted under § 61.11. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(8)(ii)(E) of this section, an owner or operator shall be exempt from § 61.242-1(d), § 61.242-7 (a), (b), and (c), § 61.246, and § 61.247 of subpart V of this part for any process unit in which the percentage of leaking valves is demonstrated to be less than 2.0 percent, as determined in accordance with the following:
(A) A performance test as specified in paragraph (b)(8)(ii)(B) of this section shall be conducted initially within 90 days of the effective date of these regulations, annually, and at times requested by the Administrator.
(B) For each performance test, a minimum of 200 or 90 percent, whichever is less, of the total valves in VOC service (as defined in § 60.481 of subpart VV of part 60) within the process unit shall be randomly selected and monitored within 1 week by the methods specified in § 61.245(b) of this part. If an instrument reading of 10,000 ppm or greater is measured, a leak is detected. The leak percentage shall be determined by dividing the number of valves in VOC service for which leaks are detected by the number of tested valves in VOC service.
(C) If a leak is detected, it shall be repaired in accordance with § 61.242-7 (d) and (e) of subpart V of this part.
(D) The results of the performance test shall be submitted in writing to the Administrator in the first quarterly report following the performance test as part of the reporting requirements of § 61.70.
(E) Any process unit in which the percentage of leaking valves is found to be greater than 2.0 percent according to the performance test prescribed in paragraph (b)(8)(ii)(B) of this section must comply with all provisions of subpart V of this part within 90 days.
(iii) Open-ended valves or lines located on multiple service process lines which operate in vinyl chloride service less than 10 percent of the time are exempt from the requirements of § 61.242-6 of subpart V, provided the open-ended valves or lines are addressed in the monitoring system required by paragraph (b)(8)(i) of this section. The Administrator may apply this exemption to other existing open-ended valves or lines that are demonstrated to require significant retrofit cost to comply with the requirements of § 61.242-6 of subpart V.
(9)
Inprocess wastewater.
Vinyl chloride emissions to the atmosphere from inprocess wastewater are to be reduced as follows:
(i) The concentration of vinyl chloride in each inprocess wastewater stream containing greater than 10 ppm vinyl chloride measured immediately as it leaves a piece of equipment and before being mixed with any other inprocess wastewater stream is to be reduced to no more than 10 ppm by weight before being mixed with any other inprocess wastewater stream which contains less than 10 ppm vinyl chloride; before being exposed to the atmosphere; before being discharged to a wastewater treatment process; or before being discharged untreated as a wastewater. This paragraph does apply to water which is used to displace vinyl chloride from equipment before it is opened to the atmosphere in accordance with § 61.64(a)(2) or paragraph (b)(6) of this section, but does not apply to water which is used to wash out equipment after the equipment has already been opened to the atmosphere in accordance with § 61.64(a)(2) or paragraph (b)(6) of this section.
(ii) Any vinyl chloride removed from the inprocess wastewater in accordance with paragraph (b)(9)(i) of this section is to be ducted through a control system from which the concentration of vinyl chloride in the exhaust gases does not exceed 10 ppm (average for 3-hour period); or equivalent as provided in § 61.66.
(c) The requirements in paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(2), (b)(5), (b)(6), (b)(7) and (b)(8) of this section are to be incorporated into a standard operating procedure, and made available upon request for inspection by the Administrator. The standard operating procedure is to include provisions for measuring the vinyl chloride in equipment 4.75 m
3
(1255 gal) in volume for which
an emission limit is prescribed in § 61.65(b)(6)(i) after opening the equipment and using Method 106, a portable hydrocarbon detector, or an alternative method. The method of measurement is to meet the requirements in § 61.67(g)(5)(i)(A) or (g)(5)(i)(B).
(d) A RVD that is ducted to a control device that is continually operating while emissions from the release are present at the device is subject to the following requirements:
(1) A discharge from a control device other than a flare shall not exceed 10 ppm (average over a 3-hour period) as determined by the continuous emission monitor system required under § 61.68. Such a discharge is subject to the requirements of § 61.70.
(2) For a discharge routed to a flare, the flare shall comply with the requirements of § 60.18.
(i) Flare operations shall be monitored in accordance with the requirements of §§ 60.18(d) and 60.18(f)(2). For the purposes of § 60.18(d), the volume and component concentration of each relief valve discharge shall be estimated and calculation shall be made to verify ongoing compliance with the design and operating requirements of §§ 60.18 (c)(3) through (c)(6). If more than one relief valve is discharged simultaneously to a single flare, these calculations shall account for the cumulative effect of all such relief valve discharges. These calculations shall be made and reported quarterly for all discharges within the quarter. Failure to comply with any of the requirements of this paragraph will be a violation of § 61.65(d)(2). Monitoring for the presence of a flare pilot flame shall be conducted in accordance with § 60.18(f)(2). If the results of this monitoring or any other information shows that the pilot flame is not present 100 percent of the time during which a relief valve discharge is routed to the flare, the relief valve discharge is subject to the provisions of § 61.65(a).
(ii) A report describing the flare design shall be provided to the Administrator not later than 90 days after the adoption of this provision or within 30 days of the installation of a flare system for control of relief valve discharge whichever is later. The flare design report shall include calculations based upon expected relief valve discharge component concentrations and net heating values (for PVC this calculation shall be based on values expected if a release occurred at the instant the polymerization starts); and estimated maximum exit velocities based upon the design throat capacity of the gas in the relief valve.

(1) Within 90 days of the effective date in the case of an existing source or a new source which has an initial startup date preceding the effective date, or
(2) Within 90 days of startup in the case of a new source, initial startup of which occurs after the effective date.
(b) The owner or operator shall provide the Administrator at least 30 days prior notice of an emission test to afford the Administrator the opportunity to have an observer present during the test.
(c) Any emission test is to be conducted while the equipment being tested is operating at the maximum production rate at which the equipment will be operated and under other relevant conditions as may be specified by the Administrator based on representative performance of the source.
(d) [Reserved]
(e) When at all possible, each sample is to be analyzed within 24 hours, but
in no case in excess of 72 hours of sample collection. Vinyl chloride emissions are to be determined within 30 days after the emission test. The owner or operator shall report the determinations to the Administrator by a registered letter dispatched before the close of the next business day following the determination.
(f) The owner or operator shall retain at the plant and make available, upon request, for inspection by the Administrator, for a minimum of 3 years, records of emission test results and other data needed to determine emissions.
(g) Unless otherwise specified, the owner or operator shall use the test methods in appendix B to this part for each test as required by paragraphs (g)(1), (g)(2), (g)(3), (g)(4), and (g)(5) of this section, unless an alternative method has been approved by the Administrator. If the Administrator finds reasonable grounds to dispute the results obtained by an alternative method, he may require the use of a reference method. If the results of the reference and alternative methods do not agree, the results obtained by the reference method prevail, and the Administrator may notify the owner or operator that approval of the method previously considered to be alternative is withdrawn. Whenever Method 107 is specified, and the conditions in Section 1.2, “Applicability” of Method 107A are met, Method 107A may be used.

(h)(1) Each piece of equipment within a process unit that can reasonably contain equipment in vinyl chloride service is presumed to be in vinyl chloride service unless an owner or operator demonstrates that the piece of equipment is not in vinyl chloride service. For a piece of equipment to be considered not in vinyl chloride service, it must be determined that the percent vinyl chloride content can be reasonably expected not to exceed 10 percent by weight for liquid streams or contained liquid volumes and 10 percent by volume for gas streams or contained gas volumes, which also includes gas volumes above liquid streams or contained liquid volumes. For purposes of determining the percent vinyl chloride content of the process fluid that is contained in or contacts equipment, procedures that conform to the methods described in ASTM D2267-68, 78, or 88 or D4420-94 (incorporated by reference as specified in § 61.18) shall be used.
(2)(i) An owner or operator may use engineering judgment rather than the procedures in paragraph (h)(1) of this section to demonstrate that the percent vinyl chloride content does not exceed 10 percent by weight for liquid streams and 10 percent by volume for gas streams, provided that the engineering judgment demonstrates that the vinyl chloride content clearly does not exceed 10 percent. When an owner or operator and the Administrator do not agree on whether a piece of equipment is not in vinyl chloride service, however, the procedures in paragraph (h)(1) of this section shall be used to resolve the disagreement.
(ii) If an owner or operator determines that a piece of equipment is in vinyl chloride service, the determination can be revised only after following the procedures in paragraph (h)(1) of this section.
(3) Samples used in determining the percent vinyl chloride content shall be representative of the process fluid that is contained in or contacts the equipment.

§ 61.68
Emission monitoring.
(a) A vinyl chloride monitoring system is to be used to monitor on a continuous basis the emissions from the sources for which emission limits are prescribed in §§ 61.62 (a) and (b), 61.63(a), and 61.64 (a)(1), (b), (c), and (d), and for any control system to which reactor emissions are required to be ducted in § 61.64(a)(2) or to which fugitive emissions are required to be ducted in § 61.65 (b)(1)(ii), and (b)(2), (b)(5), (b)(6) (ii), and (b)(9)(ii).
(b) The vinyl chloride monitoring system(s) used to meet the requirement in paragraph (a) of this section is to be a device which obtains representative samples from one or more applicable emission points on a continuous sequential basis and analyzes the samples with gas chromatography or, if the owner or operator assumes that all hydrocarbons measured are vinyl chloride, with infrared spectrophotometry, flame ion detection, or an alternative method. The vinyl chloride monitoring system used to meet the requirements in § 61.65(b)(8)(i) may be used to meet the requirements of this section.
(c) A daily span check is to be conducted for each vinyl chloride monitoring system used. For all of the emission sources listed in paragraph (a) of this section, except the one for which an emission limit is prescribed in § 61.62(b), the daily span check is to be conducted with a concentration of vinyl chloride equal to 10 ppm. For the emission source for which an emission limit is prescribed in § 61.62(b), the daily span check is to be conducted with a concentration of vinyl chloride which is determined to be equivalent to the emission limit for that source based on the emission test required by § 61.67. The calibration is to be done with either:
(1) A calibration gas mixture prepared from the gases specified in Sections 7.2.1 and 7.2.2 of Method 106 and in accordance with Section 10.1 of Method 106, or
(2) A calibration gas cylinder standard containing the appropriate concentration of vinyl chloride. The gas composition of the calibration gas cylinder standard is to have been certified by the manufacturer. The manufacturer must have recommended a maximum shelf life for each cylinder so that the concentration does not change greater than ±5 percent from the certified value. The date of gas cylinder preparation, certified vinyl chloride concentration and recommended maximum shelf life must have been affixed to the cylinder before shipment from the manufacturer to the buyer. If a gas chromatograph is used as the vinyl chloride monitoring system, these gas mixtures may be directly used to prepare a chromatograph calibration curve as described in Sections 8.1 and 9.2 of Method 106. The requirements in Sections 7.2.3.1 and 7.2.3.2 of Method 106 for certification of cylinder standards and for establishment and verification of calibration standards are to be followed.
(d) When exhaust gas(es), having emission limits that are subject to the requirement of paragraph (a) of this section, are emitted to the atmosphere without passing through the control system and required vinyl chloride monitoring system, the vinyl chloride content of the emission shall be calculated (in units of each applicable emission limit) by best practical engineering judgment based on the discharge duration and known VC concentrations in the affected equipment as determined in accordance with § 61.67(h) or other acceptable method.
(e) For each 3-hour period, the vinyl chloride content of emissions subject to the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (d) of this section shall be averaged (weighted according to the proportion of time that emissions were continuously monitored and that emissions bypassed the continuous monitor) for purposes of reporting excess emissions under § 61.70(c)(1).
(f) For each vinyl chloride emission to the atmosphere determined in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section to be in excess of the applicable emission limits, the owner or operator shall record the identity of the source(s), the date, time, and duration of the excess emission, the cause of the excess emission, and the approximate total vinyl chloride loss during the excess emission, and the method used for determining the vinyl chloride loss. This information shall be retained and made available for inspection by the Administrator as required by § 61.71(a).

The first report is to be submitted following the first full 3-month reporting period after the initial report is submitted.
(2) In the case of an existing source, the approved reporting schedule shall be used. In addition, quarterly reports shall be submitted exactly 3 months following the current reporting dates.
(b)(1) In the case of an existing source or a new source which has an initial startup date preceding the effective date, the first report is to be submitted within 180 days of the effective date, unless a waiver of compliance is granted under § 61.11. If a waiver of compliance is granted, the first report is to be submitted on a date scheduled by the Administrator.
(2) In the case of a new source which did not have an initial startup date preceding the effective date, the first report is to be submitted within 180 days of the initial startup date.
(c) Unless otherwise specified, the owner or operator shall use the test methods in appendix B to this part to conduct emission tests as required by paragraphs (c)(2) and (c)(3) of this section, unless an alternative method has been approved by the Administrator. If the Administrator finds reasonable grounds to dispute the results obtained by an alternative method, he may require the use of a reference method. If the results of the reference and alternative methods do not agree, the results obtained by the reference method prevail, and the Administrator may notify the owner or operator that approval of the method previously considered to be alternative is withdrawn.
(1) The owner or operator shall include in the report a record of the vinyl chloride content of emissions for each 3-hour period during which average emissions are in excess of the emission limits in § 61.62(a) or (b), § 61.63(a), or § 61.64(a)(1), (b), (c), or (d), or during which average emissions are in excess of the emission limits specified for any control system to which reactor emissions are required to be ducted in § 61.64(a)(2) or to which fugitive emissions are required to be ducted in § 61.65(b)(I)(ii), (b)(2), (b)(5), (b)(6)(ii), or (b)(9)(ii). The number of 3-hour periods for which average emissions were determined during the reporting period shall be reported.

(i) If batch stripping is used, one representative sample of polyvinyl chloride resin is to be taken from each batch of each grade of resin immediately following the completion of the stripping operation, and identified by resin type and grade and the date and time the batch is completed. The corresponding quantity of material processed in each stripper batch is to be recorded and identified by resin type and grade and the date and time the batch is completed.
(ii) If continuous stripping is used, one representative sample of polyvinyl chloride resin is to be taken for each grade of resin processed or at intervals of 8 hours for each grade of resin which is being processed, whichever is more frequent. The sample is to be taken as the resin flows out of the stripper and identified by resin type and grade and the date and time the sample was taken. The corresponding quantity of material processed by each stripper over the time period represented by the sample during the 8-hour period, is to be recorded and identified by resin type and grade and the date and time it represents.
(iii) The vinyl chloride content in each sample is to be determined by Method 107 as prescribed in § 61.67(g)(3).
(iv) [Reserved]
(v) The report to the Administrator by the owner or operator is to include a record of any 24-hour average resin vinyl chloride concentration, as determined in this paragraph, in excess of

# Subpart H—National Emission Standards for Emissions of Radionuclides Other Than Radon From Department of Energy Facilities

# Source:
54 FR 51695, Dec. 15, 1989, unless otherwise noted.
§ 61.90
Designation of facilities.
The provisions of this subpart apply to operations at any facility owned or operated by the Department of Energy that emits any radionuclide other than radon-222 and radon-220 into the air, except that this subpart does not apply to disposal at facilities subject to 40 CFR part 191, subpart B or 40 CFR part 192.
§ 61.91
Definitions.
As used in this subpart, all terms not defined here have the meaning given them in the Clean Air Act or 40 CFR part 61, subpart A. The following terms shall have the following specific meanings:
(a)
Effective dose equivalent
means the sum of the products of absorbed dose and appropriate factors to account for differences in biological effectiveness due to the quality of radiation and its distribution in the body of reference man. The unit of the effective dose equivalent is the rem. For purposes of this subpart, doses caused by radon-222 and its respective decay products formed after the radon is released from the facility are not included. The method for calculating effective dose equivalent and the definition of reference man are outlined in the International Commission on Radiological Protection's Publication No. 26.
(b)
Facility
means all buildings, structures and operations on one contiguous site.
(c)
Radionuclide
means a type of atom which spontaneously undergoes radioactive decay.
(d)
Residence
means any home, house, apartment building, or other place of dwelling which is occupied during any portion of the relevant year.
§ 61.92
Standard.
Emissions of radionuclides to the ambient air from Department of Energy facilities shall not exceed those amounts that would cause any member of the public to receive in any year an effective dose equivalent of 10 mrem/yr.
§ 61.93
Emission monitoring and test procedures.
(a) To determine compliance with the standard, radionuclide emissions shall be determined and effective dose equivalent values to members of the public calculated using EPA approved sampling procedures, computer models CAP-88 or AIRDOS-PC, or other procedures for which EPA has granted prior approval. DOE facilities for which the maximally exposed individual lives within 3 kilometers of all sources of emissions in the facility, may use EPA's COMPLY model and associated procedures for determining dose for purposes of compliance.
(b) Radionuclides emission rates from existing point sources (stacks or vents) shall be measured in accordance with the following requirements or with the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section, or other procedures for which EPA has granted prior approval:
(1) Effluent flow rate measurements shall be made using the following methods:
(i) Reference Method 2 of appendix A to part 60 of this chapter shall be used to determine velocity and volumetric flow rates for stacks and large vents.
(ii) Reference Method 2A of appendix A to part 60 of this chapter shall be used to measure flow rates through pipes and small vents.
(iii) The frequency of the flow rate measurements shall depend upon the variability of the effluent flow rate. For variable flow rates, continuous or frequent flow rate measurements shall be made. For relatively constant flow rates only periodic measurements are necessary.
(2) Radionuclides shall be directly monitored or extracted, collected and measured using the following methods:
(i) Reference Method 1 of appendix A to part 60 of this chapter shall be used to select monitoring or sampling sites.
(ii) The effluent stream shall be directly monitored continuously with an in-line detector or representative samples of the effluent stream shall be
withdrawn continuously from the sampling site following the guidance presented in ANSIN13.1-1969 “Guide to Sampling Airborne Radioactive Materials in Nuclear Facilities” (including the guidance presented in appendix A of ANSIN13.1) (incorporated by reference—see § 61.18). The requirements for continuous sampling are applicable to batch processes when the unit is in operation. Periodic sampling (grab samples) may be used only with EPA's prior approval. Such approval may be granted in cases where continuous sampling is not practical and radionuclide emission rates are relatively constant. In such cases, grab samples shall be collected with sufficient frequency so as to provide a representative sample of the emissions.
(iii) Radionuclides shall be collected and measured using procedures based on the principles of measurement described in appendix B, Method 114. Use of methods based on principles of measurement different from those described in appendix B, Method 114 must have prior approval from the Administrator. EPA reserves the right to approve measurement procedures.
(iv) A quality assurance program shall be conducted that meets the performance requirements described in appendix B, Method 114.
(3) When it is impractical to measure the effluent flow rate at an existing source in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (b)(1) of this section or to monitor or sample an effluent stream at an existing source in accordance with the site selection and sample extraction requirements of paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the facility owner or operator may use alternative effluent flow rate measurement procedures or site selection and sample extraction procedures provided that:
(i) It can be shown that the requirements of paragraph (b) (1) or (2) of this section are impractical for the effluent stream.
(ii) The alternative procedure will not significantly underestimate the emissions.
(iii) The alternative procedure is fully documented.
(iv) The owner or operator has received prior approval from EPA.
(4)(i) Radionuclide emission measurements in conformance with the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section shall be made at all release points which have a potential to discharge radionuclides into the air in quantities which could cause an effective dose equivalent in excess of 1% of the standard. All radionuclides which could contribute greater than 10% of the potential effective dose equivalent for a release point shall be measured. With prior EPA approval, DOE may determine these emissions through alternative procedures. For other release points which have a potential to release radionuclides into the air, periodic confirmatory measurements shall be made to verify the low emissions.
(ii) To determine whether a release point is subject to the emission measurement requirements of paragraph (b) of this section, it is necessary to evaluate the potential for radionuclide emissions for that release point. In evaluating the potential of a release point to discharge radionuclides into the air for the purposes of this section, the estimated radionuclide release rates shall be based on the discharge of the effluent stream that would result if all pollution control equipment did not exist, but the facilities operations were otherwise normal.
(5) Environmental measurements of radionuclide air concentrations at critical receptor locations may be used as an alternative to air dispersion calculations in demonstrating compliance with the standard if the owner or operator meets the following criteria:
(i) The air at the point of measurement shall be continuously sampled for collection of radionuclides.
(ii) Those radionuclides released from the facility, which are the major contributors to the effective dose equivalent must be collected and measured as part of the environmental measurement program.
(iii) Radionuclide concentrations which would cause an effective dose equivalent of 10% of the standard shall be readily detectable and distinguishable from background.
(iv) Net measured radionuclide concentrations shall be compared to the concentration levels in Table 2 of appendix E to determine compliance with
the standard. In the case of multiple radionuclides being released from a facility, compliance shall be demonstrated if the value for all radionuclides is less than the concentration level in Table 2, and the sum of the fractions that result when each measured concentration value is divided by the value in Table 2 for each radionuclide is less than 1.
(v) A quality assurance program shall be conducted that meets the performance requirements described in appendix B, Method 114.
(vi) Use of environmental measurements to demonstrate compliance with the standard is subject to prior approval of EPA. Applications for approval shall include a detailed description of the sampling and analytical methodology and show how the above criteria will be met.
(c) Radionuclide emission rates from new point sources (stacks or vents) as defined in subpart A shall be measured in accordance with the following requirements, or other procedures for which EPA has granted prior approval:
(1) Effluent flow rate measurements shall be made using the following methods:
(i) ANSI/HPS N13.1-1999 “Sampling and Monitoring Releases of Airborne Radioactive Substances from the Stacks and Ducts of Nuclear Facilities' (incorporated by reference—see § 61.18) shall be used to determine velocity and volumetric flow rates for stacks and large vents.
(ii) ANSI/HPS N13.1-1999 shall be used to measure flow rates through pipes and small vents.
(iii) The frequency of the flow rate measurements shall depend upon variability of the effluent flow rate. For variable flow rates, continuous or frequent flow rate measurements shall be made. For relatively constant flow rates only periodic measurements are necessary.
(2) Radionuclide shall be directly monitored or extracted, collected and measured using the following methods:
(i) ANSI/HPS N13.1-1999 shall be used to select monitoring or sampling sites.
(ii) The effluent stream shall be directly monitored continuously with an in-line detector or representative samples of the effluent stream shall be withdrawn continuously from the sampling site following the guidance presented in ANSI/HPS N13.1-1999. The requirements for continuous sampling are applicable to batch processes when the unit is in operation. Periodic sampling (grab samples) may be used only with EPA's prior approval. Such approval may be granted in cases where continuous sampling is not practical and radionuclide emission rates are relatively constant. In such cases, grab samples shall be collected with sufficient frequency so as to provide a representative sample of the emissions.
(iii) Radionuclides shall be collected and measured using procedures based on the principles of measurement described in appendix B, Method 114 of this part. Use of methods based on principles of measurement different from those described in appendix B, Method 114 of this part must have prior approval from the Administrator. EPA reserves the right to approve measurement procedures.
(iv) A quality assurance program shall be conducted that meets the performance requirements described in ANSI/HPS N13.1-1999.
(d) When it is impractical to measure the effluent flow rate at a source in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (b)(1) or (c) of this section or to monitor or sample an effluent stream at a source in accordance with the site selection and sample extraction requirements of paragraph (b)(2) or (c) of this section, the facility owner or operator may use alternative effluent flow rate measurement procedures or site selection and sample extraction procedures provided that:
(1) It can be shown that the requirements of paragraph (b)(1) or (2) or (c) of this section are impractical for the effluent stream.
(2) The alternative procedure will not significantly underestimate the emissions.
(3) The alternative procedure is fully documented.
(4) The owner or operator has received prior approval from EPA.
(e) Radionuclide emission measurements in conformance with the requirements of paragraph (b) or (c) of this section shall be made at all release
points that have a potential to discharge radionuclides into the air in quantities that could cause an effective dose equivalent in excess of 1% of the standard. All radionuclides that could contribute greater than 10% of the potential effective dose equivalent for a release point shall be measured. With prior EPA approval, DOE may determine these emissions through alternative procedures. For other release points that have a potential to release radionuclides into the air, periodic confirmatory measurements shall be made to verify the low emissions.
(f) To determine whether a release point is subject to the emission measurement requirements of paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, it is necessary to evaluate the potential for radionuclide emissions for that release point. In evaluating the potential of a release point to discharge radionuclides into the air for the purposes of this section, the estimated radionuclide release rates shall be based on the discharge of the effluent stream that would result if all pollution control equipment did not exist, but the facilities operations were otherwise normal.
(g) Environmental measurements of radionuclide air concentrations at critical receptor locations may be used as an alternative to air dispersion calculations in demonstrating compliance with the standard if the owner or operator meets the following criteria:
(1) The air at the point of measurement shall be continuously sampled for collection of radionuclides.
(2) Those radionuclides released from the facility that are the major contributors to the effective dose equivalent must be collected and measured as part of the environmental measurement program.
(3) Radionuclide concentrations that would cause an effective dose equivalent of 10% of the standard shall be readily detectable and distinguishable from background.
(4) Net measured radionuclide concentrations shall be compared to the concentration levels in Table 2 appendix E of this part to determine compliance with the standard. In the case of multiple radionuclides being released from a facility, compliance shall be demonstrated if the value for all radionuclides is less than the concentration level in Table 2 of appendix E of this part, and the sum of the fractions that result when each measured concentration value is divided by the value in Table 2 of appendix E of this part for each radionuclide is less than 1.
(5) A quality assurance program shall be conducted that meets the performance requirements described in appendix B, Method 114 of this part.
(6) Use of environmental measurements to demonstrate compliance with the standard is subject to prior approval of EPA. Applications for approval shall include a detailed description of the sampling and analytical methodology and show how the above criteria will be met.

business or office and the nearest farms producing vegetables, milk, and meat.
(7) The values used for all other user-supplied input parameters for the computer models (e.g., meteorological data) and the source of these data.
(8) A brief description of all construction and modifications which were completed in the calendar year for which the report is prepared, but for which the requirement to apply for approval to construct or modify was waived under § 61.96 and associated documentation developed by DOE to support the waiver. EPA reserves the right to require that DOE send to EPA all the information that normally would be required in an application to construct or modify, following receipt of the description and supporting documentation.
(9) Each report shall be signed and dated by a corporate officer or public official in charge of the facility and contain the following declaration immediately above the signature line: “I certify under penalty of law that I have personally examined and am familiar with the information submitted herein and based on my inquiry of those individuals immediately responsible for obtaining the information, I believe that the submitted information is true, accurate and complete. I am aware that there are significant penalties for submitting false information including the possibility of fine and imprisonment. See, 18 U.S.C. 1001.”
(c) If the facility is not in compliance with the emission limits of § 61.92 in the calendar year covered by the report, then the facility must commence reporting to the Administrator on a monthly basis the information listed in paragraph (b) of this section, for the preceding month. These reports will start the month immediately following the submittal of the annual report for the year in noncompliance and will be due 30 days following the end of each month. This increased level of reporting will continue until the Administrator has determined that the monthly reports are no longer necessary. In addition to all the information required in paragraph (b) of this section, monthly reports shall also include the following information:

§ 61.95
Recordkeeping requirements.
All facilities must maintain records documenting the source of input parameters including the results of all measurements upon which they are based, the calculations and/or analytical methods used to derive values for input parameters, and the procedure used to determine effective dose equivalent. This documentation should be sufficient to allow an independent auditor to verify the accuracy of the determination made concerning the facility's compliance with the standard. These records must be kept at the site of the facility for at least five years and, upon request, be made available for inspection by the Administrator, or his authorized representative.
§ 61.96
Applications to construct or modify.
(a) In addition to any activity that is defined as construction under 40 CFR part 61, subpart A, any fabrication, erection or installation of a new building or structure within a facility that emits radionuclides is also defined as new construction for purposes of 40 CFR part 61, subpart A.
(b) An application for approval under § 61.07 or notification of startup under § 61.09 does not need to be filed for any new construction of or modification within an existing facility if the effective dose equivalent, caused by all emissions from the new construction or modification, is less than 1% of the standard prescribed in § 61.92. For purposes of this paragraph the effective dose equivalent shall be calculated
using the source term derived using appendix D as input to the dispersion and other computer models described in § 61.93. DOE may, with prior approval from EPA, use another procedure for estimating the source term for use in this paragraph. A facility is eligible for this exemption only if, based on its last annual report, the facility is in compliance with this subpart.
(c) Conditions to approvals granted under § 61.08 will not contain requirements for post approval reporting on operating conditions beyond those specified in § 61.94.

# Subpart K—National Emission Standards for Radionuclide Emissions From Elemental Phosphorus Plants

# Source:
54 FR 51699, Dec. 15, 1989, unless otherwise noted.
§ 61.120
Applicability.
The provisions of this subpart are applicable to owners or operators of calciners and nodulizing kilns at elemental phosphorus plants.
§ 61.121
Definitions.
(a)
Elemental phosphorus plant
or
plant
means any facility that processes phosphate rock to produce elemental phosphorus. A plant includes all buildings, structures, operations, calciners and nodulizing kilns on one contiguous site.
(b)
Calciner
or
Nodulizing kiln
means a unit in which phosphate rock is heated to high temperatures to remove organic material and/or to convert it to a nodular form. For the purpose of this subpart, calciners and nodulizing kilns are considered to be similar units.
§ 61.122
Emission standard.
Emissions of polonium-210 to the ambient air from all calciners and nodulizing kilns at an elemental phosphorus plant shall not exceed a total of 2 curies a year; except that compliance with this standard may be conclusively shown if the elemental phosphorus plant:
(a) Installs a Hydro-Sonic ® Tandem Nozzle Fixed Throat Free-Jet Scrubber System including four scrubber units,
(b) All four scrubber units are operated continuously with a minimum average over any 6-hour period of 40 inches (water column) of pressure drop across each scrubber during calcining of phosphate shale,
(c) The system is used to scrub emissions from all calciners and/or nodulizing kilns at the plant, and
(d) Total emissions of polonium-210 from the plant do not exceed 4.5 curies per year.
Alternative operating conditions, which can be shown to achieve an overall removal efficiency for emissions of polonium-210 which is equal to or greater than the efficiency which would be achieved under the operating conditions described in paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section, may be used with prior approval of the Administrator. A facility shall apply for such approval in writing, and the Administrator shall act upon the request within 30 days after receipt of a complete and technically sufficient application.
[56 FR 65943, Dec. 19, 1991]
§ 61.123
Emission testing.
(a) Each owner or operator of an elemental phosphorus plant shall test emissions from the plant within 90 days of the effective date of this standard and annually thereafter. The Administrator may temporarily or permanently waive the annual testing requirement or increase the frequency of testing, if the Administrator determines that more testing is required.
(b) The Administrator shall be notified at least 30 days prior to an emission test so that EPA may, at its option, observe the test.
(c) An emission test shall be conducted at each operational calciner or nodulizing kiln. If emissions from a calciner or nodulizing kiln are discharged through more than one stack, then an emission test shall be conducted at each stack and the total emission rate from the calciner or kiln shall be the sum of the emission rates from each of the stacks.
(d) Each emission test shall consist of three sampling runs that meet the requirements of § 61.125. The phosphate rock processing rate during each run shall be recorded. An emission rate in curies per Mg or curies per ton of phosphate rock processed shall be calculated for each run. The average of all three runs shall apply in computing the emission rate for the test. The annual polonium-210 emission rate from a calciner or nodulizing kiln shall be determined by multiplying the measured polonium-210 emission rate in curies per Mg or curies per ton of phosphate rock processed by the annual phosphate rock processing rate in Mg (tons). In determining the annual phosphate rock processing rate, the values used for operating hours and operating capacity shall be values that will maximize the expected processing rate. For determining compliance with the emission standard of § 61.122, the total annual emission rate is the sum of the annual emission rates for all operating calciners and nodulizing kilns.
(e) If the owner or operator changes his operation in such a way as to increase his emissions of polonium-210, such as changing the type of rock processed, the temperature of the calciners or kilns, or increasing the annual phosphate rock processing rate, then a new emission test, meeting the requirements of this section, shall be conducted within 45 days under these conditions.
(f) Each owner or operator of an elemental phosphorus plant shall furnish the Administrator with a written report of the results of the emission test within 60 days of conducting the test.
The report must provide the following information:
(1) The name and location of the facility.
(2) The name of the person responsible for the operation of the facility and the name of the person preparing the report (if different).
(3) A description of the effluent controls that are used on each stack, vent, or other release point and an estimate of the efficiency of each device.
(4) The results of the testing, including the results of each sampling run completed.
(5) The values used in calculating the emissions and the source of these data.
(6) Each report shall be signed and dated by a corporate officer in charge of the facility and contain the following declaration immediately above the signature line: “I certify under penalty of law that I have personally examined and am familiar with the information submitted herein and based on my inquiry of those individuals immediately responsible for obtaining the information, I believe that the submitted information is true, accurate and complete. I am aware that there are significant penalties for submitting false information including the possibility of fine and imprisonment. See, 18 U.S.C. 1001.”

Recordkeeping requirements.
The owner or operator of any plant must maintain records documenting the source of input parameters including the results of all measurements upon which they are based, the calculations and/or analytical methods used to derive values for input parameters, and the procedure used in emission testing. This documentation should be sufficient to allow an independent auditor to verify the accuracy of the results of the emission testing. These records must be kept at the site of the plant for at least five years and, upon request, be made available for inspection by the Administrator, or his authorized representative.
§ 61.125
Test methods and procedures.
(a) Each owner or operator of a source required to test emissions under § 61.123, unless an equivalent or alternate method has been approved by the Administrator, shall use the following test methods:
(1) Method 1 of appendix A to 40 CFR part 60 shall be used to determine sample and velocity traverses;
(2) Method 2 of appendix A to 40 CFR part 60 shall be used to determine velocity and volumetric flow rate;

§ 61.139
Provisions for alternative means for process vessels, storage tanks, and tar-intercepting sumps.
(a) As an alternative means of emission limitation for a source subject to § 61.132(a)(2) or § 61.132(d), the owner or operator may route gases from the source through a closed vent system to a carbon adsorber or vapor incinerator that is at least 98 percent efficient at removing benzene from the gas stream.
(1) The provisions of § 61.132(a)(1) and § 61.132(a) (2)(i) and (ii) shall apply to the source.
(2) The seals on the source and closed vent system shall be designed and operated for no detectable emissions, as indicated by an instrument reading of less than 500 ppm above background and visual inspections, as determined by the methods specified in § 61.245(c).
(3) The provisions of § 61.132(b) shall apply to the seals and closed vent system.
(b) For each carbon adsorber, the owner or operator shall adhere to the following practices:
(1) Benzene captured by each carbon adsorber shall be recycled or destroyed in a manner that prevents benzene from being emitted to the atmosphere.
(2) Carbon removed from each carbon adsorber shall be regenerated or destroyed in a manner that prevents benzene from being emitted to the atmosphere.
(3) For each regenerative carbon adsorber, the owner or operator shall initiate regeneration of the spent carbon bed and vent the emissions from the source to a regenerated carbon bed no later than when the benzene concentration or organic vapor concentration level in the adsorber outlet vent reaches the maximum concentration point, as determined in § 61.139(h).
(4) For each non-regenerative carbon adsorber, the owner or operator shall
replace the carbon at the scheduled replacement time, or as soon as practicable (but not later than 16 hours) after an exceedance of the maximum concentration point is detected, whichever is sooner.
(i) For each non-regenerative carbon adsorber, the scheduled replacement time means the day that is estimated to be 90 percent of the demonstrated bed life, as defined in § 61.139(h)(5).
(ii) For each non-regenerative carbon adsorber, an exceedance of the maximum concentration point shall mean any concentration greater than or equal to the maximum concentration point as determined in § 61.139(h).
(c) Compliance with the provisions of this section shall be determined as follows:
(1) For each carbon adsorber and vapor incinerator, the owner or operator shall demonstrate compliance with the efficiency limit by a compliance test as specified in § 61.13 and § 61.139(g). If a waiver of compliance has been granted under § 61.11, the deadline for conducting the initial compliance test shall be incorporated into the terms of the waiver. The benzene removal efficiency rate for each carbon adsorber and vapor incinerator shall be calculated as in the following equation:
61-70a.eps
Where:
E = percent removal of benzene.
C
aj
= concentration of benzene in vents after the control device, parts per million (ppm).
C
bi
= concentration of benzene in vents before the control device, ppm.
Q
aj
= volumetric flow rate in vents after the control device, standard cubic meters/minute (scm/min) [standard cubic feet/minute (scf/min)].
Q
bi
= volumetric flow rate in vents before the control device, scm/min (scf/min).
m = number of vents after the control device.
n = number of vents after the control device.
(2) Compliance with all other provisions in this section shall be determined by inspections or the review of records and reports.
(d) For each regenerative carbon adsorber, the owner or operator shall install and operate a monitoring device that continuously indicates and records either the concentration of benzene or the concentration level of organic compounds in the outlet vent of the carbon adsorber. The monitoring device shall be installed, calibrated, maintained and operated in accordance with the manufacturer's specifications.
(1) Measurement of benzene concentration shall be made according to § 61.139(g)(2).
(2) All measurements of organic compound concentration levels shall be reasonable indicators of benzene concentration.
(i) The monitoring device for measuring organic compound concentration levels shall be based on one of the following detection principles: Infrared absorption, flame ionization, catalytic oxidation, photoionization, or thermal conductivity.
(ii) The monitoring device shall meet the requirements of part 60, appendix A, Method 21, sections 2, 3, 4.1, 4.2, and 4.4. For the purpose of the application of Method 21 to this section, the words “leak definition” shall be the maximum concentration point, which would be estimated until it is established under § 61.139(h). The calibration gas shall either be benzene or methane and shall be at a concentration associated with 125 percent of the expected organic compound concentration level for the carbon adsorber outlet vent.
(e) For each non-regenerative carbon adsorber, the owner or operator shall monitor either the concentration of benzene or the concentration level of organic compounds at the outlet vent of the adsorber. The monitoring device shall be calibrated, operated and maintained in accordance with the manufacturer's specifications.
(1) Measurements of benzene concentration shall be made according to § 61.139(g)(2). The measurement shall be conducted over at least one 5-minute interval during which flow into the carbon adsorber is expected to occur.
(2) All measurements of organic compound concentration levels shall be reasonable indicators of benzene concentration.
(i) The monitoring device for measuring organic compound concentration levels shall meet the requirements of paragraphs § 61.139(d)(2) (i) and (ii).
(ii) The probe inlet of the monitoring device shall be placed at approximately the center of the carbon adsorber outlet vent. The probe shall be held there for at least 5 minutes during which flow into the carbon adsorber is expected to occur. The maximum reading during that period shall be used as the measurement.
(3) Monitoring shall be performed at least once within the first 7 days after replacement of the carbon bed occurs, and monthly thereafter until 10 days before the scheduled replacement time, at which point monitoring shall be done daily, except as specified in paragraphs (e)(4) and (e)(5) of this section.
(4) If an owner or operator detects an exceedance of the maximum concentration point during the monthly monitoring or on the first day of daily monitoring as prescribed in paragraph (e)(3) of this section, then, after replacing the bed, the owner or operator shall begin the daily monitoring of the replacement carbon bed on the day after the last scheduled monthly monitoring before the exceedance was detected, or 10 days before the exceedance was detected, whichever is longer.
(5) If an owner or operator detects an exceedance of the maximum concentration point during the daily monitoring as prescribed in paragraph (e)(3) of this section, except on the first day, then, after replacing the bed, the owner or operator shall begin the daily monitoring of the replacement carbon bed 10 days before the exceedance was detected.
(6) If the owner or operator is monitoring on the schedule required in paragraph (e)(4) or paragraph (e)(5) of this section, and the scheduled replacement time is reached without exceeding the maximum concentration point, the owner or operator may return to the monitoring schedule in paragraph (e)(3) of this section for subsequent carbon beds.

# Note:
This note provides an example of the monitoring schedules in paragraphs (e)(3), (e)(4) and (e)(5) of this section. Assume that the scheduled replacement time for a non-regenerative carbon adsorber is the 105th day after installation. According to the monitoring schedule in paragraph (e)(3) of this section, initial monitoring would be done within 7 days after installation, monthly monitoring would be done on the 30th, 60th and 90th days, and daily monitoring would begin on the 95th day after installation. Now assume that an exceedance of the maximum concentration point is detected on the 90th day after installation. On the replacement carbon bed, the owner or operator would begin daily monitoring on the 61st day after installation (i.e., the day after the last scheduled monthly monitoring before the exceedance was detected), according to the requirements in paragraph (e)(4) of this section. If, instead, the exceedance were detected on the first bed on the 95th day, the daily monitoring of the replacement bed would begin on the 85th day after installation (i.e., 10 days before the point in the cycle where the exceedance was detected); this is a second example of the requirements in paragraph (e)(4) of this section. Finally, assume that an exceedance of the maximum concentration point is detected on the 100th day after the first carbon adsorber was installed. According to paragraph (e)(5) of this section, daily monitoring of the replacement bed would begin on the 90th day after installation (i.e., 10 days earlier than when the exceedance was detected on the previous bed). In all of these examples, the initial monitoring of the replacement bed within 7 days of installation and the monthly monitoring would proceed as set out in paragraph (e)(3) of this section until daily monitoring was required.
(f) For each vapor incinerator, the owner or operator shall comply with the monitoring requirements specified below:
(1) Install, calibrate, maintain, and operate according to the manufacturer's specifications a temperature monitoring device equipped with a continuous recorder and having an accuracy of ±1 percent of the temperature being monitored expressed in degrees Celsius or ±0.5 °C, whichever is greater.
(i) Where a vapor incinerator other than a catalytic incinerator is used, the temperature monitoring device shall be installed in the firebox.
(ii) Where a catalytic incinerator is used, temperature monitoring devices shall be installed in the gas stream immediately before and after the catalyst bed.
(2) Comply with paragraph (f)(2)(i), paragraph (f)(2)(ii), or paragraph (f)(3)(iii) of this section.
(i) Install, calibrate, maintain and operate according to the manufacturer's specifications a flow indicator that provides a record of vent stream flow to the incinerator at least once every hour for each source. The flow indicator shall be installed in the vent stream from each source at a point closest to the inlet of each vapor incinerator and before being joined with any other vent stream.
(ii) Install, calibrate, maintain and operate according to the manufacturer's specifications a flow indicator that provides a record of vent stream flow away from the vapor incinerator at least once every 15 minutes. The flow indicator shall be installed in each bypass line, immediately downstream of the valve that, if opened, would divert the vent stream away from the vapor incinerator.
(iii) Where a valve that opens a bypass line is secured in the closed position with a car seal or a lock-and-key configuration, a flow indicator is not required. The owner or operator shall perform a visual inspection at least once every month to check the position of the valve and the condition of the car seal or lock-and-key configuration. The owner or operator shall also record the date and duration of each time that the valve was opened and the vent stream diverted away from the vapor incinerator.
(g) In conducting the compliance tests required in § 61.139(c), and measurements specified in § 61.139(d)(1), (e)(1) and (h)(3)(ii), the owner or operator shall use as reference methods the test methods and procedures in appendix A to 40 CFR part 60, or other methods as specified in this paragraph, except as specified in § 61.13.
(1) For compliance tests, as described in § 61.139(c)(1), the following provisions apply.
(i) All tests shall be run under representative emission concentration and vent flow rate conditions. For sources with intermittent flow rates, representative conditions shall include typical emission surges (for example, during the loading of a storage tank).
(ii) Each test shall consist of three separate runs. These runs will be averaged to yield the volumetric flow rates and benzene concentrations in the equation in § 61.139(c)(1). Each run shall be a minimum of 1 hour.
(A) For each regenerative carbon adsorber, each run shall take place in one adsorption cycle, to include a minimum of 1 hour of sampling immediately preceding the initiation of carbon bed regeneration.
(B) For each non-regenerative carbon adsorber, all runs can occur during one adsorption cycle.
(iii) The measurements during the runs shall be paired so that the inlet and outlet to the control device are measured simultaneously.
(iv) Method 1 or 1A shall be used as applicable for locating measurement sites.
(v) Method 2, 2A, or 2D shall be used as applicable for measuring vent flow rates.
(vi) Method 18 shall be used for determining the benzene concentrations (C
aj
and C
bi
). Either the integrated bag sampling and analysis procedure or the direct interface procedure may be used. A separation column constructed of stainless steel, 1.83 m by 3.2 mm, containing 10 percent 1,2,3-tris (2-cyanoethoxy) propane (TECP) on 80/100 mesh Chromosorb P AW, with a column temperature of 80 °C, a detector temperature of 225 °C, and a flow rate of approximately 20 ml/min, may produce adequate separations. The analyst can use other columns, provided that the precision and accuracy of the analysis of benzene standards is not impaired. The analyst shall have available for review information confirming that there is adequate resolution of the benzene peak.
(A) If the integrated bag sampling and analysis procedure is used, the sample rate shall be adjusted to maintain a constant proportion to vent flow rate.
(B) If the direct interface sampling and analysis procedure is used, then each performance test run shall be conducted in intervals of 5 minutes. For each interval “t,” readings from each measurement shall be recorded, and the flow rate (Q
aj
or Q
bi
) and the corresponding benzene concentration (C
aj
or C
bi
) shall be determined. The sampling system shall be constructed to include a mixing chamber of a volume equal to 5 times the sampling flow rate
per minute. Each analysis performed by the chromatograph will then represent an averaged emission value for a 5-minute time period. The vent flow rate readings shall be timed to account for the total sample system residence time. A dual column, dual detector chromatograph can be used to achieve an analysis interval of 5 minutes. The individual benzene concentrations shall be vent flow rate weighted to determine sample run average concentrations. The individual vent flow rates shall be time averaged to determine sample run average flow rates.
(2) For testing the benzene concentration at the outlet vent of the carbon adsorber as specified under §§ 61.139(d)(1), (e)(1) and (h)(3)(ii), the following provisions apply.
(i) The measurement shall be conducted over one 5-minute period.
(ii) The requirements in § 61.139(g)(1)(i) shall apply to the extent practicable.
(iii) The requirements in § 61.139(g)(1)(vi) shall apply. Section 7.2 of method 18 shall be used as described in § 61.139(g)(1)(vi)(B) for benzene concentration measurements.
(h) For each carbon adsorber, the maximum concentration point shall be expressed either as a benzene concentration or organic compound concentration level, whichever is to be indicated by the monitoring device chosen under § 61.139 (d) or (e).
(1) For each regenerative carbon adsorber, the owner or operator shall determine the maximum concentration point at the following times:
(i) No later than the deadline for the initial compliance test as specified in § 61.139(c)(1);
(ii) At the request of the Administrator; and
(iii) At any time chosen by the owner or operator.
(2) For each non-regenerative carbon adsorber, the owner or operator shall determine the maximum concentration point at the following times:
(i) On the first carbon bed to be installed in the adsorber;
(ii) At the request of the Administrator;
(iii) On the next carbon bed after the maximum concentration point has been exceeded (before the scheduled replacement time) for each of three previous carbon beds in the adsorber since the most recent determination; and
(iv) At any other time chosen by the owner or operator.
(3) The maximum concentration point for each carbon adsorber shall be determined through the simultaneous measurement of the outlet of the carbon adsorber with the monitoring device and Method 18, except as allowed in paragraph (h)(4) of this section.
(i) Several data points shall be collected according to a schedule determined by the owner or operator. The schedule shall be designed to take frequent samples near the expected maximum concentration point.
(ii) Each data point shall consist of one 5-minute benzene concentration measurement using Method 18 as specified in § 61.139(g)(2), and of a simultaneous measurement by the monitoring device. The monitoring device measurement shall be conducted according to § 61.139 (d) or (e), whichever is applicable.
(iii) The maximum concentration point shall be the concentration level, as indicated by the monitoring device, for the last data point at which the benzene concentration is less than 2 percent of the average value of the benzene concentration at the inlet to the carbon adsorber during the most recent compliance test.
(4) If the maximum concentration point is expressed as a benzene concentration, the owner or operator may determine it by calibrating the monitoring device with benzene at a concentration that is 2 percent of the average benzene concentration measured at the inlet to the carbon adsorber during the most recent compliance test. The reading on the monitoring device corresponding to the calibration concentration shall be the maximum concentration point. This method of determination would affect the owner or operator as follows:
(i) For a regenerative carbon adsorber, the owner or operator is exempt from the provisions in paragraph (h)(3) of this section.
(ii) For a non-regenerative carbon adsorber, the owner or operator is required to collect the data points in paragraph (h)(3) of this section with
only the monitoring device, and is exempt from the simultaneous Method 18 measurement.
(5) For each non-regenerative carbon adsorber, the demonstrated bed life shall be the carbon bed life, measured in days from the time the bed is installed until the maximum concentration point is reached, for the carbon bed that is used to determine the maximum concentration point.
(i) The following recordkeeping requirements are applicable to owners and operators of control devices subject to § 61.139. All records shall be kept updated and in a readily accessible location.
(1) The following information shall be recorded for each control device for the life of the control device:
(i) The design characteristics of the control device and a list of the source or sources vented to it.

(2) For each compliance test as specified in § 61.139(c)(1), the date of the test, the results of the test, and other data needed to determine emissions shall be recorded as specified in § 61.13(g) for at least 2 years or until the next compliance test on the control device, whichever is longer.
(3) For each vapor incinerator, the average firebox temperature of the incinerator (or the average temperature upstream and downstream of the catalyst bed for a catalytic incinerator), measured and averaged over the most recent compliance test shall be recorded for at least 2 years or until the next compliance test on the incinerator, whichever is longer.
(4) For each carbon adsorber, for each determination of a maximum concentration point as specified in § 61.139(h), the date of the determination, the maximum concentration point, and data needed to make the determination shall be recorded for at least 2 years or until the next maximum concentration point determination on the carbon adsorber, whichever is longer.
(5) For each carbon absorber, the dates of and data from the monitoring required in § 61.139(d) and (e), the date and time of replacement of each carbon bed, the date of each exceedance of the maximum concentration point, and a brief description of the corrective action taken shall be recorded for at least 2 years. Also, the occurrences when the captured benzene or spent carbon are not handled as required in § 61.139(b)(1) and (2) shall be recorded for at least 2 years.

Demolition
means the wrecking or taking out of any load-supporting structural member of a facility together with any related handling operations or the intentional burning of any facility.
Emergency renovation operation
means a renovation operation that was not planned but results from a sudden, unexpected event that, if not immediately attended to, presents a safety or public health hazard, is necessary to protect equipment from damage, or is necessary to avoid imposing an unreasonable financial burden. This term includes operations necessitated by nonroutine failures of equipment.
Fabricating
means any processing (
e.g.,
cutting, sawing, drilling) of a manufactured product that contains commercial asbestos, with the exception of processing at temporary sites (field fabricating) for the construction or restoration of facilities. In the case of friction products, fabricating includes bonding, debonding, grinding, sawing, drilling, or other similar operations performed as part of fabricating.

For purposes of this definition, any building, structure, or installation that contains a loft used as a dwelling is not considered a residential structure, installation, or building. Any structure, installation or building that was previously subject to this subpart is not excluded, regardless of its current use or function.
Facility component
means any part of a facility including equipment.
Friable asbestos material
means any material containing more than 1 percent asbestos as determined using the method specified in appendix E, subpart E, 40 CFR part 763, section 1, Polarized Light Microscopy, that, when dry, can be crumbled, pulverized, or reduced to powder by hand pressure.

Each owner or operator of a demolition or renovation activity to whom this paragraph applies, according to paragraph (a) of this section, shall comply with the following procedures:
(1) Remove all RACM from a facility being demolished or renovated before any activity begins that would break up, dislodge, or similarly disturb the material or preclude access to the material for subsequent removal. RACM need not be removed before demolition if:
(i) It is Category I nonfriable ACM that is not in poor condition and is not friable.
(ii) It is on a facility component that is encased in concrete or other similarly hard material and is adequately wet whenever exposed during demolition; or
(iii) It was not accessible for testing and was, therefore, not discovered until after demolition began and, as a result of the demolition, the material cannot be safely removed. If not removed for safety reasons, the exposed RACM and any asbestos-contaminated debris must be treated as asbestos-containing waste material and adequately wet at all times until disposed of.
(iv) They are Category II nonfriable ACM and the probability is low that the materials will become crumbled, pulverized, or reduced to powder during demolition.
(2) When a facility component that contains, is covered with, or is coated with RACM is being taken out of the facility as a unit or in sections:
(i) Adequately wet all RACM exposed during cutting or disjoining operations; and
(ii) Carefully lower each unit or section to the floor and to ground level, not dropping, throwing, sliding, or otherwise damaging or disturbing the RACM.
(3) When RACM is stripped from a facility component while it remains in place in the facility, adequately wet the RACM during the stripping operation.
(i) In renovation operations, wetting is not required if:
(A) The owner or operator has obtained prior written approval from the Administrator based on a written application that wetting to comply with this paragraph would unavoidably damage equipment or present a safety hazard; and
(B) The owner or operator uses of the following emission control methods:
(
1
) A local exhaust ventilation and collection system designed and operated to capture the particulate asbestos material produced by the stripping and removal of the asbestos materials. The system must exhibit no visible emissions to the outside air or be designed and operated in accordance with the requirements in § 61.152.
(
2
) A glove-bag system designed and operated to contain the particulate asbestos material produced by the stripping of the asbestos materials.
(
3
) Leak-tight wrapping to contain all RACM prior to dismantlement.
(ii) In renovation operations where wetting would result in equipment damage or a safety hazard, and the methods allowed in paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section cannot be used, another method may be used after obtaining written approval from the Administrator based upon a determination that it is equivalent to wetting in controlling emissions or to the methods allowed in paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section.
(iii) A copy of the Administrator's written approval shall be kept at the worksite and made available for inspection.
(4) After a facility component covered with, coated with, or containing RACM has been taken out of the facility as a unit or in sections pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) of this section, it shall be stripped or contained in leak-tight wrapping, except as described in paragraph (c)(5) of this section. If stripped, either:
(i) Adequately wet the RACM during stripping; or
(ii) Use a local exhaust ventilation and collection system designed and operated to capture the particulate asbestos material produced by the stripping. The system must exhibit no visible emissions to the outside air or be designed and operated in accordance with the requirements in § 61.152.
(5) For large facility components such as reactor vessels, large tanks, and steam generators, but not beams (which must be handled in accordance with paragraphs (c)(2), (3), and (4) of this section), the RACM is not required to be stripped if the following requirements are met:
(i) The component is removed, transported, stored, disposed of, or reused without disturbing or damaging the RACM.
(ii) The component is encased in a leak-tight wrapping.
(iii) The leak-tight wrapping is labeled according to § 61.149(d)(1)(i), (ii), and (iii) during all loading and unloading operations and during storage.
(6) For all RACM, including material that has been removed or stripped:
(i) Adequately wet the material and ensure that it remains wet until collected and contained or treated in preparation for disposal in accordance with § 61.150; and
(ii) Carefully lower the material to the ground and floor, not dropping, throwing, sliding, or otherwise damaging or disturbing the material.
(iii) Transport the material to the ground via leak-tight chutes or containers if it has been removed or stripped more than 50 feet above ground level and was not removed as units or in sections.
(iv) RACM contained in leak-tight wrapping that has been removed in accordance with paragraphs (c)(4) and (c)(3)(i)(B)(
3
) of this section need not be wetted.
(7) When the temperature at the point of wetting is below 0 °C (32 °F):
(i) The owner or operator need not comply with paragraph (c)(2)(i) and the wetting provisions of paragraph (c)(3) of this section.
(ii) The owner or operator shall remove facility components containing, coated with, or covered with RACM as units or in sections to the maximum extent possible.
(iii) During periods when wetting operations are suspended due to freezing temperatures, the owner or operator must record the temperature in the area containing the facility components at the beginning, middle, and end of each workday and keep daily temperature records available for inspection by the Administrator during normal business hours at the demolition or renovation site. The owner or operator shall retain the temperature records for at least 2 years.
(8) Effective 1 year after promulgation of this regulation, no RACM shall
be stripped, removed, or otherwise handled or disturbed at a facility regulated by this section unless at least one on-site representative, such as a foreman or management-level person or other authorized representative, trained in the provisions of this regulation and the means of complying with them, is present. Every 2 years, the trained on-site individual shall receive refresher training in the provisions of this regulation. The required training shall include as a minimum: applicability; notifications; material identification; control procedures for removals including, at least, wetting, local exhaust ventilation, negative pressure enclosures, glove-bag procedures, and High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filters; waste disposal work practices; reporting and recordkeeping; and asbestos hazards and worker protection. Evidence that the required training has been completed shall be posted and made available for inspection by the Administrator at the demolition or renovation site.
(9) For facilities described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, adequately wet the portion of the facility that contains RACM during the wrecking operation.
(10) If a facility is demolished by intentional burning, all RACM including Category I and Category II nonfriable ACM must be removed in accordance with the NESHAP before burning.

# Appendix A to Subpart M of Part 61—Interpretive Rule Governing Roof Removal Operations

# I. Applicability of the Asbestos NESHAP
1.1. Asbestos-containing material (ACM) is material containing more than one percent asbestos as determined using the methods specified in appendix E, subpart E, 40 CFR part 763, section 1, Polarized Light Microscopy. The NESHAP classifies ACM as either “friable” or “nonfriable”. Friable ACM is ACM that, when dry, can be crumbled, pulverized or reduced to powder by hand pressure. Nonfriable ACM is ACM that, when dry, cannot be crumbled, pulverized or reduced to powder by hand pressure.
1.2. Nonfriable ACM is further classified as either Category I ACM or Category II ACM. Category I ACM and Category II ACM are distinguished from each other by their potential to release fibers when damaged. Category I ACM includes asbestos-containing gaskets, packings, resilient floor coverings, resilient floor covering mastic, and asphalt roofing products containing more than one percent asbestos. Asphalt roofing products which may contain asbestos include built-up roofing; asphalt-containing single ply membrane systems; asphalt shingles; asphalt-containing underlayment felts; asphalt-containing roof coatings and mastics; and asphalt-containing base flashings. ACM roofing products that use other bituminous or resinous binders (such as coal tars or pitches) are also considered to be Category I ACM. Category II ACM includes all other nonfriable ACM, for example, asbestos-cement (A/C) shingles, A/C tiles, and transite boards or panels containing more than one percent asbestos. Generally speaking, Category II ACM is more likely to become friable when damaged than is Category I ACM. The applicability of the NESHAP to Category I and II ACM depends on: (1) the condition of the material at the time of demolition or renovation, (2) the nature of the operation to which the material will be subjected, (3) the amount of ACM involved.
1.3. Asbestos-containing material regulated under the NESHAP is referred to as “regulated asbestos-containing material” (RACM). RACM is defined in § 61.141 of the NESHAP and includes: (1) friable asbestos-containing material; (2) Category I nonfriable ACM that has become friable; (3) Category I nonfriable ACM that has been or will be sanded, ground, cut, or abraded; or (4) Category II nonfriable ACM that has already been or is likely to become crumbled, pulverized, or reduced to powder. If the coverage threshold for RACM is met or exceeded in a renovation or demolition operation, then all friable ACM in the operation, and in certain situations, nonfriable ACM in the operation, are subject to the NESHAP.

# A. Threshold Amounts of Asbestos-Containing Roofing Material
1.A.1. The NESHAP does not cover roofing projects on single family homes or on residential buildings containing four or fewer dwelling units. 40 CFR 61.141. For other roofing renovation projects, if the total asbestos-containing roof area undergoing renovation is less than 160 ft
2
, the NESHAP does not apply, regardless of the removal method to be used, the type of material (Category I or II), or its condition (friable versus nonfriable). 40 CFR 61.145(a)(4). However, EPA would recommend the use of methods that damage asbestos-containing roofing material as little as possible. EPA has determined that where a rotating blade (RB) roof cutter or equipment that similarly damages the roofing material is used to remove Category I nonfriable asbestos-containing roofing material, the removal of 5580 ft
2
of that material will create 160 ft
2
of RACM. For the purposes of this interpretive rule, “RB roof cutter” means an engine-powered roof cutting machine with one or more rotating cutting blades the edges of which are blunt. (Equipment with blades having sharp or tapered edges, and/or which does not use a rotating blade, is used for “slicing” rather than “cutting” the roofing material; such equipment is not included in the term “RB roof cutter”.) Therefore, it is EPA's interpretation that when an RB roof cutter or equipment that similarly damages the roofing material is used to remove Category I nonfriable asbestos-containing roofing material, any project that is 5580 ft
2
or greater is subject to the NESHAP; conversely, it is EPA's interpretation that when an RB roof cutter or equipment that similarly damages the roofing material is used to remove Category I nonfriable asbestos-containing roofing material in a roof removal project that is less than 5580 ft
2
, the project is not subject to the NESHAP, except that notification is always required for demolitions. EPA further construes the NESHAP to mean that if slicing or other methods that do not sand, grind, cut or abrade will be used on Category I nonfriable ACM, the NESHAP does not apply, regardless of the area of roof to be removed.
1.A.2. For asbestos cement (A/C) shingles (or other Category II roofing material), if the area of the roofing material to be removed is at least 160 ft
2
and the removal methods will
crumble, pulverize, reduce to powder, or contaminate with RACM (from other ACM that has been crumbled, pulverized or reduced to powder) 160 ft
2
or more of such roofing material, the removal is subject to the NESHAP. Conversely, if the area of the A/C shingles (or other Category II roofing materials) to be removed is less than 160 ft
2
, the removal is not subject to the NESHAP regardless of the removal method used, except that notification is always required for demolitions. 40 CFR 61.145(a). However, EPA would recommend the use of methods that damage asbestos-containing roofing material as little as possible. If A/C shingles (or other Category II roofing materials) are removed without 160 ft
2
or more of such roofing material being crumbled, pulverized, reduced to powder, or contaminated with RACM (from other ACM that has been crumbled, pulverized or reduced to powder), the operation is not subject to the NESHAP, even where the total area of the roofing material to be removed exceeds 160 ft
2
; provided, however, that if the renovation includes other operations involving RACM, the roof removal operation is covered if the total area of RACM from all renovation activities exceeds 160 ft
2
.
See
the definition of regulated asbestos-containing material (RACM), 40 CFR 61.141.
1.A.3. Only roofing material that meets the definition of ACM can qualify as RACM subject to the NESHAP. Therefore, to determine if a removal operation that meets or exceeds the coverage threshold is subject to the NESHAP, any suspect roofing material (
i.e.
roofing material that may be ACM) should be tested for asbestos. If any such roofing material contains more than one percent asbestos and if the removal operation is covered by the NESHAP, then EPA must be notified and the work practices in § 61.145(c) must be followed. In EPA's view, if a removal operation involves at least the threshold level of suspect material, a roofing contractor may choose not to test for asbestos if the contractor follows the notification and work practice requirements of the NESHAP.

# B. A/C Shingle Removal (Category II ACM Removal)
1.B.1. A/C shingles, which are Category II nonfriable ACM, become regulated ACM if the material has a high probability of becoming or has become crumbled, pulverized or reduced to powder by the forces expected to act on the material in the course of demolition or renovation operations. 40 CFR 61.141. However, merely breaking an A/C shingle (or any other category II ACM) that is not friable may not necessarily cause the material to become RACM. A/C shingles are typically nailed to buildings on which they are attached. EPA believes that the extent of breakage that will normally result from carefully removing A/C shingles and lowering the shingles to the ground will not result in crumbling, pulverizing or reducing the shingles to powder. Conversely, the extent of breakage that will normally occur if the A/C shingles are dropped from a building or scraped off of a building with heavy machinery would cause the shingles to become RACM. EPA therefore construes the NESHAP to mean that the removal of A/C shingles that are not friable, using methods that do not crumble, pulverize, or reduce the A/C shingles to powder (such as pry bars, spud bars and shovels to carefully pry the material), is not subject to the NESHAP provided that the A/C shingles are properly handled during and after removal, as discussed in this paragraph and the asbestos NESHAP. This interpretation also applies to other Category II nonfriable asbestos-containing roofing materials.

# C. Cutting vs. Slicing and Manual Methods for Removal of Category I ACM
1.C.1. Because of damage to the roofing material, and the potential for fiber release, roof removal operations using rotating blade (RB) roof cutters or other equipment that sand, grind, cut or abrade the roof material are subject to the NESHAP. As EPA interprets the NESHAP, the use of certain manual methods (using equipment such as axes, hatchets, or knives, spud bars, pry bars, and shovels, but not saws) or methods that slice, shear, or punch (using equipment such as a power slicer or power plow) does not constitute “cutting, sanding, grinding or abrading.” This is because these methods do not destroy the structural matrix or integrity of the material such that the material is crumbled, pulverized or reduced to powder. Hence, it is EPA's interpretation that when such methods are used, assuming the roof material is not friable, the removal operation is not subject to the regulation.
1.C.2. Power removers or power tear-off machines are typically used to pry the roofing material up from the deck after the roof membrane has been cut. It is EPA's interpretation that when these machines are used to pry roofing material up, their use is not regulated by the NESHAP.
1.C.3. As noted previously, the NESHAP only applies to the removal of asbestos-containing roofing materials. Thus, the NESHAP does not apply to the use of RB cutters to remove non-asbestos built up roofing (BUR). On roofs containing some asbestos-containing and some non-asbestos-containing materials, coverage under the NESHAP depends on the methods used to remove each type of material in addition to other coverage thresholds specified above. For example, it is not uncommon for existing roofs to be made of non-asbestos BUR and base flashings that do contain asbestos. In that situation, EPA construes the
NESHAP to be inapplicable to the removal of the non-asbestos BUR using an RB cutter so long as the RB cutter is not used to cut 5580 ft
2
or more of the asbestos-containing base flashing or other asbestos-containing material into sections. In addition, the use of methods that slice, shear, punch or pry could then be used to remove the asbestos flashings and not trigger coverage under the NESHAP.

# II. Notification
2.1. Notification for a demolition is always required under the NESHAP. However, EPA believes that few roof removal jobs constitute “demolitions” as defined in the NESHAP (§ 61.141). In particular, it is EPA's view that the removal of roofing systems (i.e., the roof membrane, insulation, surfacing, coatings, flashings, mastic, shingles, and felt underlayment), when such removal is not a part of a demolition project, constitutes a “renovation” under the NESHAP. If the operation is a renovation, and Category I roofing material is being removed using either manual methods or slicing, notification is not required by the NESHAP. If Category II material is not friable and will be removed without crumbling, pulverizing, or reducing it to powder, no notification is required. Also, if the renovation involves less than the threshold area for applicability as discussed above, then no notification is required. However, if a roof removal meets the applicability and threshold requirements under the NESHAP, then EPA (or the delegated agency) must be notified in advance of the removal in accordance with the requirements of § 61.145(b), as follows:
• Notification must be given in writing at least 10 working days in advance and must include the information in § 61.145(b)(4), except for emergency renovations as discussed below.
• The notice must be updated as necessary, including, for example, when the amount of asbestos-containing roofing material reported changes by 20 percent or more.
• EPA must be notified if the start date of the roof removal changes. If the start date of a roof removal project is changed to an earlier date, EPA must be provided with a written notice of the new start date at least 10 working days in advance. If the start date changes to a later date, EPA must be notified by telephone as soon as possible before the original start date and a written notice must be sent as soon as possible.
• For emergency renovations (as defined in § 61.141), where work must begin immediately to avoid safety or public health hazards, equipment damage, or unreasonable financial burden, the notification must be postmarked or delivered to EPA as soon as possible, but no later than the following work day.

# III. Emission Control Practices

# A. Requirements To Adequately Wet and Discharge No Visible Emission
3.A.1. The principal controls contained in the NESHAP for removal operations include requirements that the affected material be adequately wetted, and that asbestos waste be handled, collected, and disposed of properly. The requirements for disposal of waste materials are discussed separately in section IV below. The emission control requirements discussed in this section III apply only to roof removal operations that are covered by the NESHAP as set forth in Section I above.
3.A.2. For any operation subject to the NESHAP, the regulation (§§ 61.145(c)(2)(i), (3), (6)(i)) requires that RACM be adequately wet (as defined in § 61.141) during the operation that damages or disturbs the asbestos material until collected for disposal.
3.A.3. When using an RB roof cutter (or any other method that sands, grinds, cuts or abrades the roofing material) to remove Category I asbestos-containing roofing material, the emission control requirements of § 61.145(c) apply as discussed in Section I above. EPA will consider a roof removal project to be in compliance with the “adequately wet” and “discharge no visible emission” requirements of the NESHAP if the RB roof cutter is equipped and operated with the following: (1) a blade guard that completely encloses the blade and extends down close to the roof surface; and (2) a device for spraying a fine mist of water inside the blade guard, and which device is in operation during the cutting of the roof.

# B. Exemptions From Wetting Requirements
3.B.1. The NESHAP provides that, in certain instances, wetting may not be required during the cutting of Category I asbestos roofing material with an RB roof cutter. If EPA determines in accordance with § 61.145(c)(3)(i), that wetting will unavoidably damage the building, equipment inside the building, or will present a safety hazard while stripping the ACM from a facility component that remains in place, the roof removal operation will be exempted from the requirement to wet during cutting. EPA must have sufficient written information on which to base such a decision. Before proceeding with a dry removal, the contractor must have received EPA's written approval. Such exemptions will be made on a case-by-case basis.
3.B.2. It is EPA's view that, in most instances, exemptions from the wetting requirements are not necessary. Where EPA grants an exemption from wetting because of the potential for damage to the building, damage to equipment within the building or a safety hazard, the NESHAP specifies alternative control methods (§ 61.145(c)(3)(i)(B)).
Alternative control methods include (a) the use of local exhaust ventilation systems that capture the dust, and do not produce visible emissions, or (b) methods that are designed and operated in accordance with the requirements of § 61.152, or (c) other methods that have received the written approval of EPA. EPA will consider an alternative emission control method in compliance with the NESHAP if the method has received written approval from EPA and the method is being implemented consistent with the approved procedures (§ 61.145(c)(3)(ii) or § 61.152(b)(3)).
3.B.3. An exemption from wetting is also allowed when the air or roof surface temperature at the point of wetting is below freezing, as specified in § 61.145(c)(7). If freezing temperatures are indicated as the reason for not wetting, records must be kept of the temperature at the beginning, middle and end of the day on which wetting is not performed and the records of temperature must be retained for at least 2 years. 42 CFR § 61.145(c)(7)(iii). It is EPA's interpretation that in such cases, no written application to, or written approval by the Administrator is needed for using emission control methods listed in § 61.145(c)(3)(i)(B), or alternative emission control methods that have been previously approved by the Administrator. However, such written application or approval is required for alternative emission control methods that have not been previously approved. Any dust and debris collected from cutting must still be kept wet and placed in containers. All of the other requirements for notification and waste disposal would continue to apply as described elsewhere in this notice and the Asbestos NESHAP.

# C. Waste Collection and Handling
3.C.1. It is EPA's interpretation that waste resulting from slicing and other methods that do not cut, grind, sand or abrade Category I nonfriable asbestos-containing roofing material is not subject to the NESHAP and can be disposed of as nonasbestos waste. EPA further construes the NESHAP to provide that if Category II roofing material (such as A/C shingles) is removed and disposed of without crumbling, pulverizing, or reducing it to powder, the waste from the removal is not subject to the NESHAP waste disposal requirements. EPA also interprets the NESHAP to be inapplicable to waste resulting from roof removal operations that do not meet or exceed the coverage thresholds described in section I above. Of course, other State, local, or Federal regulations may apply.
3.C.2. It is EPA's interpretation that when an RB roof cutter, or other method that similarly damages the roofing material, is used to cut Category I asbestos containing roofing material, the damaged material from the cut (the sawdust or debris) is considered asbestos containing waste subject to § 61.150 of the NESHAP, provided the coverage thresholds discussed above in section 1 are met or exceeded. This sawdust or debris must be disposed of at a disposal site operated in accordance with the NESHAP. It is also EPA's interpretation of the NESHAP that if the remainder of the roof is free of the sawdust and debris generated by the cutting, or if such sawdust or debris is collected as discussed below in paragraphs 3.C.3, 3.C.4, 3.C.5 and 3.C.6, the remainder of the roof can be disposed of as nonasbestos waste because it is considered to be Category I nonfriable material (as long as the remainder of the roof is in fact nonasbestos material or if it is Category I asbestos material and the removal methods do not further sand, grind, cut or abrade the roof material). EPA further believes that if the roof is not cleaned of such sawdust or debris,
i.e.,
it is contaminated, then it must be treated as asbestos-containing waste material and be handled in accordance with § 61.150.
3.C.3. In order to be in compliance with the NESHAP while using an RB roof cutter (or device that similarly damages the roofing material) to cut Category I asbestos containing roofing material, the dust and debris resulting from the cutting of the roof should be collected as soon as possible after the cutting operation, and kept wet until collected and placed in leak-tight containers. EPA believes that where the blade guard completely encloses the blade and extends down close to the roof surface and is equipped with a device for spraying a fine mist of water inside the blade guard, and the spraying device is in operation during the cutting, most of the dust and debris from cutting will be confined along the cut. The most efficient methods to collect the dust and debris from cutting are to immediately collect or vacuum up the damaged material where it lies along the cut using a filtered vacuum cleaner or debris collector that meets the requirements of 40 CFR 61.152 to clean up as much of the debris as possible, or to gently sweep up the bulk of the debris, and then use a filtered vacuum cleaner that meets the requirements of 40 CFR 61.152 to clean up as much of the remainder of the debris as possible. On smooth surfaced roofs (nonaggregate roofs), sweeping up the debris and then wet wiping the surface may be done in place of using a filtered vacuum cleaner. It is EPA's view that if these decontamination procedures are followed, the remaining roofing material does not have to be collected and disposed of as asbestos waste. Additionally, it is EPA's view that where such decontamination procedures are followed, if the remaining portions of the roof are non-asbestos or Category I nonfriable asbestos material, and if the remaining portions are removed using removal methods that slice, shear, punch or
pry, as discussed in section 1.C above, then the remaining portions do not have to be collected and disposed of as asbestos waste and the NESHAP's no visible emissions and adequately wet requirements are not applicable to the removal of the remaining portions. In EPA's interpretation, the failure of a filtered vacuum cleaner or debris collector to collect larger chunks or pieces of damaged roofing material created by the RB roof cutter does not require the remaining roofing material to be handled and disposed of as asbestos waste, provided that such visible chunks or pieces of roofing material are collected (e.g. by gentle sweeping) and disposed of as asbestos waste. Other methods of decontamination may not be adequate, and should be approved by the local delegated agency.
3.C.4. In EPA's interpretation, if the debris from the cutting is not collected immediately, it will be necessary to lightly mist the dust or debris, until it is collected, as discussed above, and placed in containers. The dust or debris should be lightly misted frequently enough to prevent the material from drying, and to prevent airborne emissions, prior to collection as described above. It is EPA's interpretation of the NESHAP that if these procedures are followed, the remaining roofing material does not have to be collected and disposed of as asbestos waste, as long as the remaining roof material is in fact nonasbestos material or if it is Category I asbestos material and the removal methods do not further sand, grind, cut or abrade the roof material.
3.C.5. It is EPA's interpretation that, provided the roofing material is not friable prior to the cutting operation, and provided the roofing material has not been made friable by the cutting operation, the appearance of rough, jagged or damaged edges on the remaining roofing material, due to the use of an RB roof cutter, does not require that such remaining roofing material be handled and disposed of as asbestos waste. In addition, it is also EPA's interpretation that if the sawdust or debris generated by the use of an RB roof cutter has been collected as discussed in paragraphs 3.C.3, 3.C.4 and 3.C.6, the presence of dust along the edge of the remaining roof material does not render such material “friable” for purposes of this interpretive rule or the NESHAP, provided the roofing material is not friable prior to the cutting operation, and provided that the remaining roofing material near the cutline has not been made friable by the cutting operation. Where roofing material near the cutline has been made friable by the use of the RB cutter (
i.e.
where such remaining roofing material near the cutline can be crumbled, pulverized or reduced to powder using hand pressure), it is EPA's interpretation that the use of an encapsulant will ensure that such friable material need not be treated or disposed of as asbestos containing waste material. The encapsulant may be applied to the friable material after the roofing material has been collected into stacks for subsequent disposal as nonasbestos waste. It is EPA's view that if the encapsulation procedure set forth in this paragraph is followed in operations where roofing material near the cutline has been rendered friable by the use of an RB roof cutter, and if the decontamination procedures set forth in paragraph 3.C.3 have been followed, the NESHAP's no visible emissions and adequately wet requirements would be met for the removal, handling and disposal of the remaining roofing material.
3.C.6. As one way to comply with the NESHAP, the dust and debris from cutting can be placed in leak-tight containers, such as plastic bags, and the containers labeled using warning labels required by OSHA (29 CFR 1926.58). In addition, the containers must have labels that identify the waste generator (such as the name of the roofing contractor, abatement contractor, and/or building owner or operator) and the location of the site at which the waste was generated.

Section 61.150(b) requires that, as soon as is practical, all collected dust and debris from cutting as well as any contaminated roofing squares, must be taken to a landfill that is operated in accordance with § 61.154 or to an EPA-approved site that converts asbestos waste to nonasbestos material in accordance with § 61.155. During the loading and unloading of affected waste, asbestos warning signs must be affixed to the vehicles.

# B. Waste Shipment Record
4.B.1. For each load of asbestos waste that is regulated under the NESHAP, a waste shipment record (WSR) must be maintained in accordance with § 61.150(d). Information that must be maintained for each waste load includes the following:
• Name, address, and telephone number of the waste generator
• Name and address of the local, State, or EPA regional office responsible for administering the asbestos NESHAP program
• Quantity of waste in cubic meters (or cubic yards)
• Name and telephone number of the disposal site operator
• Name and physical site location of the disposal site
• Date transported
• Name, address, and telephone number of the transporter(s)
• Certification that the contents meet all government regulations for transport by highways.
4.B.2. The waste generator is responsible for ensuring that a copy of the WSR is delivered to the disposal site along with the waste shipment. If a copy of the WSR signed by the disposal site operator is not returned to the waste generator within 35 days, the waste generator must contact the transporter and/or the disposal site to determine the status of the waste shipment. 40 CFR 61.150(d)(3). If the signed WSR is not received within 45 days, the waste generator must report, in writing, to the responsible NESHAP program agency and send along a copy of the WSR. 40 CFR 61.150(d)(4). Copies of WSRs, including those signed by the disposal site operator, must be retained for at least 2 years. 40 CFR 61.150(d)(5).

# V. Training
5.1. For those roof removals that are subject to the NESHAP, at least one on-site supervisor trained in the provisions of the NESHAP must be present during the removal of the asbestos roofing material. 40 CFR 61.145(c)(8). In EPA's view, this person can be a job foreman, a hired consultant, or someone who can represent the building owner or contractor responsible for the removal. In addition to the initial training requirement, a refresher training course is required every 2 years. The NESHAP training requirements became effective on November 20, 1991.
5.2. Asbestos training courses developed specifically to address compliance with the NESHAP in roofing work, as well as courses developed for other purposes can satisfy this requirement of the NESHAP, as long as the course covers the areas specified in the regulation. EPA believes that Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response Act (AHERA) training courses will, for example, satisfy the NESHAP training requirements. However, nothing in this interpretive rule or in the NESHAP shall be deemed to require that roofing contractors or roofing workers performing operations covered by the NESHAP must be trained or accredited under AHERA, as amended by the Asbestos School Hazard Abatement Reauthorization Act (ASHARA). Likewise, state or local authorities may independently impose additional training, licensing, or accreditation requirements on roofing contractors performing operations covered by the NESHAP, but such additional training, licensing or accreditation is not called for by this interpretive rule or the federal NESHAP.
5.3. For removal of Category I asbestos containing roofing material where RB roof cutters or equipment that similarly damages the asbestos-containing roofing material are used, the NESHAP training requirements (§ 61.145(c)(8)) apply as discussed in Section I above. It is EPA's intention that removal of Category I asbestos-containing roofing material using hatchets, axes, knives, and/or the use of spud bars, pry bars and shovels to lift the roofing material, or similar removal methods that slice, punch, or shear the roof membrane are not subject to the training requirements, since these methods do not cause the roof removal to be subject to the NESHAP. Likewise, it is EPA's intention that roof removal operations involving Category II nonfriable ACM are not subject to the training requirements where such operations are not subject to the NESHAP as discussed in section I above.

Arsenic-containing glass type
means any glass that is distinguished from other glass solely by the weight percent of arsenic added as a raw material and by the weight percent of arsenic in the glass produced. Any two or more glasses that have the same weight percent of arsenic in the raw materials as well as in the glass produced shall be considered to belong to one arsenic-containing glass type, without regard to the recipe used or any other characteristics of the glass or the method of production.
By-pass the control device
means to operate the glass melting furnace without operating the control device to which that furnace's emissions are directed routinely.
Commercial arsenic
means any form of arsenic that is produced by extraction
from any arsenic-containing substance and is intended for sale or for intentional use in a manufacturing process. Arsenic that is a naturally occurring trace constituent of another substance is not considered “commercial arsenic.”

(1) Install, operate, and maintain a secondary hood system on each copper converter. Each secondary hood system shall consist of a hood enclosure, air curtain fan(s), exhaust system fan(s), and ductwork that conveys the captured emissions to a control device, and shall meet the following specifications:
(i) The configuration and dimensions of the hood enclosure shall be such that the copper converter mouth, charging ladles, skimming ladles, and any other material transfer vessels used will be housed within the confines or influence of the hood enclosure during each mode of copper converter operation.
(ii) The back of the hood enclosure shall be fully enclosed and sealed against the primary hood. Portions of the side-walls in contact with the copper converter shall be sealed against the converter.
(iii) Openings in the top and front of the hood enclosure to allow for the entry and egress of ladles and crane appartus shall be minimized to the fullest extent practicable.
(iv) The hood enclosure shall be fabricated in such a manner and of materials of sufficient strength to withstand incidental contact with ladles and crane apparatus with no significant damage.
(v) One side-wall of the hood enclosure shall be equipped with a horizontal-slotted plenum along the top, and the opposite side-wall shall be equipped with an exhaust hood. The horizontal-slotted plenum shall be designed to allow the distance from the base to the top of the horizontal slot to be adjustable up to a dimension of 76 mm.
(vi) The horizontal-slotted plenum shall be connected to a fan. When activated, the fan shall push air through the horizontal slot, producing a horizontal air curtain above the copper converter that is directed to the exhaust hood. The fan power output installed shall be sufficient to overcome static pressure losses through the ductwork upstream of the horizontal-slotted plenum and across the plenum, and to deliver at least 22,370 watts (30 air horsepower) at the horizontal-slotted plenum discharge.
(vii) The exhaust hood shall be sized to completely intercept the airstream from the horizontal-slotted plenum combined with the additional airflow resulting from entrainment of the surrounding air. The exhaust hood shall be connected to a fan. When activated, the fan shall pull the combined airstream into the exhaust hood.
(viii) The entire secondary hood system shall be equipped with dampers and instrumentation, as appropriate, so that the desired air curtain and exhaust flow are maintained during each mode of copper converter operation.
(2) Optimize the capture of secondary inorganic arsenic emissions by operating the copper converter and secondary hood system at all times as follows:
(i)
Copper converter.
(A) Increase the air curtain and exhaust flow rates to their optimum conditions prior to raising the primary hood and rolling the copper converter out for charging, skimming, or pouring.
(B) Once rolled out, prior to the commencement of skimming or pouring, hold the copper converter in an idle position until fuming from the molten bath has been minimized.
(C) During skimming, raise the receiving ladle off the ground and position the ladle as close to the copper converter mouth as possible to minimize the drop distance between the converter mouth and the receiving ladle.
(D) Control the rate of flow into the receiving ladle to the extent practicable to minimize fuming.
(E) Upon the completion of each charge, withdraw the charging ladle or vessel used from the confines of the secondary hood in a slow, deliberate manner.
(F) During charging, skimming, or pouring, ensure that the crane block does not disturb the air flow between the horizontal-slotted plenum and the exhaust hood.
(ii)
Secondary hood system.
(A) Operate the secondary hood system under conditions that will result in the maximum capture of inorganic arsenic emissions.
(B) Within 30 days after the effective date of this subpart, or within 30 days after the initial operation of each secondary hood system, whichever comes later, provide to the Administrator a list of operating conditions for the secondary hood system that will result in the maximum capture of inorganic arsenic emissions. This list shall specify the operating parameters for the following:
(
1

(
2
) The velocity of air through the horizontal slot during each mode of converter operation.
(
3
) The distance from the horizontal slot to the exhaust hood.

(i) At least once every month, visually inspect the components of the secondary hood system that are exposed to potential damage from crane and ladle operation, including the hood enclosure, side- and back-wall hood seals, and the horizontal slot.
(ii) Replace or repair any defective or damaged components of the secondary hood system within 30 days after discovering the defective or damaged components.
(c) No owner or operator of a copper converter subject to the provisions of this subpart shall cause or allow to be discharged into the atmosphere any copper converter secondary emissions that exit from a control device and contain particulate matter in excess of 11.6 mg/dscm (0.0051 gr/dscf).
(d) The owner or operator of a copper converter subject to the provisions of this subpart shall submit a description of a plan for control of inorganic arsenic emissions from the copper converter and associated air pollution control equipment. This plan shall be submitted within 90 days after the effective date of this subpart, unless a waiver of compliance is granted under § 61.11. If a waiver of compliance is granted, the plan shall be submitted on a date set by the Administrator. Approval of the plan will be granted by the Administrator provided he finds that:
(1) It includes a systematic procedure for identifying malfunctions and for reporting them immediately to smelter supervisory personnel.
(2) It specifies the procedures that will be followed to ensure that equipment or process breakdowns due entirely or in part to poor maintenance or other preventable conditions do not occur.
(3) It specifies the measures that will be taken to ensure compliance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
(e) The owner or operator shall implement the plan required under paragraph (d) of this section unless otherwise specified by the Administrator.

(a) Sixty days following the completion of covering the pile to limit radon emissions but prior to the long term stabilization of the pile, the owners or operators of uranium mill tailings shall conduct testing for all piles within the facility in accordance with the procedures described in 40 CFR part 61, appendix B, Method 115, or other procedures for which EPA has granted prior approval.
(b) Ninety days after the testing is required, each facility shall provide EPA with a report detailing the actions taken and the results of the radon-222 flux testing. EPA shall be notified at least 30 days prior to an emission test so that EPA may, at its option, observe the test. If meteorological conditions are such that a test cannot be properly conducted, then the owner or operator shall notify EPA and test as soon as conditions permit. Each report shall also include the following information:
(1) The name and location of the facility.
(2) A list of the piles at the facility.
(3) A description of the control measures taken to decrease the radon flux from the source and any actions taken to insure the long term effectiveness of the control measures.
(4) The results of the testing conducted, including the results of each measurement.
(5) Each report shall be signed and dated by a public official in charge of the facility and contain the following declaration immediately above the signature line:
I certify under penalty of law that I have personally examined and am familiar with the information submitted herein and based on my inquiry of those individuals immediately responsible for obtaining the information. I believe that the submitted information is true, accurate and complete. I am aware that there are significant penalties for submitting false information including the possibility of fine and imprisonment. See 18 U.S.C. 1001.
(c) If year long measurements are made in accordance with Method 115 of appendix B of part 61, this report shall include the results of the first measurement period and provide a schedule for the measurement frequency to be used. An additional report shall be submitted ninety days after completion of the final measurements.
(d) If long term stabilization has begun before the effective date of the rule then testing may be conducted at any time, up to 60 days after the long term stabilization is completed.
(e) If the testing demonstrates that the pile meets the requirement of § 61.222(a) and long term stabilization has been completed then the pile is considered disposed for purposes of this rule.

§ 61.250
Designation of facilities.
The provisions of this subpart apply to owners or operators of facilities licensed to manage uranium byproduct materials during and following the processing of uranium ores, commonly referred to as uranium mills and their associated tailings. This subpart does not apply to the disposal of tailings.
§ 61.251
Definitions.
As used in this subpart, all terms not defined here have the meaning given them in the Clean Air Act or 40 CFR part 61, subpart A. The following terms shall have the following specific meanings:
(a)
Area
means the vertical projection of the pile upon the earth's surface.
(b)
Continuous disposal
means a method of uranium byproduct material or tailings management and disposal in which uranium byproduct material or tailings are dewatered by mechanical methods immediately after generation. The dried uranium byproduct material or tailings are then placed in trenches or other disposal areas and immediately covered to limit emissions consistent with applicable Federal standards.
(c)
Dewatered
means to remove the water from recently produced uranium byproduct material or tailings by mechanical or evaporative methods such that the water content of the uranium byproduct material or tailings does not exceed 30 percent by weight.
(d)
Existing conventional impoundment
means any conventional uranium byproduct material or tailings impoundment which is licensed to accept additional uranium byproduct material or tailings and is in existence on December 15, 1989.
(e)
Operation.
Operation means that an impoundment is being used for the continued placement of uranium byproduct material or tailings or is in standby status for such placement. An impoundment is in operation from the day that uranium byproduct material or tailings are first placed in the impoundment until the day that final closure begins.
(f)
Phased disposal
means a method of uranium byproduct material or tailings management and disposal which uses lined impoundments which are filled and then immediately dried and covered to meet all applicable Federal standards.
(g)
Uranium byproduct material or tailings
means the waste produced by the extraction or concentration of uranium from any ore processed primarily for its source material content. Ore bodies depleted by uranium solution extraction and which remain underground do not constitute byproduct material for the purposes of this subpart.
(h)
Conventional impoundment.
A conventional impoundment is a permanent structure located at any uranium recovery facility which contains mostly solid uranium byproduct material or tailings from the extraction of uranium from uranium ore. These impoundments are left in place at facility closure.
(i)
Non-conventional impoundment.
A non-conventional impoundment is used for managing liquids from uranium recovery operations and contains uranium byproduct material or tailings suspended in and/or covered by liquids. These structures are commonly known as holding ponds or evaporation ponds and can be located at any uranium recovery facility. They are typically not permanent structures unless they transition to become used as conventional impoundments. Impoundments constructed for the purpose of managing
liquids from closure or remediation activities (
e.g.,
contaminated groundwater), and which are used solely for that purpose, are not subject to the requirements of this subpart.
(j)
Heap leach pile.
A heap leach pile is a pile of uranium ore placed on an engineered structure and stacked so as to allow uranium to be dissolved and removed by leaching liquids.
(k)
Standby.
Standby means the period of time that an impoundment is not accepting uranium byproduct material or tailings but has not yet entered final closure.
(l)
Uranium recovery facility.
A uranium recovery facility means a facility licensed by the NRC or an NRC Agreement State to manage uranium byproduct material or tailings during and following the processing of uranium ores. Common names for these facilities are a conventional uranium mill, an in-situ leach (or recovery) facility and a heap leach facility or pile.
(m)
Heap leach pile operational life.
The operational life of a heap leach pile means the time period from the first time that lixiviant is placed on the heap leach pile until the time the final rinse is completed.
(n)
Final closure
means the period during which an impoundment or heap leach pile is being managed in accordance with the milestones and requirements in an approved reclamation plan. Final closure for the impoundment or heap leach pile begins when the owner or operator provides written notice to the Administrator and to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission or applicable NRC Agreement State that:
(1) A conventional impoundment is no longer receiving uranium byproduct material or tailings, is no longer on standby for such receipt and is being managed under an approved reclamation plan for that impoundment or facility closure plan; or
(2) A non-conventional impoundment is no longer required for evaporation or holding purposes, is no longer on standby for such purposes and is being managed under an approved reclamation plan for that impoundment or facility closure plan; or
(3) A heap leach pile has concluded its operational life and is being managed under an approved reclamation plan for that pile or facility closure plan.
(o)
Reclamation plan
means the plan detailing activities and milestones to accomplish reclamation of impoundments or piles containing uranium byproduct material or tailings. Activities and milestones to be addressed include, but are not limited to, dewatering and contouring of conventional impoundments and heap leach piles, and removal and disposal of non-conventional impoundments. A reclamation plan prepared and approved in accordance with 10 CFR part 40, Appendix A is considered a reclamation plan in this subpart.

§ 61.271
Emission standard.
The owner or operator of each storage vessel with a design storage capacity greater than or equal to 38 cubic meters (10,000 gallons) to which this subpart applies shall comply with the requirements in paragraph (d) of this section and with the requirements either in paragraph (a), (b), or (c) of this section, or equivalent as provided in § 61.273.
(a) The storage vessel shall be equipped with a fixed roof and an internal floating roof.
(1) An internal floating roof means a cover that rests on the liquid surface (but not necessarily in complete contact with it) inside a storage vessel that has a permanently affixed roof. The internal floating roof shall be floating on the liquid surface at all times, except during initial fill and during those intervals when the storage vessel is completely emptied or subsequently emptied and refilled. When the roof is resting on the leg supports, the process of filling, emptying, or refilling shall be continuous and shall be accomplished as rapidly as possible.
(2) Each internal floating roof shall be equipped with one of the closure devices listed in paragraphs (a)(2) (i), (ii), or (iii) of this section between the wall of the storage vessel and the edge of the internal floating roof. This requirement does not apply to each existing storage vessel for which construction of an internal floating roof equipped with a continuous seal commenced on or before July 28, 1988. A continuous seal means a seal that forms a continuous closure that completely covers the space between the wall of the storage vessel and the edge of the internal floating roof.
(i) A foam- or liquid-filled seal mounted in contact with the liquid (liquid-mounted seal). A liquid-mounted seal means a foam- or liquid-filled seal mounted in contact with the liquid between the wall of the storage vessel and the floating roof continuously around the circumference of the vessel.
(ii) Two seals mounted one above the other so that each forms a continuous closure that completely covers the space between the wall of the storage vessel and the edge of the internal floating roof. The lower seal may be vapor-mounted, but both must be continuous.
(iii) A metallic shoe seal. A metallic shoe seal (also referred to as a mechanical shoe seal) is, but is not limited to, a metal sheet held vertically against the wall of the storage vessel by springs or weighted levers and is connected by braces to the floating roof. A flexible coated fabric (envelope) spans the annular space between the metal sheet and the floating roof.
(3) Automatic bleeder vents are to be closed at all times when the roof is floating, except when the roof is being floated off or is being landed on the roof leg supports.
(4) Each opening in a noncontact internal floating roof except for automatic bleeder vents (vacuum breaker vents) and the rim space vents is to provide a projection below the liquid surface.
(5) Each internal floating roof shall meet the specifications listed below. If an existing storage vessel had an internal floating roof with a continuous seal as of July 28, 1988, the requirements listed below do not have to be met until the first time after September 14, 1989, the vessel is emptied and degassed or September 14, 1999, whichever occurs first,
(i) Each opening in the internal floating roof except for leg sleeves, automatic bleeder vents, rim space vents, column wells, ladder wells, sample wells, and stub drains is to be equipped with a cover or lid. The cover or lid shall be equipped with a gasket. Covers on each access hatch and automatic gauge float well shall be bolted.
(ii) Each penetration of the internal floating roof for the purposes of sampling shall be a sample well. Each sample well shall have a slit fabric cover that covers at least 90 percent of the opening.
(iii) Each automatic bleeder vent shall be gasketed.
(iv) Rim space vents shall be equipped with a gasket.
(v) Each penetration of the internal floating roof that allows for passage of a ladder shall have a gasketed sliding cover.
(vi) Each penetration of the internal floating roof that allows for passage of a column supporting the fixed roof shall have a flexible fabric sleeve seal or a gasketed sliding cover.
(6) Each cover or lid on any opening in the internal floating roof shall be closed (i.e., no visible gaps), except when a device is in actual use Covers on each access hatch and each automatic gauge float well which are equipped with bolts shall be bolted when they are not in use. Rim space vents are to be set to open only when the internal floating roof is not floating or at the manufacturer's recommended setting.
(b) The storage vessel shall have an external floating roof.
(1) An external floating roof means a pontoon-type or double-deck-type cover that rests on the liquid surface in a vessel with no fixed roof.
(2) Each external floating roof shall be equipped with a closure device between the wall of the storage vessel and the roof edge. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(5) of this section, the closure device is to consist of two seals, one above the other. The lower seal is referred to as the primary seal and the upper seal is referred to as the secondary seal.
(i) The primary seal shall be either a metallic shoe seal or a liquid-mounted seal. A liquid-mounted seal means a foam- or liquid-filled seal mounted in contact with the liquid between the wall of the storage vessel and the floating roof continuously around the circumference of the vessel. A metallic shoe seal (which can also be referred to as a mechanical shoe seal) is, but is not limited to, a metal sheet held vertically against the wall of the storage vessel by springs or weighted levers and is connected by braces to the floating roof. A flexible coated fabric (envelope) spans the annular space between the metal sheet and the floating roof. Except as provided in § 61.272(b)(4), the primary seal shall completely cover the annular space between the edge of the floating roof and the vessel wall.
(ii) The secondary seal shall completely cover the annular space between the external floating roof and the wall of the storage vessel in a continuous fashion except as allowed in § 61.272(b)(4).
(3) Except for automatic bleeder vents and rim space vents, each opening in the noncontact external floating roof shall provide a projection below the liquid surface. Except for automatic bleeder vents, rim space vents, roof drains, and leg sleeves, each opening in the roof is to be equipped with a gasketed cover, seal or lid which is to be maintained in a closed position at all times (i.e., no visible gap) except when the device is in actual use. Automatic bleeder vents are to be closed at all times when the roof is floating, except when the roof is being floated off or is being landed on the roof leg supports. Rim vents are to be set to open when the roof is being floated off the roof leg supports or at the manufacturer's recommended setting. Automatic bleeder vents and rim space vents are to be gasketed. Each emergency roof drain is to be provided with a slotted membrane fabric cover that covers at
least 90 percent of the area of the opening.
(4) The roof shall be floating on the liquid at all times (i.e., off the roof leg supports) except during initial fill until the roof is lifted off leg supports and when the vessel is completely emptied and subsequently refilled. The process of emptying and refilling when the roof is resting on the leg supports shall be continuous and shall be accomplished as rapidly as possible.
(5) The requirement for a secondary seal does not apply to each existing storage vessel that was equipped with a liquid-mounted primary seal as of July 28, 1988, until after the first time after September 14, 1989, when the vessel is emptied and degassed or 10 years from September 14, 1989, whichever occurs first.
(c) The storage vessel shall be equipped with a closed vent system and a control device.
(1) The closed vent system shall be designed to collect all benzene vapors and gases discharged from the storage vessel and operated with no detectable emissions, as indicated by an instrument reading of less than 500 ppm above background and visual inspections, as determined in § 61.242-11 (subpart V).
(2) The control device shall be designed and operated to reduce inlet benzene emissions by 95 percent or greater. If a flare is used as the control device, it shall meet the specifications described in the general control device requirements of 40 CFR 60.18.
(3) The specifications and requirements listed in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section for closed vent systems and control devices do not apply during periods of routine maintenance. During periods of routine maintenance, the benzene level in the storage vessel(s) serviced by the control device subject to the provisions of § 61.271(c) may be lowered but not raised. Periods of routine maintenance shall not exceed 72 hours as outlined in the maintenance plan required by § 61.272(c)(1)(iii).
(4) The specifications and requirements listed in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section for closed vents and control devices do not apply during a control system malfunction.

§ 61.272
Compliance provisions.
(a) For each vessel complying with § 61.271(a) (fixed roof and internal floating roof) each owner or operator shall:
(1) After installing the control equipment required to comply with § 61.271(a), visually inspect the internal floating roof, the primary seal, and the secondary seal (if one is in service), prior to filling the storage vessel with benzene. If there are holes, tears or other openings in the primary seal, the secondary seal, or the seal fabric, or defects in the internal floating roof, the owner or operator shall repair the items before filling the storage vessel.
(2) Visually inspect the internal floating roof and the primary seal or
the secondary seal (if one is in service) through manholes and roof hatches on the fixed roof at least once every 12 months after initial fill, or at least once every 12 months after September 14, 1989, except as provided in paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section. If the internal floating roof is not resting on the surface of the benzene liquid inside the storage vessel, or there is liquid on the roof, or the seal is detached, or there are holes or tears in the seal fabric, the owner or operator shall repair the items or empty and remove the storage vessel from service within 45 days. If a failure that is detected during inspections required in this paragraph cannot be repaired within 45 days and if the vessel cannot be emptied within 45 days, an extension of up to 30 additional days may be requested from the Administrator in the inspection report required in § 61.275(a). Such a request for an extension must document that alternate storage capacity is unavailable and specify a schedule of actions the company will take that will ensure that the control equipment will be repaired or the vessel will be emptied as soon as possible.
(3) Visually inspect the internal floating roof, the primary seal, the secondary seal (if one is in service), gaskets, slotted membranes and sleeve seals (if any) each time the storage vessel is emptied and degassed. In no event shall inspections conducted in accordance with this provision occur at intervals greater than 10 years in the case of vessels conducting the annual visual inspections as specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section and at intervals greater than 5 years in the case of vessels specified in paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section.
(i) For all the inspections required by paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(3) of this section, the owner or operator shall notify the Administrator in writing at least 30 days prior to the refilling of each storage vessel to afford the Administrator the opportunity to have an observer present. If the inspection required by paragraph (a)(3) of this section is not planned and the owner or operator could not have known about the inspection 30 days in advance of refilling the vessel, the owner or operator shall notify the Administrator at least 7 days prior to the refilling of the storage vessel. Notification shall be made by telephone immediately followed by written documentation demonstrating why the inspection was unplanned. Alternatively, the notification including the written documentation may be made in writing and sent by express mail so that it is received by the Administrator at least 7 days prior to refilling.
(ii) If the internal floating roof has defects, the primary seal has holes, tears, or other openings in the seal or the seal fabric, or the secondary seal has holes, tears, or other openings in the seal or the seal fabric, or the gaskets no longer close off the liquid surfaces from the atmosphere, or the slotted membrane has more than 10 percent open area, the owner or operator shall repair the items as necessary so that none of the conditions specified in this paragraph exist before refilling the storage vessel with benzene.
(4) For vessels equipped with a double-seal system as specified in § 61.271(a)(2)(ii):
(i) Visually inspect the vessel as specified in paragraph (a)(3) of this section at least every 5 years; or
(ii) Visually inspect the vessel annually as specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, and at least every 10 years as specified in paragraph (a)(3) of this section.
(b) For each vessel complying with § 61.271(b) (external floating roof) the owner or operator shall:
(1) Determine the gap areas and maximum gap widths between the primary seal and the wall of the storage vessel, and the secondary seal and the wall of the storage vessel according to the following frequency.
(i) For an external floating roof vessel equipped with primary and secondary seals, measurements of gaps between the vessel wall and the primary seal (seal gaps) shall be performed during the hydrostatic testing of the vessel or within 90 days of the initial fill with benzene or within 90 days of September 14, 1989, whichever occurs last, and at least once every 5 years thereafter, except as provided in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section.
(ii) For an external floating roof vessel equipped with a liquid-mounted primary seal and without a secondary seal as provided for in § 61.271(b)(5), measurement of gaps between the vessel wall and the primary seal (seal gaps) shall be performed within 90 days of September 14, 1989, and at least once per year thereafter. When a secondary seal is installed over the primary seal, measurement of primary seal gaps shall be performed within 90 days of installation and at least once every 5 years thereafter.
(iii) For an external floating roof vessel equipped with primary and secondary seals, measurements of gaps between the vessel wall and the secondary seal shall be performed within 90 days of the initial fill with benzene, within 90 days of installation of the secondary seal, or within 90 days after September 14, 1989, whichever occurs last, and at least once per year thereafter.
(iv) If any source ceases to store benzene for a period of 1 year or more, subsequent introduction of benzene into the vessel shall be considered an initial fill for the purposes of paragraphs (b)(1)(i), (b)(1)(ii), and (b)(1)(iii) of this section.
(2) Determine gap widths and areas in the primary and secondary seals individually by the following procedures:
(i) Measure seal gaps, if any, at one or more floating roof levels when the roof is floating off the roof leg supports.
(ii) Measure seal gaps around the entire circumference of the vessel in each place where a 0.32 centimeter (cm) (1/8 in) diameter uniform probe passes freely (without forcing or binding against the seal) between the seal and the wall of the storage vessel and measure the circumferential distance of each such location.
(iii) The total surface area of each gap described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section shall be determined by using probes of various widths to measure accurately the actual distance from the vessel wall to the seal and multiplying each such width by its respective circumferential distance.
(3) Add the gap surface area of each gap location for the primary seal and the secondary seal individually. Divide the sum for each seal by the nominal diameter of the vessel and compare each ratio to the respective standards in § 61.272(b)(4) and § 61.272(b)(5).
(4) Repair conditions that do not meet requirements listed in paragraph (b)(4) (i) and (ii) within 45 days of identification in any inspection or empty and remove the storage vessel from service within 45 days.

This documentation is to include a description of the gas stream which enters the control device, including flow and benzene content under varying liquid level conditions (dynamic and static) and manufacturer's design specifications for the control device. If the control device or the closed vent capture system receives vapors, gases or liquids, other than fuels, from sources that are not designated sources under this subpart, the efficiency demonstration is to include consideration of all vapors, gases and liquids received by the closed vent capture system and control device. If an enclosed combustion device with a minimum residence time of 0.75 seconds and a minimum temperature of 816 °C (1,500 °F) is used to meet the 95 percent requirement, documentation that those conditions exist is sufficient to meet the requirements of this paragraph.
(ii) A description of the parameter or parameters to be monitored to ensure that the control device is operated and maintained in conformance with its design and an explanation of the criteria used for selection of that parameter (or parameters).
(iii) A maintenance plan for the system including the type of maintenance necessary, planned frequency of maintenance, and lengths of maintenance periods for those operations that would require the closed vent system or the control device to be out of compliance with § 61.271(c). The maintenance plan shall require that the system be out of compliance with § 61.271(c) for no more than 72 hours per year.
(2) Operate, monitor the parameters, and maintain the closed vent system and control device in accordance with the operating plan submitted to the Administrator in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section, unless the plan was modified by the Administrator during the approval process. In this case, the modified plan applies.
(d) The owner or operator of each source that is equipped with a closed vent system and a flare to meet the requirements in § 61.271(c) shall meet the requirements as specified in the general control device requirements in 40 CFR 60.18 (e) and (f).

means a marine vessel with a benzene product tank that has been demonstrated within the preceding 12 months to have no leaks. This demonstration shall be made using Method 21 of part 60, appendix A, during the last 20 percent of loading and during a period when the vessel is being loaded at its maximum loading rate. A reading of greater than 10,000 ppm as methane shall constitute a leak. As an alternative, a marine vessel owner or operator may use the vapor-tightness test described in § 61.304(f) to demonstrate vapor tightness. A marine vessel operated at negative pressure is assumed to be vapor-tight for the purpose of this standard.

The benzene quantity in a waste stream is to be counted only once without multiple counting if other waste streams are mixed with or generated from the original waste stream. Other specific requirements for calculating the total annual benzene waste quantity are as follows:
(1) Wastes that are exempted from control under §§ 61.342(c)(2) and 61.342(c)(3) are included in the calculation of the total annual benzene quantity if they have an annual average water content greater than 10 percent, or if they are mixed with water or other wastes at any time and the mixture has an annual average water content greater than 10 percent.
(2) The benzene in a material subject to this subpart that is sold is included in the calculation of the total annual benzene quantity if the material has an annual average water content greater than 10 percent.
(3) Benzene in wastes generated by remediation activities conducted at the facility, such as the excavation of contaminated soil, pumping and treatment of groundwater, and the recovery of product from soil or groundwater, are not included in the calculation of total annual benzene quantity for that facility. If the facility's total annual benzene quantity is 10 Mg/yr (11 ton/yr) or more, wastes generated by remediation activities are subject to the requirements of paragraphs (c) through (h) of this section. If the facility is managing remediation waste generated offsite, the benzene in this waste shall be included in the calculation of total annual benzene quantity in facility waste, if the waste streams have an annual average water content greater than 10 percent, or if they are mixed with water or other wastes at any time and the mixture has an annual average water content greater than 10 percent.
(4) The total annual benzene quantity is determined based upon the quantity of benzene in the waste before any waste treatment occurs to remove the benzene except as specified in § 61.355(c)(1)(i) (A) through (C).
(b) Each owner or operator of a facility at which the total annual benzene quantity from facility waste is equal to or greater than 10 Mg/yr (11 ton/yr) as determined in paragraph (a) of this section shall be in compliance with the requirements of paragraphs (c) through (h) of this section no later than 90 days following the effective date, unless a waiver of compliance has been obtained under § 61.11, or by the initial startup for a new source with an initial startup after the effective date.

# 7.0 Reagents and Standards
Unless otherwise indicated, all reagents must conform to the specifications established by the Committee on Analytical Reagents of the American Chemical Society; where such specifications are not available, use the best available grade.
7.1 Sample Collection. The following reagents are required for sample collection:
7.1.1 Water. Deionized distilled, to conform to ASTM D 1193-77 or 91 (incorporated by reference—see § 61.18), Type 1. If high concentrations of organic matter are not expected to be present, the analyst may eliminate the KMnO
4
test for oxidizable organic matter. Use this water in all dilutions and solution preparations.
7.1.2 Nitric Acid, 50 Percent (v/v). Mix equal volumes of concentrated HNO
3
and water, being careful to add the acid to the water slowly.
7.1.3 Silica Gel. Indicating type, 6- to 16-mesh. If previously used, dry at 175 °C (350 °F) for 2 hours. The tester may use new silica gel as received.
7.1.4 Potassium Iodide (KI) Solution, 25 Percent. Dissolve 250 g of KI in water, and dilute to 1 liter.
7.1.5 Iodine Monochloride Stock Solution, 1.0 M. To 800 ml of 25 percent KI solution, add 800 ml of concentrated HCl. Cool to room temperature. With vigorous stirring, slowly add 135 g of potassium iodate (KIO
3
), and stir until all free iodine has dissolved. A clear orange-red solution occurs when all the KIO
3
has been added. Cool to room temperature, and dilute to 1800 ml with water. Keep the solution in amber glass bottles to prevent degradation.
7.1.6 Absorbing Solution, 0.1 M ICl. Dilute 100 ml of the 1.0 M ICl stock solution to 1 liter with water. Keep the solution in amber glass bottles and in darkness to prevent degradation. This reagent is stable for at least two months.
7.2 Sample Preparation and Analysis. The following reagents and standards are required for sample preparation and analysis:
7.2.1 Reagents.
7.2.1.1 Tin (II) Solution. Prepare fresh daily, and keep sealed when not being used. Completely dissolve 20 g of tin (II) chloride (or 25 g of tin (II) sulfate) crystals (Baker Analyzed reagent grade or any other brand that will give a clear solution) in 25 ml of concentrated HCl. Dilute to 250 ml with water. Do not substitute HNO
3
, H
2
SO
4
, or other strong acids for the HCl.
7.2.1.2 Sulfuric Acid, 5 Percent (v/v). Dilute 25 ml of concentrated H
2
SO
4
to 500 ml with water.
7.2.2 Standards
7.2.2.1 Hg Stock Solution, 1 mg Hg/ml. Prepare and store all Hg standard solutions in borosilicate glass containers. Completely dissolve 0.1354 g of Hg (II) chloride in 75 ml of water in a 100-ml glass volumetric flask. Add 10 ml of concentrated HNO
3
, and adjust the volume to exactly 100 ml with water. Mix thoroughly. This solution is stable for at least one month.
7.2.2.2 Intermediate Hg Standard Solution, 10 µg Hg/ml. Prepare fresh weekly. Pipet 5.0 ml of the Hg stock solution (Section 7.2.2.1) into a 500-ml glass volumetric flask, and add 20 ml of the 5 percent H
2
SO
4
solution. Dilute to exactly 500 ml with water. Thoroughly mix the solution.
7.2.2.3 Working Hg Standard Solution, 200 ng Hg/ml. Prepare fresh daily. Pipet 5.0 ml of the intermediate Hg standard solution (Section 7.2.2.2) into a 250-ml volumetric glass flask. Add 10 ml of the 5 percent H
2
SO
4
and 2 ml of the 0.1 M ICl absorbing solution taken as a blank (Section 8.7.4.3), and dilute to 250 ml with water. Mix thoroughly.

# 8.0 Sample Collection, Preservation, Transport, and Storage
Because of the complexity of this method, testers should be trained and experienced with the test procedures to ensure reliable results. Since the amount of Hg that is collected generally is small, the method must be carefully applied to prevent contamination or loss of sample.
8.1 Pretest Preparation. Follow the general procedure outlined in Method 5, Section 8.1, except omit Sections 8.1.2 and 8.1.3.
8.2 Preliminary Determinations. Follow the general procedure outlined in Method 5, Section 8.2, with the exception of the following:
8.2.1 Select a nozzle size based on the range of velocity heads to assure that it is not necessary to change the nozzle size in order to maintain isokinetic sampling rates below 28 liters/min (1.0 cfm).
8.2.2 Perform test runs such that samples are obtained over a period or periods that accurately determine the maximum emissions that occur in a 24-hour period. In the case of cyclic operations, run sufficient tests for the accurate determination of the emissions that occur over the duration of the cycle. A minimum sample time of 2 hours is recommended. In some instances, high Hg or high SO
2
concentrations make it impossible to sample for the desired minimum time. This is indicated by reddening (liberation of free iodine) in the first impinger. In these cases, the sample run may be divided into two or more subruns to ensure that the absorbing solution is not depleted.
8.3 Preparation of Sampling Train.
8.3.1 Clean all glassware (probe, impingers, and connectors) by rinsing with 50 percent HNO
3
, tap water, 0.1 M ICl, tap water, and finally deionized distilled water. Place 100 ml of 0.1 M ICl in each of the first three impingers. Take care to prevent the absorbing solution from contacting any greased surfaces. Place approximately 200 g of preweighed silica gel in the fourth impinger. More silica gel may be used, but care should be taken to ensure that it is not entrained and carried out from the impinger during sampling. Place the silica gel container in a clean place for later use in the sample recovery. Alternatively, determine and record the weight of the silica gel plus impinger to the nearest 0.5 g.
8.3.2 Install the selected nozzle using a Viton A O-ring when stack temperatures are less than 260 °C (500 °F). Use a fiberglass string gasket if temperatures are higher. See APTD-0576 (Reference 3 in Method 5) for details. Other connecting systems using either 316 stainless steel or Teflon ferrules may be used. Mark the probe with heat-resistant tape or by some other method to denote the proper distance into the stack or duct for each sampling point.
8.3.3 Assemble the train as shown in Figure 101-1, using (if necessary) a very light coat of silicone grease on all ground glass joints. Grease only the outer portion (see APTD-0576) to avoid the possibility of contamination by the silicone grease.

# Note:
An empty impinger may be inserted between the third impinger and the silica gel to remove excess moisture from the sample stream.
8.3.4 After the sampling train has been assembled, turn on and set the probe heating system, if applicable, at the desired operating temperature. Allow time for the temperatures to stabilize. Place crushed ice around the impingers.
8.4 Leak-Check Procedures. Follow the leak-check procedures outlined in Method 5, Section 8.4.
8.5 Sampling Train Operation. Follow the general procedure outlined in Method 5, Section 8.5. For each run, record the data required on a data sheet such as the one shown in Figure 101-4.
8.6 Calculation of Percent Isokinetic. Same as Method 5, Section 8.6.
8.7 Sample Recovery. Begin proper cleanup procedure as soon as the probe is removed from the stack at the end of the sampling period.
8.7.1 Allow the probe to cool. When it can be safely handled, wipe off any external particulate matter near the tip of the probe nozzle, and place a cap over it. Do not cap off the probe tip tightly while the sampling train is cooling. Capping would create a vacuum and draw liquid out from the impingers.
8.7.2 Before moving the sampling train to the cleanup site, remove the probe from the train, wipe off the silicone grease, and cap the open outlet of the probe. Be careful not to lose any condensate that might be present. Wipe off the silicone grease from the impinger. Use either ground-glass stoppers, plastic caps, or serum caps to close these openings.
8.7.3 Transfer the probe and impinger assembly to a cleanup area that is clean, protected from the wind, and free of Hg contamination. The ambient air in laboratories located in the immediate vicinity of Hg-using facilities is not normally free of Hg contamination.
8.7.4 Inspect the train before and during disassembly, and note any abnormal conditions. Treat the samples as follows.
8.7.4.1 Container No. 1 (Impingers and Probe).
8.7.4.1.1 Using a graduated cylinder, measure the liquid in the first three impingers to within 1 ml. Record the volume of liquid present (
e.g.,
see Figure 5-6 of Method 5). This information is needed to calculate the moisture content of the effluent gas. (Use only glass storage bottles and graduated cylinders that have been precleaned as in Section 8.3.1) Place the contents of the first three impingers into a 1000-ml glass sample bottle.
8.7.4.1.2 Taking care that dust on the outside of the probe or other exterior surfaces does not get into the sample, quantitatively recover the Hg (and any condensate) from the probe nozzle, probe fitting, and probe liner as follows: Rinse these components with two 50-ml portions of 0.1 M ICl. Next, rinse the probe nozzle, fitting and liner, and each piece of connecting glassware between the probe liner and the back half of the third impinger with a maximum of 400 ml of water. Add all washings to the 1000-ml glass sample bottle containing the liquid from the first three impingers.
8.7.4.1.3 After all washings have been collected in the sample container, tighten the lid on the container to prevent leakage during shipment to the laboratory. Mark the height of the liquid to determine later
whether leakage occurred during transport. Label the container to identify clearly its contents.
8.7.4.2 Container No. 2 (Silica Gel). Same as Method 5, Section 8.7.6.3.
8.7.4.3 Container No. 3 (Absorbing Solution Blank). Place 50 ml of the 0.1 M ICl absorbing solution in a 100-ml sample bottle. Seal the container. Use this blank to prepare the working Hg standard solution (Section 7.2.2.3).

# 10.0 Calibration and Standardizations

# Note:
Maintain a laboratory log of all calibrations.
10.1 Before use, clean all glassware, both new and used, as follows: brush with soap and tap water, liberally rinse with tap water, soak for 1 hour in 50 percent HNO
3
, and then rinse with deionized distilled water.
10.2 Sampling Equipment. Calibrate the sampling equipment according to the procedures outlined in the following sections of Method 5: Section 10.1 (Probe Nozzle), Section 10.2 (Pitot Tube Assembly), Section 10.3 (Metering System), Section 10.5 (Temperature Sensors), Section 10.6 (Barometer).
10.3 Aeration System Flow Rate Meter. Assemble the aeration system as shown in Figure 101-5. Set the outlet pressure on the aeration gas cylinder regulator to a minimum pressure of 500 mm Hg (10 psi), and use the flow metering valve and a bubble flowmeter or wet-test meter to obtain a flow rate of 1.5 ±0.1 liters/min (0.053 ±0.0035 cfm) through the aeration cell. After the calibration of the aeration system flow rate meter is complete, remove the bubble flowmeter from the system.
10.4 Optical Cell Heating System. Using a 50-ml graduated cylinder, add 50 ml of water to the bottle section of the aeration cell, and attach the bottle section to the bubbler section of the cell. Attach the aeration cell to the optical cell and while aerating at 1.5 ±0.1 liters/min (0.053 ±0.0035 cfm), determine the minimum variable transformer setting necessary to prevent condensation of moisture in the optical cell and in the connecting tubing. (This setting should not exceed 20 volts.)
10.5 Spectrophotometer and Recorder.
10.5.1 The Hg response may be measured by either peak height or peak area.

# Note:
The temperature of the solution affects the rate at which elemental Hg is released from a solution and, consequently, it affects the shape of the absorption curve (area) and the point of maximum absorbance (peak height). Therefore, to obtain reproducible results, bring all solutions to room temperature before use.
10.5.2 Set the spectrophotometer wavelength at 253.7 nm, and make certain the optical cell is at the minimum temperature that will prevent water condensation. Then set the recorder scale as follows: Using a 50-ml graduated cylinder, add 50 ml of water to the aeration cell bottle. Add three drops of Antifoam B to the bottle, and then pipet 5.0 ml of the working Hg standard solution into the aeration cell.

# Note:
Always add the Hg-containing solution to the aeration cell after the 50 ml of water.
10.5.3 Place a Teflon-coated stirring bar in the bottle. Before attaching the bottle section to the bubbler section of the aeration cell, make certain that (1) the aeration cell exit arm stopcock (Figure 101-3) is closed (so that Hg will not prematurely enter the optical cell when the reducing agent is being added) and (2) there is no flow through the bubbler. If conditions (1) and (2) are met, attach the bottle section to the bubbler section of the aeration cell. Pipet 5 ml of tin (II) reducing solution into the aeration cell through the side arm, and immediately stopper the side arm. Stir the solution for 15 seconds, turn on the recorder, open the aeration cell exit arm stopcock, and immediately initiate aeration with continued stirring. Determine the maximum absorbance of the standard, and set this value to read 90 percent of the recorder full scale.
10.6 Calibration Curve.
10.6.1 After setting the recorder scale, repeat the procedure in Section 10.5 using 0.0-, 1.0-, 2.0-, 3.0-, 4.0-, and 5.0-ml aliquots of the working standard solution (final amount of Hg in the aeration cell is 0, 200, 400, 600, 800, and 1000 ng, respectively). Repeat this procedure on each aliquot size until two consecutive peaks agree within 3 percent of their average value.

# Note:
To prevent Hg carryover from one sample to another, do not close the aeration
cell from the optical cell until the recorder pen has returned to the baseline.)
10.6.2 It should not be necessary to disconnect the aeration gas inlet line from the aeration cell when changing samples. After separating the bottle and bubbler sections of the aeration cell, place the bubbler section into a 600-ml beaker containing approximately 400 ml of water. Rinse the bottle section of the aeration cell with a stream of water to remove all traces of the tin (II) reducing agent. Also, to prevent the loss of Hg before aeration, remove all traces of the reducing agent between samples by washing with water. It will be necessary, however, to wash the aeration cell parts with concentrated HCl if any of the following conditions occur: (1) A white film appears on any inside surface of the aeration cell, (2) the calibration curve changes suddenly, or (3) the replicate samples do not yield reproducible results.
10.6.3 Subtract the average peak height (or peak area) of the blank (0.0-ml aliquot)—which must be less than 2 percent of recorder full scale—from the averaged peak heights of the 1.0-, 2.0-, 3.0-, 4.0-, and 5.0-ml aliquot standards. If the blank absorbance is greater than 2 percent of full-scale, the probable cause is Hg contamination of a reagent or carry-over of Hg from a previous sample. Prepare the calibration curve by plotting the corrected peak height of each standard solution versus the corresponding final total Hg weight in the aeration cell (in ng), and draw the best fit straight line. This line should either pass through the origin or pass through a point no further from the origin than ±2 percent of the recorder full scale. If the line does not pass through or very near to the origin, check for nonlinearity of the curve and for incorrectly prepared standards.

# 11.0 Analytical Procedure
11.1 Sample Loss Check. Check the liquid level in each container to see whether liquid was lost during transport. If a noticeable amount of leakage occurred, either void the sample or use methods subject to the approval of the Administrator to account for the losses.
11.2 Sample Preparation. Treat each sample as follows:
11.2.1 Container No. 1 (Impingers and Probe). Carefully transfer the contents of Container No. 1 into a 1000-ml volumetric flask, and adjust the volume to exactly 1000 ml with water.
11.2.2 Dilutions. Pipet a 2-ml aliquot from the diluted sample from Section 11.2.1 into a 250-ml volumetric flask. Add 10 ml of 5 percent H
2
SO
4
, and adjust the volume to exactly 250 ml with water. This solution is stable for at least 72 hours.

# Note:
The dilution factor will be 250/2 for this solution.
11.3 Analysis. Calibrate the analytical equipment and develop a calibration curve as outlined in Sections 10.3 through 10.6.
11.3.1 Mercury Samples. Repeat the procedure used to establish the calibration curve with an appropriately sized aliquot (1 to 5 ml) of the diluted sample (from Section 11.2.2) until two consecutive peak heights agree within 3 percent of their average value. The peak maximum of an aliquot (except the 5-ml aliquot) must be greater than 10 percent of the recorder full scale. If the peak maximum of a 1.0-ml aliquot is off scale on the recorder, further dilute the original source sample to bring the Hg concentration into the calibration range of the spectrophotometer.
11.3.2 Run a blank and standard at least after every five samples to check the spectrophotometer calibration. The peak height of the blank must pass through a point no further from the origin than ±2 percent of the recorder full scale. The difference between the measured concentration of the standard (the product of the corrected peak height and the reciprocal of the least squares slope) and the actual concentration of the standard must be less than 7 percent, or recalibration of the analyzer is required.
11.3.3 Check for Matrix Effects (optional). Use the Method of Standard Additions as follows to check at least one sample from each source for matrix effects on the Hg results. The Method of Standard Additions procedures described on pages 9-4 and 9-5 of the section entitled “General Information” of the Perkin Elmer Corporation Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry Manual, Number 303-0152 (Reference 16 in Section 16.0) are recommended. If the results of the Method of Standard Additions procedure used on the single source sample do not agree to within ±5 percent of the value obtained by the routine atomic absorption analysis, then reanalyze all samples from the source using the Method of Standard Additions procedure.
11.4 Container No. 2 (Silica Gel). Weigh the spent silica gel (or silica gel plus impinger) to the nearest 0.5 g using a balance. (This step may be conducted in the field.)

# 12.0 Data Analysis and Calculations
Carry out calculations, retaining at least one extra decimal significant figure beyond that of the acquired data. Round off figures only after the final calculation. Other forms of the equations may be used as long as they give equivalent results.
12.1 Average Dry Gas Meter Temperature and Average Orifice Pressure Drop, Dry Gas Volume, Volume of Water Vapor Condensed, Moisture Content, and Isokinetic Variation. Same as Method 5, Sections 12.2 through 12.5 and 12.11, respectively.
12.2 Stack Gas Velocity. Using the data from this test and Equation 2-9 of Method 2, calculate the average stack gas velocity v
s
.
12.3 Total Mercury.
12.3.1 For each source sample, correct the average maximum absorbance of the two consecutive samples whose peak heights agree within 3 percent of their average for the contribution of the solution blank (see Section 10.6.3). Use the calibration curve and these corrected averages to determine the final total weight of Hg in ng in the aeration cell for each source sample.
12.3.2 Correct for any dilutions made to bring the sample into the working range of the spectrophotometer. Then calculate the Hg in the original solution, m

12.4 Mercury Emission Rate. Calculate the daily Hg emission rate, R, using Equation 101-2. For continuous operations, the operating time is equal to 86,400 seconds per day. For cyclic operations, use only the time per day each stack is in operation. The total Hg emission rate from a source will be the summation of results from all stacks.

12.5 Determination of Compliance. Each performance test consists of three repetitions of the applicable test method. For the purpose of determining compliance with an applicable national emission standard, use the average of the results of all repetitions.

# 13.0 Method Performance
The following estimates are based on collaborative tests, wherein 13 laboratories performed duplicate analyses on two Hg-containing samples from a chlor-alkali plant and on one laboratory-prepared sample of known Hg concentration. The sample concentrations ranged from 2 to 65 µg Hg/ml.
13.1 Precision. The estimated intra-laboratory and inter-laboratory standard deviations are 1.6 and 1.8 µg Hg/ml, respectively.
13.2 Accuracy. The participating laboratories that analyzed a 64.3 µg Hg/ml (in 0.1 M ICl) standard obtained a mean of 63.7 µg Hg/ml.
13.3 Analytical Range. After initial dilution, the range of this method is 0.5 to 120 µg Hg/ml. The upper limit can be extended by further dilution of the sample.

# Note:
This method does not include all of the specifications (
e.g.,
equipment and supplies) and procedures (
e.g.,
sampling and analytical) essential to its performance. Some material is incorporated by reference from methods in appendix A to 40 CFR part 60 and in this part. Therefore, to obtain reliable results, persons using this method should also have a thorough knowledge of at least the following additional test methods: Methods 1, Method 2, Method 3, and Method 5 of part 60 (appendix A), and Method 101 part 61 (appendix B).

Mercury (Hg)
7439-97-6
Dependent upon spectrophotometer and recorder.
1.2 Applicability. This method is applicable for the determination of Hg emissions from sewage sludge incinerators and other sources as specified in an applicable subpart of the regulations.
1.3 Data Quality Objectives. Adherence to the requirements of this method will enhance the quality of the data obtained from air pollutant sampling methods.

# 2.0 Summary of Method
2.1 Particulate and gaseous Hg emissions are withdrawn isokinetically from the source and are collected in acidic potassium permanganate (KMnO
4
) solution. The Hg collected (in the mercuric form) is reduced to elemental Hg, which is then aerated from the solution into an optical cell and measured by atomic absorption spectrophotometry.

# 3.0 Definitions.
[Reserved]

# 4.0 Interferences
4.1 Sample Collection. Excessive oxidizable organic matter in the stack gas prematurely depletes the KMnO
4
solution and thereby prevents further collection of Hg.
4.2 Analysis. Condensation of water vapor on the optical cell windows causes a positive interference.

# 5.0 Safety
5.1 Disclaimer. This method may involve hazardous materials, operations, and equipment. This test method may not address all of the safety problems associated with its use. It is the responsibility of the user of this test method to establish appropriate safety and health practices and determine the applicability of regulatory limitations prior to performing this test method.
5.2 Corrosive Reagents. The following reagents are hazardous. Personal protective equipment and safe procedures are useful in preventing chemical splashes. If contact occurs, immediately flush with copious amounts of water for at least 15 minutes. Remove clothing under shower and decontaminate. Treat residual chemical burns as thermal burns.
5.2.1 Hydrochloric Acid (HCl). Highly toxic. Vapors are highly irritating to eyes, skin, nose, and lungs, causing severe damage. May cause bronchitis, pneumonia, or edema of lungs. Exposure to concentrations of 0.13 to 0.2 percent can be lethal to humans in a few minutes. Provide ventilation to limit exposure. Reacts with metals, producing hydrogen gas.
5.2.2 Nitric Acid (HNO
3
). Highly corrosive to eyes, skin, nose, and lungs. Vapors cause bronchitis, pneumonia, or edema of lungs. Reaction to inhalation may be delayed as long as 30 hours and still be fatal. Provide ventilation to limit exposure. Strong oxidizer. Hazardous reaction may occur with organic materials such as solvents.
5.2.3 Sulfuric acid (H
2
SO
4
). Rapidly destructive to body tissue. Will cause third degree burns. Eye damage may result in blindness. Inhalation may be fatal from spasm of the larynx, usually within 30 minutes. May cause lung tissue damage with edema. 3 mg/m
3
will cause lung damage in uninitiated. 1 mg/m
3
for 8 hours will cause lung damage or, in higher concentrations, death. Provide ventilation to limit inhalation. Reacts violently with metals and organics.
5.3 Chlorine Evolution. Hydrochloric acid reacts with KMnO
4
to liberate chlorine gas. Although this is a minimal concern when small quantities of HCl (5-10 ml) are used in the impinger rinse, a potential safety hazard may still exist. At sources that emit higher concentrations of oxidizable materials (
e.g.,
power plants), more HCl may be required to remove the larger amounts of brown deposit formed in the impingers. In such cases, the potential safety hazards due to sample container pressurization are greater, because of the larger volume of HCl rinse added to the recovered sample. These hazards are eliminated by storing and analyzing the HCl impinger wash separately from the permanganate impinger sample.

# 6.0 Equipment and Supplies
6.1 Sample Collection and Sample Recovery. Same as Method 101, Sections 6.1 and 6.2, respectively, with the following exceptions:
6.1.1 Probe Liner. Same as in Method 101, Section 6.1.2, except that if a filter is used ahead of the impingers, the probe heating system must be used to minimize the condensation of gaseous Hg.
6.1.2 Filter Holder (Optional). Borosilicate glass with a rigid stainless-steel wire-screen filter support (do not use glass frit supports) and a silicone rubber or Teflon gasket, designed to provide a positive seal against leakage from outside or around the filter. The filter holder must be equipped with a filter heating system capable of maintaining a temperature around the filter holder of 120 ±14 °C (248 ±25 °F) during sampling to minimize both water and gaseous Hg condensation. A filter may also be used in cases where the stream contains large quantities of particulate matter.
6.2 Sample Analysis. Same as Method 101, Section 6.3, with the following additions and exceptions:
6.2.1 Volumetric Pipets. Class A; 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, 5-, 10-, and 20-ml.
6.2.2 Graduated Cylinder. 25-ml.
6.2.3 Steam Bath.
6.2.4 Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer or Equivalent. Any atomic absorption unit with an open sample presentation area in which to mount the optical cell is suitable. Instrument settings recommended by the particular manufacturer should be followed. Instruments designed specifically for the measurement of mercury using the cold-vapor technique are commercially available and may be substituted for the atomic absorption spectrophotometer.
6.2.5 Optical Cell. Alternatively, a heat lamp mounted above the cell or a moisture trap installed upstream of the cell may be used.
6.2.6 Aeration Cell. Alternatively, aeration cells available with commercial cold vapor instrumentation may be used.
6.2.7 Aeration Gas Cylinder. Nitrogen, argon, or dry, Hg-free air, equipped with a single-stage regulator. Alternatively, aeration may be provided by a peristaltic metering pump. If a commercial cold vapor instrument is used, follow the manufacturer's recommendations.

2
SO
4
to 900 ml of water.
7.1.6 Absorbing Solution, 4 Percent KMnO
4
(W/V). Prepare fresh daily. Dissolve 40 g of KMnO

to make 1 liter. Prepare and store in glass bottles to prevent degradation.
7.1.7 Hydrochloric Acid, 8 N. Carefully add and mix 67 ml of concentrated HCl to 33 ml of water.
7.2 Sample Analysis. The following reagents and standards are required for sample analysis:
7.2.1 Water. Same as in Section 7.1.1.
7.2.2 Tin (II) Solution. Prepare fresh daily, and keep sealed when not being used. Completely dissolve 20 g of tin (II) chloride (or 25 g of tin (II) sulfate) crystals (Baker Analyzed reagent grade or any other brand that will give a clear solution) in 25 ml of concentrated HCl. Dilute to 250 ml with water. Do not substitute HNO
3
H2SO
4
, or other strong acids for the HCl.
7.2.3 Sodium Chloride-Hydroxylamine Solution. Dissolve 12 g of sodium chloride and 12 g of hydroxylamine sulfate (or 12 g of hydroxylamine hydrochloride) in water and dilute to 100 ml.
7.2.4 Hydrochloric Acid, 8 N. Same as Section 7.1.7.
7.2.5 Nitric Acid, 15 Percent (V/V). Carefully add 15 ml HNO

7.2.11 Filter. Whatman No. 40, or equivalent.

# 8.0 Sample Collection, Preservation, Transport, and Storage
Same as Method 101, Section 8.0, with the exception of the following:
8.1 Preliminary Determinations. Same as Method 101, Section 8.2, except that the liberation of free iodine in the first impinger
due to high Hg or sulfur dioxide concentrations is not applicable. In this method, high oxidizable organic content may make it impossible to sample for the desired minimum time. This problem is indicated by the complete bleaching of the purple color of the KMnO
4
solution. In cases where an excess of water condensation is encountered, collect two runs to make one sample, or add an extra impinger in front of the first impinger (also containing acidified KMnO
4
solution).
8.2 Preparation of Sampling Train. Same as Method 101, Section 8.3, with the exception of the following:
8.2.1 In this method, clean all the glass components by rinsing with 50 percent HNO
3
, tap water, 8 N HCl, tap water, and finally with deionized distilled water. Then place 50 ml of absorbing solution in the first impinger and 100 ml in each of the second and third impingers.
8.2.2 If a filter is used, use a pair of tweezers to place the filter in the filter holder. Be sure to center the filter, and place the gasket in the proper position to prevent the sample gas stream from bypassing the filter. Check the filter for tears after assembly is completed. Be sure also to set the filter heating system at the desired operating temperature after the sampling train has been assembled.
8.3 Sampling Train Operation. In addition to the procedure outlined in Method 101, Section 8.5, maintain a temperature around the filter (if applicable) of 120 ±14 °C (248 ±25 °F).
8.4 Sample Recovery. Same as Method 101, Section 8.7, with the exception of the following:
8.4.1 Transfer the probe, impinger assembly, and (if applicable) filter assembly to the cleanup area.
8.4.2 Treat the sample as follows:
8.4.2.1 Container No. 1 (Impinger, Probe, and Filter Holder) and, if applicable, Container No. 1A (HCl rinse).
8.4.2.1.1 Using a graduated cylinder, measure the liquid in the first three impingers to within 1 ml. Record the volume of liquid present (
e.g.,
see Figure 5-6 of Method 5). This information is needed to calculate the moisture content of the effluent gas. (Use only graduated cylinder and glass storage bottles that have been precleaned as in Section 8.2.1.) Place the contents of the first three impingers (four if an extra impinger was added as described in Section 8.1) into a 1000-ml glass sample bottle labeled Container No. 1.

# Note:
If a filter is used, remove the filter from its holder as outlined under Section 8.4.3.
8.4.2.1.2 Taking care that dust on the outside of the probe or other exterior surfaces does not get into the sample, quantitatively recover the Hg (and any condensate) from the probe nozzle, probe fitting, probe liner, front half of the filter holder (if applicable), and impingers as follows: Rinse these components with a total of 400 ml (350 ml if an extra impinger was added as described in Section 8.1) of fresh absorbing solution, carefully assuring removal of all loose particulate matter from the impingers; add all washings to the 1000 ml glass sample bottle. To remove any residual brown deposits on the glassware following the permanganate rinse, rinse with approximately 100 ml of water, carefully assuring removal of all loose particulate matter from the impingers. Add this rinse to Container No. 1.
8.4.2.1.3 If no visible deposits remain after this water rinse, do not rinse with 8 N HCl. If deposits do remain on the glassware after the water rinse, wash impinger walls and stems with 25 ml of 8 N HCl, and place the wash in a separate container labeled Container No. 1A as follows: Place 200 ml of water in a sample container labeled Container No. 1A. Wash the impinger walls and stem with the HCl by turning the impinger on its side and rotating it so that the HCl contacts all inside surfaces. Pour the HCl wash carefully with stirring into Container No. 1A.
8.4.2.1.4 After all washings have been collected in the appropriate sample container(s), tighten the lid(s) on the container(s) to prevent leakage during shipment to the laboratory. Mark the height of the fluid level to allow subsequent determination of whether leakage has occurred during transport. Label each container to identify its contents clearly.
8.4.3 Container No. 2 (Silica Gel). Same as Method 5, Section 8.7.6.3.
8.4.4 Container No. 3 (Filter). If a filter was used, carefully remove it from the filter holder, place it in a 100-ml glass sample bottle, and add 20 to 40 ml of absorbing solution. If it is necessary to fold the filter, be sure that the particulate cake is inside the fold. Carefully transfer to the 100-ml sample bottle any particulate matter and filter fibers that adhere to the filter holder gasket by using a dry Nylon bristle brush and a sharp-edged blade. Seal the container. Label the container to identify its contents clearly. Mark the height of the fluid level to allow subsequent determination of whether leakage has occurred during transport.
8.4.5 Container No. 4 (Filter Blank). If a filter was used, treat an unused filter from the same filter lot as that used for sampling according to the procedures outlined in Section 8.4.4.
8.4.6 Container No. 5 (Absorbing Solution Blank). Place 650 ml of 4 percent KMnO
4
absorbing solution in a 1000-ml sample bottle. Seal the container.
8.4.7 Container No. 6 (HCl Rinse Blank). Place 200 ml of water in a 1000-ml sample bottle, and add 25 ml of 8 N HCl carefully
with stirring. Seal the container. Only one blank sample per 3 runs is required.

9.2 Volume Metering System Checks. Same as Method 5, Section 9.2.

# 10.0 Calibration and Standardization
Same as Method 101, Section 10.0, with the following exceptions:
10.1 Optical Cell Heating System Calibration. Same as in Method 101, Section 10.4, except use a-25 ml graduated cylinder to add 25 ml of water to the bottle section of the aeration cell.
10.2 Spectrophotometer and Recorder Calibration.
10.2.1 The Hg response may be measured by either peak height or peak area.

# Note:
The temperature of the solution affects the rate at which elemental Hg is released from a solution and, consequently, it affects the shape of the absorption curve (area) and the point of maximum absorbance (peak height). To obtain reproducible results, all solutions must be brought to room temperature before use.
10.2.2 Set the spectrophotometer wave length at 253.7 nm, and make certain the optical cell is at the minimum temperature that will prevent water condensation. Then set the recorder scale as follows: Using a 25-ml graduated cylinder, add 25 ml of water to the aeration cell bottle. Add three drops of Antifoam B to the bottle, and then pipet 5.0 ml of the working Hg standard solution into the aeration cell.

# Note:
Always add the Hg-containing solution to the aeration cell after the 25 ml of water.
10.2.3 Place a Teflon-coated stirring bar in the bottle. Add 5 ml of absorbing solution to the aeration bottle, and mix well. Before attaching the bottle section to the bubbler section of the aeration cell, make certain that (1) the aeration cell exit arm stopcock (Figure 101-3 of Method 101) is closed (so that Hg will not prematurely enter the optical cell when the reducing agent is being added) and (2) there is no flow through the bubbler. If conditions (1) and (2) are met, attach the bottle section to the bubbler section of the aeration cell. Add sodium chloride-hydroxylamine in 1 ml increments until the solution is colorless. Now add 5 ml of tin (II) solution to the aeration bottle through the side arm, and immediately stopper the side arm. Stir the solution for 15 seconds, turn on the recorder, open the aeration cell exit arm stopcock, and immediately initiate aeration with continued stirring. Determine the maximum absorbance of the standard, and set this value to read 90 percent of the recorder full scale.

# 11.0 Analytical Procedure
11.1 Sample Loss Check. Check the liquid level in each container to see if liquid was lost during transport. If a noticeable amount of leakage occurred, either void the sample or use methods subject to the approval of the Administrator to account for the losses.
11.2 Sample Preparation. Treat sample containers as follows:
11.2.1 Containers No. 3 and No. 4 (Filter and Filter Blank).
11.2.1.1 If a filter is used, place the contents, including the filter, of Containers No. 3 and No. 4 in separate 250-ml beakers, and heat the beakers on a steam bath until most of the liquid has evaporated. Do not heat to dryness. Add 20 ml of concentrated HNO
3
to the beakers, cover them with a watch glass, and heat on a hot plate at 70 °C (160 °F) for 2 hours. Remove from the hot plate.
11.2.1.2 Filter the solution from digestion of the Container No. 3 contents through Whatman No. 40 filter paper, and save the filtrate for addition to the Container No. 1 filtrate as described in Section 11.2.2. Discard the filter paper.
11.2.1.3 Filter the solution from digestion of the Container No. 4 contents through Whatman No. 40 filter paper, and save the filtrate for addition to Container No. 5 filtrate as described in Section 11.2.3 below. Discard the filter paper.
11.2.2 Container No. 1 (Impingers, Probe, and Filter Holder) and, if applicable, No. 1A (HCl rinse).
11.2.2.1 Filter the contents of Container No. 1 through Whatman No. 40 filter paper into a 1 liter volumetric flask to remove the brown manganese dioxide (MnO
2
) precipitate. Save the filter for digestion of the brown MnO
2
precipitate. Add the sample filtrate from Container No. 3 to the 1-liter volumetric flask, and dilute to volume with water. If the combined filtrates are greater than 1000 ml, determine the volume to the
nearest ml and make the appropriate corrections for blank subtractions. Mix thoroughly. Mark the filtrate as analysis Sample No. A.1 and analyze for Hg within 48 hr of the filtration step. Place the saved filter, which was used to remove the brown MnO
2
precipitate, into an appropriate sized container. In a laboratory hood, add 25 ml of 8 N HCl to the filter and allow to digest for a minimum of 24 hours at room temperature.
11.2.2.2 Filter the contents of Container 1A through Whatman No. 40 filter paper into a 500-ml volumetric flask. Then filter the digestate of the brown MnO
2
precipitate from Container No. 1 through Whatman No. 40 filter paper into the same 500-ml volumetric flask, and dilute to volume with water. Mark this combined 500 ml dilute solution as analysis Sample No. A.2. Discard the filters.
11.2.3 Container No. 5 (Absorbing Solution Blank) and No. 6 (HCl Rinse Blank).
11.2.3.1 Treat Container No. 5 as Container No. 1 (as described in Section 11.2.2), except substitute the filter blank filtrate from Container No. 4 for the sample filtrate from Container No. 3, and mark as Sample A.1 Blank.
11.2.3.2 Treat Container No. 6 as Container No. 1A, (as described in Section 11.2.2, except substitute the filtrate from the digested blank MnO
2
precipitate for the filtrate from the digested sample MnO
2
precipitate, and mark as Sample No. A.2 Blank.

# Note:
When analyzing samples A.1 Blank and HCl A.2 Blank, always begin with 10 ml aliquots. This applies specifically to blank samples.
11.3 Analysis. Calibrate the analytical equipment and develop a calibration curve as outlined in Section 10.0.
11.3.1 Mercury Samples. Then repeat the procedure used to establish the calibration curve with appropriately sized aliquots (1 to 10 ml) of the samples (from Sections 11.2.2 and 11.2.3) until two consecutive peak heights agree within 3 percent of their average value. If the 10 ml sample is below the detectable limit, use a larger aliquot (up to 20 ml), but decrease the volume of water added to the aeration cell accordingly to prevent the solution volume from exceeding the capacity of the aeration bottle. If the peak maximum of a 1.0 ml aliquot is off scale, further dilute the original sample to bring the Hg concentration into the calibration range of the spectrophotometer. If the Hg content of the absorbing solution and filter blank is below the working range of the analytical method, use zero for the blank.
11.3.2 Run a blank and standard at least after every five samples to check the spectrophotometer calibration; recalibrate as necessary.
11.3.3 Check for Matrix Effects (optional). Same as Method 101, Section 11.3.3.

1.3 Data Quality Objectives. Adherence to the requirements of this method will enhance the quality of the data obtained from air pollutant sampling methods.

# 2.0 Summary of Method
2.1 Particulate and gaseous Hg emissions are withdrawn isokinetically from the source and collected in acidic iodine monochloride (ICl) solution. The Hg collected (in the mercuric form) is reduced to elemental Hg, which is then aerated from the solution into an optical cell and measured by atomic absorption spectrophotometry.

It is the responsibility of the user of this test method to establish appropriate safety and health practices and determine the applicability of regulatory limitations prior to performing this test method.
5.2 Corrosive Reagents. Same as Method 101, Section 5.2.
5.3 Explosive Mixtures. The sampler must conduct the source test under conditions of utmost safety because hydrogen and air mixtures are explosive. Since the sampling train essentially is leakless, attention to safe operation can be concentrated at the inlet and outlet. If a leak does occur, however, remove the meter box cover to avoid a possible explosive mixture. The following specific precautions are recommended:
5.3.1 Operate only the vacuum pump during the test. The other electrical equipment,
e.g.,
heaters, fans, and timers, normally are not essential to the success of a hydrogen stream test.
5.3.2 Seal the sample port to minimize leakage of hydrogen from the stack.
5.3.3 Vent sampled hydrogen at least 3 m (10 ft) away from the train. This can be accomplished by attaching a 13-mm (0.50-in.) ID Tygon tube to the exhaust from the orifice meter.

# Note:
A smaller ID tubing may cause the orifice meter calibration to be erroneous. Take care to ensure that the exhaust line is not bent or pinched.

Same as Method 101, Section 8.0, with the exception of the following:
8.1 Setting of Isokinetic Rates.
8.1.1 If a nomograph is used, take special care in the calculation of the molecular weight of the stack gas and in the setting of the nomograph to maintain isokinetic conditions during sampling (Sections 8.1.1.1 through 8.1.1.3 below).
8.1.1.1 Calibrate the meter box orifice. Use the techniques described in APTD-0576 (see Reference 9 in Section 17.0 of Method 5 of appendix A to part 60). Calibration of the orifice meter at flow conditions that simulate the conditions at the source is suggested. Calibration should either be done with hydrogen or with some other gas having a similar Reynolds Number so that there is similarity between the Reynolds Numbers during calibration and during sampling. Alternative mercury-free thermometers may be used if the thermometers are, at a minimum, equivalent in terms of performance or suitably effective for the specific temperature measurement application.
8.1.1.2 The nomograph described in APTD-0576 cannot be used to calculate the C factor because the nomograph is designed for use when the stack gas dry molecular weight is 29 ±4. Instead, the following calculation should be made to determine the proper C factor:

This calculation is left in English units, and is not converted to metric units because nomographs are based on English units.
8.1.1.3 Set the calculated C factor on the operating nomograph, and select the proper nozzle diameter and K factor as specified in APTD-0576. If the C factor obtained in Section 8.1.1.2 exceeds the values specified on the existing operating nomograph, expand the C scale logarithmically so that the values can be properly located.
8.1.2 If a calculator is used to set isokinetic rates, it is suggested that the isokinetic equation presented in Reference 13 in Section 17.0 of Method 101 be consulted.
8.2 Sampling in Small (
12-in. Diameter) Stacks. When the stack diameter (or equivalent diameter) is less than 12 inches, conventional pitot tube-probe assemblies should not be used. For sampling guidelines, see Reference 14 in Section 17.0 of Method 101.

6.1.1 Nozzle. Stainless steel, or equivalent, with sharp, tapered leading edge.
6.1.2 Probe. Sheathed borosilicate or quartz glass tubing.
6.1.3 Filter. Millipore AA, or equivalent, with appropriate filter holder that provides a positive seal against leakage from outside or around the filter. It is suggested that a Whatman 41, or equivalent, be placed immediately against the back side of the Millipore filter as a guard against breakage of the Millipore. Include the backup filter in the analysis. To be equivalent, other filters shall exhibit at least 99.95 percent efficiency (0.05 percent penetration) on 0.3 micron dioctyl phthalate smoke particles, and be amenable to the Be analysis procedure. The filter efficiency tests shall be conducted in accordance with ASTM D 2986-71, 78, 95a (incorporated by reference—see § 61.18). Test data from the supplier's quality control program are sufficient for this purpose.
6.1.4 Meter-Pump System. Any system that will maintain isokinetic sampling rate, determine sample volume, and is capable of a sampling rate of greater than 14 lpm (0.5 cfm).
6.2 Measurement of Stack Conditions. The following equipment is used to measure stack conditions:
6.2.1 Pitot Tube. Type S, or equivalent, with a constant coefficient (±5 percent) over the working range.

7.2 Analysis. Reagents and standards as necessary for the selected analytical procedure.

# 8.0 Sample Collection, Preservation, Transport, and Storage
Guidelines for source testing are detailed in the following sections. These guidelines are generally applicable; however, most sample sites differ to some degree and temporary alterations such as stack extensions or expansions often are required to insure the best possible sample site. Further, since Be is hazardous, care should be taken to minimize exposure. Finally, since the total quantity of Be to be collected is quite small, the test must be carefully conducted to prevent contamination or loss of sample.
8.1 Selection of a Sampling Site and Number of Sample Runs. Select a suitable sample site that is as close as practicable to the point of atmospheric emission. If possible, stacks smaller than one foot in diameter should not be sampled.
8.1.1 Ideal Sampling Site. The ideal sampling site is at least eight stack or duct diameters downstream and two diameters upstream from any flow disturbance such as a bend, expansion or contraction. For rectangular cross sections, use Equation 103-1 in Section 12.2 to determine an equivalent diameter, D
e
.
8.1.2 Alternate Sampling Site. Some sampling situations may render the above sampling site criteria impractical. In such cases, select an alternate site no less than two diameters downstream and one-half diameter upstream from any point of flow disturbance. Additional sample runs are recommended at any sample site not meeting the criteria of Section 8.1.1.
8.1.3 Number of Sample Runs Per Test. Three sample runs constitute a test. Conduct each run at one of three different points. Select three points that proportionately divide the diameter, or are located at 25, 50, and 75 percent of the diameter from the inside wall. For horizontal ducts, sample on a vertical line through the centroid. For rectangular ducts, sample on a line through the centroid and parallel to a side. If additional sample runs are performed per Section 8.1.2, proportionately divide the duct to accommodate the total number of runs.
8.2 Measurement of Stack Conditions. Using the equipment described in Section 6.2, measure the stack gas pressure, moisture, and temperature to determine the molecular weight of the stack gas. Sound engineering estimates may be made in lieu of direct measurements. Describe the basis for such estimates in the test report.
8.3 Preparation of Sampling Train.
8.3.1 Assemble the sampling train as shown in Figure 103-1. It is recommended that all glassware be precleaned by soaking in wash acid for two hours.
8.3.2 Leak check the sampling train at the sampling site. The leakage rate should not be in excess of 1 percent of the desired sample rate.
8.4 Sampling Train Operation.
8.4.1 For each run, measure the velocity at the selected sampling point. Determine the isokinetic sampling rate. Record the velocity head and the required sampling rate. Place the nozzle at the sampling point with the tip pointing directly into the gas stream. Immediately start the pump and adjust the flow to isokinetic conditions. At the conclusion of the test, record the sampling rate. Again measure the velocity head at the sampling point. The required isokinetic rate at the end of the period should not have deviated more than 20 percent from that originally calculated. Describe the reason for any deviation beyond 20 percent in the test report.
8.4.2 Sample at a minimum rate of 14 liters/min (0.5 cfm). Obtain samples over such a period or periods of time as are necessary to determine the maximum emissions which would occur in a 24-hour period. In the case of cyclic operations, perform sufficient sample runs so as to allow determination or calculation of the emissions that occur over the duration of the cycle. A minimum sampling time of two hours per run is recommended.
8.5 Sample Recovery.
8.5.1 It is recommended that all glassware be precleaned as in Section 8.3. Sample recovery should also be performed in an area free of possible Be contamination. When the sampling train is moved, exercise care to prevent breakage and contamination. Set aside a portion of the acetone used in the sample recovery as a blank for analysis. The total amount of acetone used should be measured for accurate blank correction. Blanks can be eliminated if prior analysis shows negligible amounts.
8.5.2 Remove the filter (and backup filter, if used) and any loose particulate matter from filter holder, and place in a container.
8.5.3 Clean the probe with acetone and a brush or long rod and cotton balls. Wash into the container with the filter. Wash out the filter holder with acetone, and add to the same container.

Unless otherwise indicated, it is intended that all reagents conform to the specifications established by the Committee on Analytical Reagents of the American Chemical Society, where such specifications are available; otherwise, use the best available grade.
7.1 Sample Collection. Same as Method 5, Section 7.1, including deionized distilled water conforming to ASTM D 1193-77 or 91 (incorporated by reference—see § 61.18), Type 3. The Millipore AA filter is recommended.
7.2 Sample Recovery. Same as Method 5 in appendix A, part 60, Section 7.2, with the addition of the following:
7.2.1 Wash Acid, 50 Percent (V/V) Hydrochloric Acid (HCl). Mix equal volumes of concentrated HCl and water, being careful to add the acid slowly to the water.
7.3 Sample Preparation and Analysis. The following reagents and standards and standards are needed for sample preparation and analysis:
7.3.1 Water. Same as in Section 7.1.
7.3.2. Perchloric Acid (HClO
4

# 8.0 Sample Collection, Preservation, Transport, and Storage
The amount of Be that is collected is generally small, therefore, it is necessary to exercise particular care to prevent contamination or loss of sample.
8.1 Pretest Preparation. Same as Method 5, Section 8.1, except omit Section 8.1.3.
8.2 Preliminary Determinations. Same as Method 5, Section 8.2, with the exception of the following:
8.2.1 Select a nozzle size based on the range of velocity heads to assure that it is not necessary to change the nozzle size in order to maintain isokinetic sampling rates below 28 liters/min (1.0 cfm).
8.2.2 Obtain samples over a period or periods of time that accurately determine the maximum emissions that occur in a 24-hour period. In the case of cyclic operations, perform sufficient sample runs for the accurate determination of the emissions that occur over the duration of the cycle. A minimum sample time of 2 hours per run is recommended.
8.3 Preparation of Sampling Train. Same as Method 5, Section 8.3, with the exception of the following:
8.3.1 Prior to assembly, clean all glassware (probe, impingers, and connectors) by first soaking in wash acid for 2 hours, followed by rinsing with water.
8.3.2 Save a portion of the water for a blank analysis.
8.3.3 Procedures relating to the use of metal probe liners are not applicable.
8.3.4 Probe and filter heating systems are needed only if water condensation is a problem. If this is the case, adjust the heaters to provide a temperature at or above the stack temperature. However, membrane filters such as the Millipore AA are limited to about 107 °C (225 °F). If the stack gas is in excess of about 93 °C (200 °F), consideration should be given to an alternate procedure such as moving the filter holder downstream of the first impinger to insure that the filter does not exceed its temperature limit. After the sampling train has been assembled, turn on and set the probe heating system, if applicable, at the desired operating temperature. Allow time for the temperatures to stabilize. Place crushed ice around the impingers.

# Note:
An empty impinger may be inserted between the third impinger and the silica gel to remove excess moisture from the sample stream.
8.4 Leak Check Procedures, Sampling Train Operation, and Calculation of Percent Isokinetic. Same as Method 5, Sections 8.4, 8.5, and 8.6, respectively.
8.5 Sample Recovery. Same as Method 5, Section 8.7, except treat the sample as follows: Transfer the probe and impinger assembly to a cleanup area that is clean, protected from the wind, and free of Be contamination. Inspect the train before and during this assembly, and note any abnormal conditions. Treat the sample as follows: Disconnect the probe from the impinger train.
8.5.1 Container No. 1. Same as Method 5, Section 8.7.6.1.
8.5.2 Container No. 2. Place the contents (measured to 1 ml) of the first three impingers into a glass sample bottle. Use the procedures outlined in Section 8.7.6.2 of Method 5, where applicable, to rinse the probe nozzle, probe fitting, probe liner, filter holder, and all glassware between the filter holder and the back half of the third impinger with water. Repeat this procedure with acetone. Place both water and acetone rinse solutions in the sample bottle with the contents of the impingers.
8.5.3 Container No. 3. Same as Method 5, Section 8.7.6.3.
8.6 Blanks.
8.6.1 Water Blank. Save a portion of the water as a blank. Take 200 ml directly from the wash bottle being used and place it in a plastic sample container labeled “H
2
O blank.”
8.6.2 Filter. Save two filters from each lot of filters used in sampling. Place these filters in a container labeled “filter blank.”
8.7 Post-test Glassware Rinsing. If an additional test is desired, the glassware can be carefully double rinsed with water and reassembled. However, if the glassware is out of use more than 2 days, repeat the initial acid wash procedure.

# 10.0 Calibration and Standardization

# Note:
Maintain a laboratory log of all calibrations.
10.1 Sampling Equipment. Same as Method 5, Section 10.0.
10.2 Preparation of Standard Solutions. Pipet 1, 3, 5, 8, and 10 ml of the 1.0 µg Be/ml working standard solution into separate 100 ml volumetric flasks, and dilute to the mark with water. The total amounts of Be in these standards are 1, 3, 5, 8, and 10 µg, respectively.
10.3 Spectrophotometer and Recorder. The Be response may be measured by either peak height or peak area. Analyze an aliquot of the 10-µg standard at 234.8 nm using a nitrous oxide/acetylene flame. Determine the maximum absorbance of the standard, and set this value to read 90 percent of the recorder full scale.
10.4 Calibration Curve.
10.4.1 After setting the recorder scale, analyze an appropriately sized aliquot of each standard and the BLANK (see Section 11) until two consecutive peaks agree within 3 percent of their average value.
10.4.3 Subtract the average peak height (or peak area) of the blank—which must be less than 2 percent of recorder full scale—from the averaged peak heights of the standards. If the blank absorbance is greater than 2 percent of full-scale, the probable cause is Be contamination of a reagent or carry-over of Be from a previous sample. Prepare the calibration curve by plotting the corrected peak height of each standard solution versus the corresponding total Be weight in the standard (in µg).
10.5 Spectrophotometer Calibration Quality Control. Calculate the least squares slope of the calibration curve. The line must pass through the origin or through a point no further from the origin than ±2 percent of the recorder full scale. Multiply the corrected peak height by the reciprocal of the least squares slope to determine the distance each calibration point lies from the theoretical calibration line. The difference between the calculated concentration values and the actual concentrations (i.e., 1, 3, 5, 8, and 10 µg Be) must be less than 7 percent for all standards.

# 11.0 Analytical Procedure
11.1 Sample Loss Check. Prior to analysis, check the liquid level in Container No. 2. Note on the analytical data sheet whether leakage occurred during transport. If a noticeable amount of leakage occurred, either void the sample or take steps, subject to the approval of the Administrator, to adjust the final results.
11.2 Glassware Cleaning. Before use, clean all glassware according to the procedure of Section 8.3.1.
11.3 Sample Preparation. The digestion of Be samples is accomplished in part in concentrated HClO
4
.

# Note:
The sample must be heated to light brown fumes after the initial HNO3 addition;
otherwise, dangerous perchlorates may result from the subsequent HClO
4
digestion. HClO
4
should be used only under a hood.
11.3.1 Container No. 1. Transfer the filter and any loose particulate matter from Container No. 1 to a 150-ml beaker. Add 35 ml concentrated HNO

. To oxidize all organic matter, heat on a hotplate until light brown fumes are evident. Cool to room temperature, and add 5 ml 12 N H

and 5 ml concentrated HClO

. To oxidize all organic matter, heat on a hotplate until light brown fumes are evident. Cool to room temperature, and add 5 ml 12 N H

and 5 ml concentrated HClO

. Then proceed with step 11.3.4.
11.3.3 Final Sample Preparation. Add the sample from Section 11.3.2 to the 150-ml beaker from Section 11.3.1. Replace on a hotplate, and evaporate to dryness in a HClO
4
hood. Cool the residue to room temperature, add 10.0 ml of 25 percent V/V HCl, and mix to dissolve the residue.
11.3.4 Filter and Water Blanks. Cut each filter into strips, and treat each filter individually as directed in Section 11.3.1. Treat the 200-ml water blank as directed in Section 11.3.2. Combine and treat these blanks as directed in Section 11.3.3.
11.4 Spectrophotometer Preparation. Turn on the power; set the wavelength, slit width, and lamp current; and adjust the background corrector as instructed by the manufacturer's manual for the particular atomic absorption spectrophotometer. Adjust the burner and flame characteristics as necessary.
11.5 Analysis. Calibrate the analytical equipment and develop a calibration curve as outlined in Sections 10.4 and 10.5.
11.5.1 Beryllium Samples. Repeat the procedure used to establish the calibration curve with an appropriately sized aliquot of each sample (from Section 11.3.3) until two consecutive peak heights agree within 3 percent of their average value. The peak height of each sample must be greater than 10 percent of the recorder full scale. If the peak height of the sample is off scale on the recorder, further dilute the original source sample to bring the Be concentration into the calibration range of the spectrophotometer.
11.5.2 Run a blank and standard at least after every five samples to check the spectrophotometer calibration. The peak height of the blank must pass through a point no further from the origin than ±2 percent of the recorder full scale. The difference between the measured concentration of the standard (the product of the corrected peak height and the reciprocal of the least squares slope) and the actual concentration of the standard must be less than 7 percent, or recalibration of the analyzer is required.
11.5.3 Check for Matrix Effects (optional). Use the Method of Standard Additions (see Reference 2 in Section 17.0) to check at least one sample from each source for matrix effects on the Be results. If the results of the Method of Standard Additions procedure used on the single source sample do not agree to within 5 percent of the value obtained by the routine atomic absorption analysis, then reanalyze all samples from the source using the Method of Standard Additions procedure.
11.6 Container No. 2 (Silica Gel). Weigh the spent silica gel (or silica gel plus impinger) to the nearest 0.5 g using a balance. (This step may be conducted in the field.)

7.1.2 Hydrogen. Purity 99.9995 percent or greater.
7.1.3 Oxygen or Air. Either oxygen (purity 99.99 percent or greater) or air (less than 0.1 ppmv total hydrocarbon content), as required by detector.
7.2 Calibration. Use one of the following options: either Sections 7.2.1 and 7.2.2, or Section 7.2.3.
7.2.1 Vinyl Chloride. Pure vinyl chloride gas certified by the manufacturer to contain a minimum of 99.9 percent vinyl chloride. If the gas manufacturer maintains a bulk cylinder supply of 99.9 + percent vinyl chloride, the certification analysis may have been performed on this supply, rather than on each gas cylinder prepared from this bulk supply. The date of gas cylinder preparation and the certified analysis must have been affixed to the cylinder before shipment from the gas manufacturer to the buyer.
7.2.2 Nitrogen. Same as described in Section 7.1.1.
7.2.3 Cylinder Standards. Gas mixture standards (50-,10-, and 5 ppmv vinyl chloride) in nitrogen cylinders may be used to directly prepare a chromatograph calibration curve as described in Section 10.3 if the following conditions are met: (a) The manufacturer certifies the gas composition with an accuracy of ±3 percent or better. (b) The manufacturer recommends a maximum shelf life over which the gas concentration does not change by greater than ±5 percent from the certified value. (c) The manufacturer affixes the date of gas cylinder preparation, certified vinyl chloride concentration, and recommended maximum shelf to the cylinder before shipment to the buyer.
7.2.3.1 Cylinder Standards Certification. The manufacturer shall certify the concentration of vinyl chloride in nitrogen in each cylinder by (a) directly analyzing each cylinder and (b) calibrating his analytical procedure on the day of cylinder analysis. To calibrate his analytical procedure, the manufacturer shall use as a minimum, a three point calibration curve. It is recommended that the manufacturer maintain (1) a high concentration calibration standard (between 50 and 100 ppmv) to prepare his calibration curve by an appropriate dilution technique and (2) a low-concentration calibration standard (between 5 and 10 ppmv) to verify the dilution technique used. If the difference between the apparent concentration read from the calibration curve and the true concentration assigned to the low-concentration calibration standard exceeds 5 percent of the true concentration, the manufacturer shall determine the source of error and correct it, then repeat the three-point calibration.
7.2.3.2 Verification of Manufacturer's Calibration Standards. Before using a standard, the manufacturer shall verify each calibration standard (a) by comparing it to gas mixtures prepared (with 99 mole percent vinyl chloride) in accordance with the procedure described in Section 7.2.1 or (b) calibrating it against vinyl chloride cylinder Standard Reference Materials (SRM's) prepared by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, if such SRM's are available. The agreement between the initially determined concentration value and the verification concentration value must be ±5 percent. The manufacturer must reverify all calibration standards on a time interval consistent with the shelf life of the cylinder standards sold.

# 8.0 Sample Collection, Preservation, Storage, and Transport

# Note:
Performance of this method should not be attempted by persons unfamiliar with the operation of a gas chromatograph (GC) nor by those who are unfamiliar with source sampling, because knowledge beyond the scope of this presentation is required.
8.1 Bag Leak-Check. The following leak-check procedure is recommended, but not required, prior to sample collection. The post-test leak-check procedure is mandatory. Connect a water manometer and pressurize the bag to 5 to 10 cm H
2
O (2 to 4 in. H
2
O). Allow to stand for 10 min. Any displacement in the water manometer indicates a leak. Also, check the rigid container for leaks in this manner.

# Note:
An alternative leak-check method is to pressurize the bag to 5 to 10 cm H2O and allow it to stand overnight. A deflated bag indicates a leak. For each sample bag in its rigid container, place a rotameter in line between the bag and the pump inlet. Evacuate the bag. Failure of the rotameter to register
zero flow when the bag appears to be empty indicates a leak.
8.2 Sample Collection. Assemble the sample train as shown in Figure 106-1. Join the quick connects as illustrated, and determine that all connection between the bag and the probe are tight. Place the end of the probe at the centroid of the stack and start the pump with the needle valve adjusted to yield a flow that will fill over 50 percent of bag volume in the specific sample period. After allowing sufficient time to purge the line several times, change the vacuum line from the container to the bag and evacuate the bag until the rotameter indicates no flow. Then reposition the sample and vacuum lines and begin the actual sampling, keeping the rate proportional to the stack velocity. At all times, direct the gas exiting the rotameter away from sampling personnel. At the end of the sample period, shut off the pump, disconnect the sample line from the bag, and disconnect the vacuum line from the bag container. Protect the bag container from sunlight.
8.3 Sample Storage. Keep the sample bags out of direct sunlight. When at all possible, analysis is to be performed within 24 hours, but in no case in excess of 72 hours of sample collection. Aluminized Mylar bag samples must be analyzed within 24 hours.
8.4 Post-test Bag Leak-Check. Subsequent to recovery and analysis of the sample, leak-check the sample bag according to the procedure outlined in Section 8.1.

# Note:
Maintain a laboratory log of all calibrations.
10.1 Preparation of Vinyl Chloride Standard Gas Mixtures. (Optional Procedure-delete if cylinder standards are used.) Evacuate a 16-inch square Tedlar bag that has passed a leak-check (described in Section 8.1) and meter in 5.0 liters of nitrogen. While the bag is filling, use the 0.5-ml syringe to inject 250 µl of 99.9 + percent vinyl chloride gas through the wall of the bag. Upon withdrawing the syringe, immediately cover the resulting hole with a piece of adhesive tape. The bag now contains a vinyl chloride concentration of 50 ppmv. In a like manner use the 50 µl syringe to prepare gas mixtures having 10-and 5-ppmv vinyl chloride concentrations. Place each bag on a smooth surface and alternately depress opposite sides of the bag 50 times to further mix the gases. These gas mixture standards may be used for 10 days from the date of preparation, after which time new gas mixtures must be prepared. (Caution: Contamination may be a problem when a bag is reused if the new gas mixture standard is a lower concentration than the previous gas mixture standard.)
10.2 Determination of Vinyl Chloride Retention Time. (This section can be performed simultaneously with Section 10.3.) Establish chromatograph conditions identical with those in Section 11.3. Determine proper attenuator position. Flush the sampling loop with helium or nitrogen and activate the sample valve. Record the injection time, sample loop temperature, column temperature, carrier gas flow rate, chart speed, and attenuator setting. Record peaks and detector responses that occur in the absence of vinyl chloride. Maintain conditions with the equipment plumbing arranged identically to Section 11.2, and flush the sample loop for 30 seconds at the rate of 100 ml/min with one of the vinyl chloride calibration mixtures. Then activate the sample valve. Record the injection time. Select the peak that corresponds to vinyl chloride. Measure the distance on the chart from the injection time to the time at which the peak maximum occurs. This quantity divided by the chart speed is defined as the retention time. Since other organics may be present in the sample, positive identification of the vinyl chloride peak must be made.
10.3 Preparation of Chromatograph Calibration Curve. Make a GC measurement of each gas mixture standard (described in Section 7.2.3 or 10.1) using conditions identical to those listed in Sections 11.2 and 11.3. Flush the sampling loop for 30 seconds at the rate of 100 ml/min with one of the standard mixtures, and activate the sample valve. Record the concentration of vinyl chloride injected (C
c
), attenuator setting, chart speed, peak area, sample loop temperature, column temperature, carrier gas flow rate, and retention time. Record the barometric pressure. Calculate A
c
, the peak area multiplied by the attenuator setting. Repeat until two consecutive injection areas are within 5 percent, then plot the average of those two values versus C
c
. When the other standard gas mixtures have been similarly analyzed and plotted, draw a straight line through the points derived by the least squares method. Perform calibration daily, or before and after the analysis of each emission test set of bag samples, whichever is more frequent. For each group of sample analyses, use the average of the two calibration curves which
bracket that group to determine the respective sample concentrations. If the two calibration curves differ by more than 5 percent from their mean value, then report the final results by both calibration curves.

# 11.0 Analytical Procedure
11.2 Sample Recovery. With a new piece of Teflon tubing identified for that bag, connect a bag inlet valve to the gas chromatograph sample valve. Switch the valve to receive gas from the bag through the sample loop. Arrange the equipment so the sample gas passes from the sample valve to 100-ml/min rotameter with flow control valve followed by a charcoal tube and a 1-in. H
2
O pressure gauge. Maintain the sample flow either by a vacuum pump or container pressurization if the collection bag remains in the rigid container. After sample loop purging is ceased, allow the pressure gauge to return to zero before activating the gas sampling valve.
11.3 Analysis.
11.3.1 Set the column temperature to 100 °C (210 °F) and the detector temperature to 150 °C (300 °F). When optimum hydrogen and oxygen (or air) flow rates have been determined, verify and maintain these flow rates during all chromatography operations. Using helium or nitrogen as the carrier gas, establish a flow rate in the range consistent with the manufacturer's requirements for satisfactory detector operation. A flow rate of approximately 40 ml/min should produce adequate separations. Observe the base line periodically and determine that the noise level has stabilized and that base line drift has ceased. Purge the sample loop for 30 seconds at the rate of 100 ml/min, shut off flow, allow the sample loop pressure to reach atmospheric pressure as indicated by the H
2
O manometer, then activate the sample valve. Record the injection time (the position of the pen on the chart at the time of sample injection), sample number, sample loop temperature, column temperature, carrier gas flow rate, chart speed, and attenuator setting. Record the barometric pressure. From the chart, note the peak having the retention time corresponding to vinyl chloride as determined in Section 10.2. Measure the vinyl chloride peak area, A
m
, by use of a disc integrator, electronic integrator, or a planimeter. Measure and record the peak heights, H
m
. Record A
m
and retention time. Repeat the injection at least two times or until two consecutive values for the total area of the vinyl chloride peak agree within 5 percent of their average. Use the average value for these two total areas to compute the bag concentration.
11.3.2 Compare the ratio of H
m
to A
m
for the vinyl chloride sample with the same ratio for the standard peak that is closest in height. If these ratios differ by more than 10 percent, the vinyl chloride peak may not be pure (possibly acetaldehyde is present) and the secondary column should be employed (see Section 6.3.2.2).
11.4 Determination of Bag Water Vapor Content. Measure the ambient temperature and barometric pressure near the bag. From a water saturation vapor pressure table, determine and record the water vapor content of the bag, B
wb
, as a decimal figure. (Assume the relative humidity to be 100 percent unless a lesser value is known.)

# Note:
Performance of this method should not be attempted by persons unfamiliar with the operation of a gas chromatograph (GC) nor by those who are unfamiliar with source sampling, because knowledge beyond the scope of this presentation is required. This method does not include all of the specifications (
e.g.,
equipment and supplies) and procedures (
e.g.,
sampling and analytical) essential to its performance. Some material is incorporated by reference from other methods in this part. Therefore, to obtain reliable results, persons using this method should have
a thorough knowledge of at least the following additional test methods: Method 106.

# 1.0 Scope and Application
1.1 Analytes.
Analyte
CAS No.
Sensitivity
Vinyl Chloride (CH

:CHCl)
75-01-4
Dependent upon analytical equipment.
1.2 Applicability. This method is applicable for the determination of the vinyl chloride monomer (VCM) content of in-process wastewater samples, and the residual vinyl chloride monomer (RCVM) content of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) resins, wet, cake, slurry, and latex samples. It cannot be used for polymer in fused forms, such as sheet or cubes. This method is not acceptable where methods from section 304(h) of the Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. 1251
et seq.
(the Federal Water Pollution Control Amendments of 1972 as amended by the Clean Water Act of 1977) are required.
1.3 Data Quality Objectives. Adherence to the requirements of this method will enhance the quality of the data obtained from air pollutant sampling methods.

# 2.0 Summary of Method
2.1 The basis for this method relates to the vapor equilibrium that is established at a constant known temperature in a closed system between RVCM, PVC resin, water, and air. The RVCM in a PVC resin will equilibrate rapidly in a closed vessel, provided that the temperature of the PVC resin is maintained above the glass transition temperature of that specific resin.
2.2 A sample of PVC or in-process wastewater is collected in a vial or bottle and is conditioned. The headspace in the vial or bottle is then analyzed for vinyl chloride using gas chromatography with a flame ionization detector.

# 4.0 Interferences
4.1 The chromatograph columns and the corresponding operating parameters herein described normally provide an adequate resolution of vinyl chloride; however, resolution interferences may be encountered on some sources. Therefore, the chromatograph operator shall select the column and operating parameters best suited to his particular analysis requirements, subject to the approval of the Administrator. Approval is automatic provided that confirming data are produced through an adequate supplemental analytical technique, such as analysis with a different column or GC/mass spectroscopy, and that these data are made available for review by the Administrator.

# 5.0 Safety
5.1 Disclaimer. This method may involve hazardous materials, operations, and equipment. This test method may not address all of the safety problems associated with its use. It is the responsibility of the user of this test method to establish appropriate safety and health practices and determine the applicability of regulatory limitations prior to performing this test method.
5.2 Toxic Analyte. Care must be exercised to prevent exposure of sampling personnel to vinyl chloride, which is a carcinogen. Do not release vinyl chloride to the laboratory atmosphere during preparation of standards. Venting or purging with VCM/air mixtures must be held to a minimum. When they are required, the vapor must be routed to outside air. Vinyl chloride, even at low ppm levels, must never be vented inside the laboratory. After vials have been analyzed, the gas must be vented prior to removal of the vial from the instrument turntable. Vials must be vented through a hypodermic needle connected to an activated charcoal tube to prevent release of vinyl chloride into the laboratory atmosphere. The charcoal must be replaced prior to vinyl chloride breakthrough.

# 6.0 Equipment and Supplies
6.1 Sample Collection. The following equipment is required:
6.1.1 Glass bottles. 60-ml (2-oz) capacity, with wax-lined screw-on tops, for PVC samples.
6.1.2 Glass Vials. Headspace vials, with Teflon-faced butyl rubber sealing discs, for water samples.
6.1.3 Adhesive Tape. To prevent loosening of bottle tops.
6.2 Sample Recovery. The following equipment is required:
6.2.1 Glass Vials. Headspace vials, with butyl rubber septa and aluminum caps. Silicone rubber is not acceptable.
6.2.2 Analytical Balance. Capable of determining sample weight within an accuracy of ±1 percent.
6.2.3 Vial Sealer. To seal headspace vials.
6.2.4 Syringe. 100-ml capacity.
6.3 Analysis. The following equipment is required:
6.3.1 Headspace Sampler and Chromatograph. Capable of sampling and analyzing a constant amount of headspace gas from a sealed vial, while maintaining that
vial at a temperature of 90 °C ±0.5 °C (194 °F ±0.9 °F). The chromatograph shall be equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID). Perkin-Elmer Corporation Models F-40, F-42, F-45, HS-6, and HS-100, and Hewlett-Packard Corporation Model 19395A have been found satisfactory. Chromatograph backflush capability may be required.
6.3.2 Chromatographic Columns. Stainless steel 1 m by 3.2 mm and 2 m by 3.2 mm, both containing 50/80-mesh Porapak Q. Other columns may be used provided that the precision and accuracy of the analysis of vinyl chloride standards are not impaired and information confirming that there is adequate resolution of the vinyl chloride peak are available for review. (Adequate resolution is defined as an area overlap of not more than 10 percent of the vinyl chloride peak by an interferant peak. Calculation of area overlap is explained in Procedure 1 of appendix C to this part: “Determination of Adequate Chromatographic Peak Resolution.”) Two 1.83 m columns, each containing 1 percent Carbowax 1500 on Carbopak B, have been found satisfactory for samples containing acetaldehyde.
6.3.3 Temperature Sensor. Range 0 to 100 °C (32 to 212 °F) accurate to 0.1 °C.
6.3.4 Integrator-Recorder. To record chromatograms.
6.3.5 Barometer. Accurate to 1 mm Hg.
6.3.6 Regulators. For required gas cylinders.
6.3.7 Headspace Vial Pre-Pressurizer. Nitrogen pressurized hypodermic needle inside protective shield.

# 7.0 Reagents and Standards
7.1 Analysis. Same as Method 106, Section 7.1, with the addition of the following:
7.1.1 Water. Interference-free.
7.2 Calibration. The following items are required for calibration:
7.2.1 Cylinder Standards (4). Gas mixture standards (50-, 500-, 2000- and 4000-ppm vinyl chloride in nitrogen cylinders). Cylinder standards may be used directly to prepare a chromatograph calibration curve as described in Section 10.3, if the following conditions are met: (a) The manufacturer certifies the gas composition with an accuracy of ±3 percent or better (see Section 7.2.1.1). (b) The manufacturer recommends a maximum shelf life over which the gas concentration does not change by greater than ±5 percent from the certified value. (c) The manufacturer affixes the date of gas cylinder preparation, certified vinyl chloride concentration, and recommended maximum shelf life to the cylinder before shipment to the buyer.
7.2.1.1 Cylinder Standards Certification. The manufacturer shall certify the concentration of vinyl chloride in nitrogen in each cylinder by (a) directly analyzing each cylinder and (b) calibrating the analytical procedure on the day of cylinder analysis. To calibrate the analytical procedure, the manufacturer shall use, as a minimum, a 3-point calibration curve. It is recommended that the manufacturer maintain (1) a high-concentration calibration standard (between 4000 and 8000 ppm) to prepare the calibration curve by an appropriate dilution technique and (2) a low-concentration calibration standard (between 50 and 500 ppm) to verify the dilution technique used. If the difference between the apparent concentration read from the calibration curve and the true concentration assigned to the low-concentration calibration standard exceeds 5 percent of the true concentration, the manufacturer shall determine the source of error and correct it, then repeat the 3-point calibration.
7.2.1.2 Verification of Manufacturer's Calibration Standards. Before using, the manufacturer shall verify each calibration standard by (a) comparing it to gas mixtures prepared (with 99 mole percent vinyl chloride) in accordance with the procedure described in Section 10.1 of Method 106 or by (b) calibrating it against vinyl chloride cylinder Standard Reference Materials (SRMs) prepared by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, if such SRMs are available. The agreement between the initially determined concentration value and the verification concentration value must be within 5 percent. The manufacturer must reverify all calibration standards on a time interval consistent with the shelf life of the cylinder standards sold.

# 8.0 Sample Collection, Preservation, Storage, and Transport
8.1 Sample Collection.
8.1.1 PVC Sampling. Allow the resin or slurry to flow from a tap on the tank or silo until the tap line has been well purged. Extend and fill a 60-ml sample bottle under the tap, and immediately tighten a cap on the bottle. Wrap adhesive tape around the cap and bottle to prevent the cap from loosening. Place an identifying label on each bottle, and record the date, time, and sample location both on the bottles and in a log book.
8.1.2 Water Sampling. At the sampling location fill the vials bubble-free to overflowing so that a convex meniscus forms at the top. The excess water is displaced as the sealing disc is carefully placed, with the Teflon side down, on the opening of the vial. Place the aluminum seal over the disc and the neck of the vial, and crimp into place. Affix an identifying label on the bottle, and record the date, time, and sample location both on the vials and in a log book.
8.2 Sample Storage. All samples must be analyzed within 24 hours of collection, and must be refrigerated during this period.

# 10.0 Calibration and Standardization

# Note:
Maintain a laboratory log of all calibrations.
10.1 Preparation of Standards. Calibration standards are prepared as follows: Place 100 µl or about two equal drops of distilled water in the sample vial, then fill the vial with the VCM/nitrogen standard, rapidly seat the septum, and seal with the aluminum cap. Use a
1/8
-in. stainless steel line from the cylinder to the vial. Do not use rubber or Tygon tubing. The sample line from the cylinder must be purged (into a properly vented hood) for several minutes prior to filling the vials. After purging, reduce the flow rate to between 500 and 1000 cc/min. Place end of tubing into vial (near bottom). Position a septum on top of the vial, pressing it against the
1/8
-in. filling tube to minimize the size of the vent opening. This is necessary to minimize mixing air with the standard in the vial. Each vial is to be purged with standard for 90 seconds, during which time the filling tube is gradually slid to the top of the vial. After the 90 seconds, the tube is removed with the septum, simultaneously sealing the vial. Practice will be necessary to develop good technique. Rubber gloves should be worn during the above operations. The sealed vial must then be pressurized for 60 seconds using the vial prepressurizer. Test the vial for leakage by placing a drop of water on the septum at the needle hole. Prepressurization of standards is not required unless samples have been prepressurized.
10.2 Analyzer Calibration. Calibration is to be performed each 8-hour period the chromatograph is used. Alternatively, calibration with duplicate 50-, 500-, 2,000-, and 4,000-ppm standards (hereafter described as a four-point calibration) may be performed on a monthly basis, provided that a calibration confirmation test consisting of duplicate analyses of an appropriate standard is performed once per plant shift, or once per chromatograph carrousel operation (if the chromatograph operation is less frequent than once per shift). The criterion for acceptance of each calibration confirmation test is that both analyses of 500-ppm standards [2,000-ppm standards if dispersion resin (excluding latex resin) samples are being analyzed] must be within 5 percent of the most recent four-point calibration curve. If this criterion is not met, then a complete four-point calibration must be performed before sample analyses can proceed.
10.3 Preparation of Chromatograph Calibration Curve. Prepare two vials each of 50-, 500-, 2,000-, and 4,000-ppm standards. Run the calibration samples in exactly the same manner as regular samples. Plot A
s
, the integrator area counts for each standard sample, versus C
c
, the concentration of vinyl chloride in each standard sample. Draw a straight line through the points derived by the least squares method.

# 11.0 Analytical Procedure
11.1 Preparation of Equipment. Install the chromatographic column and condition overnight at 160 °C (320 °F). In the first operation, Porapak columns must be purged for 1 hour at 230 °C (450 °F).
Do not connect the exit end of the column to the detector while conditioning. Hydrogen and air to the detector must be turned off while the column is disconnected.
11.2 Flow Rate Adjustments. Adjust flow rates as follows:
11.2.1. Nitrogen Carrier Gas. Set regulator on cylinder to read 50 psig. Set regulator on chromatograph to produce a flow rate of 30.0 cc/min. Accurately measure the flow rate at the exit end of the column using the soap film flowmeter and a stopwatch, with the oven and column at the analysis temperature. After the instrument program advances to the “B” (backflush) mode, adjust the nitrogen pressure regulator to exactly balance the nitrogen flow rate at the detector as was obtained in the “A” mode.
11.2.2. Vial Prepressurizer Nitrogen.
11.2.2.1 After the nitrogen carrier is set, solve the following equation and adjust the pressure on the vial prepressurizer accordingly.

7.50 = mm Hg per k Pa.
10 kPa = Factor to adjust the prepressurized pressure to slightly less than the dosing pressure.
11.2.2.2 Because of gauge errors, the apparatus may over-pressurize the vial. If the vial pressure is at or higher than the dosing pressure, an audible double injection will occur. If the vial pressure is too low, errors will occur on resin samples because of inadequate time for head-space gas equilibrium. This condition can be avoided by running several standard gas samples at various pressures around the calculated pressure, and then selecting the highest pressure that does not produce a double injection. All samples and standards must be pressurized for 60 seconds using the vial prepressurizer. The vial is then placed into the 90 °C conditioning bath and tested for leakage by placing a drop of water on the septum at the needle hole. A clean, burr-free needle is mandatory.
11.2.3. Burner Air Supply. Set regulator on cylinder to read 50 psig. Set regulator on chromatograph to supply air to burner at a rate between 250 and 300 cc/min. Check with bubble flowmeter.
11.2.4. Hydrogen Supply. Set regulator on cylinder to read 30 psig. Set regulator on chromatograph to supply approximately 35 ±5 cc/min. Optimize hydrogen flow to yield the most sensitive detector response without extinguishing the flame. Check flow with bubble meter and record this flow.
11.3 Temperature Adjustments. Set temperatures as follows:
11.3.1. Oven (chromatograph column), 140 °C (280 °F).
11.3.2. Dosing Line, 150 °C (300 °F).
11.3.3. Injection Block, 170 °C (340 °F).
11.3.4. Sample Chamber, Water Temperature, 90 °C ±1.0 °C (194 °F ±1.8 °F).
11.4 Ignition of Flame Ionization Detector. Ignite the detector according to the manufacturer's instructions.
11.5 Amplifier Balance. Balance the amplifier according to the manufacturer's instructions.
11.6 Programming the Chromatograph. Program the chromatograph as follows:
11.6.1. I—Dosing or Injection Time. The normal setting is 2 seconds.
11.6.2. A—Analysis Time. The normal setting is approximately 70 percent of the VCM retention time. When this timer terminates, the programmer initiates backflushing of the first column.
11.6.3. B—Backflushing Time. The normal setting is double the analysis time.
11.6.4. W—Stabilization Time. The normal setting is 0.5 min to 1.0 min.
11.6.5. X—Number of Analyses Per Sample. The normal setting is one.
11.7. Sample Treatment. All samples must be recovered and analyzed within 24 hours after collection.
11.7.1 Resin Samples. The weight of the resin used must be between 0.1 and 4.5 grams. An exact weight must be obtained (within ±1 percent) for each sample. In the case of suspension resins, a volumetric cup can be prepared for holding the required amount of sample. When the cup is used, open the sample bottle, and add the cup volume of resin to the tared sample vial (tared, including septum and aluminum cap). Obtain the exact sample weight, add 100 ml or about two equal drops of water, and immediately seal the vial. Report this value on the data sheet; it is required for calculation of RVCM. In the case of dispersion resins, the cup cannot be used. Weigh the sample in an aluminum dish, transfer the sample to the tared vial, and accurately weigh it in the vial. After prepressurization of the samples, condition them for a minimum of 1 hour in the 90 °C (190 °F) bath. Do not exceed 5 hours. Prepressurization is not required if the sample weight, as analyzed, does not exceed 0.2 gram. It is also not required if solution of the prepressurization equation yields an absolute prepressurization value that is within 30 percent of the atmospheric pressure.

# Note:
Some aluminum vial caps have a center section that must be removed prior to placing into sample tray. If the cap is not removed, the injection needle will be damaged.
11.7.2 Suspension Resin Slurry and Wet Cake Samples. Decant the water from a wet cake sample, and turn the sample bottle upside down onto a paper towel. Wait for the water to drain, place approximately 0.2 to 4.0 grams of the wet cake sample in a tared vial (tared, including septum and aluminum cap) and seal immediately. Then determine the sample weight (1 percent). All samples weighing over 0.2 gram, must be prepressurized prior to conditioning for 1 hour at 90 °C (190 °F), except as noted in Section 11.7.1. A sample of wet cake is used to determine total solids (TS). This is required for calculating the RVCM.
11.7.3 Dispersion Resin Slurry and Latex Samples.The materials should not be filtered. Sample must be thoroughly mixed. Using a tared vial (tared, including septum and aluminum cap) add approximately eight drops (0.25 to 0.35 g) of slurry or latex using a medicine dropper. This should be done immediately after mixing. Seal the vial as soon as possible. Determine sample weight (1 percent). Condition the vial for 1 hour at 90 °C (190 °F) in the analyzer bath. Determine the TS on the slurry sample (Section 11.10).
11.7.4 In-process Wastewater Samples. Using a tared vial (tared, including septum
and aluminum cap) quickly add approximately 1 cc of water using a medicine dropper. Seal the vial as soon as possible. Determine sample weight (1 percent). Condition the vial for 1 hour at 90 °C (190 °F) in the analyzer bath.
11.8 Preparation of Sample Turntable.
11.8.1 Before placing any sample into turntable, be certain that the center section of the aluminum cap has been removed. The numbered sample vials should be placed in the corresponding numbered positions in the turntable. Insert samples in the following order:
11.8.1.1 Positions 1 and 2. Old 2000-ppm standards for conditioning. These are necessary only after the analyzer has not been used for 24 hours or longer.
11.8.1.2 Position 3. 50-ppm standard, freshly prepared.
11.8.1.3 Position 4. 500-ppm standard, freshly prepared.
11.8.1.4 Position 5. 2000-ppm standard, freshly prepared.
11.8.1.5 Position 6. 4000-ppm standard, freshly prepared.
11.8.1.6 Position 7. Sample No. 7 (This is the first sample of the day, but is given as 7 to be consistent with the turntable and the integrator printout.)
11.8.2 After all samples have been positioned, insert the second set of 50-, 500-, 2000-, and 4000-ppm standards. Samples, including standards, must be conditioned in the bath of 90 °C (190 °F) for a minimum of one hour and a maximum of five hours.
11.9 Start Chromatograph Program. When all samples, including standards, have been conditioned at 90 °C (190 °F) for at least one hour, start the analysis program according to the manufacturer's instructions. These instructions must be carefully followed when starting and stopping a program to prevent damage to the dosing assembly.
11.10 Determination of Total Solids. For wet cake, slurry, resin solution, and PVC latex samples, determine TS for each sample by accurately weighing approximately 3 to 4 grams of sample in an aluminum pan before and after placing in a draft oven (105 to 110 °C (221 to 230 °F)). Samples must be dried to constant weight. After first weighing, return the pan to the oven for a short period of time, and then reweigh to verify complete dryness. The TS are then calculated as the final sample weight divided by initial sample weight.

# 13.0 Method Performance
13.1 Range and Sensitivity. The lower limit of detection of vinyl chloride will vary according to the sampling and chromatographic system. The system should be capable of producing a measurement for a 50-ppm vinyl chloride standard that is at least 10 times the standard deviation of the system background noise level.
13.2 An interlaboratory comparison between seven laboratories of three resin samples, each split into three parts, yielded a standard deviation of 2.63 percent for a sample with a mean of 2.09 ppm, 4.16 percent for a sample with a mean of 1.66 ppm, and 5.29 percent for a sample with a mean of 62.66 ppm.
