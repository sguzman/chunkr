To cite the regulations in this volume use title, part and section number. Thus,
5 CFR 1200.1
refers to title 5, part 1200, section 1.

# Explanation
The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.
Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:
Title 1 through Title 16
as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27
as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41
as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50
as of October 1
The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.

# LEGAL STATUS
The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

# HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS
The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, January 1, 2025), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

# EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES
Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.

# OMB CONTROL NUMBERS
The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request.
Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.

# PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE
Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.

# “[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY
The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not dropped in error.

# INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE
What is incorporation by reference?
Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.
What is a proper incorporation by reference?
The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:
(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.
(b) The matter incorporated is adequately summarized in the preamble of the final rule and is available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.
(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?
If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or email fr.inspection@nara.gov.

# CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES
A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR
Index and Finding Aids.
This volume contains the Parallel Table of Authorities and Rules. A list of CFR titles, chapters, subchapters, and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in this volume.
An index to the text of “Title 3—The President” is carried within that volume.
The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. This index is based on a consolidation of the “Contents” entries in the daily Federal Register.
A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

# REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL
There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing in the Code of Federal Regulations.

§ 1200.1
Statement of purpose.
The Merit Systems Protection Board (the Board) is an independent Government agency that operates like a court. The Board was created to ensure that all Federal government agencies follow Federal merit systems practices. The Board does this by adjudicating Federal employee appeals of agency personnel actions, and by conducting special reviews and studies of Federal merit systems.
[56 FR 41747, Aug. 23, 1991, as amended at 59 FR 65233, Dec. 19, 1994]
§ 1200.2
Board members and duties.
(a) The Board has three members whom the President appoints and the Senate confirms. Members of the Board serve seven-year terms.
(b) The President appoints, with the Senate's consent, one member of the Board to serve as Chairman and chief executive officer of the Board. The President also appoints one member of the Board to serve as Vice Chairman. If the office of the Chairman is vacant or the Chairman cannot perform his or her duties, then the Vice Chairman performs the Chairman's duties. If both the Chairman and the Vice Chairman cannot perform their duties, then the remaining Board Member performs the Chairman's duties.
[56 FR 41747, Aug. 23, 1991, as amended at 59 FR 65233, Dec. 19, 1994]
§ 1200.3
How the Board members make decisions.
(a) The three Board members make decisions in all cases by majority vote except in circumstances described in paragraph (b) of this section or as otherwise provided by law.
(b) When there are at least two Board members and, due to a vacancy, recusal or other reasons, the Board members are unable to decide any case by majority vote, the decision, recommendation, or other order under review may be deemed the final decision or order of the Board. The Chairman of the Board may direct the issuance of an order consistent with this paragraph (b).
(c) When due to vacancies, recusals, or other reasons, only one Board member is able to act, the Board member may direct the following types of matters to an administrative judge or other official:
(1) A party's request to withdraw his/her appeal or petition for review for final disposition;
(2) A newly raised claim that was not previously adjudicated in the appeal currently under review for docketing and adjudication;
(3) A settlement for possible final disposition, including a determination of whether the parties actually reached a settlement, understood its terms, and agreed whether it is to be enforceable by the Board; or
(4) A matter for further development of the record.
(d) When due to vacancies, recusals, or other reasons no Board member is able to act, the Clerk of the Board may direct the following types of matters to an administrative judge or other official:
(1) A party's request to withdraw his/her appeal or petition for review for final disposition;
(2) A newly raised claim that was not previously adjudicated in the appeal currently under review for docketing and adjudication;
(3) A settlement for possible final disposition, including a determination of whether the parties actually reached a settlement, understood its terms, and agreed whether it is to be enforceable by the Board; or
(4) A matter for further development of the record.
(e) Decisions and orders issued pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section shall not be precedential.
[89 FR 72960, Sept. 9, 2024]
§ 1200.4
Petition for rulemaking.
(a) Any interested person may petition the MSPB for the issuance, amendment, or repeal of a rule. For purposes of this regulation, a “rule” means a regulation contained in 5 CFR parts 1200 through 1216. Each petition shall:
(1) Be submitted to the Clerk of the Board, 1615 M Street NW., Washington, DC 20419;
(2) Set forth the text or substance of the rule or amendment proposed or specify the rule sought to be repealed;
(3) Explain the petitioner's interest in the action sought; and
(4) Set forth all data and arguments available to the petitioner in support of the action sought.
(b) No public procedures will be held on the petition before its disposition. If the MSPB finds that the petition contains adequate justification, a rulemaking proceeding will be initiated or a final rule will be issued as appropriate under the Administrative Procedure Act. If the Board finds that the petition does not contain adequate justification, the petition will be denied by letter or other notice, with a brief statement of the ground for denial. The Board may consider new evidence at any time; however, repetitious petitions for rulemaking will not be considered.
[77 FR 62363, Oct. 12, 2012]
1200.5
Conduct policy.
The Board may issue a policy governing the conduct of the parties for all appeals before the Board and of parties and any other individuals in communications with the Board. Such policy may include rules regarding prohibited conduct and vexatious filing by a party, witness, representative, or other individual, as well as potential sanctions or other consequences for violations of the policy. Any policy established pursuant to this regulation will be made publicly available via the Board's website (
www.mspb.gov
).

# Subpart A—Jurisdiction and Definitions
§ 1201.1
General.
The Board has two types of jurisdiction, original and appellate.
§ 1201.2
Original jurisdiction.
The Board's original jurisdiction includes the following cases:
(a) Actions brought by the Special Counsel under 5 U.S.C. 1214, 1215, and 1216;
(b) Requests, by persons removed from the Senior Executive Service for performance deficiencies, for informal hearings; and
(c) Actions taken against administrative law judges under 5 U.S.C. 7521.
[54 FR 53504, Dec. 29, 1989, as amended at 62 FR 66814, Dec. 22, 1997]
§ 1201.3
Appellate jurisdiction.
(a)
Generally.
The Board's appellate jurisdiction is limited to those matters over which it has been given jurisdiction by law, rule, or regulation. The Board's jurisdiction does not depend solely on the label or nature of the action or decision taken or made but may also depend on the type of Federal appointment the individual received, e.g.,
competitive or excepted service, whether an individual is preference eligible, and other factors. Accordingly, the laws and regulations cited below, which are the source of the Board's jurisdiction, should be consulted to determine not only the nature of the actions or decisions that are appealable, but also the limitations as to the types of employees, former employees, or applicants for employment who may assert them. Instances in which a law or regulation authorizes the Board to hear an appeal or claim include the following:
(1)
Adverse actions.
Removals (terminations of employment after completion of probationary or other initial service period), reductions in grade or pay, suspension for more than 14 days, or furloughs for 30 days or less for cause that will promote the efficiency of the service; an involuntary resignation or retirement is considered to be a removal (5 U.S.C. 7511-7514; 5 CFR part 752, subparts C and D);
(2)
Retirement appeals.
Determinations affecting the rights or interests of an individual under the Federal retirement laws (5 U.S.C. 8347(d)(1)-(2) and 8461(e)(1); and 5 U.S.C. 8331 note; 5 CFR parts 831, 839, 842, 844, and 846);
(3)
Termination of probationary employment.
Appealable issues are limited to a determination that the termination was motivated by partisan political reasons or marital status, and/or if the termination was based on a pre-appointment reason, whether the agency failed to take required procedures. These appeals are not generally available to employees in the excepted service. (38 U.S.C. 2014(b)(1)(D); 5 CFR 315.806
315.908(b));
(4)
Restoration to employment following recovery from a work-related injury.
Failure to restore, improper restoration of, or failure to return following a leave of absence following recovery from a compensable injury. (5 CFR 353.304);
(5)
Performance-based actions under chapter 43.
Reduction in grade or removal for unacceptable performance (5 U.S.C. 4303(e); 5 CFR part 432);
(6)
Reduction in force.
Separation, demotion, or furlough for more than 30 days, when the action was effected because of a reduction in force (5 CFR 351.901); Reduction-in-force action affecting a career or career candidate appointee in the Foreign Service (22 U.S.C. 4011);
(7)
Employment practices appeal.
Employment practices administered by the Office of Personnel Management to examine and evaluate the qualifications of applicants for appointment in the competitive service (5 CFR 300.104);
(8)
Denial of within-grade pay increase.
Reconsideration decision sustaining a negative determination of competence for a general schedule employee (5 U.S.C. 5335(c); 5 CFR 531.410);
(9)
Suitability action.
Action based on suitability determinations, which relate to an individual's character or conduct that may have an impact on the integrity or efficiency of the service. Suitability actions include the cancellation of eligibility, removal, cancellation of reinstatement eligibility, and debarment. A non-selection or cancellation of eligibility for a specific position based on an objection to an eligible or a pass over of a preference eligible under 5 CFR 332.406 is not a suitability action. (5 CFR 731.501, 731.203, 731.101(a));
(10)
Various actions involving the Senior Executive Service.
Removal or suspension for more than 14 days (5 U.S.C. 7543(d) and 5 CFR 752.605); Reduction-in-force action affecting a career appointee (5 U.S.C. 3595); Furlough of a career appointee (5 CFR 359.805); Removal or transfer of a Senior Executive Service employee of the Department of Veterans Affairs (38 U.S.C. 713 and 5 CFR part 1210); and
(11)
Miscellaneous restoration and reemployment matters.
(i) Failure to afford reemployment priority rights pursuant to a Reemployment Priority List following separation by reduction in force (5 CFR 330.214);
(ii) Full recovery from a compensable injury after more than 1 year, because of the employment of another person (5 CFR 302.501);
(iii) Failure to reinstate a former employee after service under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (5 CFR 352.508);
(iv) Failure to re-employ a former employee after movement between executive agencies during an emergency (5 CFR 352.209);
(v) Failure to re-employ a former employee after detail or transfer to an international organization (5 CFR 352.313);
(vi) Failure to re-employ a former employee after service under the Indian Self-Determination Act (5 CFR 352.707); or
(vii) Failure to re-employ a former employee after service under the Taiwan Relations Act (5 CFR 352.807).
(12)
Actions Related to Placement or Movement into an Excepted Service Position Without Civil Service Protections.
(i) An agency assertion that an involuntary (including a facially voluntary, but alleged to be involuntary) movement or placement of a competitive service employee into the excepted service, will eliminate competitive status or any other procedural and appeal rights that the employee had previously accrued. (5 CFR 302.603(b); 5 CFR 302.603(d));
(ii) An agency assertion that an involuntary (including a facially voluntary, but alleged to be involuntary) movement or placement of an excepted service employee into a different schedule of the excepted service, will eliminate competitive status or any other procedural and appeal rights that the employee had previously accrued. (5 CFR 302.603(b); 5 CFR 302.603(d));
(iii) An agency's failure to provide the required notice, under 5 CFR 302.602(c)(1), of the effect of the above-described movements or placements on the employee's status or procedural and appeal rights. (5 CFR 302.603(c)).
(b)(1)
Appeals under the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act and the Veterans Employment Opportunities Act.
Appeals filed under the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (Public Law 103-353), as amended, and the Veterans Employment Opportunities Act (Public Law 105-339) are governed by part 1208 of this title. The provisions of subparts A, B, C, and F of part 1201 apply to appeals governed by part 1208 unless other specific provisions are made in that part. The provisions of subpart H of this part regarding awards of attorney fees apply to appeals governed by part 1208 of this title.
(2)
Appeals involving an allegation that the action was based on appellant's whistleblowing or other protected activity.
Appeals of actions appealable to the Board under any law, rule, or regulation, in which the appellant alleges that the action was taken because of the appellant's whistleblowing or other protected activity, are governed by part 1209 of this title. The provisions of subparts B, C, E, F, and G of part 1201 apply to appeals and stay requests governed by part 1209 unless other specific provisions are made in that part. The provisions of subpart H of this part regarding awards of attorney fees, compensatory damages, and consequential damages under 5 U.S.C. 1221(g) apply to appeals governed by part 1209 of this chapter.
(c)
Limitations on appellate jurisdiction, collective bargaining agreements, and election of procedures:
(1) For an employee covered by a collective bargaining agreement under 5 U.S.C. 7121, the negotiated grievance procedures contained in the agreement are the exclusive procedures for resolving any action that could otherwise be appealed to the Board, with the following exceptions:
(i) An appealable action involving discrimination under 5 U.S.C. 2302(b)(1), reduction in grade or removal under 5 U.S.C. 4303, or adverse action under 5 U.S.C. 7512, may be raised under the Board's appellate procedures, or under the negotiated grievance procedures, but not under both;
(ii) An appealable action involving a prohibited personnel practice other than discrimination under 5 U.S.C. 2302(b)(1) may be raised under not more than one of the following procedures:
(A) The Board's appellate procedures;
(B) The negotiated grievance procedures; or
(C) The procedures for seeking corrective action from the Special Counsel under subchapters II and III of chapter 12 of title 5 of the United States Code.
(iii) Except for actions involving discrimination under 5 U.S.C. 2302(b)(1) or any other prohibited personnel practice, any appealable action that is excluded from the application of the negotiated grievance procedures may be raised only under the Board's appellate procedures.
(2)
Choice of procedure.
When an employee has an option of pursuing an action under the Board's appeal procedures or under negotiated grievance procedures, the Board considers the choice between those procedures to have been made when the employee timely files an appeal with the Board or timely files a written grievance, whichever event occurs first. When an employee has the choice of pursuing an appealable action involving a prohibited personnel practice other than discrimination under 5 U.S.C. 2302(b)(1) in accordance with paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, the Board considers the choice among those procedures to have been made when the employee timely files an appeal with the Board, timely files a written grievance under the negotiated grievance procedure, or seeks corrective action from the Special Counsel by making an allegation under 5 U.S.C. 1214(a)(1), whichever event occurs first.
(3)
Review of discrimination grievances.
If an employee chooses the negotiated grievance procedure under paragraph (c)(2) of this section and alleges discrimination as described at 5 U.S.C. 2302(b)(1), then the employee, after having obtained a final decision under the negotiated grievance procedure, may ask the Board to review that final decision. The request must be filed with the Clerk of the Board in accordance with § 1201.155.

(1) Is more than conclusory;
(2) Is plausible on its face; and
(3) Is material to the legal issues in the appeal.

# Subpart B—Procedures for Appellate Cases

# General
§ 1201.11
Scope and policy.
The regulations in this subpart apply to Board appellate proceedings except as otherwise provided in § 1201.13. The regulations in this subpart apply also to appellate proceedings and stay requests covered by part 1209 unless other specific provisions are made in that part. These regulations also apply to original jurisdiction proceedings of the Board except as otherwise provided in subpart D. It is the Board's policy that these rules will be applied in a manner that expedites the processing of each case. It is the Board's policy that these rules will be applied in a manner that ensures the fair and efficient processing of each case.
[74 FR 9343, Mar. 4, 2009]
§ 1201.12
Revocation, amendment, or waiver of rules.
The Board may revoke, amend, or waive any of these regulations. A judge may, for good cause shown, waive a Board regulation unless a statute requires application of the regulation. The judge must give notice of the waiver to all parties, but is not required to give the parties an opportunity to respond.
§ 1201.13
Appeals by Board employees.
Appeals by Board employees will be filed with the Clerk of the Board and will be assigned to an administrative law judge for adjudication under this subchapter. The Board's policy is to insulate the adjudication of its own employees' appeals from agency involvement as much as possible. Accordingly, the Board will not disturb initial decisions in those cases unless the party shows that there has been harmful procedural irregularity in the proceedings
before the administrative law judge or a clear error of law. In addition, the Board, as a matter of policy, will not rule on any interlocutory appeals or motions to disqualify the administrative law judge assigned to those cases until the initial decision has been issued.
§ 1201.14
Electronic filing procedures.
(a)
General.
This section prescribes the rules and procedures by which parties and representatives to proceedings within the MSPB's appellate and original jurisdiction may file and receive documents electronically.

System for electronic filing.
(1) The MSPB's e-Appeal system is the exclusive system for electronic filing (e-filing) with the MSPB. Except as specifically provided, the MSPB will not accept pleadings filed by email. The link to e-Appeal is available at the MSPB's website (
https://www.mspb.gov
).
(2) e-Appeal is a closed system that collects and maintains records as part of an MSPB system of records and is subject to the provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974. Access to cases in e-Appeal is limited to the parties participating in a Board proceeding who have registered as e-filers with the MSPB, and authorized individuals providing legal support to designated representatives.
(c)
Matters subject to electronic filing.
Subject to the registration requirement of paragraph (e) of this section, parties and representatives may use e-filing to do any of the following:
(1) File any pleading, including a new appeal, in any matter within the MSPB's appellate jurisdiction (§ 1201.3);
(2) File any pleading, including a new complaint, in any matter within the MSPB's original jurisdiction (§ 1201.2);
(3) File a petition for enforcement of a final MSPB decision (§ 1201.182);
(4) File a request for attorney fees (§ 1201.203);
(5) File a request for compensatory, consequential, or liquidated damages (§ 1201.204);
(6) Designate a representative, revoke such a designation, or change such a designation (§ 1201.31);
(7) Notify the MSPB of a change in contact information such as address (geographic or email) or telephone number; or
(8) Receive a requested subpoena from the Board for issuance to a witness (§ 1201.83).
(d)
Matters excluded from e-filing.
E-filing may not be used to:
(1) File a request to hear a case as a class appeal or any opposition thereto (§ 1201.27);
(2) Serve a subpoena on a witness (§ 1201.83);
(3) File a pleading with the Special Panel (§ 1201.137);
(4) File a pleading that contains Sensitive Security Information (SSI) (49 CFR parts 15 and 1520);
(5) File a pleading that contains classified information (32 CFR part 2001); or
(6) File a request to intervene or participate as an
amicus curiae
or file a brief as amicus curiae pursuant to § 1201.34.
(e) Registration as an e-filer.
(1) The exclusive means to register as an e-filer is to follow the instructions at e-Appeal using a unique email address.
(2) Registration as an e-filer constitutes consent to accept electronic service of pleadings filed by other e-filers and documents issued by the MSPB. No one may electronically file a new appeal or a pleading with the MSPB, or view the case record in an assigned appeal, unless registered as an e-filer.
(3) Registration as an e-filer applies to all MSPB proceedings with which the e-filer is associated in their e-Appeal role (appellant, appellant representative, or agency representative). If an individual requires more than one e-Appeal role (
e.g.,
appellant and appellant representative), they must register for each role separately using a different email address.
(4) All notices, orders, decisions, and other documents issued by the MSPB, as well as all pleadings filed by parties, will be made available for viewing and downloading at e-Appeal. Access to documents at e-Appeal is limited to the parties and representatives who are registered e-filers in the appeals in which they were filed.
(5) Agency representatives and appellant attorney representatives must register as e-filers.
(6) Each e-filer must promptly update their e-Appeal profile and notify the MSPB and other participants of any change in their address, telephone number, or email address by filing a pleading in each pending proceeding with which they are associated.
(7) An appellant or an appellant non-attorney representative may withdraw their registration as an e-filer pursuant to requirements set forth in e-Appeal policies posted to the MSPB's website. Such withdrawal means that, effective upon the MSPB's processing of a proper withdrawal, pleadings and MSPB documents will no longer be served on that person electronically and that person will no longer have electronic access to their case records through e-Appeal. A withdrawal of registration as an e-filer may preclude future re-registering as an e-filer.
(f)
Pleadings by e-filers.
Agency representatives and appellant attorney representatives must file all pleadings using e-Appeal, except those pleadings excluded from e-filing by paragraph (d) of this section. A pleading, or any part thereof, filed by non-electronic means,
i.e.,
via postal mail, facsimile, or personal or commercial delivery, may be rejected.
(g)
Agency Initial Contacts.
(1) Agencies are required to designate a specific individual as an initial agency representative to whom the Board will serve a copy of an appeal when it is docketed. Agency initial contacts are responsible for monitoring case activity regularly at e-Appeal.
(2) Agency initial contacts must be designated pursuant to requirements set forth in e-Appeal policies posted to the MSPB's website.
(h)
Form of electronic pleadings
—(1)
Electronic formats allowed.
E-Appeal accepts numerous electronic formats, including word-processing and spreadsheet formats, Portable Document Format (PDF), and image files (files created by scanning). A list of formats allowed is set forth in e-Appeal policies posted to the MSPB's website. Pleadings filed via e-Appeal must be formatted so that they will print on 8
1/2
-inch by 11-inch paper in portrait orientation. Parties are responsible for reviewing all pleadings to confirm legibility and to minimize the inclusion of nonrelevant personally identifiable information.
(2)
Requirements for pleadings with electronic attachments.
An e-filer who uploads supporting documents, in addition to the document that constitutes the primary pleading, must identify each attachment, either by bookmarking the document using e-Appeal, or by uploading the supporting documents in the form of one or more PDF files in which each attachment is bookmarked. Bookmark names must comply with requirements set forth in e-Appeal policies posted to the MSPB's website and include information such as a brief descriptive label with dates (
e.g.,
“Oct. 1, 2021—Decision Notice”).
(3)
Submission of audio and video evidence.
Audio and video evidence must be submitted according to the formatting and submission requirements set forth in e-Appeal policies posted to the MSPB's website.
(i)
Service of electronic pleadings and MSPB documents.
(1) When MSPB documents are issued or when parties e-file any pleadings, e-Appeal will send an email notification to other parties who are e-filers. When using e-Appeal to file a pleading, e-filers will be notified of all documents that must be served by non-electronic means, and they must certify that they will serve all such documents no later than the first business day after the electronic submission.
(2) Delivery of email can encounter failure points. E-filers are responsible for ensuring that email from
mspb.gov
is not blocked by filters.
(3) E-filers are responsible for monitoring case activity regularly at e-Appeal to ensure that they have received all case-related documents.
(j)
Documents requiring a signature.
Electronic documents filed by an e-filer pursuant to this section shall be deemed to be signed by the e-filer for purposes of any regulation in part 1201, 1203, 1208, or 1209 of this chapter that requires a signature.
(k)
Affidavits and declarations made under penalty of perjury.
E-filers may submit electronic pleadings in the form of declarations made under penalty of perjury under 28 U.S.C. 1746, as described in appendix IV to this part. If the declarant is someone other than
the e-filer, a signed affidavit or declaration should be uploaded as an image file or with an acceptable digital signature that complies with requirements set forth in e-Appeal policies posted to the MSPB's website.
(l)
Date electronic documents are filed and served.
(1) As provided in § 1201.4(l) of this part, the date of filing for pleadings filed via e-Appeal is the date of electronic submission. All pleadings filed via e-Appeal are time stamped with Eastern Time, but the timeliness of a pleading will be determined based on the time zone from which the pleading was submitted. For example, a pleading filed at 11 p.m. Pacific Time on August 20 will be stamped by e-Appeal as being filed at 2 a.m. Eastern Time on August 21. However, if the pleading was required to be filed with the Washington Regional Office (in the Eastern Time Zone) on August 20, it would be considered timely, as it was submitted prior to midnight Pacific Time on August 20.
(2) MSPB documents served electronically on e-filers are deemed received on the date of electronic transmission.
(m)
Authority of MSPB to regulate e-filing.
(1) A judge or the Clerk of the Board may issue orders regulating the method of submissions for a particular period or particular submissions.
(2) A judge or the Clerk of the Board may require that any document filed electronically be submitted in non-electronic form and bear the written signature of the submitter.
(3) The MSPB may order any party or authorized individual to cease participation as an e-filer or access to e-Appeal in circumstances that constitute a misuse of the system or a failure to comply with law, rule, regulation, or policy governing use of a U.S. government information system.
(4) MSPB reserves the right to revert to traditional methods of service. The MSPB may serve documents via traditional means—postal mail, facsimile, commercial or personal delivery—at its discretion. Parties and their representatives are responsible for ensuring that the MSPB always has their current postal mailing addresses, even when they are e-filers.

# Appeal of Agency Action; Pleadings
§ 1201.21
Notice of appeal rights.
When an agency issues a decision notice to an employee on a matter that is appealable to the Board, the agency must provide the employee with the following:
(a) Notice of the time limits for appealing to the Board, the requirements of § 1201.22(c), and the address of the appropriate Board office for filing the appeal;
(b) A copy, or access to a copy, of the Board's regulations;
(c) A copy, or access to a copy, of the MSPB appeal form available at the Board's Web site (
http://www.mspb.gov
), and
(d) Notice of any right the employee has to file a grievance or seek corrective action under subchapters II and III of 5 U.S.C. chapter 12, including:
(1) Whether the election of any applicable grievance procedure will result in waiver of the employee's right to file an appeal with the Board;
(2) Whether both an appeal to the Board and a grievance may be filed on the same matter and, if so, the circumstances under which proceeding with one will preclude proceeding with the other, and specific notice that filing a grievance will not extend the time limit for filing an appeal with the Board;
(3) Whether there is any right to request Board review of a final decision on a grievance in accordance with § 1201.155 of this part; and
(4) The effect of any election under 5 U.S.C. 7121(g), including the effect that seeking corrective action under subchapters II and III of 5 U.S.C. chapter 12 will have on the employee's appeal rights before the Board.
(e) Notice of any right the employee has to file a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission or to grieve allegations of unlawful discrimination, consistent with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 7121(d) and 29 CFR 1614.301 and 1614.302.
(f) The name or title and contact information for the agency official to whom the Board should send the Acknowledgment Order and copy of the appeal in the event the employee files
an appeal with the Board. Contact information should include the official's mailing address, email address, telephone and fax numbers.
[74 FR 9343, Mar. 4, 2009, as amended at 77 FR 62364, Oct. 12, 2012; 78 FR 21518, Apr. 11, 2013]
§ 1201.22
Filing an appeal and responses to appeals.
(a)
Place of filing.
Appeals, and responses to those appeals, must be filed with the appropriate Board regional or field office. See § 1201.4(d) of this part.
(b)
Time of filing.
(1) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, an appeal must be filed no later than 30 days after the effective date, if any, of the action being appealed, or 30 days after the date of the appellant's receipt of the agency's decision, whichever is later. Where an appellant and an agency mutually agree in writing to attempt to resolve their dispute through an alternative dispute resolution process prior to the timely filing of an appeal, however, the time limit for filing the appeal is extended by an additional 30 days—for a total of 60 days. A response to an appeal must be filed within 20 days of the date of the Board's acknowledgment order. The time for filing a submission under this section is computed in accordance with § 1201.23 of this part.
(2) The time limit prescribed by paragraph (b)(1) of this section for filing an appeal does not apply where a law or regulation establishes a different time limit or where there is no applicable time limit. No time limit applies to appeals under the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (Pub. L. 103-353), as amended; see part 1208 of this title. See part 1208 of this title for the statutory filing time limits applicable to appeals under the Veterans Employment Opportunities Act (Pub. L. 105-339). See part 1209 of this title for the statutory filing time limits applicable to whistleblower appeals and stay requests.
(3) An appellant is responsible for keeping the agency informed of his or her current home address for purposes of receiving the agency's decision, and correspondence which is properly addressed and sent to the appellant's address via postal or commercial delivery is presumed to have been duly delivered to the addressee. While such a presumption may be overcome under the circumstances of a particular case, an appellant may not avoid service of a properly addressed and mailed decision by intentional or negligent conduct which frustrates actual service. The appellant may also be deemed to have received the agency's decision if it was received by a designated representative or a person of suitable age and discretion residing with the appellant. The following examples, while not controlling, illustrate potential application of this rule:

# Example A:
An appellant who fails to pick up mail delivered to his or her post office box may be deemed to have received the agency decision.

# Example B:
An appellant who did not receive his or her mail while in the hospital may overcome the presumption of actual receipt.

# Example C:
An appellant may be deemed to have received an agency decision received by his or her roommate.
(c)
Timeliness of appeals.
If a party does not submit an appeal within the time set by statute, regulation, or order of a judge, it will be dismissed as untimely filed unless a good reason for the delay is shown. The judge will provide the party an opportunity to show why the appeal should not be dismissed as untimely.
(d)
Method of filing an appeal.
Filing of an appeal must be made with the appropriate Board office by commercial or personal delivery, by facsimile, by mail, or by electronic filing under § 1201.14.
(e)
Filing a response.
Filing of a response must be made with the appropriate Board office by commercial or personal delivery, by facsimile, by mail, or by electronic filing under § 1201.14.

citations affecting § 1201.22, see the List of CFR Sections Affected, which appears in the Finding Aids section of the printed volume and at
www.govinfo.gov.
§ 1201.23
Computation of time.
(a)
Computation of deadlines.
In computing the number of days allowed for complying with any deadline, the first day counted is the day after the event
from which the time period begins to run. If the date that ordinarily would be the last day for filing falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal holiday, the filing period will include the first workday after that date. Unless a different deadline is specified by the Board or its designee, 5 days are added to a party's deadline for responding to a document served on the party by mail.
(1)

# Example 1:
If an employee receives a decision notice that is effective on July 1, the 30-day period for filing an appeal starts to run on July 2. The filing ordinarily would be timely only if it is made by July 31. If July 31 is a Saturday, however, the last day for filing would be Monday, August 2.
(2)

# Example 2:
The judge orders the appellant to file a response to a jurisdictional order no later than October 15, 2012, and that the agency's response is due 10 days after the filing of the appellant's pleading. If the appellant serves the agency with a pleading via regular mail on October 15, the agency's deadline for filing a response will be October 30, not October 25.
(b)
Changes to the computation of deadlines.
At MSPB's discretion, the computation of deadlines may be changed due to events that broadly affect the ability of parties with appeals before MSPB to file pleadings and/or MSPB's ability to serve issuances, such as MSPB system outages or government shutdowns. In these circumstances, any information concerning changes to the computation of deadlines will be addressed by MSPB through a press release posted to MSPB's website.
[77 FR 62364, Oct. 12, 2012, as amended at 89 FR 72961, Sept. 9, 2024]
§ 1201.24
Content of an appeal; right to hearing.
(a)
Content.
Only an appellant, his or her designated representative, or a party properly substituted under § 1201.35 may file an appeal. Appeals may be in any format, including letter form. An appeal may be filed electronically provided that the requirements of § 1201.14 have been satisfied. All appeals must contain the following:
(1) The name, address, telephone number, and email address of the appellant, and the name and address of the agency that took the action;
(2) A description of the action the agency took and its effective date;
(3) A request for hearing if the appellant wants one;
(4) A statement of the reasons why the appellant believes the agency action is wrong;
(5) A statement of the action the appellant would like the judge to order;
(6) The name, address, telephone number, and email address of the appellant's representative, if the appellant has a representative;
(7) Where applicable, a copy of the notice of proposed action, the agency decision being appealed and, if available, the SF-50 or similar notice of personnel action. No other attachments should be included with the appeal, as the agency will be submitting the documents required by 1201.25 of this part, and there will be several opportunities to submit evidence and argument after the appeal is filed. An appellant should not miss the deadline for filing merely because he or she does not currently have all of the documents specified in this section.
(8) A statement telling whether the appellant or anyone acting on his or her behalf has filed a grievance or a formal discrimination complaint with any agency regarding this matter; and
(9) The signature of the appellant or, if the appellant has a representative, of the representative. If the appeal is electronically filed, compliance with § 1201.14 and the directions at e-Appeal satisfy the signature requirement.
(b) An appellant may raise a claim or defense not included in the appeal at any time before the end of the conference(s) held to define the issues in the case. An appellant may not raise a new claim or defense after that time, except for good cause shown. However, a claim or defense not included in the appeal may be excluded if a party shows that including it would result in undue prejudice.
(c)
Use of Board form or electronic filing.
An appellant may comply with paragraph (a) of this section, and with § 1201.31, by completing MSPB Form 185, or by completing all requests for information marked as required at e-Appeal. MSPB Form 185 can be accessed at the MSPB's website (
http://www.mspb.gov
).
(d)
Right to hearing.
An appellant generally has a right to a hearing on the merits if the appeal has been timely filed and the Board has jurisdiction over the appeal.
(e)
Timely request.
The appellant must submit any request for a hearing with the appeal, or within any other time period the judge sets for that purpose. If the appellant does not make a timely request for a hearing, the right to a hearing is waived.
[54 FR 53504, Dec. 29, 1989, as amended at 68 FR 59862, Oct. 20, 2003; 69 FR 57629, Sept. 27, 2004; 77 FR 62364, Oct. 12, 2012; 88 FR 67058, Sept. 29, 2023]
§ 1201.25
Content of agency response.
The agency response to an appeal must contain the following:
(a) The name of the appellant and of the agency whose action the appellant is appealing;
(b) A statement identifying the agency action taken against the appellant and stating the reasons for taking the action;
(c) All documents contained in the agency record of the action;
(d) Designation of and signature by the authorized agency representative; and
(e) Any other documents or responses requested by the Board.
§ 1201.26
Service of pleadings and response.
(a)
Service
—(1)
Service by the Board.
The appropriate office of the Board will notify each party to the proceeding that a new appeal has been docketed and will attach to the initial order in the proceeding a certificate of service, consisting of a list of the parties to the proceeding or their designated representatives.
(2)
Service by the parties.
The parties must serve on each other one copy of each pleading, as defined by § 1201.4(b), and all documents submitted with it, except for the appeal. They may do so by electronic filing in accordance with § 1201.14, postal mail, facsimile, or commercial or personal delivery. Documents and pleadings must be served on each party and each representative. A certificate of service stating how and when service was made must accompany each pleading. The parties and their representatives must notify the appropriate Board office and one another, in a pleading, of any changes in their address, telephone number, or email address.
(b)
Submission of documents.
Pleadings and attachments filed via postal mail, facsimile, or commercial or personal delivery must be filed on 8
1/2
-inch by 11-inch paper. This requirement enables the Board to comply with standards established for U.S. courts. Paper pleadings and attachments may not contain binders, folders, staples, paper clips, or notes adhered to pages. Such items will be removed and not included in the record, or the filing may be rejected. Documents may not be submitted on an electronic media storage device such as a Compact Disc (CD), Digital Video Disc (DVD), or flash drive. Parties are responsible for reviewing all pleadings to confirm legibility and to minimize the inclusion of nonrelevant personally identifiable information. Pleadings filed via e-Appeal must adhere to the formatting and filing requirements set forth in § 1201.14(h).
(c)
Submission of audio and video evidence.
Audio and video evidence must be submitted according to the formatting and submission requirements set forth in policies posted to the MSPB's website.
[88 FR 67058, Sept. 29, 2023]
§ 1201.27
Class appeals.
(a)
Appeal.
One or more employees may file an appeal as representatives of a class of employees. The judge will hear the case as a class appeal if he or she finds that a class appeal is the fairest and most efficient way to adjudicate the appeal and that the representative of the parties will adequately protect the interests of all parties. When a class appeal is filed, the time from the filing date until the judge issues his or her decision under paragraph (b) of this section is not counted in computing the time limit for individual members of the potential class to file individual appeals.
(b)
Procedure.
The judge will consider the appellant's request and any opposition to that request, and will issue an order within 30 days after the appeal is filed stating whether the appeal is to be heard as a class appeal. If the judge
denies the request, the appellants affected by the decision may file individual appeals within 30 days after the date of receipt of the decision denying the request to be heard as a class appeal. Each individual appellant is responsible for either filing an individual appeal within the original time limit, or keeping informed of the status of a class appeal and, if the class appeal is denied, filing an individual appeal within the additional 35-day period.
(c)
Standards.
In determining whether it is appropriate to treat an appeal as a class action, the judge will be guided but not controlled by the applicable provisions of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.
(d)
Electronic filing.
A request to hear a case as a class appeal and any opposition thereto may not be filed in electronic form. Subsequent pleadings may be filed and served in electronic form, provided that the requirements of § 1201.14 are satisfied.
[54 FR 53504, Dec. 29, 1989, as amended at 59 FR 31109, June 17, 1994; 62 FR 59992, Nov. 6, 1997; 68 FR 59862, Oct. 20, 2003; 69 FR 57630, Sept. 27, 2004]
§ 1201.28
Case suspension procedures.
(a)
Suspension period.
The judge may issue an order suspending the processing of an appeal for up to 30 days. The judge may grant a second order suspending the processing of an appeal for up to an additional 30 days.
(b)
Early termination of suspension period.
The administrative judge may terminate the suspension period upon joint request of the parties or where the parties request the judge's assistance and the judge's involvement is likely to be extensive.
(c)
Termination of suspension period.
If the final day of any suspension period falls on a day on which the Board is closed for business, adjudication shall resume as of the first business day following the expiration of the period.
(d)
Mediation.
Whenever an appeal is accepted into the Board's Mediation Appeals Program (MAP), the processing of the appeal and all deadlines are suspended until the mediator returns the case to the judge. This provision does not apply where the parties enter into other forms of alternative dispute resolution.
[77 FR 62365, Oct. 12, 2012]
§ 1201.29
Dismissal without prejudice.
(a)
In general.
Dismissal without prejudice is a procedural option that allows for the dismissal and subsequent refiling of an appeal.
(b)
Procedure.
Dismissal without prejudice may be granted on the judge's own motion or upon request by either party. The decision whether to dismiss an appeal without prejudice is committed to the sound discretion of the judge, and may be granted when the interests of fairness, due process, and administrative efficiency outweigh any prejudice to either party.
(c)
Refiling.
Except in certain USERRA appeals under Part 1208 involving the use of military leave, a decision dismissing an appeal without prejudice will include a date certain by which the appeal must be refiled. The judge will determine whether the appeal must be refiled by the appellant or whether it will be automatically refiled by the judge as of a date certain. When a dismissal without prejudice is issued over the objection of the appellant, the appeal will be automatically refiled as of a date certain.
(d)
Waiver.
When a dismissed appeal must be refiled by the appellant, requests for waiver of a late filing based upon good cause will be liberally construed.
[77 FR 62365, Oct. 12, 2012]

# Parties, Representatives, and Witnesses
§ 1201.31
Representatives.
(a)
Procedure.
A party to an appeal may be represented in any matter related to the appeal. Parties may designate a representative, revoke such a designation, and change such a designation in a signed submission, submitted as a pleading.
(b) A party may choose any representative as long as that person is willing and available to serve. The other party or parties may challenge the designation, however, on the ground that it involves a conflict of interest or a conflict of position. Any
party who challenges the designation must do so by filing a motion with the judge within 15 days after the date of service of the notice of designation or 15 days after a party becomes aware of the conflict. The judge will rule on the motion before considering the merits of the appeal. These procedures apply equally to each designation of representative, regardless of whether the representative was the first one designated by a party or a subsequently designated representative. If a representative is disqualified, the judge will give the party whose representative was disqualified a reasonable time to obtain another one.
(c) The judge, on his or her own motion, may disqualify a party's representative on the grounds described in paragraph (b) of this section.
(d) As set forth in paragraphs (d) and (e) of § 1201.43 of this part, a judge may exclude a representative from all or any portion of the proceeding before him or her for contumacious conduct or conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice.

§ 1201.32
Witnesses; right to representation.
Witnesses have the right to be represented when testifying. The representative of a nonparty witness has no right to examine the witness at the hearing or otherwise participate in the development of testimony.
§ 1201.33
Federal witnesses.
(a) Every Federal agency or corporation, including nonparties, must make its employees or personnel available to furnish sworn statements or to appear at a deposition or hearing when ordered by the judge to do so. When providing those statements or appearing at a deposition or at the hearing, Federal employee witnesses will be in official duty status (
i.e.
, entitled to pay and benefits including travel and per diem, where appropriate). When a desired witness is employed by an agency that is not a party to the Board proceeding, the requesting party may avail itself of the provisions of §§ 1201.81 through 1201.85 regarding subpoenas to ensure the attendance of the witness. In addition, the Board and the parties will implement this provision, to the maximum extent possible, to avoid conflict with other regulations governing the production of Federal employees in matters in litigation.
(b) A Federal employee who is denied the official time required by paragraph (a) of this section may file a written request that the judge order the employing agency to provide such official time. The judge will act on such a request promptly and, where warranted, will order the agency to comply with the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section.
(c) An order obtained under paragraph (b) of this section may be enforced as provided under subpart F of this part.

§ 1201.34
Intervenors and amicus curiae.
(a)
Explanation of Intervention.
Intervenors are organizations or persons who want to participate in a proceeding because they believe the proceeding, or its outcome, may affect their rights or duties. Intervenors as a “matter of right” are those parties who have a statutory right to participate. “Permissive” intervenors are those parties who may be permitted to participate if the proceeding will affect them directly and if intervention is otherwise appropriate under law. A request to intervene may be made by motion filed with the judge.
(b)
Intervenors as a matter of right.
(1) The Director of the Office of Personnel Management may intervene as a matter of right under 5 U.S.C. 7701(d)(1). The motion to intervene must be filed at the earliest practicable time.
(2)(i) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, the Special Counsel may intervene as a matter of right under 5 U.S.C. 1212(c). The motion to intervene must be filed at the earliest practicable time.
(ii) The Special Counsel may not intervene in an action brought by an individual under 5 U.S.C. 1221, or in an
appeal brought by an individual under 5 U.S.C. 7701, without the consent of that individual. The Special Counsel must present evidence that the individual has consented to the intervention at the time the motion to intervene is filed.
(c)
Permissive intervenors.
(1) Any person, organization or agency may, by motion, ask the judge for permission to intervene. The motion must explain the reason why the person, organization or agency should be permitted to intervene.
(2) A motion for permission to intervene will be granted where the requester will be affected directly by the outcome of the proceeding. Any person alleged to have committed a prohibited personnel practice under 5 U.S.C. 2302(b) may request permission to intervene. A judge's denial of a motion for permissive intervention may be appealed to the Board under § 1201.91 of this part.
(d)
Role of intervenors.
Intervenors have the same rights and duties as parties, with the following two exceptions:
(1) Intervenors do not have an independent right to a hearing; and
(2) Permissive intervenors may participate only on the issues affecting them. The judge is responsible for determining the issues on which permissive intervenors may participate.
(e)
Amicus curiae.
(1) An amicus curiae is a person or organization who, although not a party to an appeal, gives advice or suggestions by filing a brief with the judge or the Board regarding an appeal. Any person or organization, including those who do not qualify as intervenors, may request permission to file an amicus brief. The Board may solicit amicus briefs on its own motion.
(2) A request to file an amicus curiae brief must include a statement of the person's or organization's interest in the appeal and how the brief will be relevant to the issues involved.
(3) The request may be granted, in the discretion of the judge or the Board, if the person or organization has a legitimate interest in the proceedings, and such participation will not unduly delay the outcome and may contribute materially to the proper disposition thereof.
(4) The amicus curiae shall submit its brief within the time limits set by the judge or the Board and must comply with any further orders by the judge or the Board.
(5) An amicus curiae is not a party to the proceeding and may not participate in any way in the conduct of the hearing, including the presentation of evidence or the examination of witnesses. The Board, in its discretion, may invite an amicus curiae to participate in oral argument in proceedings in which oral argument is scheduled.

§ 1201.35
Substituting parties.
(a) If an appellant dies or is otherwise unable to pursue the appeal, the processing of the appeal will only be completed upon substitution of a proper party. Substitution will not be permitted where the interests of the appellant have terminated because of the appellant's death or other disability.
(b) The representative or proper party must file a motion for substitution within 90 days after the death or other disabling event, except for good cause shown.
(c) In the absence of a timely substitution of a party, the processing of the appeal may continue if the interests of the proper party will not be prejudiced.
§ 1201.36
Consolidating and joining appeals.
(a)
Explanation.
(1) Consolidation occurs when the appeals of two or more parties are united for consideration because they contain identical or similar issues. For example, individual appeals rising from a single reduction in force might be consolidated.
(2) Joinder occurs when one person has filed two or more appeals and they are united for consideration. For example, a judge might join an appeal challenging a 30-day suspension with a pending appeal challenging a subsequent removal if the same appellant filed both appeals.
(b)
Action by judge.
A judge may consolidate or join cases on his or her own motion or on the motion of a party if doing so would:
(1) Expedite processing of the cases; and
(2) Not adversely affect the interests of the parties.
(c) Any objection to a motion for consolidation or joinder must be filed within 10 days of the date of service of the motion.
[54 FR 53504, Dec. 29, 1989, as amended at 77 FR 62365, Oct. 12, 2012]
§ 1201.37
Witness fees.
(a)
Federal employees.
Employees of a Federal agency or corporation testifying in any Board proceeding or making a statement for the record will be in official duty status and will not receive witness fees.
(b)
Other witnesses.
Other witnesses (whether appearing voluntarily or under subpoena) shall be paid the same fee and mileage allowances which are paid subpoenaed witnesses in the courts of the United States.
(c)
Payment of witness fees and travel costs.
The party requesting the presence of a witness must pay that witness' fees. Those fees must be paid or offered to the witness at the time the subpoena is served, or, if the witness appears voluntarily, at the time of appearance. A Federal agency or corporation is not required to pay or offer witness fees in advance.
(d) A witness who is denied the witness fees and travel costs required by paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section may file a written request that the judge order the party who requested the presence of the witness to provide such fees and travel costs. The judge will act on such a request promptly and, where warranted, will order the party to comply with the requirements of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.
(e) An order obtained under paragraph (d) of this section may be enforced as provided under subpart F of this part.

A judge may cancel a scheduled hearing, or suspend or terminate a hearing in progress, for contumacious conduct or conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice
on the part of the appellant or the appellant's representative. If the judge suspends a hearing, the parties must be given notice as to when the hearing will resume.

§ 1201.52
Public hearings.
(a)
Closing the hearing.
Hearings are generally open to the public; however, the judge may order a hearing or any part of a hearing closed when doing so would be in the best interests of a party, a witness, the public, or any other person affected by the proceeding. Any order closing the hearing will set out the reasons for the judge's decision. Any objections to the order will be made a part of the record.

§ 1201.53
Record of proceedings.
(a)
Recordings.
A recording of the hearing is generally prepared by a court reporter, under the judge's guidance. Such a recording is included with the Board's copy of the appeal file and serves as the official hearing record. Judges may prepare recordings in some hearings, such as those conducted telephonically.
(b)
Transcripts.
A “transcript” refers not only to printed copies of the hearing testimony, but also to electronic versions of such documents. Along with recordings, a transcript prepared by the court reporter is accepted by the Board as the official hearing record. Any party may request that the court reporter prepare a full or partial transcript, at the requesting party's expense. Judges do not prepare transcripts.
(c)
Copies.
Copies of recordings or existing transcripts will be provided upon request to parties free of charge. Such requests should be made in writing to the adjudicating regional or field office, or to the Clerk of the Board, as appropriate. Nonparties may request a copy of a hearing recording or existing transcript under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and Part 1204 of the Board's regulations. A nonparty may request a copy by writing to the appropriate Regional Director, the Chief Administrative Judge of the appropriate MSPB Field Office, or to the Clerk of the Board at MSPB headquarters in Washington, DC, as appropriate. Nonparties may also make FOIA requests online at
https://foia.mspb.gov.
(d)
Corrections to transcript.
Any discrepancy between the transcript and the recording shall be resolved by the judge or the Clerk of the Board, as appropriate. Corrections to the official transcript may be made on motion by a party or on the judge's own motion or by the Clerk of the Board, as appropriate. Motions for corrections must be filed within 10 days after the receipt of a transcript. Corrections of the official transcript will be made only when substantive errors are found by the judge or by the Clerk of the Board, as appropriate.
(e)
Official record.
Hearing exhibits and pleadings that have been accepted into the record, the official hearing record, if a hearing is held, and all orders and decisions of the judge and the Board, make up the official record of the case. Other than the Board's decisions, the official record is not available for public inspection and copying. The official record is, however, subject to requests under both the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) and the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a) pursuant to the procedures contained in 5 CFR parts 1204 and 1205.
[77 FR 62366, Oct. 12, 2012]
§ 1201.55
Motions.
(a)
Form.
All motions, except those made during a prehearing conference or a hearing, must be in writing. All motions must include a statement of the reasons supporting them. Written motions must be filed with the judge or the Board, as appropriate, and must be served upon all other parties in accordance with § 1201.26(b)(2) of this part. A party filing a motion for extension of time, a motion for postponement of a hearing, or any other procedural motion must first contact the other party to determine whether there is any objection to the motion, and must state in the motion whether the other party has an objection.
(b)
Objection.
Unless the judge provides otherwise, any objection to a written motion must be filed within 10 days from the date of service of the motion. Judges, in their discretion, may grant or deny motions for extensions of time to file pleadings without providing any opportunity to respond to the motions.
(c)
Motions for extension of time.
Motions for extension of time will be granted only on a showing of good cause.
(d)
Motions for protective orders.
A motion for an order under 5 U.S.C. 1204(e)(1)(B) to protect a witness or other individual from harassment must be filed as early in the proceeding as practicable. The party seeking a protective order must include a concise statement of reasons justifying the motion, together with any relevant documentary evidence. An agency, other than the Office of Special Counsel, may not request such an order with respect to an investigation by the Special Counsel during the Special Counsel's investigation. An order issued under this paragraph may be enforced in the same manner as provided under subpart F for Board final decisions and orders.

# Evidence
§ 1201.61
Exclusion of evidence and testimony.
Any evidence and testimony that is offered in the hearing and excluded by the judge will be described, and that description will be made a part of the record.
§ 1201.63
Stipulations.
The parties may stipulate to any matter of fact. The stipulation will satisfy a party's burden of proving the fact alleged.
§ 1201.64
Official notice.
Official notice is the Board's or judge's recognition of certain facts without requiring evidence to be introduced establishing those facts. The judge, on his or her own motion or on the motion of a party, may take official notice of matters of common knowledge or matters that can be verified. The parties may be given an opportunity to object to the taking of official notice. The taking of official notice of any fact satisfies a party's burden of proving that fact.

# Discovery
§ 1201.71
Purpose of discovery.
Proceedings before the Board will be conducted as expeditiously as possible with due regard to the rights of the parties. Discovery is designed to enable a party to obtain relevant information needed to prepare the party's case. These regulations are intended to provide a simple method of discovery. They will be interpreted and applied so as to avoid delay and to facilitate adjudication of the case. Parties are expected to start and complete discovery with a minimum of Board intervention.
Discovery requests and responses thereto are not to be filed in the first instance with the Board. They are only filed with the Board in connection with a motion to compel discovery under 1201.73(c) of this part, with a motion to subpoena discovery under 1201.73(d) of this part, or as substantive evidence to be considered in the appeal.
[54 FR 53504, Dec. 29, 1989, as amended at 77 FR 62367, Oct. 12, 2012]
§ 1201.72
Explanation and scope of discovery.
(a)
Explanation.
Discovery is the process, apart from the hearing, by which a party may obtain relevant information, including the identification of potential witnesses, from a party or nonparty, that the other party or nonparty has not otherwise provided. Relevant information includes information that appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. This information is obtained to assist the parties in preparing and presenting their cases. The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure may be used as a general guide for discovery practices in proceedings before the Board. Those rules, however, are instructive rather than controlling.
(b)
Scope.
Discovery covers any nonprivileged matter that is relevant to the issues involved in the appeal, including the existence, description, nature, custody, condition, and location of documents or other tangible things, and the identity and location of persons with knowledge of relevant facts. Discovery requests that are directed to nonparties and nonparty Federal agencies and employees are limited to information that appears directly material to the issues involved in the appeal.
(c)
Methods.
Parties may use one or more of the following methods for obtaining discovery from parties or nonparties: written interrogatories, depositions, requests for production of documents or things for inspection or copying, and requests for admission. These methods include written interrogatories to parties, depositions, requests for production of documents or things for inspection or copying, and requests for admission.
(d)
Limitations.
The judge may limit the frequency or extent of use of the discovery methods permitted by these regulations. Such limitations may be imposed if the judge finds that:
(1) The discovery sought is cumulative or duplicative, or is obtainable from some other source that is more convenient, less burdensome, or less expensive;
(2) The party seeking discovery has had sufficient opportunity through discovery in the action to obtain the information sought; or
(3) The burden or expense of the proposed discovery outweighs its likely benefit.

§ 1201.73
Discovery procedures.
(a)
Initiating discovery.
A party seeking discovery must start the process by serving a request for discovery on the representative of the party or nonparty, or, if there is no representative, on the party or nonparty themselves. The request for discovery must state the time limit for responding, as prescribed in 1201.73(d) of this part, and must specify the time and place of the taking of the deposition, if applicable. When a party directs a request for discovery to the official or employee of a Federal agency that is a party, the agency must make the officer or employee available on official time to respond to the request and must assist the officer or employee as necessary in providing relevant information that is available to the agency.
(b)
Responses to discovery requests.
A party or nonparty must answer a discovery request within the time provided under paragraph (d)(2) of this section, either by furnishing to the requesting party the information requested or agreeing to make deponents available to testify within a reasonable time, or by stating an objection to the particular request and the reasons for the objection. Parties and nonparties may respond to discovery requests by electronic mail.
(c)
Motions to compel or issue a subpoena.
(1) If a party fails or refuses to respond in full to a discovery request, the requesting party may file a motion
to compel discovery. If a nonparty fails or refuses to respond in full to a discovery request, the requesting party may file a motion for the issuance of a subpoena directed to the individual or entity from which the discovery is sought under the procedures described in 1201.81 of this part. The requesting party must serve a copy of the motion on the other party or nonparty. Before filing any motion to compel or issue a subpoena, the moving party shall discuss the anticipated motion with the opposing party or nonparty, and all those involved shall make a good faith effort to resolve the discovery dispute and narrow the areas of disagreement. The motion shall include:
(i) A copy of the original request and a statement showing that the information sought is discoverable under section 1201.72;
(ii) A copy of the response to the request (including the objections to discovery) or, where appropriate, a statement that no response has been received, along with an affidavit or sworn statement under 28 U.S.C. 1746 supporting the statement (See appendix IV to part 1201); and
(iii) A statement that the moving party has discussed or attempted to discuss the anticipated motion with the nonmoving party or nonparty and made a good faith effort to resolve the discovery dispute and narrow the areas of disagreement.
(2) The party or nonparty from whom discovery was sought may respond to the motion to compel or the motion to issue a subpoena within the time limits stated in paragraph (d)(3) of this section.
(d)
Time limits.
(1) Unless otherwise directed by the judge, parties must serve their initial discovery requests within 30 days after the date on which the judge issues an order to the respondent agency to produce the agency file and response.
(2) A party or nonparty must serve a response to a discovery request promptly, but not later than 20 days after the date of service of the request or order of the judge. Any discovery requests following the initial request must be served within 10 days of the date of service of the prior response, unless the parties are otherwise directed by the judge. Deposition witnesses must give their testimony at the time and place stated in the request for deposition or in the subpoena, unless the parties agree on another time or place.
(3)(i) Any motion for an order to compel or to issue a subpoena must be filed with the judge:
(A) Within 20 days of the date of service of objections or, if no response is received, within 10 days after the time limit for response has expired; or
(B) Within 10 days of notice that a nonmoving party or nonparty provided an evasive or incomplete answer or response to a discovery request.
(ii) A party may request an extension of the time limit to file a motion to compel with respect to any discovery dispute pursuant to § 1201.55. Any pleading in opposition to a motion to compel or subpoena discovery must be filed with the judge within 10 days of the date of service of the motion.
(4) Discovery must be completed within the time period designated by the judge or, if no such period is designated, no later than the prehearing or close of record conference.
(e)
Limits on the number of discovery requests.
(1) Absent prior approval by the judge, interrogatories served by parties upon another party or a nonparty may not exceed 25 in number, including all discrete subparts.
(2) Absent prior approval by the judge, requests for documents served by parties upon another party or nonparty may not exceed 25 in number, including all discrete subparts.
(3) Absent prior approval by the judge, requests for admission served by parties upon another party or nonparty may not exceed 25 in number, including all discrete subparts.
(4) Absent prior approval by the judge or agreement by the parties, each party may not take more than 10 depositions.
(5) Requests to exceed the limitations set forth in paragraphs (e)(1) through (4) of this section may be granted at the discretion of the judge. In considering such requests, the judge shall consider the factors identified in § 1201.72(d) of this part.
[77 FR 62367, Oct. 12, 2012, as amended at 89 FR 72961, Sept. 9, 2024]
§ 1201.74
Orders for discovery.
(a)
Motion for an order compelling discovery.
Motions for orders compelling discovery and motions for the appearance of nonparties must be filed with the judge in accordance with § 1201.73(c)(1) and (d)(3). An administrative judge may deny a motion to compel discovery if a party fails to comply with the requirements of 5 CFR 1201.73(c)(1) and (d)(3).
(b)
Content of order.
Any order issued will include, where appropriate:
(1) A provision that the person to be deposed must be notified of the time and place of the deposition;
(2) Any conditions or limits concerning the conduct or scope of the proceedings or the subject matter that may be necessary to prevent undue delay or to protect a party or other individual or entity from undue expense, embarrassment, or oppression;
(3) Limits on the time for conducting depositions, answering written interrogatories, or producing documentary evidence; and
(4) Other restrictions upon the discovery process that the judge sets.
(c)
Noncompliance.
The judge may impose sanctions under § 1201.43 of this part for failure to comply with an order compelling discovery.
[54 FR 53504, Dec. 29, 1989, as amended at 73 FR 18151, Apr. 3, 2008; 78 FR 23458, Apr. 19, 2013]
§ 1201.75
Taking depositions.
Depositions may be taken by any method agreed upon by the parties. The person providing information is subject to penalties for intentional false statements.

# Subpoenas
§ 1201.81
Requests for subpoenas.
(a)
Request.
Parties who have complied with 1201.73(c), as applicable, and wish to obtain subpoenas that would require the attendance and testimony of witnesses, or subpoenas that would require the production of documents or other evidence under 5 U.S.C. 1204(b)(2)(A), should file their motions for those subpoenas with the judge. The Board has authority under 5 U.S.C. 1204(b)(2)(A) to issue a subpoena requiring the attendance and testimony of any individual regardless of location and for the production of documentary or other evidence from any place in the United States, any territory or possession of the United States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico or the District of Columbia. Subpoenas are not ordinarily required to obtain the attendance of Federal employees as witnesses because Federal agencies and their employees must comply with 5 CFR 5.4 and § 1201.33.
(b)
Form.
Parties requesting subpoenas must file their requests, in writing, with the judge. Each request must identify specifically the testimony, documents, or other evidence desired.
(c)
Relevance.
The request must be supported by a showing that the evidence sought is directly material to the issues involved in the appeal.
(d)
Rulings.
Any judge who does not have the authority to issue subpoenas will refer the request to an official with authority to rule on the request, with a recommendation for decision. The official to whom the request is referred will rule on the request promptly. Judges who have the authority to rule on these requests themselves will do so directly.
[54 FR 53504, Dec. 29, 1989, as amended at 70 FR 30608, May 27, 2005; 77 FR 62367, Oct. 12, 2012; 89 FR 72962, Sept. 9, 2024]
§ 1201.82
Motions to quash subpoenas.
Any person to whom a subpoena is directed, or any party, may file a motion to quash or limit the subpoena. The motion must include reasons why compliance with the subpoena should not be required or the subpoena's scope should be limited. A party must file the motion with the judge and serve it on the other parties. A non-party must file the motion with the judge, who will enter the motion into the record and serve the motion on all parties. For purposes of this section, judges may provide a method by which nonparties may file the motion electronically, including by email, notwithstanding § 1201.14(d). Any party may file a response to the motion within 10 days after the motion has been entered into the record, and the judge will
specify the method of service of any such response upon a non-party.
[89 FR 72962, Sept. 9, 2024]
§ 1201.83
Serving subpoenas.
(a) Any person who is at least 18 years of age and who is not a party to the appeal may serve a subpoena. The means prescribed by applicable state law are sufficient. The party who requested the subpoena, and to whom the subpoena has been issued, is responsible for serving the subpoena.
(b) A subpoena directed to an individual outside the territorial jurisdiction of any court of the United States may be served in the manner described by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for service of a subpoena in a foreign country.
(c) A party requesting the presence of a non-federal employee witness must pay that witness' fees and travel expenses in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 1204(b)(3) and 28 U.S.C. 1821. Those fees must be paid or offered to the witness at the time the subpoena is served.
[54 FR 53504, Dec. 29, 1989, as amended at 89 FR 72962, Sept. 9, 2024]
§ 1201.84
Proof of service.
The person who has served the subpoena must certify that he or she did so:
(a) By delivering it to the witness in person,
(b) By registered or certified mail,
(c) By delivering the subpoena to a responsible person (named in the document certifying the delivery) at the residence or place of business (as appropriate) of the person for whom the subpoena was intended, or
The document in which the party makes this certification also must include a statement that the prescribed fees have been paid or offered.
(d) By any other method that is in accordance with applicable State law.
[54 FR 53504, Dec. 29, 1989, as amended at 89 FR 72962, Sept. 9, 2024]
§ 1201.85
Enforcing subpoenas.
(a) If a person who has been served with a Board subpoena fails or refuses to comply with its terms, the party seeking compliance may file a written motion for enforcement with the judge. That party must present the document certifying that the subpoena was served and, except where the witness was required to appear before the judge, must submit an affidavit or sworn statement under 28 U.S.C. 1746 (see appendix IV) describing the failure or refusal to obey the subpoena. A written motion must be served upon the person who is alleged to be in noncompliance.
(b) The person who is alleged to be in noncompliance may file a response within 10 days. A party must file the response with the judge and serve it on the other parties. Non-parties must file their response with the judge, who will enter the response into the record. The judge may waive § 1201.14(d) to accept a nonparty's response by email. Any party may file a reply to the response within 10 days after the response has been entered into the record.
(c) In ruling on a motion to quash, judges may rely on Fed.R.Civ.P. 45 and applicable case law. Upon a finding by the judge of failure to obey a subpoena, the Board, in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 1204(c), may then ask an appropriate U.S. district court to enforce the subpoena. If the person who has failed or refused to comply with a Board subpoena is located in a foreign country, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia will have jurisdiction to enforce compliance, to the extent that a U.S. court can assert jurisdiction over an individual in the foreign country.
(d) Upon application by the Special Counsel, the Board may seek court enforcement of a subpoena issued by the Special Counsel in the same manner in which it seeks enforcement of Board subpoenas, in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 1212(b)(3).
[89 FR 72962, Sept. 9, 2024]

# Interlocutory Appeals
§ 1201.91
Explanation.
An interlocutory appeal is an appeal to the Board of a ruling made by a judge during a proceeding. The judge may permit the appeal if he or she determines that the issue presented in it is of such importance to the proceeding that it requires the Board's immediate attention. Either party may make a
motion for certification of an interlocutory appeal. In addition, the judge, on his or her own motion, may certify an interlocutory appeal to the Board. If the appeal is certified, the Board will decide the issue and the judge will act in accordance with the Board's decision.
§ 1201.92
Criteria for certifying interlocutory appeals.
The judge will certify a ruling for review only if the record shows that:
(a) The ruling involves an important question of law or policy about which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion; and
(b) An immediate ruling will materially advance the completion of the proceeding, or the denial of an immediate ruling will cause undue harm to a party or the public.
§ 1201.93
Procedures.
(a)
Motion for certification.
A party seeking the certification of an interlocutory appeal must file a motion for certification within 10 days of the date of the ruling to be appealed. The motion must be filed with the judge, and must state why certification is appropriate and what the Board should do and why. The opposing party may file objections within 10 days of the date of service of the motion, or within any other time period that the judge may designate.
(b)
Certification and review.
The judge will grant or deny a motion for certification within five days after receiving all pleadings or, if no response is filed, within 10 days after receiving the motion. If the judge grants the motion for certification, he or she will refer the record to the Board. If the judge denies the motion, the party that sought certification may raise the matter at issue in a petition for review filed after the initial decision is issued, in accordance with §§ 1201.113 and 1201.114 of this part.
(c)
Stay of appeal.
The judge has the authority to proceed with or to stay the processing of the appeal while an interlocutory appeal is pending with the Board. The passage of time during any stay granted under this section is not deemed, or accounted for, as a case suspension under § 1201.28 of this part. If the judge does not stay the appeal, the Board may do so while an interlocutory appeal is pending with it.
[54 FR 53504, Dec. 29, 1989, as amended at 77 FR 62367, Oct. 12, 2012]

Not all ex parte communications are prohibited. Those that involve the merits of the case, or those that violate rules requiring submissions to be in writing, are prohibited. Accordingly, interested parties may ask about such matters as the status of a case, when it will be heard, and methods of submitting evidence to the Board. Parties may not ask about matters such as what defense they should use or whether their evidence is adequate, and they may not make a submission orally if that submission is required to be made in writing.

[54 FR 53504, Dec. 29, 1989, as amended at 77 FR 62367, Oct. 12, 2012]
§ 1201.102
Prohibition on ex parte communications.
Except as otherwise provided in § 1201.41(c)(1) of this part, ex parte communications that concern the merits of any matter before the Board for adjudication, or that otherwise violate rules requiring written submissions, are prohibited from the time the persons involved know that the Board
may consider the matter until the time the Board has issued a final decision on the matter.
§ 1201.103
Placing communications in the record; sanctions.
(a) Any communication made in violation of § 1201.102 of this part will be made a part of the record. If the communication was oral, a memorandum stating the substance of the discussion will be placed in the record.
(b) If there has been a violation of § 1201.102 of this part, the judge or the Clerk of the Board, as appropriate, will notify the parties in writing that the regulation has been violated, and will give the parties 10 days to file a response.
(c) The following sanctions are available:
(1)
Parties.
The offending party may be required to show why, in the interest of justice, the claim or motion should not be dismissed, denied, or otherwise adversely affected.

# Final Decisions
§ 1201.111
Initial decision by judge.
(a) The judge will prepare an initial decision after the record closes and will serve that decision on all parties to the appeal, including named parties, permissive intervenors, and intervenors of right. The Board satisfies its legal obligation under 5 U.S.C. 7701(b)(1) by making electronic copies of initial decisions available to the Office of Personnel Management.
(b) Each initial decision will contain:
(1) Findings of fact and conclusions of law upon all the material issues of fact and law presented on the record;
(2) The reasons or bases for those findings and conclusions;
(3) An order making final disposition of the case, including appropriate relief;
(4) A statement, if the appellant is the prevailing party, as to whether interim relief is provided effective upon the date of the decision, pending the outcome of any petition for review filed by another party under subpart C of this part;
(5) The date upon which the decision will become final (a date that, for purposes of this section, is 35 days after issuance); and

The agency may decline to return the appellant to his or her place of employment if it determines that the return or presence of the appellant will be unduly disruptive to the work environment. However, pay and benefits must be provided.
(2) An initial decision that orders interim relief shall include a section which will provide the appellant specific notice that the relief ordered in the decision must be provided by the agency effective as of the date of the decision if a party files a petition for review. If the relief ordered in the initial decision requires the agency to effect an appointment, the notice required by this section will so state, will specify the title and grade of the appointment, and will specifically advise the appellant of his right to receive pay and benefits while any petition for review is pending, even if the agency determines that the appellant's return to or presence in the workplace would be unduly disruptive.
[54 FR 53504, Dec. 29, 1989, as amended at 62 FR 17045, Apr. 9, 1997; 63 FR 41179, Aug. 3, 1998; 64 FR 27900, May 24, 1999; 77 FR 62367, Oct. 12, 2012]

(3) Process any petition for enforcement filed under subpart F of this part;

# Subpart C—Petitions for Review of Initial Decisions
§ 1201.114
Petition for review—content and procedure.
(a)
Pleadings allowed.
Pleadings allowed on review include a petition for review, which may be filed by either party, a response to a petition for review, and a reply to a response to a petition for review. Each party is limited to filing a single petition for review, response to a petition for review, and reply to a response to a petition for review.
(1) A petition for review is a pleading in which a party contends that an initial decision was incorrectly decided in whole or in part.
(2) A response to a petition for review may respond only to the arguments and assertions raised in the petition for review and does not contend that the initial decision was incorrectly decided in whole or in part. A response to another party's petition for review must be filed separately from a party's own petition for review.
(3) A reply to a response to a petition for review is limited to the factual and legal issues raised by another party in the response to the petition for review. It may not raise new allegations of error.
(4) No pleading other than the ones described in this paragraph is permitted unless the party files a motion with and obtains leave from the Clerk of the Board. The motion must briefly describe the nature of and need for the requested pleading,
i.e.,
the motion must identify the requested pleading and briefly explain why the requested pleading is important. If the record is closed, as defined in paragraph (k) of this section, the motion must also show that the requested pleading is new and material, as defined in § 1201.115(a)(1) and (d), and that it was not readily available before the record closed. The party may not submit the requested pleading unless the Board issues an order granting the motion for leave. A filing characterized as a motion for leave that does not adhere to the above requirements will be rejected.
(b)
Contents of petition for review.
A petition for review states a party's objections to the initial decision, including all of the party's legal and factual arguments, and must be supported by references to applicable laws or regulations and by specific references to the record. Any petition for review that contains new evidence or argument must include an explanation of why the evidence or argument was not presented before the record below closed (see § 1201.59). A petition for review should not include documents that were part of the record below, as the entire administrative record will be available to the Board. A petition for review filed by an agency should address the agency's compliance with any interim relief requirements and should contain a certification, as set forth in § 1201.116(a).
(c)
Who may file.
Any party to the proceeding, the Director of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), or the Special Counsel (under 5 U.S.C. 1212(c)) may file a petition for review. The Director of OPM may request review only if he or she believes that the decision is erroneous and will have a substantial impact on any civil service law, rule, or regulation under OPM's jurisdiction. 5 U.S.C. 7701(e)(2). All submissions to the Board must contain the signature of the party or of the party's designated representative.
(d)
Place for filing.
All pleadings described in paragraph (a) and all motions and pleadings associated with them must be filed with the Clerk of the Merit Systems Protection Board, 1615 M Street NW., Washington, DC 20419, by commercial or personal delivery, by facsimile, by mail, or by electronic filing in accordance with 1201.14 of this part.
(e)
Time for filing.
Any petition for review must be filed within 35 days after the date of issuance of the initial decision or, if the petitioner shows that the initial decision was received more than 5 days after the date of issuance, within 30 days after the date the petitioner received the initial decision. For purposes of this section, the date that the petitioner receives the initial decision is determined according to the standard set forth at § 1201.22(b)(3), pertaining to an appellant's receipt of an agency decision. If the petitioner is represented, the 30-day time period begins to run upon receipt of the initial decision by either the representative or the petitioner, whichever comes first. Any response to a petition for review must be filed within 25 days after the date of service of the petition. Any reply to a response to a petition for review must be filed within 10 days after the date of service of the response to the petition for review. For purposes of this section, § 1201.23 governs the computation of time.
(f)
Extension of time to file.
The Board will grant a motion for extension of time to file a pleading described in paragraph (a) only if the party submitting the motion shows good cause. Motions for extensions must be filed with the Clerk of the Board on or before the date on which the petition or other pleading is due. The Board, in its discretion, may grant or deny those motions without providing the other parties the opportunity to comment on them. A motion for an extension must be accompanied by an affidavit or sworn statement under 28 U.S.C. 1746. (See Appendix IV.) The affidavit or sworn statement must include a specific and detailed description of the circumstances alleged to constitute good cause, and it should be accompanied by any available documentation or other
evidence supporting the matters asserted.
(g)
Late filings.
Any pleading described in paragraph (a) of this section that is filed late must be accompanied by a motion that shows good cause for the untimely filing, unless the Board has specifically granted an extension of time under paragraph (f) of this section, or unless a motion for extension is pending before the Board. The motion must be accompanied by an affidavit or sworn statement under 28 U.S.C. 1746. (See appendix IV.) The affidavit or sworn statement must include: the reasons for failing to request an extension before the deadline for the submission, and a specific and detailed description of the circumstances causing the late filing, accompanied by supporting documentation or other evidence. Any response to the timeliness motion may be included in the response to the petition for review or may be filed separately. The response to the timeliness motion will not extend the time provided by paragraph (e) of this section to respond to the petition. In the absence of a motion, the Board may, in its discretion, determine on the basis of the existing record whether there was good cause for the untimely filing, or it may provide the party that submitted the pleading with an opportunity to show why it should not be dismissed or excluded as untimely.
(h)
Length limitations.
A petition for review, or a response to a petition for review, whether computer generated, typed, or handwritten, is limited to 30 pages or 7500 words. A reply to a response to a petition for review is limited to 15 pages or 3750 words. A party relying on word count to adhere to the length limitation must include certification of the word count with their pleading. Argument formatted such that the length of the pleading cannot be determined may be rejected. Computer generated and typed pleadings must use no less than 12-point typeface and 1-inch margins and must be double spaced and only use one side of a page. The length limitation is exclusive of any table of contents, table of authorities, attachments, and certificate of service. Length limitations may not be circumvented by including argument in attachments. Failure to comply with the length limitations set forth in this regulation, after sufficient opportunity to comply, may lead to dismissal of the petition for review. A request for leave to file a pleading that exceeds the limitations prescribed in this paragraph must be received by the Clerk of the Board at least 3 days before the filing deadline. Such requests must give the reasons for a waiver as well as the desired length of the pleading and are granted only in exceptional circumstances. The page and word limits set forth above are maximum limits. Parties are not expected or required to submit pleadings of the maximum length.
(i)
Intervention.
(1)
By Director of OPM.
The Director of OPM may intervene in a case before the Board under the standards stated in 5 U.S.C. 7701(d). The notice of intervention is timely if it is filed with the Clerk of the Board within 45 days of the date the petition for review was filed. If the Director requests additional time for filing a brief on intervention, the Board may, in its discretion, grant the request. A party may file a response to the Director's brief within 15 days of the date of service of that brief. The Director must serve the notice of intervention and the brief on all parties.
(2)
By Special Counsel.
(i) Under 5 U.S.C. 1212(c), the Special Counsel may intervene as a matter of right, except as provided in paragraph (i)(2)(ii) of this section. The notice of intervention is timely filed if it is filed with the Clerk of the Board within 45 days of the date the petition for review was filed. If the Special Counsel requests additional time for filing a brief on intervention, the Board may, in its discretion, grant the request. A party may file a response to the Special Counsel's brief within 15 days of the date of service. The Special Counsel must serve the notice of intervention and the brief on all parties.
(ii) The Special Counsel may not intervene in an action brought by an individual under 5 U.S.C. 1221, or in an appeal brought by an individual under 5 U.S.C. 7701, without the consent of that individual. The Special Counsel
must present evidence that the individual has consented to the intervention at the time the motion to intervene is filed.
(3)
Permissive intervenors.
Any person, organization, or agency, by motion made in a petition for review, may ask for permission to intervene. The motion must state in detail the reasons why the person, organization, or agency should be permitted to intervene. A motion for permission to intervene will be granted if the requester shows that he or she will be affected directly by the outcome of the proceeding. Any person alleged to have committed a prohibited personnel practice under 5 U.S.C. 2302(b) may ask for permission to intervene.
(j)
Service.
A party submitting a pleading must serve a copy of it on each party and on each representative, as required by paragraph (b)(2) of § 1201.26.
(k)
Closing the record.
The record closes on expiration of the period for filing the last permissible pleading or the date on which the last permissible pleading is filed, whichever is earlier. Once the record closes, no additional argument or evidence may be filed without first requesting and receiving leave from the Clerk of the Board under paragraph (a)(4) of this section.
(l)
Rejection for failure to comply.
The Clerk of the Board may reject material submitted for filing that does not substantially conform to the procedural requirements of this subpart by issuing a rejection letter advising the parties of the nature of the nonconformity and the requirements and deadline for resubmission. Any deadlines affected by the rejection will be addressed in the rejection letter.
[77 FR 62368, Oct. 12, 2012, as amended at 78 FR 23458, Apr. 19, 2013; 89 FR 72962, Sept. 9, 2024]
§ 1201.115
Criteria for granting petition for review.
The Board normally will consider only issues raised in a timely filed petition for review. Situations in which the Board may grant a petition for review include, but are not limited to, a showing that:
(a) The initial decision contains erroneous findings of material fact.
(1) Any alleged factual error must be material, meaning of sufficient weight to warrant an outcome different from that of the initial decision.
(2) A petitioner who alleges that the judge made erroneous findings of material fact must explain why the challenged factual determination is incorrect and identify specific evidence in the record that demonstrates the error. In reviewing a claim of an erroneous finding of fact, the Board will give deference to an administrative judge's credibility determinations when they are based, explicitly or implicitly, on the observation of the demeanor of witnesses testifying at a hearing.
(b) The initial decision is based on an erroneous interpretation of statute or regulation or the erroneous application of the law to the facts of the case. The petitioner must explain how the error affected the outcome of the case.
(c) The judge's rulings during either the course of the appeal or the initial decision were not consistent with required procedures or involved an abuse of discretion, and the resulting error affected the outcome of the case.
(d) New and material evidence or legal argument is available that, despite the petitioner's due diligence, was not available when the record closed. To constitute new evidence, the information contained in the documents, not just the documents themselves, must have been unavailable despite due diligence when the record closed.
(e) Notwithstanding the above provisions in this section, the Board reserves the authority to consider any issue in an appeal before it.
[77 FR 62369, Oct. 12, 2012, as amended at 89 FR 72963, Sept. 9, 2024]
§ 1201.116
Compliance with orders for interim relief.
(a)
Certification of compliance.
(1) If the appellant was the prevailing party in the initial decision, and the decision granted the appellant interim relief, any petition for review filed by the agency must be accompanied by a certification that the agency has complied with the interim relief order, either by:
(i) Providing the required interim relief; or
(ii) Satisfying the requirements of
5 U.S.C. 7701
(b)(2)(A)(ii) and (B).
(2) Evidence of its compliance must accompany its petition for review. Failure by an agency to provide the certification and evidence required by this section with its petition for review may result in the dismissal of the agency's petition for review.
(b)
Allegation of noncompliance in petition for review.
If an appellant or an intervenor files a petition for review of an initial decision ordering interim relief and such petition includes a challenge to the agency's compliance with the interim relief order, the agency must submit evidence within 25 days of the date of service that it has provided the interim relief required or that it has satisfied the requirements of 5 U.S.C.
7701
(b)(2)(A)(ii) and (B). The agency's evidence may be provided with any response to the petition for review or in a separate pleading.
(c)
Request for dismissal for noncompliance with interim relief order.
If the agency files a petition for review and the appellant believes the agency has not provided required interim relief, the appellant may request dismissal of the agency's petition. Any such request must be filed with the Clerk of the Board within 25 days of the date of service of the agency's petition, or within 25 days of the date upon which the appellant becomes aware that the agency has not provided, or has ceased to provide, interim relief. A copy of the request must be served on the agency at the same time it is filed with the Board. The agency may respond with evidence and argument to the appellant's request to dismiss within 15 days of the date of service of the request. If the appellant files a motion to dismiss beyond the time limit, the Board will dismiss the motion as untimely unless the appellant shows that it is based on information not readily available before the close of the time limit. Failure by an agency to provide the certification required by paragraph (a) of this section with its petition for review, or to provide evidence of compliance in response to a Board order, may result in the dismissal of the agency's petition for review.
(d)
Back pay and attorney fees.
Nothing in this section shall be construed to require any payment of back pay for the period preceding the date of the judge's initial decision or attorney fees before the decision of the Board becomes final.
[89 FR 72963, Sept. 9, 2024]
§ 1201.117
Board decisions; procedures for review or reopening.
(a) In any case that is reviewed, or reopened at the Board's discretion pursuant to § 1201.118, the Board may:
(1) Issue a decision that decides the case;
(2) Hear oral arguments;
(3) Require that briefs be filed;
(4) Remand the appeal so that the judge may take further testimony or evidence or make further findings or conclusions; or
(5) Take any other action necessary for final disposition of the case.
(b) The Board may affirm, reverse, modify, or vacate the initial decision of the judge, in whole or in part. The Board may issue a final decision and, when appropriate, order a date for compliance with that decision.
(c) The Board may issue a decision in the form of a precedential Opinion and Order or a nonprecedential Order.
(1)
Opinion and Order.
An Opinion and Order is a precedential decision of the Board and may be appropriately cited or referred to by any party.
(2)
Nonprecedential Orders.
A nonprecedential Order is one that the Board has determined does not add significantly to the body of MSPB case law. The Board may, in its discretion, include in nonprecedential Orders a discussion of the issue(s) to assist the parties in understanding the reason(s) for the Board's disposition in a particular appeal. Nonprecedential Orders are not binding on the Board or its administrative judges in any future appeals except when it is determined they have a preclusive effect on parties under the doctrines of res judicata (claim preclusion), collateral estoppel (issue preclusion), judicial estoppel, or law of the case. Parties may cite nonprecedential Orders, but such orders have no precedential value; the Board and its administrative judges are not required to follow or distinguish them in any future decisions. In contrast, a precedential decision issued as an Opinion and Order has been identified
by the Board as significantly contributing to the Board's case law.
[76 FR 60707, Sept. 30, 2011, as amended at 77 FR 62370, Oct. 12, 2012; 89 FR 72964, Sept. 9, 2024]
§ 1201.118
Board reopening of final decisions.
Regardless of any other provision of this part, the Board may at any time reopen any appeal in which it has issued a final order or in which an initial decision has become the Board's final decision by operation of law. The Board will exercise its discretion to reopen an appeal only in unusual or extraordinary circumstances and generally within a short period of time after the decision becomes final. The parties have no right to request reopening and no right to a response from the Board on a request for reopening. Any response to a request for reopening from the Office of the Clerk of the Board does not constitute a final order or decision of the Board, and thus is not subject to judicial review under 5 U.S.C. 7703 or § 1201.120.
[89 FR 72964, Sept. 9, 2024]
§ 1201.119

(a)
Criteria.
Under 5 U.S.C. 7703(d), the Director of the Office of Personnel Management may file a petition for reconsideration of a Board final decision if he or she determines:
(1) That the Board erred in interpreting a civil service law, rule, or regulation affecting personnel management, and
(2) That the Board's decision will have a substantial impact on a civil service law, rule, regulation, or policy directive.
(b)
Time limit.
The Director must file the petition for reconsideration within 35 days after the date of service of the Board's final decision.
(c)
Briefs.
After the petition is filed, the Board will make the official record relating to the petition for reconsideration available to the Director for review. The Director's brief in support of the petition for reconsideration must be filed within 20 days after the Board makes the record available for review. Any party's opposition to the petition for reconsideration must be filed within 25 days from the date of service of the Director's brief.
(d)

§ 1201.120
Judicial review.
Any employee or applicant for employment who is adversely affected by a final order or decision of the Board under the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 7703 may obtain judicial review as provided by 5 U.S.C. 7703. As § 1201.175 of this part provides, an appropriate United States district court has jurisdiction over a request for judicial review of cases involving the kinds of discrimination issues described in 5 U.S.C. 7702.

§ 1201.154
Time for filing appeal.
For purposes of this section, the date an appellant receives the agency's decision is determined according to the standard set forth at 1201.22(b)(3) of this part. Appellants who file appeals raising issues of prohibited discrimination in connection with a matter otherwise appealable to the Board must comply with the following time limits:

Requests for review of final grievance or arbitrator's decisions.
(a)
Source and applicability.
(1) Under paragraph (d) of 5 U.S.C. 7121, an employee who believes he or she has been subjected to discrimination within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. 2302(b)(1), and who may raise the matter under either a statutory procedure such as 5 U.S.C. 7701 or under a negotiated grievance procedure, must make an election between the two procedures. The election of the negotiated grievance procedure “in no manner prejudices” the employee's right to request Board review of the final decision pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 7702. Subsection (a)(1) of section 7702 provides that, “[n]otwithstanding any other provision of law,” when an employee who has been subjected to an action that is appealable to the Board and who alleges that the action was the result of discrimination within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. 2302(b)(1), the Board will decide both the issue of discrimination and the appealable action in accordance with the Board's appellate procedures under section 7701.

(c)
Scope of Board review.
If the negotiated grievance procedure permits allegations of discrimination, the Board will review only those claims of discrimination that were raised in the negotiated grievance procedure. If the negotiated grievance procedure does not permit allegations of discrimination to be raised, the appellant may raise such claims before the Board.
(d)
Contents.
The appellant must file the request with the Clerk of the Board, Merit Systems Protection Board, 1615 M Street NW., Washington, DC 20419. The request for review must contain:
(1) A statement of the grounds on which review is requested;
(2) References to evidence of record or rulings related to the issues before the Board;
(3) Arguments in support of the stated grounds that refer specifically to relevant documents and that include relevant citations of authority; and
(4) Legible copies of the final grievance or arbitration decision, the agency decision to take the action, and other relevant documents. Those documents may include a transcript or recording of the hearing.
(e)
Development of the record.
The Board, in its discretion, may develop the record as to a claim of prohibited discrimination by ordering the parties to submit additional evidence or forwarding the request for review to a judge to conduct a hearing.
(f)
Closing of the record.
The record will close upon expiration of the period for filing the response to the request for review, or to the brief on intervention, if any, or on any other date the Board sets for this purpose. Once the record closes, no additional evidence or argument will be accepted unless the party submitting it shows that the evidence was not readily available before the record closed.
(g)
Petition for enforcement.
A petition for enforcement of a final Board decision or order that was issued pursuant to paragraphs (a) through (f) of this section, should be filed with the Office of the Clerk of the Board and should otherwise comply with the requirements set forth in § 1201.182(a).

Appellate jurisdiction.
Any party may petition the Board for enforcement of a final decision or order issued under the Board's appellate jurisdiction, or for enforcement of the terms of a settlement agreement that has been entered into the record for the purpose of enforcement in an order or decision under the Board's appellate jurisdiction. The petition must be filed promptly with the regional or field office that issued the initial decision, or with the Office of the Clerk of the Board if the party is requesting enforcement of a final Board decision or order that was issued pursuant to § 1201.155; a copy of it must be served on the other party and that party's representative; and it must describe specifically the reasons the petitioning party believes there is noncompliance. The petition also must include the date and results of any communications regarding compliance.

Original jurisdiction.
Any party seeking enforcement of a final Board decision or order issued under its original jurisdiction or enforcement of the terms of settlement agreement entered into the record for the purpose of enforcement in an order or decision issued under its original jurisdiction

Except for a petition filed under paragraph (c)(2) or (c)(3) of this section, the Board will entertain a petition for enforcement from an aggrieved employee who is not a party only if the employee seeks and is granted party status as a permissive intervenor under § 1201.34(c) of this part. The employee must file a motion to intervene at the time of filing the petition for enforcement. The petition for enforcement must describe specifically why the petitioner believes there is noncompliance and in what way the petitioner is aggrieved by the noncompliance. The motion to intervene will be considered in accordance with § 1201.34(c) of this part.

§ 1201.183
Procedures for processing petitions for enforcement.
(a)
Initial processing of a petition for enforcement.
(1) When a party has filed a petition for enforcement of a final decision or order of the Board, or enforcement of a settlement agreement that has been entered into the Board's record for purposes of enforcement, the alleged noncomplying party must file one of the following within 15 days of the date of service of the petition:
(i) Evidence of compliance, including a narrative explanation of the calculation of back pay and other benefits, and supporting documents;
(ii) Evidence and/or a statement of the compliance actions that are in process and/or remain to be taken, along with a schedule for accomplishing full compliance within a reasonable period; or
(iii) A statement showing good cause for the failure to comply completely with the final decision or order of the Board, or with the terms of an applicable settlement agreement.
(2) The party that filed the petition may respond to the alleged noncomplying party's submission within 10 days after the date of service of the submission. The parties must serve copies of their pleadings on each other as required under § 1201.26(b)(2).
(3) If a party files a petition for enforcement seeking compliance with a final Board decision or order, the alleged noncomplying party generally has the burden of proving its compliance by a preponderance of the evidence. However, if any party files a petition for enforcement seeking compliance with the terms of a settlement agreement that has been entered into the Board's record for purposes of enforcement, that party has the burden of proving the other party's breach of the settlement agreement by a preponderance of the evidence.
(4) If the agency is the alleged noncomplying party, it shall submit the
name, title, grade, and address of the agency official charged with complying with the Board's final decision or order, and inform such official in writing of the potential sanction for noncompliance as set forth in 5 U.S.C. 1204(a)(2) and (e)(2)(A), even if the agency asserts that it is has fully complied. The agency must further submit a current initial contact email address that is regularly checked to ensure receipt of all information regarding the allegations of compliance. The agency must advise the Board of any subsequent change to the identity and/or location of the designated agency official during the pendency of any compliance proceeding. In the absence of this information, the Board will presume that the highest-ranking agency official who is not appointed by the President by and with the consent of the Senate, is charged with compliance.
(5) Discovery may be pursued in accordance with the procedures set forth at §§ 1201.71 through 1201.75, except that unless otherwise directed by the judge, initial discovery requests must be served no later than 15 days after the alleged noncomplying party files a response to the petition for enforcement.
(6) The judge may convene a hearing to resolve compliance issues.
(7) If the judge finds that the alleged noncomplying party has fully complied with the final Board decision or order at issue, or with the applicable settlement agreement entered into the Board's record for purposes of enforcement, he or she will issue an initial decision to that effect. That decision will be subject to the procedures for petitions for review by the Board under subpart C of this part, and subject to judicial review under § 1201.120.
(8) If the judge finds that the alleged noncomplying party has not complied, in whole or in part, with the final Board decision or order at issue, or with the applicable settlement agreement entered into the Board's record for purposes of enforcement, he or she will issue an initial decision:
(i) Directing the noncomplying party to take the specific actions required by the final Board decision or order at issue, or required under the applicable settlement agreement entered into the Board's record for purposes of enforcement; or
(ii) Upon the request of the party seeking compliance where the judge finds a material breach, rescinding the applicable settlement agreement and reinstating the underlying matter on appeal.
(9) An initial decision issued under paragraph (a)(8) of this section will be subject to the procedures for petitions for review by the Board under subpart C of this part, but not subject to judicial review under § 1201.120.
(10) A copy of an initial decision finding full or partial noncompliance with a final Board decision or order, or a settlement agreement that has been entered into the Board's record for purposes of enforcement will be served on the designated agency official.
(b)
Processing after a finding of noncompliance that directs specific action.
(1) If an initial decision described under paragraph (a)(8)(i) of this section is issued, the noncomplying party must do the following:
(i) To the extent that the noncomplying party agrees to take some or all of the actions required by the initial decision, the party must, within the time limit for filing a petition for review under § 1201.114(e), provide the Clerk of the Board with a statement of compliance certifying that the party has taken the actions identified in the initial decision, along with evidence establishing that the party has taken those actions. The narrative statement must explain in detail why the evidence of compliance satisfies the requirements set forth in the initial decision. The party seeking compliance may file evidence and argument in response to any statement of compliance within 20 days of the date of service of the statement of compliance.
(ii) To the extent that the noncomplying party declines to take some or all of the actions required by the initial decision, the party must file a petition for review under the provisions of §§ 1201.114 and 1201.115.
(iii) A statement of compliance and a petition for review, as described in the two preceding paragraphs, may be filed separately or as part of a single pleading.
(2) If an initial decision described under paragraph (a)(8)(i) of this section is issued, the party seeking compliance may also file a petition for review of an initial decision's finding of partial compliance with the Board's final decision or order, or with an applicable settlement agreement entered into the Board's record for purposes of enforcement.
(c)
Consideration by the Board.
(1) Following review of the initial decision and the written submissions of the parties, the Board will render a final decision on the issues of compliance. Upon finding that the agency is in noncompliance, the Board may, when appropriate, require the agency and the responsible agency official to appear before the Board to show why sanctions should not be imposed under 5 U.S.C. 1204(a)(2) and 1204(e)(2)(A). The Board also may require the agency and the responsible agency official to make this showing in writing, or to make it both personally and in writing. The responsible agency official has the right to respond in writing or to appear at any argument concerning the withholding of that official's pay.
(2) The Board's final decision on the issues of compliance is subject to judicial review under 1201.120 of this part.
(d)
Burdens of proof.
If an appellant files a petition for enforcement seeking compliance with a Board order, the agency generally has the burden to prove its compliance with the Board order by a preponderance of the evidence. However, if any party files a petition for enforcement seeking compliance with the terms of a settlement agreement, that party has the burden of proving the other party's breach of the settlement agreement by a preponderance of the evidence.
(e)
Certification to the Comptroller General.
When appropriate, the Board may certify to the Comptroller General of the United States, under 5 U.S.C. 1204(e)(2)(A), that no payment is to be made to a certain Federal employee. This order may apply to any Federal employee, other than a Presidential appointee subject to confirmation by the Senate, who is found to be in noncompliance with the Board's order.
(f)
Effect of Special Counsel's action or failure to act.
Failure by the Special Counsel to file a complaint under 5 U.S.C. 1215(a)(1)(C) and subpart D of this part will not preclude the Board from taking action under this subpart.
(g)
Requests for attorney fees.
A request for attorney fees related to a petition for enforcement will be governed by § 1201.203 and must be made no later than 60 days after issuance of the Board's final decision issued under § 1201.183(c)(1).

# Subpart G—Savings Provisions
§ 1201.191
Savings provisions.
(a)
Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (Pub.L. 95-454)
—(1)
Scope.
All executive orders, rules and regulations relating to the Federal service that were in effect prior to the effective date of the Civil Service Reform Act shall continue in effect and be applied by the Board in its adjudications until modified, terminated, superseded, or repealed by the President, Office of Personnel Management, the Merit Systems Protection Board, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, or the Federal Labor Relations Authority, as appropriate.
(2)
Administrative proceedings and appeals therefrom.
No provision of the Civil Service Reform Act shall be applied by the Board in such a way as to affect any administrative proceeding pending at the effective date of such provision. “Pending” is considered to encompass existing agency proceedings, and appeals before the Board or its predecessor agencies, that were subject to judicial review or under judicial review on January 11, 1979, the date on which the Act became effective. An agency proceeding is considered to exist once the employee has received notice of the proposed action.
(3)
Explanation.
Mr. X was advised of agency's intention to remove him for abandonment of position, effective December 29, 1978. Twenty days later Mr. X appealed the agency action to the Merit Systems Protection Board. The Merit Systems Protection Board docketed Mr. X's appeal as an “old system case,”
i.e.
, one to which the savings
clause applied. The appropriate regional office processed the case, applying the substantive laws, rules and regulations in existence prior to the enactment of the Act. The decision, dated February 28, 1979, informed Mr. X that he is entitled to judicial review if he files a timely notice of appeal in the appropriate United States district court or the United States Court of Claims under the statute of limitations applicable when the adverse action was taken.
(b)
Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989 (Pub. L. 101-12)
—(1)
Scope.
All orders, rules, and regulations issued by the Board and the Special Counsel before the effective date of the Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989 shall continue in effect, according to their terms, until modified, terminated, superseded, or repealed by the Board or the Special Counsel, as appropriate.
(2)
Administrative proceedings and appeals therefrom.
No provision of the Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989 shall be applied by the Board in such a way as to affect any administrative proceeding pending at the effective date of such provision. “Pending” is considered to encompass existing agency proceedings, including personnel actions that were proposed, threatened, or taken before July 9, 1989, the effective date of the Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989, and appeals before the Board or its predecessor agencies that were subject to judicial review on that date. An agency proceeding is considered to exist once the employee has received notice of the proposed action.

# Subpart H—Attorney Fees (Plus Costs, Expert Witness Fees, and Litigation Expenses, Where Applicable) and Damages (Consequential, Liquidated, and Compensatory)

# Source:
63 FR 41179, Aug. 3, 1998, unless otherwise noted.
§ 1201.201
Statement of purpose.
(a) This subpart governs Board proceedings for awards of attorney fees (plus costs, expert witness fees, and litigation expenses, where applicable), consequential damages, compensatory damages, and liquidated damages.
(b) There are seven statutory provisions covering attorney fee awards. Because most MSPB cases are appeals under 5 U.S.C. 7701, most requests for attorney fees will be governed by § 1201.202(a)(1). There are, however, other attorney fee provisions that apply only to specific kinds of cases. For example, § 1201.202(a)(4) applies only to certain whistleblower appeals. Sections 1201.202(a)(5) and (a)(6) apply only to corrective and disciplinary action cases brought by the Special Counsel. Section 1201.202(a)(7) applies only to appeals brought under the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act.
(c) An award of consequential damages is authorized in only two situations: Where the Board orders corrective action in a whistleblower appeal under 5 U.S.C. 1221, and where the Board orders corrective action in a Special Counsel complaint under 5 U.S.C. 1214. Consequential damages include such items as medical costs and travel expenses, and other costs as determined by the Board through case law.
(d) The Civil Rights Act of 1991 (42 U.S.C. 1981a) authorizes an award of compensatory damages to a prevailing party who is found to have been intentionally discriminated against based on race, color, religion, sex, national origin, or disability. The Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act of 2012 (5 U.S.C. 1221(g)) also authorizes an award of compensatory damages in cases where the Board orders corrective action. Compensatory damages include pecuniary losses, future pecuniary losses, and nonpecuniary losses, such as emotional pain, suffering, inconvenience, mental anguish, and loss of enjoyment of life.
(e) An award equal to back pay shall be awarded as liquidated damages under 5 U.S.C. 3330c when the Board or a court determines an agency willfully violated an appellant's veterans' preference rights.
[63 FR 41179, Aug. 3, 1998, as amended at 77 FR 62372, Oct. 12, 2012; 78 FR 39545, July 2, 2013]

(2) Attorney fees, as authorized by 5 U.S.C. 7701(g)(2), where the appellant or respondent is the prevailing party in an appeal under 5 U.S.C. 7701, a request to review an arbitration decision under 5 U.S.C. 7121(d), or an agency action against an administrative law judge under 5 U.S.C. 7521, and the decision is based on a finding of discrimination prohibited under 5 U.S.C. 2302(b)(1);
(3) Attorney fees and costs, as authorized by 5 U.S.C. 1221(g)(2), where the appellant is the prevailing party in an appeal under 5 U.S.C. 7701 and the Board's decision is based on a finding of a prohibited personnel practice;
(4) Attorney fees and costs, as authorized by 5 U.S.C. 1221(g)(1)(B), where the Board orders corrective action in a whistleblower appeal to which 5 U.S.C. 1221 applies;
(5) Attorney fees, as authorized by 5 U.S.C. 1214(g)(2) or 5 U.S.C. 7701(g)(1), where the Board orders corrective action in a Special Counsel complaint under 5 U.S.C. 1214;
(6) Attorney fees, costs and damages as authorized by 5 U.S.C. 1214(h) where the Board orders corrective action in a Special Counsel complaint under 5 U.S.C. 1214 and determines that the employee has been subjected to an agency investigation that was commenced, expanded or extended in retaliation for the disclosure or protected activity that formed the basis of the corrective action.

(b)
Awards of consequential damages.
The Board may order payment of consequential damages, including medical costs incurred, travel expenses, and any other reasonable and foreseeable consequential damages:
(1) As authorized by 5 U.S.C. 1221(g)(1)(A)(ii), where the Board orders corrective action in a whistleblower appeal to which 5 U.S.C. 1221 applies; and
(2) As authorized by 5 U.S.C. 1221(g)(4) where the Board orders corrective action to correct a prohibited personnel practice and determines that the employee has been subjected to an agency investigation that was commenced, expanded, or extended in retaliation for the disclosure or protected activity that formed the basis of the corrective action.
(3) As authorized by 5 U.S.C. 1214(g)(2), where the Board orders corrective action in a Special Counsel complaint under 5 U.S.C. 1214.
(4) As authorized by 5 U.S.C. 1214(h) where the Board orders corrective action to correct a prohibited personnel practice and determines that the employee has been subjected to an agency investigation that was commenced, expanded, or extended in retaliation for the disclosure or protected activity that formed the basis of the corrective action.
(c)
Awards of compensatory damages.
The Board may order payment of compensatory damages, as authorized by section 102 of the Civil Rights Act of 1991 (42 U.S.C. 1981a), based on a finding of unlawful intentional discrimination but not on an employment practice that is unlawful because of its disparate impact under the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, or the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. The Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act of 2012 (5 U.S.C.
1221(g)) also authorizes an award of compensatory damages in cases where the Board orders corrective action. Compensatory damages include pecuniary losses, future pecuniary losses, and nonpecuniary losses such as emotional pain, suffering, inconvenience, mental anguish, and loss of enjoyment of life.

The judge or the Board, as applicable, may waive the time limit for making such request for good cause shown, and upon a finding that a waiver would not result in undue prejudice to the opposing party.
(2)
Place of filing.
When the initial decision in the proceedings on the merits was issued by a judge in an MSPB regional or field office, the request must be filed with the applicable regional or field office. When the initial decision in the proceedings on the merits was issued by a judge at the Board's headquarters or when the only decision was a final decision issued by the Board itself, the request must be filed with the Clerk of the Board.
(3)
Form and content of request.
A request for consequential, liquidated, or compensatory damages must be made in writing and state the basis for entitlement to an award of such damages, and the amount of damages sought.

(5)
Hearing; applicability of subpart B.
The judge may grant the appellant's request for a hearing on a request for consequential, liquidated, or compensatory damages and may apply appropriate provisions of subpart B of this part to the addendum proceeding.
(6)
Initial decision; review by the Board.
The judge will issue an initial decision in the addendum proceeding, adjudicating the request for damages. The initial decision shall then be subject to the provisions for a petition for review by the Board under subpart C of this part.
(7)
Request for damages made in proceeding before the Board.
Where a request for damages is made in a case which originates before the Board, the Board may:
(i) Consider both the merits of the case and the request for damages and issue a final decision; or
(ii) Remand the case to a judge for a new initial decision, either on the request for damages only or on both the merits and the request for damages.
(8)
EEOC review of decision on compensatory damages.
A final decision of the Board on a request for compensatory damages pursuant to the Civil Rights Act of 1991 shall be subject to review by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission as provided under subpart E of this part.

(3) A reply to a response may be filed within 10 days after the response is filed. The reply may address only those matters raised in the response that were not addressed in the request for regulation review.
(4) Motions may be filed at any time during the regulation review. The filing of a motion will not delay the acting of the Board unless the Board orders a postponement. The Board may rule immediately on a motion for an extension of time or a continuance if circumstances make consideration of others' views regarding the motion impracticable.
(5) Submissions opposing motions must be filed within five days after the opposing party receives the motion.
(c)
Additional pleadings.
The Board will consider pleadings in addition to those mentioned above only if the Board requests them, or if it grants a request that it consider them.

If the document was submitted by certified mail, it is considered to have been filed on the mailing date. If it was submitted by regular mail, it is presumed to have been filed five days before the Office of the Clerk receives it, in the absence of evidence contradicting that presumption. If it was delivered personally, it is considered to have been filed on the date the Office of the Clerk receives it. If it was submitted by facsimile, the date of the facsimile is considered to be the filing date.

Parties.
In every case, the person requesting regulation review must serve a copy of the request on the Director of OPM.

Federal Register.
[54 FR 28658, July 6, 1989]

# Subpart A—Purpose and Scope
§ 1204.1
Purpose.
This part implements the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552, as amended, by stating the procedures to follow when requesting information from the Board, and by stating the fees that will be charged for that information.
§ 1204.2
Scope.
(a) For the purpose of this part, the term
record
and any other term used in reference to information includes any information that would be a Board record subject to the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 552 when maintained by the Board in any format including an electronic format. All written requests for information that are not processed under part 1205 of this chapter will be processed under this part. The Board may continue, without complying with this part, to furnish the public with the information it has furnished in the regular course of performing its official duties, unless furnishing the information would violate the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a, or another law.
(b) When the subject of the record, or the subject's representative, requests a record from a Privacy Act system of records, as that term is defined by 5 U.S.C. 552a(a)(5), and the Board retrieves the record by the subject's name or other personal identifier, the Board will handle the request under the procedures and fees shown in part 1205 of this chapter. When a third party requests access to those records, without the written consent of the subject of the record, the Board will handle the request under this part.
(c) When a party to an appeal requests a copy of a tape recording, video tape, or transcript (if one has been prepared) of a hearing that the Board or a judge held under part 1201 or part 1209 of this chapter, the Board will handle the request under § 1201.53 of this chapter. When someone other than a party to the appeal makes this request, the Board will handle the request under this part.
(d) In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(2), the Board's final opinions and orders (including concurring and dissenting opinions), those statements of policy and interpretations adopted by the Board and that are not published in the
Federal Register,
administrative staff manuals and instructions to staff that affect a member of the public, and agency records processed and disclosed in response to a FOIA request that the Board determines have been or are likely to become the subject of additional requests for basically the same records and a general index of those records, are available for public review and copying in the Board's Headquarters' Library, 1615 M Street, NW., Washington, DC 20419-0001, and on the Board's World Wide Web site at
http://www.mspb.gov.
[64 FR 51039, Sept. 21, 1999, as amended at 65 FR 48885, Aug. 10, 2000]

# Subpart B—Procedures for Obtaining Records Under the Freedom of Information Act
§ 1204.11
Request for access to Board records.
(a)
Sending a request.
A person may request a Board record under this part by writing to the office that has the record. If the requester believes that the records are located in a regional or field office, the request must be sent to that office. A list of the addresses of the Board's regional and field offices are in appendix II of part 1201 of this chapter and on the Board's World Wide Web site at
http://www.mspb.gov.
Other requests must be sent to the Clerk of the Board, 1615 M Street, NW., Washington, DC 20419-0001. Requests sent under this part must be clearly marked “Freedom of Information Act Request” on both the envelope and the request.
(b)
Description.
A request must describe the records wanted in enough detail for Board employees to locate the records with no more than a reasonable effort. Wherever possible, a request must include specific information about each record, such as the date, title or name, author, recipient, and subject matter of the record. In addition, if the request asks for records on cases decided by the Board, it must show the title of the case, the MSPB docket number, and the date of the decision.
(c)
Time limits and decisions.
If a request is not properly labeled or is sent to the wrong office, the time for processing the request will begin when the proper office receives it. Requests to the Board's headquarters will be decided by the Clerk of the Board. Requests to one of the regional or field offices will be decided by the Regional Director or Chief Administrative Judge. The Board will decide a request within 20 workdays after the appropriate office receives it, except under the conditions that follow.
(1)
Extension of time.
If “unusual circumstances” exist, the Board may extend the time for deciding the request by no more than 10 additional workdays. An example of unusual circumstances could be the need to find and retrieve records from regional or field offices or from federal records centers or the need to search, collect and or examine a large number of records which are demanded in a single request, or the need to talk to another agency with a substantial interest in the determination of the request. When the Board extends the time to decide the request, it will inform the requester in writing and describe the “unusual circumstances”, and it will state a date on which a decision on the request will be made. If the “unusual circumstances” are such that the Board cannot comply with the request within the time limit, the Board will offer the requester an opportunity:
(i) To limit the request so that it may be processed within the time limit, or
(ii) To arrange with the Board a different time frame for processing the request or a changed request.
(2)
Expedited processing.
Where a requester shows a “compelling need” and in other cases determined by the Board, a decision whether to provide expedited processing of a request and notification of that decision to the requester will be made within 10 workdays of the date of the request. An example of a compelling need could be that a failure to obtain the records expeditiously could reasonably be expected to be a threat to the life or physical safety of a person or that there is urgency to inform the public about actual or alleged Federal Government activity by a person primarily engaged in distributing information. Where the Board approves expeditious processing, the Board will process the request within 5 workdays from the date of the decision to grant the expeditious processing. If, in order to fully satisfy the request, the Board requires the standard or additional processing time, or if it decides that good cause for expedited processing has not been made, it will provide written notice of its decision to the requester and will inform the requester of the right to administrative and court review of the decision. A showing of a compelling need must be made by a statement certified to be true to the best of the requester's knowledge and belief.
[64 FR 51039, Sept. 21, 1999, as amended at 65 FR 48886, Aug. 10, 2000]
§ 1204.12
Fees.
(a)
General.
The Board will charge the requester fees for services provided in processing requests for information. Those fees will be charged according to the schedule in paragraph (d) of this section, and will recover the full allowable direct costs that the Board incurs. Fees may be charged for time spent searching for information, even if the Board fails to locate responsive records, and even if it determines that the information is exempt from disclosure.
(b)
Definitions.
(1) The term
direct costs
means the costs to an agency for searching for and copying (and in the case of commercial requesters, reviewing) documents to respond to a FOIA request. Direct costs include, for example, the salary of each employee performing work at the rate of $5 per quarter hour. Overhead expenses, such as costs of space and of heating or lighting the facility in which the records are stored, are not included in direct costs.
(2) The term
search,
as defined by 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(3)(D), means either manual or automated review of Board records to locate those records asked for, and includes all time spent looking for material in response to a request, including page-by-page or line-by-line identification of material within documents. Searches will be done in the most efficient and least expensive way to limit costs for both the Board and the requester. Searches may be done manually or by computer using existing programming. The Board will make a reasonable effort to search for the records in electronic form or format, except when such effort would interfere to a large extent with the operation of the Board's automated information system.
(3) The term
duplication
means the process of copying a document or electronically maintained information in response to a FOIA request. Copies can take the form of paper, microfilm, audio-visual materials, or machine-readable documentation (e.g., magnetic tape or disk), among others. The copy provided will be in a form or format requested if the record is readily reproducible by the Board in that form or format. The Board will make a reasonable effort to maintain its records in forms or formats that are reproducible.
(4) The term
review
includes the process of examining documents to determine whether any portion of them may be exempt from disclosure under the FOIA, when the documents have been located in response to a request that is for a commercial use. The term also includes processing any documents for disclosure, e.g., doing all that is necessary to edit them and otherwise prepare them for release. Review does not include time spent resolving general legal or policy issues.
(5) The term
commercial use request
means a request from or on behalf of one who seeks information for a use or purpose that furthers the commercial, trade, or profit interests of the requester or the person on whose behalf the request is made. In deciding whether a requester properly belongs in this category, the Board will decide the use the requester will make of the documents requested. Also, where the Board has reasonable cause to doubt the use a requester will make of the records requested, or where that use is not clear from the request, the Board will seek additional clarification before assigning the request to a specific category.
(6) The term
educational institution
means a preschool, a public or private elementary or secondary school, an institution of graduate higher education, an institution of undergraduate higher education, an institution of professional education, or an institution of vocational education that operates a program or programs of scholarly research.
(7) The term
noncommercial scientific institution
means an institution that is not operated on a “commercial” basis as that term is used above, and that is operated solely for the purpose of conducting scientific research whose results are not intended to promote any particular product or industry.
(8) The term
representative of the news media
means any person actively gathering news for an entity that is organized and operated to publish or broadcast news to the public. The term
news
means information that concerns current events or that would be of current interest to the public.
(c)
Categories of requesters.
There are four categories of FOIA requesters: Commercial use requesters; educational and noncommercial scientific institutions; representatives of the news media; and all other requesters. To be included in the category of educational and noncommercial scientific institutions, requesters must show that the request is authorized by a qualifying institution and that they are seeking the records not for a commercial use, but to further scholarly or scientific research. To be included in the news media category, a requester must meet the definition in paragraph (b)(8) of this section and the request must not be made for a commercial use. To avoid commercial use charges, requesters must show that they should be included in a category or categories other than that of commercial use requesters. The Board will decide the categories to place requesters for fee purposes. It will make these determinations based on information given by the requesters and information otherwise known to the Board.
(d) The Board will not charge a requester if the fee for any request is less that $100 (the cost to the Board of processing and collecting the fee).
(1) When the Board receives a request:
(i) From a commercial use requester, it will charge fees that recover the full direct costs for searching for the information requested, reviewing it for release at the initial request stage, reviewing it after an appeal to determine whether other exemptions not considered before the appeal apply to it, and copying it.
(ii) From an educational and noncommercial scientific institution or, to the extent copying exceeds 100 pages, from a representative of the news media, it will charge fees only for the cost of copying the requested information.
(iii) From all other requesters, to the extent copying exceeds 100 pages and search time exceeds 2 hours, it will charge fees for the full direct cost of searching for and copying requested records.
(2) When the Board reasonably believes that a requester or group of requesters is attempting to divide a request into more than one request to avoid payment of fees, the Board will combine the requests and charge fees accordingly. The Board will not combine multiple requests on unrelated subjects from one requester.
(3) When the Board decides that charges for a request are likely to exceed $250, the Board will require the requester to pay the entire fee in advance before continuing to process the request.
(4) When a requester has an outstanding fee charge or has not paid a fee on time, the Board will require the requester to pay the full amount of the estimated fee in advance before the Board begins to process a new or pending request from that requester, and before it applies administrative time limits for making a decision on the new or pending request.
(e)
Fee schedule.
(1) Fees for document searches for records will be charged at a rate of $5 per quarter hour spent by each Board employee performing the search.
(2) Fees for computer searches for records will be $5 per quarter hour spent by each employee operating the computer equipment and/or developing a new inquiry or report.
(3) Fees for review at the initial administrative level to determine whether records or portions of records are exempt from disclosure, and for review after an appeal to determine whether the records are exempt on other legal grounds, will be charged, for commercial use requests, at a rate of $5 per quarter hour spent by each reviewing employee.
(4) Fees for photocopying records is 20 cents a page, the fee for copying audio tapes is the direct cost up to $15 per cassette tape; the fee for copying video tapes is the direct cost up to $20 per tape; and the fee for computer printouts is 10 cents a page. The fee for duplication of electronically maintained information in the requester's preferred format will be $21 for copying computer tapes and $4 for copying records on computer diskettes, if it is feasible for the Board to reproduce records in the format requested. Fees for certified copies of the Board's records will include a $4 per page charge for each page displaying the
Board's seal and certification. When the Board estimates that copying costs will exceed $100, it will notify the requester of the estimated amount unless the requester has indicated in advance a willingness to pay an equal or higher amount.
(f)
Fee waivers.
(1) Upon request, the Clerk of the Board, Regional Director, or Chief Administrative Judge, as appropriate, will furnish information without charge or at reduced rates if it is established that disclosure “is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government.” This decision will be based on:
(i) The subject of the request: Whether the subject of the requested records concerns the operations or activities of the government;
(ii) The informative value of the information to be disclosed: Whether the disclosure is likely to contribute to an understanding of government operations or activities;
(iii) Whether disclosure of the requested information is likely to contribute to public understanding of the subject of the disclosure; and
(iv) The significance of the contribution the disclosure would make to public understanding of government operations or activities.
(2) If information is to be furnished without charge or at reduced rates, the requester must also establish that disclosure of the information is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. This decision will be based on:
(i) Whether the requester has a commercial interest that would be furthered by the requested disclosure; and, if so,
(ii) Whether the identified commercial interest of the requester is sufficiently large, in comparison with the public interest in disclosure, that disclosure is primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.
(3) The requester must establish eligibility for a waiver of fees or for reduced fees. The denial of a request for waiver of fees may be appealed under subpart C of this part.
§ 1204.13
Denials.
(a) The Board may deny: A request for reduced fees or waiver of fees; a request for a record, either in whole or in part; a request for expeditious processing based on the requester's compelling need; or a request that records be released in a specific electronic format. The denial will be in writing, will state the reasons, and will notify the requester of the right to appeal.
(b) If the Board applies one or more of the exemptions provided under the FOIA to deny access to some or all of the information requested, it will respond in writing, identifying for the requester the specific exemption(s), providing an explanation as to why the exemption(s) to withhold the requested information must be applied, and providing an estimate of the amount of material that has been denied to the requester, unless providing such an estimate would harm an interest protected by the exemptions.
(c) The amount of information deleted will be indicated on the released portion of the record at the place in the record where the deletion is made, if technically feasible and unless the indication would harm an interest protected by the exemption under which the deletion is made.
§ 1204.14
Requests for access to confidential commercial information.
(a)
General.
Confidential commercial information provided to the Board by a business submitter will not be disclosed in response to a FOIA request except as required by this section.
(b)
Definitions.
(1) The term
confidential commercial information
means records provided to the government by a submitter that are believed to contain material exempt from release under Exemption 4 of the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4), because disclosure could reasonably be expected to cause substantial competitive harm.
(2) The term
submitter
means any person or organization that provides confidential commercial information to the government. The term
submitter
includes, but is not limited to, corporations, state governments, and foreign governments.
(c)
Notice to business submitters.
The Board will provide a business submitter with prompt written notice of a request for its confidential commercial information whenever such written notice is required under paragraph (d) of this section. Exceptions to such written notice are at paragraph (h) of this section. This written notice will either describe the exact nature of the confidential information requested or provide copies of the records or parts of records containing the commercial information.
(d)
When initial notice is required.
(1) With respect to confidential commercial information received by the Board before January 1, 1988, the Board will give the business submitter notice of a request whenever:
(i) The information is less than 10 years old; or
(ii) The Board has reason to believe that releasing the information could reasonably be expected to cause substantial competitive harm.
(2) With respect to confidential commercial information received by the Board on or after January 1, 1988, the Board will give notice to the business submitter whenever:
(i) The business submitter has designated the information in good faith as commercially or financially sensitive information; or
(ii) The Board has reason to believe that releasing the information could reasonably be expected to cause substantial competitive harm.
(3) Notice of a request for commercially confidential information that was received by January 1, 1988, is required for a period of not more than 10 years after the date on which the information is submitted unless the business submitter requests, and provides justification for, a longer specific notice period. Whenever possible, the submitter's claim of confidentially must be supported by a statement or certification, by an officer or authorized representative of the company, that the information in question is confidential commercial information and has not been disclosed to the public.
(e)
Opportunity to object to disclosure.
Through the notice described in paragraph (c) of this section, the Board will give a business submitter a reasonable period to provide a detailed statement of any objection to disclosure. The statement must specify all grounds for withholding any of the information under any exemption of the Freedom of Information Act. In addition, in the case of Exemption 4, the statement must state why the information is considered to be a trade secret, or to be commercial or financial information that is privileged or confidential. Information a business submitter provides under this paragraph may itself be subject to disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act.
(f)
Notice of intent to release information.
The Board will consider carefully a business submitter's objections and specific grounds for claiming that the information should not be released before determining whether to release confidential commercial information. Whenever the Board decides to release confidential commercial information over the objection of a business submitter, it will forward to the business submitter a written notice that includes:
(1) A statement of the reasons for which the business submitter's objections to the release were not sufficient;
(2) A description of the confidential commercial information to be released; and
(3)
A specified release date.
The Board will forward the notice of intent to release the information a reasonable number of days, as circumstances permit, before the specified date upon which release is expected. It will forward a copy of the release notice to the requester at the same time.
(g)
Notice of Freedom of Information Act lawsuit.
Whenever a requester files a lawsuit seeking to require release of business information covered by paragraph (d) of this section, the Board will notify the business submitter promptly.
(h)
Exceptions to notice requirements.
The notice requirements of this section do not apply when:
(1) The Board decides that the information should not be released;
(2) The information lawfully has been published or otherwise made available to the public;
(3) Disclosure of the information is required by law (other than 5 U.S.C. 552); or
(4) The disclosure is required by an agency rule that:
(i) Was adopted after notice and public comment;
(ii) Specifies narrow classes of records submitted to the agency that are to be released under the FOIA; or
(iii) Provides in exceptional circumstances for notice when the submitter provides written justification, at the time the information is submitted or a reasonable time thereafter, that release of the information could reasonably be expected to cause substantial competitive harm.
(5) The information requested is not designated by the submitter as exempt from release according to agency regulations issued under this section, when the submitter has an opportunity to do so at the time of sending the information or a reasonable time thereafter, unless the agency has good reason to believe that disclosure of the information would result in competitive harm; or
(6) The designation made by the submitter according to Board regulations appears obviously frivolous; except that, in such case, the Board must provide the submitter with written notice of any final administrative release decision within a reasonable period before the stated release date.
§ 1204.15
Records of other agencies.
Requests for Board records that were created by another agency may, in appropriate circumstances, be referred to that agency for discussion or processing. In these instances, the Board will notify the requester.

# Subpart A—General Provisions
§ 1205.1
Purpose.
This subpart implements the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a, (“the Act”) by stating the procedures by which individuals may determine the existence of, seek access to, and request amendment of Board records concerning themselves, and by stating the requirements that apply to Board employees' use and disclosure of those records.
§ 1205.2
Policy and scope.
The Board's policy is to apply these regulations to all records that can be retrieved from a system of records under the Board's control by using an individual's name or by using a number, symbol, or other way to identify the individual. These regulations, however, do not govern the rights of the parties in adversary proceedings before the Board to obtain discovery from adverse parties; those rights are governed by part 1201 and part 1209 of this chapter. These regulations also are not meant to allow the alteration, either before or after the Board has issued a decision on an appeal, of evidence presented during the Board's adjudication of the appeal.
§ 1205.3
Definitions.
The definitions of 5 U.S.C. 552a apply to this part. In addition, as used in this part:

(b)
Request for access

(c)
Request for amendment
means a request by an individual to change the substance of a particular record by addition, deletion, or other correction.
(d)
Requester
means the individual requesting access to or amendment of a record. The individual may be either the person to whom the requested record refers, a legal guardian acting on behalf of the individual, or a representative designated by that individual.
§ 1205.4
Disclosure of Privacy Act records.
(a) Except as provided in 5 U.S.C. 552a(b), the Board will not disclose any personal record information from systems of records it maintains to any individual other than the individual to whom the record refers, or to any other agency, without the express written consent of the individual to whom the record refers, or his or her representative or attorney.
(b) The Board's staff will take necessary steps, in accordance with the law and these regulations, to protect the security and integrity of the records and the personal privacy interests of the subjects of the records.

# Subpart B—Procedures for Obtaining Records
§ 1205.11

Form.
All denials of access under this section will be made in writing and will notify the requester of the right to judicial review.
§ 1205.16
Fees.

§ 1206.8
Providing information to the public.

§ 1206.9
Procedures for expedited closing of meetings.
Instead of following the procedures described in §§ 1206.4 through 1206.8 of this part, and in §§ 1206.11 and 1206.12, the Board may expedite the closing of its meetings under the following conditions by using the following procedures:
(a)
Finding.
(1) Most regular Board business consists of reviewing initial decisions in cases adjudicated after an opportunity for a hearing has been provided. Based on a review of this circumstance, the legislative history of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (Pub. L. 95-454), the Government in the Sunshine Act (5 U.S.C. 552b), and the Board's regulations at 5 CFR part 1201, the Board finds that a majority of its meetings may properly be closed to the public under 5 U.S.C. 552b(c)(10) and 552b(d)(4).
(2) Absent a compelling public interest to the contrary, meetings or portions of meetings that can be expected to be closed under these procedures include meetings held to consider the following: Petitions for review or cases that have been or may be reopened under 5 CFR 1201.114 through 1201.117; proposals to take action against administrative law judges under 5 CFR 1201.131 through 1201.136; and actions brought by the Special Counsel under 5 CFR 1201.129.
(b)
Announcement.
The Board will announce publicly, at the earliest practicable time, the time, place, and subject matter of meetings or portions of meetings that are closed under this provision.
(c)
Procedure for closing meetings under this section.
At the beginning of a meeting or portion of a meeting that is to be closed under this section, the Board may, by recorded vote of two of its members, decide to close the meeting or a portion of it to public observation. The Board may take this action, however, only after it receives a certification by the General Counsel under § 1206.6(b) of this part.
(d)
Record Availability.
When the Board has closed a meeting or portion of a meeting under this paragraph, it will make the following available as soon as practicable:
(1) A written record reflecting the vote of each participating member of the Board with respect to closing the meeting; and
(2) The General Counsel certification under § 1206.6(b).

# Subpart C—Conduct of Meetings
§ 1206.11
Meeting place.
The Board will hold open meetings in meeting rooms designated in the public announcements of those meetings. Whenever the number of observers is greater than can be accommodated in the designated meeting room, however, it will make alternative facilities available to the extent possible.
§ 1206.12
Role of observers.
The public may attend open meetings for the sole purpose of observation. Observers may not participate in the meetings unless they are expressly invited to do so. They also may not create distractions that interfere with the conduct and disposition of Board business, and they may be asked to leave if they do so. Observers of meetings that are partially closed must leave the meeting room when they are asked to do so.

(c) The exclusion of nondisabled persons from the benefits of a program
limited by Federal statute or Executive order to individuals with disabilities or the exclusion of a specific class of individuals with disabilities from a program limited by Federal statute or Executive order to a different class of individuals with disabilities is not prohibited by this part.

[Reserved]

No qualified individual with a disability shall, on the basis of such disability, be subject to discrimination in employment under any program or activity conducted by the agency. The definitions, requirements, and procedures of section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 791), as established by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 29 CFR part 1614, shall apply to employment in federally conducted programs or activities.
§§ 1207.131-1207.139
[Reserved]
§ 1207.140
Program accessibility: Discrimination prohibited.
Except as otherwise provided in § 1207.150, no qualified individual with disabilities shall, because the agency's facilities are inaccessible to or unusable by individuals with disabilities, be denied the benefits of, be excluded from participation in, or otherwise be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity conducted by the agency.
§§ 1207.141-1207.149
[Reserved]
§ 1207.150
Program accessibility: Existing facilities.
(a)
General.
The agency shall operate each program or activity so that the program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities. This paragraph does not—
(1) Necessarily require the agency to make each of its existing facilities accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities;
(2) In the case of historic preservation programs, require the agency to take any action that would result in a substantial impairment of significant historic features of an historic property; or
(3) Require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 1207.150(a) would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that individuals with disabilities receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.
(b)
Methods
—(1)
General.
The agency may comply with the requirements of this section through such means as redesign of equipment, reassignment of services to accessible buildings, assignment of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of services at alternate accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities and construction of new facilities, use of accessible rolling stock, or any other methods that result in making its programs or activities readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities. The agency is not required to make structural changes in existing facilities where other methods are effective in achieving compliance with this section. The agency, in making alterations to existing buildings, shall meet accessibility requirements to the extent compelled by the Architectural Barriers Act of
1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), and any regulations implementing it. In choosing among available methods for meeting the requirements of this section, the agency shall give priority to those methods that offer programs and activities to qualified individuals with disabilities in the most integrated setting appropriate.
(2)
Historic preservation programs.
In meeting the requirements of § 1207.150(a) in historic preservation programs, the agency shall give priority to methods that provide physical access to individuals with disabilities. In cases where a physical alteration to an historic property is not required because of § 1207.150(a)(2) or (3), alternative methods of achieving program accessibility include—
(i) Using audio-visual materials and devices to depict those portions of an historic property that cannot otherwise be made accessible;
(ii) Assigning persons to guide individuals with disabilities into or through portions of historic properties that cannot otherwise be made accessible; or
(iii) Adopting other innovative methods.
§ 1207.151
Program accessibility: New construction and alterations.
Each building or part of a building that is constructed or altered by, on behalf of, or for the use of the agency shall be designed, constructed, or altered so as to be readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities. The definitions, requirements, and standards of the Architectural Barriers Act (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), as established in 41 CFR 101-19.600 to 101-19.607, apply to buildings covered by this section.
§§ 1207.152-1207.159
[Reserved]
§ 1207.160
Communications.
(a) The agency shall take appropriate steps to ensure effective communication with applicants, participants, personnel of other Federal entities, and members of the public.
(1) The agency shall furnish appropriate auxiliary aids where necessary to afford an individual with a disability an equal opportunity to participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a program or activity conducted by the agency.
(i) In determining what type of auxiliary aid is necessary, the agency shall give primary consideration to the requests of the individual with a disability.
(ii) The agency need not provide individually prescribed devices, readers for personal use or study, or other devices of a personal nature.
(2) Where the agency communicates with parties by telephone, telecommunication devices for deaf persons or equally effective telecommunication systems shall be used to communicate with persons with impaired hearing.
(b) The agency shall ensure that interested persons, including persons with impaired vision or hearing, can obtain information as to the existence and location of accessible services, activities, and facilities.
(c) The agency shall provide signage at a primary entrance to each of its inaccessible facilities, directing users to a location at which they can obtain information about accessible facilities. The international symbol for accessibility shall be used at each primary entrance of an accessible facility.
(d) This section does not require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 1207.160 would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action required to comply with this section would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action
that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum extent possible, individuals with disabilities receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.

The petition for review, cross petition for review or response to the petition or cross petition must be clearly marked “5 CFR part 1207 allegation of discrimination in the adjudication of a Board case.”

Any person who believes that any specific class of persons has been subjected to discrimination prohibited by this part and who is a member of that class or the authorized representative of a member of that class may file a complaint. A charge on behalf of a person or member of a class of persons claiming to be aggrieved may be made by any person, agency or organization.
(2)
Where and when to file.
Complaints shall be filed with the Director, Office of Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO Director), Merit Systems Protection Board, 1615 M Street, NW., Washington DC 20419, or e-mailed to
equalopportunity@mspb.gov
, within thirty-five (35) calendar days of the alleged act of discrimination. A complaint filed by personal delivery is considered filed on the date it is received by the EEO Director. The date of filing by facsimile or e-mail is the date the facsimile or e-mail is sent. The date of filing by mail is determined by the postmark date; if no legible postmark date appears on the mailing, the submission is presumed to have been mailed five days (excluding days on which the Board is closed for business) before its receipt. The date of filing by commercial overnight delivery is the date the
document was delivered to the commercial overnight delivery service. The agency shall extend the time period for filing a complaint upon a showing of good cause. For example, the agency shall extend this time limit if a complainant shows that he or she was prevented by circumstances beyond his or her control from submitting the matter within the time limits.
(3)
Acceptance of complaint.
(i) The agency shall accept a complete complaint that is filed in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section and over which it has jurisdiction. The EEO Director shall notify the complainant of receipt and acceptance of the complaint.
(ii) If the EEO Director receives a complaint that is not complete, he or she shall notify the complainant that additional information is needed. If the complainant fails to complete the complaint and return it to the EEO Director within 15 days of his or her receipt of the request for additional information, the EEO Director shall dismiss the complaint with prejudice and shall so inform the complainant.
(4) Within 60 days of the receipt of a complete complaint for which it has jurisdiction, the EEO Director shall notify the complainant of the results of the investigation in an initial decision containing—
(i) Findings of fact and conclusions of law;
(ii) When applicable, a description of a remedy for each violation found; and
(iii) A notice of the right to appeal.
(5) Any appeal of the EEO Director's initial decision must be filed with the Chairman of the Board, Merit Systems Protection Board, 1615 M Street, NW., Washington, DC 20419 by the complainant within 35 days of the date the EEO Director issues the decision required by § 1207.170(c)(4). The agency may extend this time for good cause when a complainant shows that circumstances beyond his or her control prevented the filing of an appeal within the prescribed time limit. An appeal filed by personal delivery is considered filed on the date it is received by the Chairman. The date of filing by facsimile is the date of the facsimile. The date of filing by mail is determined by the postmark date; if no legible postmark date appears on the mailing, the submission is presumed to have been mailed five days (excluding days on which the Board is closed for business) before its receipt. The date of filing by commercial overnight delivery is the date the document was delivered to the commercial overnight delivery service. The appeal should be clearly marked “Appeal of Section 504 Decision” and must contain specific objections explaining why the person believes the initial decision was factually or legally wrong. A copy of the initial decision being appealed should be attached to the appeal letter.
(6) A timely appeal shall be decided by the Chairman unless the Chairman determines, in his or her discretion, that the appeal raises policy issues and that the nature of those policy issues warrants a decision by the full Board. The full Board shall then decide such appeals.
(7) The Chairman shall notify the complainant of the results of the appeal within sixty (60) days of the receipt of the request. If the Chairman determines that he or she needs additional information from the complainant, he or she shall have sixty (60) days from the date he or she receives the additional information to make his or her determination on the appeal.
(8) The time limit stated in paragraph (c)(2) may be extended by the EEO Director to a period of up to 180 days, and may be extended further with the permission of the Assistant Attorney General. The time limit stated in paragraph (c)(5) may be extended by the Chairman to a period of up to 180 days, and may be extended further with the permission of the Assistant Attorney General.
(9) The agency may delegate its authority for conducting complaint investigations to other Federal agencies, except that the authority for making the final determination may not be delegated to another agency.
(d) The agency shall notify the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board upon receipt of any complaint alleging that a building or facility that is subject to the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as amended
(42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), is not readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities.
(e) If the agency receives a complaint over which it does not have jurisdiction, it shall promptly notify the complainant and shall make reasonable efforts to refer the complaint to the appropriate entity.

# Subpart A—Jurisdiction and Definitions
§ 1208.1
Scope.
This part governs appeals filed with the Board under the provisions of 38 U.S.C. 4324, as enacted by the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 (USERRA), Public Law 103-353, as amended, or under the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 3330a, as enacted by the Veterans Employment Opportunities Act of 1998 (VEOA), Public Law 105-339. With respect to USERRA appeals, this part applies to any appeal filed with the Board on or after October 13, 1994, without regard as to whether the alleged violation occurred before, on, or after October 13, 1994. With respect to VEOA appeals, this part applies to any appeal filed with the Board which alleges that a violation occurred on or after October 31, 1998.
§ 1208.2
Jurisdiction.
(a)
USERRA.
Under 38 U.S.C. 4324, a person entitled to the rights and benefits provided by chapter 43 of title 38, United States Code, may file an appeal with the Board alleging that a Federal agency employer or the Office of Personnel Management has failed or refused, or is about to fail or refuse, to comply with a provision of that chapter (other than a provision relating to benefits under the Thrift Savings Plan for Federal employees). In general, the provisions of chapter 43 of title 38 that apply to Federal employees guarantee various reemployment rights following a period of service in a uniformed service, provided the employee satisfies the requirements for coverage under that chapter. In addition, chapter 43 of title 38 prohibits discrimination based on a person's service—or application or obligation for service—in a uniformed service (38 U.S.C. 4311). This prohibition applies with respect to initial employment, reemployment, retention in employment, promotion, or any benefit of employment.
(b)
VEOA.
Under 5 U.S.C. 3330a, a preference eligible who alleges that a Federal agency has violated his rights under any statute or regulation relating to veterans' preference may file an appeal with the Board, provided that
he has satisfied the statutory requirements for first filing a complaint with the Secretary of Labor and allowing the Secretary at least 60 days to attempt to resolve the complaint.
§ 1208.3
Application of 5 CFR part 1201.
Except as expressly provided in this part, the Board will apply subparts A (Jurisdiction and Definitions), B (Procedures for Appellate Cases), C (Petitions for Review of Initial Decisions), and F (Enforcement of Final Decisions and Orders) of 5 CFR part 1201 to appeals governed by this part. The Board will apply the provisions of subpart H (Attorney Fees (Plus Costs, Expert Witness Fees, and Litigation Expenses, Where Applicable) and Damages (Consequential, Liquidated, and Compensatory)) of 5 CFR part 1201 regarding awards of attorney fees and liquidated damages to appeals governed by this part.
[77 FR 62373, Oct. 12, 2012]
§ 1208.4
Definitions.
(a)
Appeal.
“Appeal” means a request for review of an agency action (the same meaning as in 5 CFR § 1201.4(f)) and includes a “complaint” or “action” as those terms are used in USERRA (38 U.S.C. 4324) and a “complaint” or “appeal” as those terms are used in VEOA (5 U.S.C. 3330a).
(b)
Preference eligible.
“Preference eligible” is defined in 5 U.S.C. 2108.
(c)
USERRA appeal.
“USERRA appeal” means an appeal filed under 38 U.S.C. 4324, as enacted by the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 (Public Law 103-353), as amended. The term includes an appeal that alleges a violation of a predecessor statutory provision of chapter 43 of title 38, United States Code.
(d)
VEOA appeal.
“VEOA appeal” means an appeal filed under 5 U.S.C. 3330a, as enacted by the Veterans Employment Opportunities Act of 1998 (Public Law 105-339).

# Subpart B—USERRA Appeals
§ 1208.11
Choice of procedure under USERRA; exhaustion requirement.
(a)
Choice of procedure.
An appellant may file a USERRA appeal directly with the Board under this subpart
or
may file a complaint with the Secretary of Labor under 38 U.S.C. 4322.
(b)
Exhaustion requirement.
If an appellant files a complaint with the Secretary of Labor under 38 U.S.C. 4322, the appellant may not file a USERRA appeal with the Board until the Secretary notifies the appellant in accordance with 38 U.S.C. 4322(e) that the Secretary's efforts have not resolved the complaint. An appellant who seeks assistance from the Secretary of Labor under 38 U.S.C. 4321 but does not file a complaint with the Secretary under 38 U.S.C. 4322 is not subject to the exhaustion requirement of this paragraph.
(c)
Appeals after exhaustion of Department of Labor procedure.
When an appellant receives notice from the Secretary of Labor in accordance with 38 U.S.C. 4322(e) that the Secretary's efforts have not resolved the complaint, the appellant may file a USERRA appeal directly with the Board or may ask the Secretary to refer the complaint to the Special Counsel. If the Special Counsel agrees to represent the appellant, the Special Counsel may file a USERRA appeal directly with the Board. If the Special Counsel does not agree to represent the appellant, the appellant may file a USERRA appeal directly with the Board.
[65 FR 5412, Feb. 4, 2000, as amended at 65 FR 49896, Aug. 16, 2000]
§ 1208.12
Time of filing.
Under chapter 43 of title 38, United States Code, there is no time limit for filing a USERRA appeal with the Board. However, the Board encourages appellants to file a USERRA appeal as soon as possible after the date of the alleged violation or, if a complaint is filed with the Secretary of Labor, as soon as possible after receiving notice from the Secretary in accordance with 38 U.S.C. 4322(e) that the Secretary's efforts have not resolved the complaint, or, if the Secretary has referred the complaint to the Special Counsel and the Special Counsel does not agree
to represent the appellant, as soon as possible after receiving the Special Counsel's notice.
[65 FR 5412, Feb. 4, 2000, as amended at 65 FR 49896, Aug. 16, 2000]
§ 1208.13
Content of appeal; request for hearing.
(a)
Content.
A USERRA appeal may be in any format, including letter form, but must contain the following:
(1) The nine (9) items or types of information required in 5 CFR 1201.24(a)(1) through (a)(9);
(2) Evidence or argument that the appellant has performed service in a uniformed service, including the dates of such service (or, where applicable, has applied for or has an obligation to perform such service), and that the appellant otherwise satisfies the requirements for coverage under chapter 43 of title 38, United States Code;
(3) A statement describing in detail the basis for the appeal, that is, the protected right or benefit that was allegedly denied, including reference to the provision(s) of chapter 43 of title 38, United States Code, allegedly violated if possible.
(4) If the appellant filed a complaint with the Secretary of Labor under 38 U.S.C. 4322(a), evidence of notice under 38 U.S.C. 4322(e) that the Secretary's efforts have not resolved the complaint (a copy of the Secretary's notice satisfies this requirement); and
(5) If the appellant's complaint was referred to the Special Counsel and the appellant has received notice that the Special Counsel will not represent the appellant before the Board, evidence of the Special Counsel's notice (a copy of the Special Counsel's notice satisfies this requirement).
(b)
Request for hearing.
An appellant must submit any request for a hearing with the USERRA appeal, or within any other time period the judge sets. A hearing may be provided to the appellant once the Board's jurisdiction over the appeal is established. The judge may also order a hearing if necessary to resolve issues of jurisdiction. The appellant has the burden of proof with respect to issues of jurisdiction (5 CFR 1201.56(a)(2)(i)).
(c)
Electronic filing.
An appeal may be filed electronically by using the Board's e-Appeal site (
https://e-appeal.mspb.gov
) in accordance with § 1201.14 of this chapter.
[65 FR 5412, Feb. 4, 2000, as amended at 65 FR 49896, Aug. 16, 2000; 68 FR 59865, Oct. 20, 2003; 69 FR 57631, Sept. 27, 2004]
§ 1208.14
Representation by Special Counsel.
The Special Counsel may represent an appellant in a USERRA appeal before the Board. A written statement (in any format) that the appellant submitted a written request to the Secretary of Labor that the appellant's complaint under 38 U.S.C. 4322(a) be referred to the Special Counsel for litigation before the Board, and that the Special Counsel has agreed to represent the appellant, will be accepted as the written designation of representative required by 5 CFR 1201.31(a). The designation of representative may be filed by electronic filing, provided the requirements of § 1201.14 of this chapter are satisfied.
[69 FR 57631, Sept. 27, 2004]
§ 1208.15
Remedies.
(a)
Order for compliance.
If the Board determines that a Federal agency employer or the Office of Personnel
Management has not complied with a provision or provisions of chapter 43 of title 38, United States Code (other than a provision relating to benefits under the Thrift Savings Plan for Federal employees), the decision of the Board (either an initial decision of a judge under 5 CFR 1201.111 or a final Board decision under 5 CFR 1201.117) will order the Federal agency employer or the Office of Personnel Management, as applicable, to comply with such provision(s) and to compensate the appellant for any loss of wages or benefits suffered by the appellant because of such lack of compliance. Under 38 U.S.C. 4324(c)(3), any compensation received by the appellant pursuant to the Board's order shall be in addition to any other right or benefit provided for by chapter 43 of title 38, United States Code, and shall not diminish any such right or benefit.
(b)
Attorney fees and expenses.
If the Board issues a decision ordering compliance under paragraph (a) of this section, the Board has discretion to order payment of reasonable attorney fees, expert witness fees, and other litigation expenses under 38 U.S.C. 4324(c)(4). The provisions of subpart H of part 1201 shall govern any proceeding for attorney fees and expenses.
§ 1208.16
Appeals under another law, rule, or regulation.
Nothing in USERRA prevents an appellant who may appeal an agency action to the Board under any other law, rule, or regulation from raising a claim of a USERRA violation in that appeal. The Board will treat such a claim as an affirmative defense that the agency action was not in accordance with law (5 CFR 1201.56(b)(3)).

# Subpart C—VEOA Appeals
§ 1208.21
VEOA exhaustion requirement.
(a)
General rule.
Before an appellant may file a VEOA appeal with the Board, the appellant must first file a complaint under 5 U.S.C. 3330a(a) with the Secretary of Labor within 60 days after the date of the alleged violation. In addition, either the Secretary must have sent the appellant written notification that efforts to resolve the complaint were unsuccessful or, if the Secretary has not issued such notification and at least 60 days have elapsed from the date the complaint was filed, the appellant must have provided written notification to the Secretary of the appellant's intention to file an appeal with the Board.
(b)
Equitable tolling; extension of filing deadline.
In extraordinary circumstances, the appellant's 60-day deadline for filing a complaint with the Secretary is subject to the doctrine of equitable tolling, which permits the Board to extend the deadline where the appellant, despite having diligently pursued his or her rights, was unable to make a timely filing. Examples include cases involving deception or in which the appellant filed a defective pleading during the statutory period.
[77 FR 62373, Oct. 12, 2012]
§ 1208.22
Time of filing.
(a) Unless the Secretary of Labor has notified the appellant that the Secretary's efforts have not resolved the VEOA complaint, a VEOA appeal may not be filed with the Board before the 61st day after the date on which the appellant filed the complaint under 5 U.S.C. 3330a(a) with the Secretary.
(b) If the Secretary of Labor notifies the appellant that the Secretary's efforts have not resolved the VEOA complaint and the appellant elects to appeal to the Board under 5 U.S.C. 3330a(d), the appellant must file the VEOA appeal with the Board within 15 days after the date of receipt of the Secretary's notice. A copy of the Secretary's notice must be submitted with the appeal.
(c)
Equitable tolling; extension of filing deadline.
In extraordinary circumstances, the appellant's 15-day deadline for filing an appeal with the MSPB is subject to the doctrine of equitable tolling, which permits the Board to extend the deadline where the appellant, despite having diligently pursued his or her rights, was unable to make a timely filing. Examples include cases involving deception or in which the appellant filed a defective pleading during the statutory period.
[65 FR 5412, Feb. 4, 2000, as amended at 65 FR 49896, Aug. 16, 2000; 77 FR 62373, Oct. 12, 2012; 78 FR 23458, Apr. 19, 2013]
§ 1208.23
Content of appeal; request for hearing.
(a)
Content.
A VEOA appeal may be in any format, including letter form, but must contain the following:
(1) The nine (9) items or types of information required in 5 CFR 1201.24(a)(1) through (a)(9);
(2) Evidence or argument that the appellant is a preference eligible;
(3) A statement identifying the statute or regulation relating to veterans' preference that was allegedly violated, an explanation of how the provision was violated, and the date of the violation;
(4) Evidence that a complaint under 5 U.S.C. 3330a(a) was filed with the Secretary of Labor, including the date the complaint was filed; and
(5) Evidence identifying the specific veterans' preference claims that the
appellant raised before the Secretary; and
(b)
Request for hearing.
An appellant must submit any request for a hearing with the VEOA appeal, or within any other time period the judge sets. A hearing may be provided to the appellant once the Board's jurisdiction over the appeal is established and it has been determined that the appeal is timely. The judge may also order a hearing if necessary to resolve issues of jurisdiction or timeliness. The appellant has the burden of proof with respect to issues of jurisdiction and timeliness (5 CFR 1201.56(a)(2)(i) and (ii)).
(c)
Electronic filing.
An appeal may be filed electronically by using the Board's e-Appeal site (
https://e-appeal.mspb.gov
) in accordance with § 1201.14 of this chapter.
[65 FR 5412, Feb. 4, 2000, as amended at 65 FR 49896, Aug. 16, 2000; 68 FR 59865, Oct. 20, 2003; 69 FR 57631, Sept. 27, 2004; 77 FR 62373, Oct. 12, 2012]
§ 1208.24
Election to terminate MSPB proceeding.
(a)
Election to terminate.
At any time beginning on the 121st day after an appellant files a VEOA appeal with the Board, if a judicially reviewable Board decision on the appeal has not been issued, the appellant may elect to terminate the Board proceeding as provided under 5 U.S.C. 3330b and file a civil action with an appropriate United States district court. Such election must be in writing, signed, filed with the Board office where the appeal is being processed, and served on the parties. The election is effective immediately on the date of receipt by the Board office where the appeal is being processed. The election may be filed by electronic filing, provided the requirements of § 1201.14 of this chapter are satisfied.
(b)
Termination order.
Following receipt by the Board of an appellant's written election to terminate the Board proceeding, a termination order will be issued to document the termination of the proceeding. The termination order will state that the proceeding was terminated as of the date of receipt of the appellant's written election. Such an order is neither an initial decision under 5 CFR 1201.111 nor a final Board decision and is not subject to a petition for review in accordance with subpart C of part 1201, a petition for enforcement in accordance with subpart F of part 1201, or a petition for judicial review.
[65 FR 5412, Feb. 4, 2000, as amended at 68 FR 59865, Oct. 20, 2003; 69 FR 57631, Sept. 27, 2004]
§ 1208.25
Remedies.
(a)
Order for compliance.
If the Board determines that a Federal agency has violated the appellant's VEOA rights, the decision of the Board (either an initial decision of a judge under 5 CFR 1201.111 or a final Board decision under 5 CFR 1201.117) will order the agency to comply with the statute or regulation violated and to compensate the appellant for any loss of wages or benefits suffered by the appellant because of the violation. If the Board determines that the violation was willful, it will order the agency to pay the appellant an amount equal to back pay as liquidated damages.
(b)
Attorney fees and expenses.
If the Board issues a decision ordering compliance under paragraph (a) of this section, the Board will order payment of reasonable attorney fees, expert witness fees, and other litigation expenses. The provisions of subpart H of part 1201 shall govern any proceeding for attorney fees and expenses.
§ 1208.26
Appeals under another law, rule, or regulation.
(a) The VEOA provides that 5 U.S.C. 3330a shall not be construed to prohibit a preference eligible from appealing directly to the Board from any action that is appealable under any other law, rule, or regulation, in lieu of administrative redress under VEOA (5 U.S.C. 3330a(e)(1)). An appellant may not pursue redress for an alleged violation of veterans' preference under VEOA at the same time he pursues redress for such violation under any other law, rule, or regulation (5 U.S.C. 3330a(e)(2)).
(b) An appellant who elects to appeal to the Board under another law, rule, or regulation must comply with the provisions of subparts B and C of 5 CFR part 1201, including the time of filing requirement of 5 CFR 1201.22(b)(1).

# Subpart A—Jurisdiction and Definitions
§ 1209.1
Scope.
This part governs any appeal or stay request filed with the Board by an employee, former employee, or applicant for employment where the appellant alleges that a personnel action defined in 5 U.S.C. 2302(a)(2) was threatened, proposed, taken, or not taken because of the appellant's whistleblowing or other protected activity activities. Included are individual right of action appeals authorized by 5 U.S.C. 1221(a), appeals of otherwise appealable actions allegedly based on the appellant's whistleblowing or other protected activity, and requests for stays of personnel actions allegedly based on whistleblowing or other protected activity.
[78 FR 39546, July 2, 2013]
§ 1209.2
Jurisdiction.
(a)
Generally.
Under 5 U.S.C. 1221(a), an employee, former employee, or applicant for employment may appeal to the Board from agency personnel actions alleged to have been threatened, proposed, taken, or not taken because of the appellant's whistleblowing or other protected activity.
(b)
Appeals authorized.
The Board exercises jurisdiction over:
(1)
Individual right of action (IRA) appeals.
These are authorized by 5 U.S.C. 1221(a) with respect to personnel actions listed in 1209.4(a) of this part that are allegedly threatened, proposed, taken, or not taken because of the appellant's whistleblowing or other protected activity. If the action is not otherwise directly appealable to the Board, the appellant must seek corrective action from the Special Counsel before appealing to the Board.

# Example 1:
An agency gives Employee X a performance evaluation under 5 U.S.C. chapter 43 that rates him as “minimally satisfactory.” Employee X believes that the agency has rated him “minimally satisfactory” because he reported that his supervisor embezzled public funds in violation of Federal law and regulation. Because a performance evaluation is not an otherwise appealable action, Employee X must seek corrective action from the Special Counsel before appealing to the Board or before seeking a stay of the evaluation. If Employee X appeals the evaluation to the Board after the Special Counsel proceeding is terminated or exhausted, his appeal is an IRA appeal.

# Example 2:
As above, an agency gives Employee X a performance evaluation under 5 U.S.C. chapter 43 that rates him as “minimally satisfactory.” Employee X believes that the agency has rated him “minimally satisfactory” because he previously filed a Board appeal of the agency's action suspending him without pay for 15 days. Whether the Board would have jurisdiction to review Employee X's performance rating as an IRA appeal depends on whether his previous Board appeal involved a claim of retaliation for whistleblowing. If it did, the Board could review the performance evaluation in an IRA appeal because the employee has alleged a violation of 5 U.S.C. 2302(b)(9)(A)(i). If the
previous appeal did not involve a claim of retaliation for whistleblowing, there might be a prohibited personnel practice under subsection (b)(9)(A)(ii), but Employee X could not establish jurisdiction over an IRA appeal. Similarly, if Employee X believed that the current performance appraisal was retaliation for his previous protected equal employment opportunity (EEO) activity, there might be a prohibited personnel practice under subsection (b)(9)(A)(ii), but Employee X could not establish jurisdiction over an IRA appeal.

# Example 3:
As above, an agency gives Employee X a performance evaluation under 5 U.S.C. chapter 43 that rates him as “minimally satisfactory.” Employee X believes that the agency has rated him “minimally satisfactory” because he testified on behalf of a co-worker in an EEO proceeding. The Board would have jurisdiction over the performance evaluation in an IRA appeal because the appellant has alleged a violation of 5 U.S.C. 2302(b)(9)(B).

# Example 4:
Citing alleged misconduct, an agency proposes Employee Y's removal. While that removal action is pending, Employee Y files a complaint with OSC alleging that the proposed removal was initiated in retaliation for her having disclosed that an agency official embezzled public funds in violation of Federal law and regulation. OSC subsequently issues a letter notifying Employee Y that it has terminated its investigation of the alleged retaliation with respect to the proposed removal. Employee Y may file an IRA appeal with respect to the proposed removal.
(2)
Otherwise appealable action appeals.
These are appeals to the Board under laws, rules, or regulations other than 5 U.S.C. 1221(a) that include an allegation that the action was based on the appellant's whistleblowing or other protected activity. Otherwise appealable actions are listed in 5 CFR 1201.3(a). An individual who has been subjected to an otherwise appealable action must make an election of remedies as described in 5 U.S.C. 7121(g) and paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section.

# Example 5:
Same as Example 4 above. While the OSC complaint with respect to the proposed removal is pending, the agency effects the removal action. OSC subsequently issues a letter notifying Employee Y that it has terminated its investigation of the alleged retaliation with respect to the proposed removal. With respect to the effected removal, Employee Y can elect to appeal that action directly to the Board or to proceed with a complaint to OSC. If she chooses the latter option, she may file an IRA appeal when OSC has terminated its investigation, but the only issue that will be adjudicated in that appeal is whether she proves that her protected disclosure was a contributing factor in the removal action and, if so, whether the agency can prove by clear and convincing evidence that it would have removed Employee Y in the absence of the protected disclosure. If she instead files a direct appeal, the agency must prove its misconduct charges, nexus, and the reasonableness of the penalty, and Employee Y can raise any affirmative defenses she might have.
(c)
Issues before the Board in IRA appeals.
In an individual right of action appeal, the only merits issues before the Board are those listed in 5 U.S.C. 1221(e),
i.e.
, whether the appellant has demonstrated that whistleblowing or other protected activity was a contributing factor in one or more covered personnel actions and, if so, whether the agency has demonstrated by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same personnel action(s) in the absence of the whistleblowing or other protected activity. The appellant may not raise affirmative defenses, such as claims of discrimination or harmful procedural error. In an IRA appeal that concerns an adverse action under 5 U.S.C. 7512, the agency need not prove its charges, nexus, or the reasonableness of the penalty, as a requirement under 5 U.S.C. 7513(a),
i.e.
, that its action is taken “only for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service.” However, the Board may consider the strength of the agency's evidence in support of its adverse action in determining whether the agency has demonstrated by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same personnel action in the absence of the whistleblowing or other protected activity.
(d)
Elections under 5 U.S.C. 7121(g).
(1) Under 5 U.S.C. 7121(g)(3), an employee who believes he or she was subjected to a covered personnel action in retaliation for whistleblowing or other protected activity “may elect not more than one” of 3 remedies: An appeal to the Board under 5 U.S.C. 7701; a negotiated grievance under 5 U.S.C. 7121(b); or corrective action under subchapters II and III of 5 U.S.C. chapter 12,
i.e.
, a
complaint filed with the Special Counsel (5 U.S.C. 1214), which can be followed by an IRA appeal filed with the Board (5 U.S.C. 1221). Under 5 U.S.C. 7121(g)(4), an election is deemed to have been made based on which of the 3 actions the individual files first.
(2) In the case of an otherwise appealable action as described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, an employee who files a complaint with OSC prior to filing an appeal with the Board has elected corrective action under subchapters II and III of 5 U.S.C. chapter 12,
i.e.
, a complaint filed with OSC, which can be followed by an IRA appeal with the Board. As described in paragraph (c) of this section, the IRA appeal in such a case is limited to resolving the claim(s) of reprisal for whistleblowing or other protected activity.
(e)
Elements and Order of Proof.
Once jurisdiction has been established, the merits of a claim of retaliation for whistleblowing or other protected activity will be adjudicated as follows:
(1) The appellant must establish by preponderant evidence that he or she engaged in whistleblowing or other protected activity and that his or her whistleblowing or other protected activity was a contributing factor in a covered personnel action. An appellant may establish the contributing factor element through circumstantial evidence, such as evidence that the official taking the personnel action knew of the disclosure or protected activity, and that the personnel action occurred within a period of time such that a reasonable person could conclude that the disclosure or protected activity was a contributing factor in the personnel action.
(2) If a finding has been made that a protected disclosure or other protected activity was a contributing factor in one or more covered personnel actions, the Board will order corrective action unless the agency demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same personnel action in the absence of such disclosure or activity.

[78 FR 39547, July 2, 2013]
§ 1209.4
Definitions.
(a)
Personnel action
means, as to individuals and agencies covered by 5 U.S.C. 2302:

(12) Any other significant change in duties, responsibilities, or working conditions.
(b)
Whistleblowing
is the making of a protected disclosure, that is, a formal or informal communication or transmission, but does not include a communication concerning policy decisions that lawfully exercise discretionary authority, unless the employee or applicant providing the disclosure reasonably believes that the disclosure evidences any violation of any law, rule, or regulation, gross mismanagement, a
gross waste of funds, an abuse of authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety. It does not include a disclosure that is specifically prohibited by law or required by Executive order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign affairs, unless such information is disclosed to Congress, the Special Counsel, the Inspector General of an agency, or an employee designated by the head of the agency to receive it.
(c)
Other protected activity
means any of the following:
(1) The exercise of any appeal, complaint, or grievance right granted by any law, rule, or regulation with regard to remedying a violation of 5 U.S.C. 2302(b)(8),

(d)
Contributing factor
means any disclosure that affects an agency's decision to threaten, propose, take, or not take a personnel action with respect to the individual making the disclosure.
(e)
Clear and convincing evidence
is that measure or degree of proof that produces in the mind of the trier of fact a firm belief as to the allegations sought to be established. It is a higher standard than “preponderance of the evidence” as defined in 5 CFR 1201.4(q).
(f)
Reasonable belief.
An employee or applicant may be said to have a reasonable belief when a disinterested observer with knowledge of the essential facts known to and readily ascertainable by the employee or applicant could reasonably conclude that the actions of the Government evidence the violation, mismanagement, waste, abuse, or danger in question.

# Subpart B—Appeals
§ 1209.5
Time of filing.
(a)
General rule.
The appellant must seek corrective action from the Special Counsel before appealing to the Board unless the action being appealed is otherwise appealable directly to the Board and the appellant has elected a direct appeal. (See § 1209.2(d) regarding election of remedies under 5 U.S.C. 7121(g)). Where the appellant has sought corrective action, the time limit for filing an appeal with the Board is governed by 5 U.S.C. 1214(a)(3). Under that section, an appeal must be filed:
(1) No later than 65 days after the date of issuance of the Special Counsel's written notification to the appellant that it was terminating its investigation of the appellant's allegations or, if the appellant shows that the Special Counsel's notification was received more than 5 days after the date of issuance, within 60 days after the date the appellant received the Special Counsel's notification; or,
(2) At any time after the expiration of 120 days, if the Special Counsel has not notified the appellant that it will seek corrective action on the appellant's behalf within 120 days of the date of filing of the request for corrective action.
(b)
Equitable tolling; extension of filing deadline.
The appellant's deadline for filing an individual right of action appeal with the Board after receiving written notification from the Special Counsel that it is terminating its investigation of his or her allegations is subject to the doctrine of equitable tolling, which permits the Board to extend the deadline where the appellant, despite having diligently pursued his or her rights, was unable to make a timely filing. Examples include cases involving deception or in which the appellant filed a defective pleading during the statutory period.
(c)
Appeals after a stay request.
Where an appellant has filed a request for a stay with the Board without first filing an appeal of the action, the appeal must be filed within 30 days after the date the appellant receives the order ruling on the stay request. Failure to timely file the appeal will result in the termination of any stay that has been
granted unless a good reason for the delay is shown.
[55 FR 28592, July 12, 1990, as amended at 59 FR 31110, June 17, 1994; 62 FR 59993, Nov. 6, 1997; 77 FR 62374, Oct. 12, 2012]

(ii) The personnel action was or will be based wholly or in part on the whistleblowing disclosure or other protected activity, as described in § 1209.4(b) of this part.
(6) An appellant who first sought corrective action from the Special Counsel may satisfy the requirements of paragraphs (a)(3) through (a)(5) of this section by filing with the appeal a copy of
Part 2: Reprisal For Whistleblowing
of the complaint form submitted to the Office of Special Counsel (Form OSC-11,
Complaint of Possible Prohibited Personnel Practice or Other Prohibited Activity,
Rev. 8/00), together with a copy of any continuation sheet with answers to Part 2 questions filed with the Office of Special Counsel, and any supplement to Part 2 of the original complaint filed with the Office of Special Counsel or completed by the Office of Special Counsel and furnished to the appellant.
(b)

§ 1209.7
Burden and degree of proof.
(a) Subject to the exception stated in paragraph (b) of this section, in any case involving a prohibited personnel practice described in 5 U.S.C. 2302(b)(8) or (b)(9)(A)(i), (B), (C), or (D), the Board will order appropriate corrective action if the appellant shows by a preponderance of the evidence that the disclosure or other protected activity was a contributing factor in the personnel action that was threatened, proposed, taken, or not taken against the appellant.
(b) However, even where the appellant meets the burden stated in paragraph (a) of this section, the Board will not order corrective action if the agency shows by clear and convincing evidence that it would have threatened, proposed, taken, or not taken the same personnel action in the absence of the disclosure or other protected activity.

An appeal of an action taken pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 713 must be filed no later than 7 days after the effective date of the removal or transfer being appealed. (38 U.S.C. 713(d)(2)(B)). An agency response must be filed within 3 days of the filing of the appeal.
(c)
Timeliness of appeals.
If an appellant does not submit an appeal within 7 days of the effective date of the action it will be dismissed as untimely filed. This deadline cannot be extended for any reason. (38 U.S.C. 713(d)(2)(B)). However, if an appellant establishes that he or she attempted to file an appeal using e-Appeal Online within the 7-day deadline and that the filing was unsuccessful due to a problem with e-Appeal Online, the administrative judge may deem the filing to have been completed on the date it was attempted, provided the appellant took reasonable steps to immediately advise the MSPB of the failed attempt to file the appeal using e-Appeal Online. The 21-day deadline for issuance of a decision will commence on the day such an appeal was deemed to have been filed.
(d)
Time limits for other appeals not brought under 38 U.S.C. 713.
The time limit prescribed by paragraph (b) of this section for filing an appeal does not apply where a law or regulation establishes a different time limit or where there is no applicable time limit.

§ 1210.18
Burden of proof, standard of review, and penalty.
(a)
Agency.
Under 5 U.S.C. 7701(c)(1), and subject to exceptions stated in paragraph (c) of this section, the agency (the Department of Veterans Affairs) bears the burden of proving that an appellant engaged in misconduct, as defined by 38 U.S.C. 713(g)(2), or poor performance, and the Secretary's determination as to such misconduct or poor performance shall be sustained only if the factual reasons for the
charge(s) are supported by a preponderance of the evidence. Proof of misconduct or poor performance shall create a presumption that the Secretary's decision to remove or transfer the appellant was warranted. The appellant may rebut this presumption by establishing that the imposed penalty was unreasonable under the circumstances of the case. The following examples illustrate the application of this rule:

# Example A.
The Secretary determines that the appellant intentionally submitted false data on the agency's provision of medical care and that the misconduct warrants transfer to a General Schedule position. The appellant files an appeal with the Board. Following a hearing, the administrative judge finds that the agency proved its charge by preponderant evidence. The appellant's transfer is presumed to be warranted, absent a showing that such a penalty was unreasonable under the circumstances of the case.

# Example B.
The Secretary determines that the appellant's performance or misconduct warrants removal, but the notice of the decision and the agency's response file do not identify any factual reasons supporting the Secretary's determination. The appellant files an appeal with the Board. The administrative judge may not sustain the removal because the agency, in taking its action, provided no factual reasons in support of its charge(s).

# Example C.
The Secretary determines that the appellant's performance or misconduct warrants removal. The appellant files an appeal with the Board. During the processing of the appeal, the appellant contends that the agency unduly delayed or refused to engage in discovery. If the agency has obstructed the appeal from being adjudicated in a timely fashion, the administrative judge may impose sanctions, up to and including the drawing of adverse inferences or reversing the removal action. Because the administrative judge finds that the agency has not unduly delayed or refused to engage in discovery, he declines to impose sanctions and affirms the removal.

# Example D.
The Secretary decides to remove the appellant based on a charge that the appellant engaged in a minor infraction that occurred outside the workplace. The appellant files an appeal with the Board. Following a hearing, the administrative judge finds that the agency proved its charge and further finds that the appellant established that the penalty of removal was unreasonable under the circumstances of the case. The presumption that the Secretary's decision to remove was warranted is rebutted and the action is reversed.
(b)
Appellant.
The appellant has the burden of proof, by a preponderance of the evidence, concerning:
(1) Issues of jurisdiction;
(2) The timeliness of the appeal; and
(3) Affirmative defenses.
(c)
Affirmative defenses.
Under 5 U.S.C. 7701(c)(2), the Secretary's determination may not be sustained, even where the agency met the evidentiary standard stated in paragraph (a) of this section, if the appellant shows that:
(1) The agency, in rendering its determination, committed harmful error in the application of its procedures;
(2) The decision was based on any prohibited personnel practice described in 5 U.S.C. 2302(b); or
(3) The determination is not otherwise in accordance with law.
(d)
Penalty review.
As set forth in paragraph (a) of this section, proof of the agency's charge(s) by preponderant evidence creates a presumption that the Secretary's decision to remove or transfer the appellant was warranted. An appellant may rebut this presumption by establishing that the imposed penalty was unreasonable under the circumstances of the case, in which case the action is reversed. However, the administrative judge may not mitigate the Secretary's decision to remove or transfer the appellant.

(b) Pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 713(e)(2), a decision by the administrative judge is not subject to further appeal.
(c) A decision by the administrative judge is nonprecedential. Such a decision may be cited as persuasive authority only in an appeal filed pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 713(e)(2). Such a decision may not be cited in any appeal not filed pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 713(e)(2).

§ 1215.28
Administrative offset.
(a) The MSPB may collect debts owed by administrative offset if:
(1) The debt is certain in amount;
(2) Efforts to obtain direct payment have been, or would most likely be unsuccessful, or the MSPB and the debtor agree to the offset;
(3) Offset is cost effective or has significant deterrent value; and
(4) Offset is best suited to further and protect the Government's interest.
(b) The MSPB may offset a debt owed to another Federal agency from amounts due or payable by the MSPB to the debtor or request another Federal agency to offset a debt owed to the MSPB;
(c) Prior to initiating administrative offset, the MSPB will send the debtor written notice of the following:
(1) The nature and amount of the debt and the agency's intention to collect the debt by offset 30 days from the date the notice was mailed if neither payment nor a satisfactory response is received by that date;
(2) The debtor's right to an opportunity to submit a good faith alternative repayment schedule to inspect and copy agency records pertaining to the debt, to request a review of the determination of indebtedness; and to enter into a written agreement to repay the debt; and
(3) The applicable interest.
(d) The MSPB may effect an administrative offset against a payment to be made to a debtor prior to the completion of the procedures required by paragraph (c) of this section if:
(1) Failure of offset would substantially prejudice the Government's ability to collect the debt; and
(2) The time before the payment is to be made does not reasonably permit completion of those procedures.
§ 1215.29
Use of credit reporting agencies.
(a) The MSPB may report delinquent accounts to credit reporting agencies consistent with the notice requirements contained in the § 1215.26. Individual debtors must be given at least 60 days written notice that the debt is overdue and will be reported to a credit reporting agency.
(b) Debts may be reported to consumer or commercial reporting agencies. Consumer reporting agencies are defined in 31 U.S.C. 3701(a)(3) pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(b)(12) and 31 U.S.C. 3711(f). The MSPB may disclose only an individual's name, address, Social Security number, and the nature, amount, status and history of the debt and the program under which the claim arose.
§ 1215.30
Collection services.
(a) The MSPB may contract for collection services to recover outstanding debts. The MSPB may refer delinquent debts to private collection agencies listed on the schedule compiled by the General Services Administration. In such contracts, the MSPB will retain the authority to resolve disputes, compromise claims, terminate or suspend collection, and refer the matter to the Department of Justice or the General Accounting Office.
(b) The contractor shall be subject to the disclosure provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended (5 U.S.C. 552a(m)), and to applicable Federal and state laws and regulations pertaining to debt collection practices, including the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, 15 U.S.C. 1692. The contractor shall be strictly accountable for all amounts collected.
(c) The contractor shall be required to provide to the MSPB any data contained in its files relating to the debt account upon agency request or upon returning an account to the MSPB for referral to the Department of Justice for litigation.
§ 1215.31
Referral to the Department of Justice or the General Accounting Office.
Debts over $600 but less than $100,000 which the MSPB determines can neither be collected nor otherwise disposed of will be referred for litigation to the United States Attorney in whose judicial district the debtor is located. Claims for amounts exceeding $100,000 shall be referred for litigation to the Commercial Litigation Branch, Civil Division of the Department of Justice.
§ 1215.32
Compromise, suspension and termination.
(a) The Chairman of the MSPB or his designee may compromise, suspend or terminate the collection of debts where the outstanding principal is not greater than $20,000. MSPB procedures for writing off outstanding accounts are available to the public.
(b) The Chairman of the MSPB may compromise, suspend or terminate collection of debts where the outstanding principal is greater than $20,000 only with the approval of, or by referral to the United States Attorney or the Department of Justice.
(c) The Chairman of the MSPB will refer to the General Accounting Office (GAO) debts arising from GAO audit exceptions.
§ 1215.33
Omissions not a defense.
Failure to comply with any provisions of this rule may not serve as a defense to any debtor.

General prohibition.
No employee may produce official records and information or provide any testimony relating to official information in response to a demand or request without the prior, written approval of the General Counsel.
§ 1216.202
Factors the MSPB will consider.
The General Counsel, in his or her sole discretion, may grant an employee permission to testify on matters relating to official information, or produce official records and information, in response to a demand or request. Among the relevant factors that the General Counsel may consider in making this decision are whether:
(a) The purposes of this part are met;
(b) Allowing such testimony or production of records would be necessary to prevent a miscarriage of justice;
(c) Allowing such testimony or production of records would assist or hinder the MSPB in performing its statutory duties;
(d) Allowing such testimony or production of records would be in the best interest of the MSPB or the United States;
(e) The records or testimony can be obtained from other sources;
(f) The demand or request is unduly burdensome or otherwise inappropriate under the applicable rules of discovery or the rule of procedure governing the case or mater in which the demand or request arose;

(j) Disclosure would result in the MSPB appearing to favor one litigant over another;
(k) Whether the request was served before the demand;

(a) The request must be in writing and must be submitted to the Clerk of the Board who will immediately forward the request to the General Counsel.
(b) The written request must contain the following information:
(1) The caption of the legal proceeding, docket number, and name and address of the court or other authority involved;
(2) A copy of the complaint or equivalent document setting forth the assertions in the case and any other pleading or document necessary to show relevance;
(3) A list of categories of records sought, a detailed description of how the information sought is relevant to the issues in the legal proceeding, and a specific description of the substance of the testimony or records sought;
(4) A statement as to how the need for the information outweighs any need to maintain the confidentiality of the information and outweighs the burden on the MSPB to produce the records or provide testimony;
(5) A statement indicating that the information sought is not available from another source, from other persons or entities, or from the testimony of someone other than an MSPB employee, such as a retained expert;
(6) If testimony is requested, the intended use of the testimony, and a showing that no document could be provided and used in lieu of testimony;

(c) The MSPB reserves the right to require additional information to complete the request where appropriate.
(d) The request should be submitted at least 30 days before the date that records or testimony is required. Requests submitted in less than 30 days before records or testimony is required must be accompanied by a written explanation stating the reasons for the late request and the reasons for expedited processing.
(e) Failure to cooperate in good faith to enable the General Counsel to make an informed decision may serve as the basis for a determination not to comply with the request.
(f) The request should state that the requester will provide a copy of the MSPB employee's statement free of charge and that the requester will permit the MSPB to have a representative present during the employee's testimony.
§ 1216.204
Service of requests or demands.
Requests or demands for official records or information or testimony under this subpart must be served on the Clerk of the Board, U.S. Merit Systems Protection Board, 1615 M Street, NW., Washington, DC 20419-0002 by mail, fax, or e-mail and clearly marked “Part 1216 Request for Testimony or Official Records in Legal Proceedings.” The request or demand will be immediately forwarded to the General Counsel for processing.
§ 1216.205
Processing requests or demands.
(a) After receiving service of a request or demand for testimony, the
General Counsel will review the request and, in accordance with the provisions of this subpart, determine whether, or under what conditions, to authorize the employee to testify on matters relating to official information and/or produce official records and information.
(b) Absent exigent circumstances, the MSPB will issue a determination within 30 days from the date the request is received.
(c) The General Counsel may grant a waiver of any procedure described by this subpart where a waiver is considered necessary to promote a significant interest of the MSPB or the United States, or for other good cause.
(d)
Certification (authentication) of copies of records.
The MSPB may certify that records are true copies in order to facilitate their use as evidence. If a requester seeks certification, the requester must request certified copies from the MSPB at least 30 days before the date they will be needed. The request should be sent to the Clerk of the Board.
§ 1216.206
Final determination.
The General Counsel makes the final determination on demands to requests to employees for production of official records and information or testimony in litigation in which the MSPB is not a party. All final determinations are within the sole discretion of the General Counsel. The General Counsel will notify the requester and, when appropriate, the court of other competent authority of the final determination, the reasons for the grant or denial of the request, and any conditions that the General Counsel may impose on the release of records or information, or on the testimony of an MSPB employee. The General Counsel's decision exhausts administrative remedies for discovery of the information.
§ 1216.207
Restrictions that apply to testimony.
(a) The General Counsel may impose conditions or restrictions on the testimony of MSPB employees including, for example:
(1) Limiting the areas of testimony;

(b) The MSPB may offer the employee's written declaration in lieu of testimony.
(c) If authorized to testify pursuant to this part, an employee may testify as to facts within his or her personal knowledge, but, unless specifically authorized to do so by the General Counsel, the employee shall not;
(1) Disclose confidential or privileged information; or
(2) For a current MSPB employee, testify as an expert or opinion witness with regard to any matter arising out of the employee's official duties or the functions of the MSPB unless testimony is being given on behalf of the United States (see also 5 CFR 2635.805).
(d) The scheduling of an employee's testimony, including the amount of time that the employee will be made available for testimony, will be subject to the MSPB's approval.
§ 1216.208
Restrictions that apply to released records.
(a) The General Counsel may impose conditions or restrictions on the release of official records and information, including the requirement that parties to the proceeding obtain a protective order or execute a confidentiality agreement to limit access and any further disclosure. The terms of the protective order or of a confidentiality agreement must be acceptable to the General Counsel. In cases where protective orders or confidentiality agreements have already been executed, the MSPB may condition the release of official records and information on an amendment to the existing protective order or confidentiality agreement.
(b) If the General Counsel so determines, original MSPB records may be presented for examination in response to a request, but they may not be presented as evidence or otherwise used in a manner by which they could lose
their identity as official MSPB records, nor may they be marked or altered. In lieu of the original records, certified copies may be presented for evidentiary purposes.
§ 1216.209
Procedure when a decision is not made prior to the time a response is required.
If a response to a demand or request is required before the General Counsel can make the determination referred to in § 1216.206, the General Counsel, when necessary, will provide the court or other competent authority with a copy of this part, inform the court or other competent authority that the request is being reviewed, provide an estimate as to when a decision will be made, and seek a stay of the demand or request pending a final determination.
§ 1216.210
Procedure in the event of an adverse ruling.
If the court or other competent authority fails to stay a demand or request, the employee upon whom the demand or request is made, unless otherwise advised by the General Counsel, will appear, if necessary, at the stated time and place, produce a copy of this part, state that the employee has been advised by counsel not to provide the requested testimony or produce documents, and respectfully decline to comply with the demand or request, citing
United States ex rel. Touchy
v.
Ragen,
340 U.S. 462 (1951).

# Subpart C—Schedule of Fees
§ 1216.301
Fees.
(a)
Generally.
The General Counsel may condition the production of records or appearance for testimony upon advance payment of a reasonable estimate of the costs to the MSPB.
(b)
Fees for records.
Fees for producing records will include fees for searching, reviewing, and duplicating records, costs of attorney time spent in reviewing the request, and expenses generated by materials and equipment used to search for, produce, and copy the responsive information. Costs for employee time will be calculated on the basis of the hourly pay of the employee (including all pay, allowances, and benefits). Fees for duplication will be the same as those charged by the MSPB in its Freedom of Information Act regulations at 5 CFR part 1204.
(c)
Witness fees.
Fees for attendance by a witness will include fees, expenses, and allowances prescribed by the court's rules. If no such fees are prescribed, witness fees will be determined based upon the rule of the Federal district closest to the location where the witness will appear and on 28 U.S.C. 1821, as applicable. Such fees will include cost of time spent by the witness to prepare for testimony, in travel and for attendance in the legal proceeding, plus travel costs.
(d)
Payment of fees.
A requester must pay witness fees for current MSPB employees and any record certification fees by submitting to the Clerk of the Board a check or money order for the appropriate amount made payable to the Treasury of the United States. In the case of testimony of former MSPB employees, the request must pay applicable fees directly to the former MSPB employee in accordance with 28 U.S.C. 1821 or other applicable statutes.
(e)
Waiver or reduction of fees.
The General Counsel, in his or her sole discretion, may, upon a showing of reasonable cause, waive or reduce any fees in connection with the testimony, production, or certification of records.
(f)
De minimis fees.
Fees will not be assessed if the total charge would be $10.00 or less.

# Subpart D—Penalties
§ 1216.401
Penalties.
(a) An employee who discloses official records or information or gives testimony relating to official information, except as expressly authorized by the MSPB, or as ordered by a Federal court after the MSPB has had the opportunity to be heard, may face the penalties provided in 18 U.S.C. 641 and other applicable laws. Additionally, former MSPB employees are subject to the restrictions and penalties of 18 U.S.C. 207 and 216.
(b) A current MSPB employee who testifies or produces official records and information in violation of this part shall be subject to disciplinary action.

§ 1302.1
General provisions.
(a)
Purpose and scope.
This part implements the rules that the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) follows under the Privacy Act of 1974, codified as amended at 5 U.S.C. 552a (Privacy Act). This part applies to all records in systems of records maintained by OMB that are retrieved by an individual's name or personal identifier. This part describes the procedures by which individuals may request access to records about themselves, request amendment or correction of those records, and request an accounting of disclosures of those records by OMB.
(b)
Definitions.
As used in this part:
Request for access
to a record means a request made under 5 U.S.C. 552a(d)(1).
Request for amendment or correction
of a record means a request made under 5 U.S.C. 552a(d)(2).
Request for an accounting
means a request made under 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3).
Requester
means an individual who makes a request for access, a request for amendment or correction, or a request for an accounting under the Privacy Act. An
individual
is a citizen of the United States or an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence.
System manager
means the OMB official identified in a system of records notice as the manager of a system of records; and for Government-wide systems of records, the individual designated by the agency to act on behalf of the system manager.
(c)
Providing written consent to disclose records protected under the Privacy Act.
OMB may disclose any record contained in a system of records by any means of communication to any person, or to another agency, pursuant to a written request by, or with the prior written consent of, the individual about whom the record pertains. An individual must verify the individual's identity in the same manner as required by § 1302.2(d) when providing written consent to disclose a record protected under the Privacy Act and pertaining to the individual.
§ 1302.2
Requirements for making requests for access.
(a)
How made and addressed.
You may make a Privacy Act request for access to an OMB record by mail or delivery service, to Privacy Officer, Office of Management and Budget, 725 17th Street NW, Room 9204, Washington, DC 20503 or by electronic means as described on OMB's privacy program web page:
www.whitehouse.gov/omb/privacy.
(b)
Description of the records sought.
In making a request for access, you must describe the records that you want in enough detail to enable OMB to locate the system of records containing them with a reasonable amount of effort. Your access request should name the system of records or contain a concise
description of such system of records. OMB publishes notices of OMB systems of records subject to the Privacy Act in the
Federal Register
.
(c)
Information about yourself.
Your access request should also contain sufficient information to identify yourself in order to allow OMB to determine if there is a record pertaining to you in a particular system of records.
(d)
Verification of identity.
To ensure that information about you is disclosed only to you or your authorized representative, you are required to verify your identity when making a Privacy Act request for access, as detailed in paragraphs (d)(1) through (3) of this section. If OMB cannot verify your identity, disclosure will be limited to information that would be required to be made available if requested under 5 U.S.C. 552 by any person.
(1) You must state your name, current address, and date and place of birth and provide either a notarized statement of identity or a signed submission under 28 U.S.C. 1746; or
(2) When available, verify your identity through remote identity-proofing and authentication using digital processes.
(3) OMB may require you to supply additional information as necessary in order to verify your identity.
(e)
Verification of guardianship.
When making a request for access as the parent or guardian of a minor or as the guardian of someone determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be incompetent, for access to records about that individual, you must establish the criteria listed in paragraphs (e)(1) through (4) of this section. If OMB cannot verify your identity, disclosure will be limited to information that would be required to be made available if requested under 5 U.S.C. 552 by any person.
(1) The identity of the individual who is the subject of the record, by stating the name, current address, and date and place of birth;
(2) Your own identity, as required in this paragraph (e);
(3) That you are the parent or guardian of that individual, which you may prove by providing a copy of the individual's birth certificate showing your parentage or by providing a court order establishing your guardianship; and
(4) That you are acting on behalf of that individual in making the request.
(f)
Submit identifying information only using approved OMB processes.
In order to safeguard information you submit in making a request for access for purposes of verifying your identity or verifying guardianship, or any information about yourself that may assist in the rapid identification of the record to which you are requesting access (
e.g.,
prior names, dates of employment, etc.) as well as any other identifying information contained in an OMB system of records, you must use one of OMB's approved processes as described on OMB's privacy program web page. Failure to submit identifying information through an OMB approved process may result in the failure to expunge your information in accordance with approved OMB records schedules after your access request has been processed.
(g)
Subsequent requests for access.
If your request for access follows a prior request under this section, and you already provided appropriate verifications with that prior request, you do not need to include the same verification or identifying information in the subsequent request for access if you reference that prior request or attach a copy of the OMB response to that request.
§ 1302.3
Responsibility for responding to requests.
(a)
Acknowledgment of requests.
OMB will acknowledge your request for access in writing and provide an individualized tracking number. Upon request, OMB will make information available to you about the status of your request using the assigned tracking number.
(b)
Timing of responses to a Privacy Act request for access.
OMB will respond to Privacy Act requests for access to records according to the order in which OMB receives the requests. Consistent with OMB's FOIA procedures at 5 CFR 1303.40(b), OMB may designate multiple processing tracks that distinguish between simple and more complex Privacy Act requests for access, based on the estimated amount of work or time needed to process the request.
(c)
Additional information.
If, after receiving a request, OMB determines that your request does not reasonably describe the records sought, OMB will inform you what additional information is needed and why the request is otherwise insufficient. If a request does not reasonably describe the records sought, OMB's response to the request may be delayed.
(d)
Grant of request for access.
Once OMB makes a determination to grant a request for access, OMB will provide you a written response, which may include the following:
(1) A statement as to whether OMB will grant access by providing a copy of the record through electronic means or the mail; and
(2) The amount of fees charged, if any (see § 1302.7). (Fees are applicable only to requests for duplicates.)
(e)
Adverse determination of request for access.
OMB will notify you of an adverse determination denying a request for access in writing. Adverse determinations, or denials of requests, consist of: A determination to withhold any requested record in whole or in part; a determination that a requested record does not exist or cannot be located; a determination that what has been requested is not a record subject to the Privacy Act; a determination on any disputed fee matter; or a denial of a request for expedited treatment. OMB's notification letter to you will include:
(1) The decision of OMB whether to grant in whole, or deny any part of the request;
(2) The reasons for the determination for any portion of the request that is denied; and
(3) A description of the procedure by which the OMB decision to deny your request may be appealed, including the name and address of the official with whom you may lodge such an appeal.
§ 1302.4
Requests for an accounting.
You may request an accounting of disclosures by the same rules governing requests for access, outlined in § 1302.2.
§ 1302.5
Requests for an amendment or correction.
(a)
Requirement for written requests.
If you want to amend a record that pertains to you in a system of records maintained by OMB, you must submit your request in writing following the procedures established in this section unless the system manager waives the requirements in this section. OMB is not required to amend records that are not subject to the Privacy Act of 1974. However, individuals who believe that such records are inaccurate may bring this to the attention of OMB.
(b)
Procedures.
(1) You should address your request to amend a record in a system of records to the system manager. You should include the name of the system and a brief description of the record proposed for amendment. If the request to amend the record is the result of you gaining access to the record in accordance with the provisions concerning access to records as set forth in § 1302.2, you may attach a copy of previous correspondence between you and OMB instead of providing a separate description of the record.
(2) If a requester cannot determine where within OMB to send the Privacy Act request to amend a record, the requester may send by mail or delivery to Privacy Officer, Office of Management and Budget, 725 17th Street NW, Room 9204, Washington, DC 20503 or by electronic means as described on OMB's privacy program web page:
www.whitehouse.gov/omb/privacy.
OMB will forward the request to the component(s) it believes most likely to have the relevant records. For the quickest possible handling, the requester should specify “Privacy Act Record Amendment Request” on the letter.
(3) You must validate your identity as described in § 1302.2(e). If OMB has previously verified your identity pursuant to § 1302.2(e), further verification of identity is not required as long as the communication does not suggest that a need for verification is present.
(4) You should clearly indicate the exact portion of the record you seek to have amended. If possible, you should also propose alternative language, or at a minimum, identify the facts that you believe are not accurate, relevant,
timely, or complete, with such particularity as to permit OMB not only to understand the basis for your request, but also to make an appropriate amendment to the record.
(5) Your request must also state why you believe your record is not accurate, relevant, timely, or complete. The burden of persuading OMB to amend a record will be upon you. You must furnish sufficient facts to persuade the official in charge of the system of the inaccuracy, irrelevancy, timeliness, or incompleteness of the record.
(6) OMB will not categorically reject incomplete or inaccurate requests. OMB will ask you to clarify the request as needed.
(c)
OMB action on the request.
(1) OMB will acknowledge, in writing, receipt of a request to amend a record within 10 business days (
i.e.,
excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal Federal holidays) of OMB's receipt.
(2) OMB will promptly respond to a Privacy Act request for amendment or correction. OMB ordinarily will respond to Privacy Act requests for amendment or correction according to their order of receipt. Consistent with OMB's FOIA procedures at 5 CFR 1303.40(b), OMB may designate multiple processing tracks that distinguish between simple and more complex Privacy Act requests for amendment or correction, based on the estimated amount of work or time needed to process the request. The response reflecting the decision upon a request for amendment will include the following:
(i) The decision of OMB whether to grant in whole, or deny any part of, the request to amend the record;
(ii) The reasons for the determination for any portion of the request which is denied; and
(iii) A description of the procedure by which the OMB decision to deny your request may be appealed, including the name and address of the official with whom you may lodge such an appeal.
§ 1302.6
Appeals.
(a) If you wish to appeal a decision by OMB with regard to your request to access or amend a record in accordance with the provisions of §§ 1302.2 and 1302.5, you should submit the appeal in writing and, to the extent possible, include the information specified in paragraph (b) of this section.
(b) Your appeal should contain a brief description of the record involved or copies of the correspondence from OMB in which the request to access or to amend was denied and also the reasons why you believe that access should be granted or the information amended, as relevant. Your appeal should refer to the information you furnished in support of your claim and the reasons set forth by OMB in its decision denying access or amendment, as required by §§ 1302.2 and 1302.5. In order to make the appeal process as meaningful as possible, you should set forth your disagreement in an understandable manner. In order to avoid the unnecessary retention of personal information, OMB reserves the right to dispose of the material concerning the request to access or amend a record if OMB receives no appeal in accordance with this section within 180 days of the sending by OMB of its decision upon an initial request. OMB may treat an appeal received after the 180-day period as an initial request to access or amend a record.
(c) You may send your appeal by mail or delivery to the Senior Agency Official for Privacy, Office of Management and Budget, 725 17th Street NW, Room 9204, Washington, DC 20503 or by electronic means as described on OMB's privacy program web page:
www.whitehouse.gov/omb/privacy.
For the quickest possible handling, the requester should specify “Privacy Act Record Appeal” on the letter.
(d) The Senior Agency Official for Privacy will review a refusal to amend a record within 30 business days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal Federal holidays) from the date on which the individual requests such review, unless the OMB Director extends the 30-day period for good cause. If the Senior Agency Official for Privacy's decision does not grant in full the request, the notice of the decision will describe the steps you may take to obtain judicial review of such a decision.
§ 1302.7
Fees.
(a)
Prohibitions against charging fees for Privacy Act requests.
OMB will not charge you for:
(1) The search and review of requests for records subject to this part;
(2) Any copies of the record produced as a necessary part of the process of making the record available for access; or
(3) Any copies of the requested record when OMB determines that the only way you can access the record is by providing a copy to you through the mail.
(b)
Waiver.
OMB may at no charge provide copies of a record if it is determined the production of the copies is in the interest of the Government.
(c)
Fee schedule and method of payment.
OMB will charge fees as provided in paragraphs (c)(1) through (5) of this section except as provided in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.
(1) OMB will duplicate records at a rate of $.10 per page for all copying of 4 pages or more. There is no charge for duplication 3 or fewer pages.
(2) Where OMB anticipates that the fees chargeable under this section will amount to more than $25.00, OMB shall promptly notify you of the amount of the anticipated fee or such portion thereof as can readily be estimated. If the estimated fees will greatly exceed $25.00, OMB may require an advance deposit. OMB's request for an advance deposit shall extend an offer to the requester to consult with OMB personnel in order to reformulate the request in a manner which will reduce the fees, yet still meet the needs of the requester.
(3) You should pay fees in full before the requested copies are issued. If the requester is in arrears for previous requests, OMB will not provide copies for any subsequent request until the arrears have been paid in full.
(4) Remittances shall be in the form either of a personal check or bank draft drawn on a bank in the United States, or a postal money order. Remittances shall be made payable to the order of the Treasury of the United States and mailed or delivered to the Assistant Director for Management and Operations, Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503.
(5) OMB will provide a receipt for fees paid upon request.

# General
§ 1303.1
Purpose.
This part implements the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552,
as amended, and prescribes the rules governing the public availability of Office of Management and Budget (OMB) records. The rules in this subpart should be read in conjunction with the text of the FOIA.
§ 1303.2
Authority and functions.
The general functions of OMB, as provided by statute and by executive order, are to develop and to execute the budget, oversee implementation of Administration policies and programs, advise and assist the President, and develop and implement management policies for the government.
§ 1303.3
Organization.
(a) The central organization of OMB is as follows:
(1) The Director's Office includes the Director, the Deputy Director, the Deputy Director for Management, and the Executive Associate Director.
(2) Staff Offices include General Counsel, Legislative Affairs, Communications, Management and Operations, and Economic Policy.
(3) Offices that provide OMB-wide support include the Legislative Reference Division and the Budget Review Division.
(4) Resource Management Offices, which develop and support the President's management and budget agenda in the areas of Natural Resources, Energy and Science; National Security; Health; Education, Income Maintenance and Labor; and General Government Programs.
(5) Statutory offices include the Office of Federal Financial Management; Office of Federal Procurement Policy; Office of E-government and Information Technology; Made in America Office; and Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs.
(b) OMB is located in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, 17th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue NW, and the New Executive Office Building, 725 17th Street NW, Washington, DC 20503. OMB has no field offices. Security in both buildings prevents visitors from entering the building without an appointment.
[84 FR 22951, May 21, 2019, as amended at 89 FR 48825, June 10, 2024]

# Proactive Disclosures
§ 1303.10
Availability of proactive disclosures.
OMB makes available records that are required by the FOIA to be made available for public inspection in an electronic format. OMB information pertaining to matters issued, adopted, or promulgated by OMB that is within the scope of 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(2) is available electronically on OMB's website at
www.whitehouse.gov/omb/
. Additionally, for help accessing these materials, you may contact OMB's FOIA Officer at (202) 395-3642.

# Requirements for Making Requests
§ 1303.20
Where to send requests.
The FOIA Officer is responsible for acting on all initial requests. Individuals wishing to file a request under the FOIA should address their request in writing to FOIA Officer, Office of Management and Budget, 725 17th Street NW, Room 9272, Washington, DC 20503, via fax to (202) 395-3504, by email at
OMBFOIA@omb.eop.gov,
or the Government-wide FOIA.gov portal. Requesters must provide contact information sufficient to enable OMB to communicate with the requester. Additionally, OMB's FOIA Public Liaison is available to assist requesters who have questions and can be reached at (202) 395-FOIA or in writing at the address provided in this section.
[89 FR 48825, June 10, 2024]
§ 1303.21
Requesters making requests about themselves or on behalf of others.
In order to obtain greater access to records, a requester who is making a request for records about the requester or on behalf of another individual must comply with the verification of identity requirements as determined by OMB pursuant to OMB's requirements for making requests for access in 5 CFR part 1302. OMB may require a requester to supply additional information as necessary in order to verify the identity of the requester or to verify that a particular individual has consented to disclosure.
[89 FR 48825, June 10, 2024]
§ 1303.22
Requirement for providing description of the records sought.
(a) Requesters must describe the records sought in sufficient detail to enable OMB personnel to locate them with a reasonable amount of effort. To the extent possible, requesters should include specific information that may help the agency identify the requested records, such as the date, title or name, author, recipient, subject matter of the record, case number, file designation, or reference number. Before submitting their requests, requesters may contact the FOIA Officer or FOIA Public Liaison to discuss the records they seek and to receive assistance in describing the records.
(b) If, after receiving a request, OMB determines that the request does not reasonably describe the records sought, OMB will inform the requester what additional information is needed and why the request is otherwise insufficient. Requesters who are attempting to reformulate or modify such a request may discuss their request with the FOIA Officer or the FOIA Public Liaison. If a request does not reasonably describe the records sought, OMB's response to the request may be delayed.

# Responsibility for Responding to Requests
§ 1303.30
Responsibility for responding to requests.
(a)
Search cutoff date.
In determining which records are responsive to a request, OMB ordinarily will include only records in its possession as of the date that it begins its search. If any other date is used, OMB will inform the requester of that date.
(b)
Transfer of records to the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA).
Permanent records of OMB which have been transferred to the control of NARA under the Federal Records Act are not in the control of OMB and are therefore not accessible by a FOIA request to OMB. Requests for such records should be directed to NARA.
(c)
Consultation and referral.
When reviewing records, OMB will determine whether another agency of the Federal Government is better able to determine whether the record is exempt from disclosure under the FOIA. As to any such record, OMB will proceed in one of the following ways:
(1)
Consultation.
When records contain information of interest to another agency, OMB typically will consult with that agency prior to making a release determination.
(2)
Referral.
(i) When OMB believes that a different agency is best able to determine whether to disclose the record, OMB will refer the responsibility for responding to the request regarding that record to that agency, will notify the requester, and will inform them of the agency which will be processing the record, including that agency's FOIA contact information. Ordinarily, the agency that originated the record is best situated to make the disclosure determination. However, if OMB and the originating agency jointly agree that OMB is in the best position to respond regarding the record, then OMB may respond to the requester.
(ii) When OMB believes that a different agency is best able to determine whether to disclose the record, but also believes that disclosure of the identity of the different agency could harm an interest protected by an applicable FOIA exemption, such as the exemptions that protect personal privacy or national security interests, OMB will coordinate with the originating agency to seek its views on the disclosability of the record and convey the release determination for the record that is the subject of the coordination to the requester. For example, if a non-law enforcement agency responding to a request for records on a living third party locates within its files records originating with a law enforcement agency, and if the existence of that law enforcement interest in the third party was not publicly known, then to disclose that law enforcement interest could cause an unwarranted invasion of the personal privacy of the third party. Similarly, if an agency locates within its files material originating with an Intelligence Community agency, and the involvement of that agency in the matter is classified and not publicly acknowledged, then to disclose or give attribution to the involvement of that
Intelligence Community agency could cause national security harms.
[84 FR 22951, May 21, 2019, as amended at 89 FR 48825, June 10, 2024]

# Timing of Responses to Requests
§ 1303.40
Timing of responses to requests.
(a)
In general.
Upon receipt of any request for information or records, the FOIA Officer will determine within 20 working days (excepting Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) after the receipt of such request whether it is appropriate to grant the request and will immediately notify the requester of such determination and the reasons therefore and the right of such person to seek assistance from the FOIA Public Liaison. The 20-day period, as used herein, shall commence on the date on which the FOIA Officer or the FOIA Public Liaison first receives the request but in any event not later than 10 working days after the request is first received by any component's office that is designated by these regulations to receive requests. OMB may toll this 20-day period either one time while OMB is awaiting information that it has reasonably requested from the requester or any time when necessary to clarify with the requester issues regarding fee assessment. OMB's receipt of the requester's response to OMB's request for information ends the tolling period.
(b)
Multitrack processing.
(1) FOIA requests are placed on one of three tracks:
(i) Track one covers those requests that seek and receive expedited processing pursuant to subsection (a)(6)(E) of the FOIA and in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section;
(ii) Track two covers simple requests;
(iii) Track three covers complex requests.
(2) Whether a request is simple or complex is based on the amount of work or time needed to process the request. OMB considers various factors, including the number of records requested, the number of pages involved in processing the request, and the need for consultations or referrals. OMB will advise the requester of the processing track in which their request has been placed and provide an opportunity to narrow or modify their request so that the request can be placed in a different processing track.
(c)
Unusual circumstances.
Whenever the statutory time limit for processing a request cannot be met because of “unusual circumstances,” as defined in the FOIA, and OMB extends the time limit on that basis, OMB will, before expiration of the 20-day period to respond, notify the requester in writing of the unusual circumstances involved and of the date by which processing of the request can be expected to be completed. Where the extension exceeds 10 working days, OMB will, as described by the FOIA, provide the requester with an opportunity to modify the request or arrange an alternative time period for processing. OMB will alert requesters to the availability of its FOIA Public Liaison, who will assist in the resolution of any disputes between the requester and OMB, and notify the requester of the right of the requester to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS).
(d)
Aggregating requests.
To satisfy unusual circumstances under the FOIA, OMB may aggregate those requests for the purposes of this section when OMB reasonably believes that a requester, or a group of requesters acting in concert, has submitted requests that constitute a single request, that would otherwise satisfy the unusual circumstances specified in this section. Multiple requests involving unrelated matters will not be aggregated.
(e)
Expedited processing.
(1) Requests and appeals will be given expedited treatment in cases where OMB determines:
(i) The lack of expedited treatment could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual;
(ii) There is an urgency to inform the public about an actual or alleged Federal Government activity;
(iii) Failure to respond to the request expeditiously would result in the loss of due process rights in other proceedings; or
(iv) There are possible questions, in a matter of widespread and exceptional
public interest, about the Government's integrity which affect public confidence.
(2) A request for expedited processing may be made at the time of the initial request for records or at any later time.
(3) A requester who seeks expedited processing must submit a statement, certified to be true and correct to the best of the requester's knowledge and belief, explaining in detail the basis for requesting expedited processing. OMB may waive this certification requirement at its discretion.
(4) OMB will decide whether to grant a request for expedited processing and will notify the requester within 10 calendar days after the date of the request. If a request for expedited treatment is granted, OMB will prioritize the underlying FOIA request, place the request in the processing track for expedited requests, and process the request as soon as practicable. If a request for expedited processing is denied, any appeal of that decision will be acted on expeditiously.
[84 FR 22951, May 21, 2019, as amended at 89 FR 48825, June 10, 2024]

# Responses to Requests
§ 1303.50
Responses to requests.
(a)
Acknowledgments of requests.
OMB will assign an individualized tracking number to each request received that will take longer than ten days to process; and acknowledge each request, informing the requester of their tracking number if applicable; and, upon request, make available information about the status of a request to the requester using the assigned tracking number, including—
(1) The date on which OMB originally received the request; and
(2) An estimated date on which OMB will complete action on the request.
(b)
Grants of requests.
Once OMB makes a determination to grant a request in full or in part, it will notify the requester in writing. OMB also will inform the requester of any fees charged under § 1303.9 and shall provide the requested records to the requester promptly upon payment of any applicable fees. OMB will inform the requester of the availability of the FOIA Public Liaison to offer assistance.
(c)
Adverse determinations of requests.
Adverse determinations, or denials of requests, include decisions that the requested record is exempt, in whole or in part; the request does not reasonably describe the records sought; the information requested is not a record subject to the FOIA; the requested record does not exist, cannot be located, or has been destroyed; or the requested record is not readily reproducible in the form or format sought by the requester. Adverse determinations also include denials involving fees or fee waiver matters or denials of requests for expedited processing. In the case of an adverse determination, the FOIA Officer will immediately notify the requester of—
(1) The right of the requester to appeal to the head of OMB within 90 calendar days after the date of such adverse determination in accordance with § 1303.70;
(2) The right of such person to seek dispute resolution services from the FOIA Public Liaison or the OGIS at NARA;
(3) The names and titles or positions of each person responsible for the denial of such request; and
(4) OMB's estimate of the volume of any requested records OMB is withholding, unless providing such estimate would harm an interest protected by the exemption in 5 U.S.C. 552(b) under which the withholding is being made.
[84 FR 22951, May 21, 2019, as amended at 89 FR 48825, June 10, 2024]

# Confidential Commercial Information
§ 1303.60
Notification procedures for confidential commercial information.
(a)
Definitions.
(1) “Confidential commercial information” means commercial or financial information obtained by OMB from a submitter that may be protected from disclosure under Exemption 4 of the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4).
(2)
Submitter
means any person or entity, including a corporation, State, or foreign government, but not including another Federal Government entity,
that provides confidential commercial information, either directly or indirectly, to the Federal Government.
(b)
Designation of confidential commercial information.
A submitter of confidential commercial information must use good faith efforts to designate by appropriate markings, at the time of submission, any portion of its submission that it considers to be protected from disclosure under Exemption 4 of the FOIA. These designations expire 10 years after the date of the submission unless the submitter requests and provides justification for a longer designation period.
(c)
When notice to submitters is required.
(1) OMB will promptly notify a submitter when OMB determines that a pending FOIA lawsuit seeks to compel the disclosure of records containing the submitter's confidential information, or if OMB determines that it may be required to disclose such records, provided:
(i) The requested information has been designated by the submitter as information considered protected from disclosure under Exemption 4 in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section; or
(ii) OMB has a reason to believe that the requested information may be protected from disclosure under Exemption 4, but has not yet determined whether the information is protected from disclosure.
(2) The notice will describe the commercial information requested or include a copy of the requested records or portions of records containing the information. In cases involving a voluminous number of submitters, OMB may post or publish a notice in a place or manner reasonably likely to inform the submitters of the proposed disclosure, instead of sending individual notifications.
(d)
Exceptions to submitter notice requirements.
The notice requirements of this section do not apply if:
(1) OMB determines that the information is exempt under the FOIA, and therefore will not be disclosed;
(2) The information has been lawfully published or has been officially made available to the public;
(3) Disclosure of the information is required by law, including regulation issued in accordance with the requirements of Executive Order 12,600 of June 23, 1987; or
(4) The designation made by the submitter under paragraph (b) of this section appears obviously frivolous. In such case, OMB will give the submitter written notice of any final decision to disclose the information within a reasonable number of days prior to a specified disclosure date.
(e)
Opportunity to object to disclosure.
(1) Unless OMB specifies a different period, submitters who fail to respond to OMB's notice within 30 days of OMB's notice will be deemed to have consented to disclosure.
(2) If a submitter has any objections to disclosure, it should provide OMB a detailed written statement that specifies all grounds for withholding the particular information under any exemption of the FOIA. In order to rely on Exemption 4 as basis for nondisclosure, the submitter must explain why the information constitutes a trade secret or commercial or financial information that is privileged or confidential. OMB is not required to consider any information received after the date of any disclosure decision.
(3) Any information provided by a submitter under this section may itself be subject to disclosure under the FOIA.
(f)
Analysis of objections.
OMB will consider a submitter's objections and specific grounds for nondisclosure in deciding whether to disclose the requested information.
(g)
Notice of intent to disclose.
Whenever OMB decides to disclose information over the objection of a submitter, OMB will provide the submitter written notice, which will include:
(1) A statement of the reasons why each of the submitter's disclosure objections were not sustained;
(2) A description of the information to be disclosed or copies of the records as OMB intends to release them; and
(3) A specified disclosure date, at least 30 days after OMB transmits its notice of intent to disclose, except for good cause.
(h)
Requester notification.
OMB will notify the requester whenever it provides the submitter with notice and an opportunity to object to disclosure;
whenever it notifies the submitter of its intent to disclose the requested information; and whenever a submitter files a lawsuit to prevent the disclosure of the information.
[84 FR 22951, May 21, 2019, as amended at 89 FR 48826, June 10, 2024]

# Appeals
§ 1303.70
Appeals.
(a) A requester must appeal to the head of OMB in writing within 90 calendar days after the date of such adverse determination addressed to the FOIA Officer at the address specified in § 1303.20. The appeal must include a statement explaining the basis for the appeal. Determinations of appeals will be set forth in writing and signed by the Deputy Director, or their designee, within 20 working days. If on appeal the denial is upheld in whole or in part, the written determination will also contain a notification of the provisions for judicial review, the names of the persons who participated in the determination, and notice of the services offered by OGIS as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation.
(b) OGIS's dispute resolution services is a voluntary process. If OMB agrees to participate in the mediation services provided by OGIS, OMB will actively engage as a partner to the process in an attempt to resolve the dispute. An appeal ordinarily will not be adjudicated if the request becomes a matter of FOIA litigation. Before seeking review by a court of an agency's adverse determination, a requester generally must first submit a timely administrative appeal.
[84 FR 22951, May 21, 2019, as amended at 89 FR 48826, June 10, 2024]

# Preservation of Records
§ 1303.80
Preservation of records.
OMB will preserve all correspondence pertaining to the requests that it receives under this section, as well as copies of all requested records, until disposition or destruction is authorized pursuant to title 44 of the United States Code or NARA's General Records Schedule 4.2. OMB will not dispose of or destroy records while they are the subject of a pending request, appeal, or lawsuit under the FOIA.

# Fees
§ 1303.90
Definitions.
For the purpose of this part, all definitions set forth in the FOIA apply.
(a) The term “direct costs” means those expenditures that OMB actually incurs in searching for and duplicating (and in the case of commercial requesters, reviewing) documents to respond to a FOIA request. Not included in direct costs are overhead expenses such as costs of space, heating, or lighting the facility in which the records are stored.
(b) The term “search” means the process of looking for and retrieving records or information responsive to a request. It includes page-by-page or line-by-line identification of information within records and also includes reasonable efforts to locate and retrieve information from records maintained in electronic form or format.
(c) The term “duplication” means the making of a copy of a document, or of the information contained in it, that is necessary to respond to a FOIA request. Such copies can be in the form of paper, microform, audio-visual materials, or electronic records (e.g., magnetic tape or disk), among others.
(d) The term “review” refers to the process of examining documents located in response to a request to determine whether any portion of any document located is permitted to be withheld. It also refers to the processing of any documents for disclosure, e.g., doing all that is necessary to excise them and otherwise prepare them for release. Review does not include time spent resolving general legal or policy issues regarding the application of exemptions.
(e) The term “commercial use request” is a request that asks for information for a use or purpose that furthers a commercial, trade, or profit interest, which can include furthering those interests through litigation.
(f) The term “educational institution” is any school that operates a program of teaching or scholarly research. To be eligible for inclusion in this category, requesters must show that the
request is being made as authorized by and in connection with the requester's role at a qualifying institution and that the records are not sought for commercial use, but are sought in furtherance of teaching or scholarly research. OMB may seek assurance from the requester that the request is in furtherance of teaching or scholarly research and will advise requesters of their placement in this category.
(g) The term “non-commercial scientific institution” refers to an institution that is not operated on a commercial basis (as that term is referenced in paragraph (e) of this section) and that is operated solely for the purpose of conducting scientific research where the results of the research are not intended to promote any particular product or industry. A requester in this category must show that the request is authorized by and is made under the auspices of a qualifying institution and that the records are sought to further scientific research and are not for a commercial use.
(h) The term “representative of the news media” refers to any person or entity that gathers information of potential interest to a segment of the public, uses its editorial skills to turn the raw materials into a distinct work, and distributes that work to an audience.
(i) The term “news” means information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. Examples of news media entities include television or radio stations that broadcast “news” to the public at large and publishers of periodicals that disseminate “news” and make their products available through a variety of means to the general public, including news organizations that disseminate solely on the internet. A request for records supporting the news-dissemination function of the requester will not be considered to be for a commercial use. “Freelance” journalists who demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication through a news media entity will be considered as a representative of the news media. A publishing contract would provide the clearest evidence that publication is expected; however, OMB can also consider a requester's past publication record in making this determination. OMB will advise requesters of their placement in this category.
§ 1303.91
Fees to be charged—general.
OMB will charge fees that recoup the full allowable direct costs it incurs. Moreover, it will use the most efficient and least costly methods to comply with requests for documents made under the FOIA. For example, employees should not engage in line-by-line search when merely duplicating an entire document would prove the less expensive and quicker method of complying with a request. Search should be distinguished, moreover, from review of material in order to determine whether the material is exempt from disclosure. When documents that would be responsive to a request are maintained for distribution by agencies operating statutory-based fee schedule programs (see 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4)(A)(vi)), such as the National Technical Information Service, OMB will inform requesters of the steps necessary to obtain records from those sources.
(a)
Search.
Requests made by educational institutions, noncommercial scientific institutions, or representatives of the news media are not subject to search fees. OMB will charge search fees for all other requesters, subject to the restrictions of paragraph (h) of this section.
(1) For each quarter hour spent by personnel searching for requested records, including electronic searches that do not require new programming, the fees will be charged as follows: Professional—$10.00; and clerical/administrative—$4.75.
(2) Requesters shall be charged the direct costs associated with conducting any search that requires the creation of a new computer program to locate the requested records. Requesters shall be notified of the costs associated with creating such a program and must agree to pay the associated costs before the costs may be incurred.
(b)
Review of records.
Only requesters who are seeking documents for commercial use may be charged for time spent reviewing records to determine whether they are exempt from mandatory disclosure. Charges may be assessed only for the initial review;
i.e.,
the review conducted by an agency to determine whether an exemption applies to a particular record or portion of a record. Records or portions of records withheld in full under an exemption that is subsequently determined not to apply may be reviewed again to determine the applicability of other exemptions not previously considered. The direct costs for such a subsequent review are assessable. However, review costs will not include any costs incurred in resolving issues of law or policy that may be raised in the course of processing a request under this section. Review fees will be charged at the same rates as those charged for a search under paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
(c)
Duplication of records.
The requester's specified preference of form or format of disclosure will be honored if the record is readily reproducible in that format. Where photocopies are supplied, OMB will provide one copy per request at a cost of five cents per page. For copies prepared by computer, such as tapes or printouts, OMB will charge the actual cost, including operator time, of production of the tape or printout. For other methods of reproduction or duplication, OMB will charge the actual direct costs of producing the document(s).
(d)
Other charges.
OMB will recover the full costs of providing services such as those enumerated below when it elects to provide them:
(1) Certifying that records are true copies; or
(2) Sending records by special methods, such as express mail.
(e)
Remittances.
Remittances shall be in the form of either a personal check, a bank draft drawn on a bank in the United States, or a postal money order. Remittances shall be made payable to the order of the Treasury of the United States and mailed to the FOIA Officer at the address found in § 1303.10(b).
(f)
Receipts and refunds.
A receipt for fees paid will be provided upon request. Refund of fees paid for services actually rendered will not be made.
(g)
First 100 pages and two hours of search time.
With the exception of requesters seeking documents for a commercial use, OMB will provide the first 100 pages of duplication (or the cost equivalent for other media) and the first two hours of search time without charge.
(h)
Restrictions on assessing fees.
If OMB fails to comply with the FOIA's time limits in which to respond to a request, it may not charge search fees, or, in the instances of requests from requesters described in § 1303.90(g) through (i), may not charge duplication fees, except as described in the following circumstances:
(1) If OMB has determined that unusual circumstances, as defined by the FOIA, apply, and OMB provided timely written notice to the requester in accordance with the FOIA, a failure to comply with the time limit will be excused for an additional 10 days.
(2) If OMB has determined that unusual circumstances, as defined by the FOIA, apply, and more than 5,000 pages are necessary to respond to the request, OMB may charge search fees, or, in the case of requesters described in § 1303.90(g) through (i), may charge duplication fees, if OMB has provided timely written notice to the requester in accordance with the FOIA and OMB has discussed with the requester via written mail, email, or telephone (or made not less than three good-faith attempts to do so) how the requester could effectively limit the scope of the request in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(B)(ii).
(3) If a court determines that exceptional circumstances exist, as defined by the FOIA, a failure to comply with the time limits shall be excused for the length of time provided by the court order.
(i)
No Fees under $25.
No fee will be charged when the total fee, after deducting the first 100 free pages (or its cost equivalent) and the first two hours of search, is equal to or less than $25. If OMB estimates that the charges are likely to exceed $25, it will notify the requester of the estimated amount of fees, unless the requester has indicated in advance their willingness to pay fees as high as those anticipated. Such a notice shall offer a requester the opportunity to confer with agency personnel to meet the requester's needs at a lower cost.
[84 FR 22951, May 21, 2019, as amended at 89 FR 48826, June 10, 2024]
§ 1303.92
Fees to be charged—categories of requesters.
There are four categories of FOIA requesters: Commercial use requesters; educational and non-commercial scientific institutions; representatives of the news media; and all other requesters. The specific levels of fees for each of these categories are:
(a)
Commercial use requesters.
When OMB receives a request for documents for commercial use, it will assess charges that recover the full direct costs of searching for, reviewing for release, and duplicating the record sought. Commercial use requesters are entitled to neither two hours of free search time nor 100 free pages of duplication of documents. OMB may recover the cost of searching for and reviewing records even if there is ultimately no disclosure of records (see § 1303.93(b)).
(b)
Educational and noncommercial scientific institution requesters.
OMB will provide documents to educational and noncommercial scientific institution requesters that meet the criteria in § 1303.90(f) or (g) for the cost of duplication alone, excluding charges for the first 100 pages. OMB may seek evidence from the requester that the request is in furtherance of scholarly research and will advise requesters of their determination whether the requester has met the criteria in § 1303.90(f) or (g).
(c)
Requesters who are representatives of the news media.
OMB will provide documents to requesters who are representatives of the news media that meet the criteria in § 1303.90(h) and (i), and that do not make the request for commercial use, for the cost of duplication alone, excluding charges for the first 100 pages.
(d)
All other requesters.
OMB will charge requesters who do not fit into any of the categories described in paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section fees that recover only the full reasonable direct cost of searching for and duplicating records that are responsive to the request, except that the first 100 pages of duplication and the first two hours of search time will be furnished without charge. Moreover, requests for records about the requesters filed in OMB's systems of records will continue to be treated under the fee provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974, which permit fees only for producing copies of records
[84 FR 22951, May 21, 2019, as amended at 89 FR 48826, June 10, 2024]
§ 1303.93
Miscellaneous fee provisions.
(a)
Charging interest—notice and rate.
OMB may begin assessing interest charges on an unpaid bill starting on the 31st day after OMB sends the bill. If OMB receives the fee within the thirty-day grace period, interest will not accrue on the paid portion of the bill, even if the payment is unprocessed. Interest will be at the rate prescribed in 31 U.S.C. 3717 and will accrue from the date of the billing.
(b)
Charges for unsuccessful search.
OMB may properly charge for time spent searching even if it does not locate any responsive records or if OMB determines that the records are entirely exempt from disclosure.
(c)
Aggregating requests.
When OMB reasonably believes that a requester, or a group of requesters acting in concert, is attempting to divide a single request into a series of requests for the purpose of avoiding fees, OMB may aggregate those requests and charge fees accordingly. OMB may presume that multiple requests of this type made within a 30-day period have been made in order to avoid fees. For requests separated by a longer period, OMB will aggregate them only where there is a reasonable basis for determining that aggregation is warranted in view of all the circumstances involved. Multiple requests involving unrelated matters shall not be aggregated.
(d)
Advance payments.
(1) OMB will not require a requester to make an advance payment,
i.e.,
payment before work is commenced or continued on a request, unless OMB estimates or determines that allowable charges that a requester may be required to pay will exceed $250 or the requester has previously failed to make a payment due within 30 days of billing.
(2) In cases in which OMB requires advance payment, the request will not be considered received and further work will not be completed until the required payment is received. If the requester does not pay the advance payment within 30 calendar days after the
date of OMB's fee determination, the request will be closed.
(e)
Effect of the Debt Collection Act of 1982 (Pub. L. 97-365).
OMB will comply with applicable provisions of the Debt Collection Act, including disclosure to consumer reporting agencies and use of collection agencies, where appropriate, to encourage repayment.
[84 FR 22951, May 21, 2019, as amended at 89 FR 48826, June 10, 2024]
§ 1303.94
Waiver or reduction of charges.
(a)
How to apply for a fee waiver.
Requesters may seek a waiver of fees by submitting a written application demonstrating how disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.
(b)
Factors for approving fee waivers.
OMB will furnish records responsive to a request without charge or at a reduced rate when it determines, based on all available information, that the following factors are satisfied:
(1) Disclosure of the requested information would shed light on the operations or activities of the government. The subject of the request must concern identifiable operations or activities of the Federal Government with a connection that is direct and clear, not remote or attenuated.
(2) Disclosure of the requested information is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations or activities. This factor is satisfied when both of the following criteria are met:
(i) Disclosure of the requested records must be meaningfully informative about government operations or activities. The disclosure of information that already is in the public domain, in either the same or a substantially identical form, would not be meaningfully informative if nothing new would be added to the public's understanding.
(ii) The disclosure must contribute to the understanding of a reasonably broad audience of persons interested in the subject, as opposed to the individual understanding of the requester. A requester's expertise in the subject area as well as the requester's ability and intention to effectively convey information to the public must be considered. OMB will presume that a representative of the news media will satisfy this consideration.
(3) The disclosure must not be primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. To determine whether disclosure of the requested information is primarily in the commercial interest of the requester, OMB will consider the following criteria:
(i) OMB will identify whether the requester has any commercial interest that would be furthered by the requested disclosure. A commercial interest includes any commercial, trade, or profit interest. Requesters must be given an opportunity to provide explanatory information regarding this consideration.
(ii) If there is an identified commercial interest, OMB must determine whether that is the primary interest furthered by the request. A waiver or reduction of fees is justified when the requirements of paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section are satisfied and any commercial interest is not the primary interest furthered by the request. OMB ordinarily will presume that when a news media requester has satisfied the requirements of paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section, the request is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. Disclosure to data brokers or others who merely compile and market government information for direct economic return will not be presumed to primarily serve the public interest.
(c)
Timing of requests for fee waivers.
Requests for a waiver or reduction of fees should be made when the request is first submitted to OMB and should address the criteria referenced above. A requester may submit a fee waiver request at a later time so long as the underlying record request is pending or on administrative appeal. When a requester who has committed to pay fees subsequently asks for a waiver of those fees and that waiver is denied, the requester shall be required to pay any costs incurred up to the date the fee waiver request was received.

# Source:
45 FR 84007, Dec. 22, 1980, unless otherwise noted.
§ 1304.4601
Purpose.
(a) This section sets forth OMB's policy and procedures under the Ethics in Government Act of 1978, 18 U.S.C. 207, and the Office of Personnel Management's implementing regulations, 5 CFR part 737, for determining violations of restrictions on post-employment activities and for exercising OMB's administrative enforcement authority.
(b) These regulations bar certain acts by former Government employees which may reasonably give the appearance of making unfair use of prior Government employment and affiliations. OMB acts on the premise that it has the primary responsibility for the enforcement of restrictions on post-employment activities and that criminal enforcement by the Department of Justice should be undertaken only in cases involving aggravated circumstances.
(c) These regulations do not incorporate possible additional restrictions contained in a professional code of conduct to which an employee may also be subject.
(d) Any person who holds a Government position after June 30, 1979, is subject to the restrictions under this section; except that the new provisions applicable to Senior employees designated by the Director of the Office of Government Ethics are effective February 28, 1980.
§ 1304.4604
Definitions.
(a)
Government Employee
includes any officer or employee of the Executive Branch, those appointed or detailed under 5 U.S.C. 3374, and Special Government Employees. It does not include an individual performing services for the United States as an independent contractor under a personal service contract.
(b)
Former Government Employee
means one who was, and no longer is, a Government employee.
(c)
Special Government Employee
means an officer or employee of an agency who is retained, designated, appointed, or employed to perform temporary duties on a full-time or intermittent basis for not more than 130 days during any period of 365 consecutive days. This applies whether the Special Government Employee is compensated or not.
(d)
Senior Employee
means an employee or officer as designated in the statute or by the Director of the Office of Government Ethics. The Director of the Office of Government Ethics has designated civilians who have significant decision-making or supervisory responsibility and are paid at or equivalent to GS-17 or above as Senior Employees. Civilians paid at the Executive level are automatically designated by statute as Senior Employees. (A list of Senior Employee positions is found at 5 CFR 737.33.)
§ 1304.4605
Post-employment restrictions.
(a) General Restrictions Applicable to All Former Government Employees:
(1)
Permanent Bar.
A former Government employee is restricted from acting as a representative before an agency as to a particular matter involving a specific party if the employee participated personally and substantially in that matter as a Government employee. The government employee is also restricted from making any oral or written communication to an agency with the intent to influence on behalf of another person as to a particular matter involving a specific party if the former Government employee participated personally and substantially in that matter as a Government employee.
(2)
Two-Year Bar.
(i) A former Government employee is restricted for two years from acting as a representative
before an agency as to a particular matter involving a specific party if the employee had official responsibility for that matter. The former Government employee is also restricted for two years from making any oral or written communication to any agency with the intent to influence on behalf of another person as to a particular matter involving a specific party if the employee had official responsibility for that matter.
(ii) In order to be a matter for which the former Government employee had official responsibility, the matter must actually have been pending under the employee's responsibility within the period of one year prior to the termination of such responsibility.
(iii) The statutory two-year restriction period is measured from the date when the employee's responsibility for a particular matter ends, not from the termination of Government service.
(b) Restrictions Applicable Only to Former Senior Employees:
(1)
Two-Year Bar on Assisting in Representing.
(i) A former Senior Employee is restricted for two years from assisting in representing another person by personal appearance before an agency as to a particular matter involving a specific party if the former Senior Employee participated personally and substantially in that matter as a Government employee.
(ii) The statutory two-year period is measured from the date of termination of employment in the position that was held by the Senior Employee when he participated personally and substantially in the matter involved.
(2)
One-Year Bar on Attempts to Influence Former Agency.
(i) A former Senior Employee is restricted for one year from any transactions with the former agency on a particular matter with the intent to influence the agency, regardless of the former Senior Employee's prior involvement in that matter.
(ii) This restriction is aimed at the possible use of personal influence based on past Government affiliations in order to facilitate transaction of business. Therefore, it includes matters which first arise after a Senior Employee leaves Government service.
(iii) The restriction applies whether the former Senior Employee is representing another or representing himself, either by appearance before an agency or through communication with that agency.
(c) OFPP is a separate agency for purposes of the foregoing restrictions on post-employment activities.
§ 1304.4606
Exemptions.
(a)
General.
(1) Communications made solely to furnish scientific or technological information are exempt from these prohibitions.
(2) A former Government employee may be exempted from the restrictions on post-employment practices if the Deputy Director of OMB, in consultation with the Director of the Office of Government Ethics, executes a certification that is published in the
Federal Register.
The certification shall state that the former Government employee has outstanding qualifications in a scientific, technological or other technical discipline; is acting with respect to a particular matter which requires such qualifications; and the national interest would be served by his participation.
(b)
Specific.
The one-year bar shall not apply to a former Senior Employee's representation on new matters if the former Senior Employee is:
(1) An elected State or local government official, who is acting on behalf of such government; or
(2) Regularly employed by or acting on behalf of an agency or instrumentality of a State or local government; an accredited, degree-granting institution of higher education; or a non-profit hospital or medical research organization.
§ 1304.4607
Advice to former Government employees.
The Office of General Counsel, OMB, has the responsibility for providing assistance promptly to former Government employees who seek advice on specific problems.
§ 1304.4608
Administrative Enforcement Procedures (18 U.S.C. 207(j); 5 CFR 737.27).
(a) Whenever an allegation is made that a former Government employee has violated 18 U.S.C. 207(a), (b) or (c) or any of the regulations promulgated
thereunder by the Office of Government Ethics or by OMB, the allegation and any supporting evidence shall be transmitted through the Office of General Counsel to the Deputy Director, OMB.
(b) Allegations and evidence shall be safeguarded so as to protect the privacy of former employees prior to a determination of sufficient cause to initiate an administrative disciplinary proceeding.
(c) If review by the Office of General Counsel, OMB, shows that the information concerning a possible violation does not appear to be frivolous, the Deputy Director, OMB, shall expeditiously provide all relevant evidence, any appropriate comments, and copies of applicable agency regulations to the director, Office of Government Ethics, and to the Criminal Division, Department of Justice. Unless the Department of Justice informs OMB that it does not intend to initiate criminal prosecution, OMB shall coordinate any investigation or administrative action with the Department of Justice in order to avoid prejudicing criminal proceedings.
(d) After appropriate review and recommendation by the Office of General Counsel, if the Deputy Director, OMB, determines that there is reasonable cause to believe that there has been a violation, the Deputy Director may direct the Office of General Counsel to initiate an administrative disciplinary proceeding and may designate an individual to represent OMB in the proceeding.
(e)
Notice.
The Office of General Counsel shall provide the former Government employee with adequate notice of its intention to institute a proceeding and with an opportunity for a hearing. The notice must include a statement of allegations, and the basis thereof, in sufficient detail to enable the former Government employee to prepare an adequate defense; notification of the right to a hearing; and an explanation of the method by which a hearing may be requested.
(f)
Hearing.
A hearing may be obtained by submitting a written request to the Office of General Counsel.
(g)
Examiner.
The presiding official at the proceedings shall be the hearing examiner, who is delegated authority by the Director, OMB, to make an initial decision. The hearing examiner shall be an attorney in the Office of General Counsel designated by the General Counsel. The hearing examiner shall be impartial and shall not have participated in any manner in the decision to initiate the proceedings.
(h)
Time, date and place.
The hearing shall be conducted at a reasonable time, date, and place. The hearing examiner shall give due regard in setting the hearing date to the former Government employee's need for adequate time to properly prepare a defense and for an expeditious resolution of allegations that may be damaging to his reputation.
(i)
Hearing rights.
The hearing shall include, as a minimum, the right to represent oneself or to be represented by counsel; the right to introduce and examine witnesses and to submit physical evidence; the right to confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses; the right to present oral argument; and, on request, the right to have a transcript or recording of the proceedings.
(j)
Burden of proof.
OMB has the burden of proof and must establish substantial evidence of a violation.
(k)
Decision.
The hearing examiner shall make a decision based exclusively on matters of record in the proceedings. All findings of fact and conclusions of law relevant to the matters at issue shall be set forth in the decision.
(l)
Appeal within OMB.
Within 30 days of the date of the hearing examiner's decision, either party may appeal the decision to the Director. The Director shall make a decision on the appeal based solely on the record of the proceedings or on those portions of the record agreed to by the parties to limit the issues. If the Director modifies or reverses the hearing examiner's decision, he shall specify the findings of fact and conclusions of law that are different from those of the hearing examiner.
(m)
Administrative sanctions.
Administrative sanctions may be taken if the former Government employee fails to request a hearing after receipt of adequate notice or if a final administrative determination of a violation of 18
U.S.C. 207 (a), (b) or (c) or regulations promulgated thereunder has been made. The Director may prohibit the former Government employee from appearance or communication with OMB on behalf of another for a period not to exceed five years (5 CFR 737.27(a)(9)(i)) or take other appropriate disciplinary action (5 CFR 737.27(a)(9)(ii)).
(n)
Judicial review.
Any person found by an OMB administrative decision to have participated in a violation of 18 U.S.C. 207 (a), (b) or (c) or regulations promulgated thereunder may seek judicial review of the administrative decision.

§ 1305.1
Purpose and scope.
This part contains the regulations of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) concerning procedures to be followed when, in litigation (including administrative proceedings), a subpoena, order or other demand (hereinafter in this part referred to as a “demand”) of a court or other authority is issued for the production or disclosure of:
(a) Any material contained in the files of OMB;
(b) Any information relating to materials contained in the files of OMB; or
(c) Any information or material acquired by any person while such person was an employee of OMB as a part of the performance of the person's official duties or because of the person's official status.
§ 1305.2
Production prohibited unless approved.
No employee or former employee of OMB shall, in response to a demand of a court or other authority, produce any material contained in the files of OMB, disclose any information relating to materials contained in the files of OMB, or disclose any information or produce any material acquired as part of the performance of the person's official duties, or because of the person's official status, without the prior approval of the General Counsel.
§ 1305.3
Procedures in the event of a demand for disclosure.
(a) Whenever a demand is made upon an employee or former employee of OMB for the production of material or the disclosure of information described in § 1305.2, he shall immediately notify the General Counsel. If possible, the General Counsel shall be notified before the employee or former employee concerned replies to or appears before the court or other authority.
(b) If information or material is sought by a demand in any case or matter in which OMB is not a party, an affidavit (or, if that is not feasible, a statement by the party seeking the information or material, or by his attorney) setting forth a summary of the information or material sought and its relevance to the proceeding, must be submitted before a decision is made as to whether materials will be produced or permission to testify or otherwise provide information will be granted. Any authorization for testimony by a present or former employee of OMB shall be limited to the scope of the demand as summarized in such statement.
(c) If response to a demand is required before instructions from the General Counsel are received, an attorney designated for that purpose by OMB shall appear, and shall furnish the court or other authority with a copy of the regulations contained in this part and inform the court or other authority that the demand has been or is being, as the case may be, referred for prompt consideration by the General Counsel. The court or other authority shall be requested respectfully to stay
the demand pending receipt of the requested instructions from the General Counsel.

§ 1305.4
Procedure in the event of an adverse ruling.
If the court or other authority declines to stay the effect of the demand in response to a request made in accordance with § 1305.3(c) pending receipt of instructions from the General Counsel, or if the court or other authority rules that the demand must be complied with irrespective of the instructions from the General Counsel not to produce the material or disclose the information sought, the employee or former employee upon whom the demand has been made shall respectfully decline to comply with the demand (United States ex rel.

# Subpart A—Classification and Declassification of National Security Information
§ 1312.1
Purpose and authority.
This subpart sets forth the procedures for the classification and declassification of national security information in the possession of the Office of Management and Budget. It is issued under the authority of Executive Order 12958, (60 FR 19825, 3 CFR, 1995 Comp., P.333), as implemented by Information Security Oversight Office Directive No. 1 (32 CFR part 2001), and is applicable to all OMB employees.
§ 1312.2
Responsibilities.
The effectiveness of the classification and declassification program in OMB depends entirely on the amount of attention paid to it by supervisors and their staffs in those offices and divisions that possess or produce classified material. Officials who originate classified information are responsible for proper assignment of a classification to that material and for the decision as to its declassification. Officials who produce documents containing classified information must determine the source of the classification for that information and must ensure that the proper identity of that source is shown on the document. Custodians of classified material are responsible for its safekeeping and for ensuring that such material is adequately marked as to current classification. Custodians are also responsible for the control of and accounting for all classified material within their area of jurisdiction as prescribed in OMB Manual Section 1030.
(a)
EOP Security Officer.
In cooperation with the Associate Director (or Assistant Director) for Administration, the EOP Security Officer supervises the administration of this section and develops programs to assist in the compliance with the Order. Specifically, he:
(1) Promotes the correct understanding of this section by all employees by providing annual security refresher briefings and ensures that new employees attend initial briefings about overall security procedures and policies.
(2) Issues and keeps current such classification guides and guidelines for review for declassification as are required by the Order.
(3) Conducts periodic reviews of classified documents produced and provides assistance and guidance where necessary.
(4) Maintains and publishes a current listing of all officials who have been designated in writing to have Top Secret, Secret, and Confidential original classification authority.
(b)
Heads of divisions or offices.
The head of each division or major organizational unit is responsible for the administration of this section within his or her area. Appropriate internal guidance should be issued to cover special or unusual conditions within an office.
§ 1312.3
Classification requirements.
United States citizens must be kept informed about the activities of their Government. However, in the interest of national security, certain official information must be subject to constraints on its dissemination or release. This information is classified in order to provide that protection.
(a) Information shall be considered for classification if it concerns:
(1) Military plans, weapons systems, or operations;
(2) Foreign government information;
(3) Intelligence activities (including special activities), intelligence sources or methods, or cryptology;
(4) Foreign relations or foreign activities of the United States, including confidential sources;
(5) Scientific, technological, or economic matters relating to the national security;
(6) United States Government programs for safeguarding nuclear materials or facilities; or
(7) Vulnerabilities or capabilities of systems, installations, projects or plans relating to the national security.
(b) When information is determined to meet one or more of the criteria in paragraph (a) of this section, it shall be classified by an original classification authority when he/she determines that its unauthorized disclosure reasonably could be expected to cause at least identifiable damage to the national security.
(c) Unauthorized disclosure of foreign government information, including the identity of a confidential foreign source of intelligence sources or methods, is presumed to cause damage to the national security.
(d) Information classified in accordance with this section shall not be declassified automatically as a result of any unofficial or inadvertent or unauthorized disclosure in the United States or abroad of identical or similar information.
§ 1312.4
Classified designations.
(a) Except as provided by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, (42 U.S.C. 2011) or the National Security Act of 1947, as amended, (50 U.S.C. 401) Executive Order 12958 provides the only basis for classifying information. Information which meets the test for classification may be classified in one of the following three designations:
(1)
Top Secret.
This classification shall be applied only to information the unauthorized disclosure of which reasonably could be expected to cause exceptionally grave damage to the national security that the original classification authority is able to identify or describe.
(2)
Secret.
This classification shall be applied only to information the unauthorized disclosure of which reasonably could be expected to cause serious damage to the national security that the original classification authority is able to identify or describe.
(3)
Confidential.
This classification shall be applied only to information the unauthorized disclosure of which reasonably could be expected to cause damage to the national security that the original classification authority is able to identify or describe.
(b) If there is significant doubt about the need to classify information, it shall not be classified. If there is significant doubt about the appropriate level of classification, it shall be classified at the lower level.
§ 1312.5
Authority to classify.
(a) The authority to originally classify information or material under this part shall be limited to those officials
concerned with matters of national security. The officials listed in this section are granted authority by the Director, OMB, to assign original classifications as indicated to information or material that is originated by OMB staff and relating to the national security of the United States:
(1) Top Secret and below:
(i) Deputy Director.
(ii) Deputy Director for Management.
(iii) Associate Director for National Security and International Affairs.
(iv) Associate Director for Natural Resources, Energy and Science.
(2) Secret and below:
(i) Deputy Associate Director for National Security.
(ii) Deputy Associate Director for International Affairs.
(iii) Deputy Associate Director for Energy and Science.
(b) Classification authority is not delegated to persons who only reproduce, extract, or summarize classified information, or who only apply classification markings derived from source material or from a classification guide.
§ 1312.6
Duration of classification.
(a)(1) When determining the duration of classification for information originally classified under Executive Order 12958, an original classification authority shall follow the following sequence:
(i) He/She shall attempt to determine a date or event that is less than 10 years from the date of original classification, and which coincides with the lapse of the information's national security sensitivity, and shall assign such date or event as the declassification instruction;
(ii) If unable to determine a date or event of less than 10 years, he/she shall ordinarily assign a declassification date that is 10 years from the date of the original classification decision;
(iii) He/She may extend the duration of classification or reclassify specific information for a period not to exceed 10 additional years if such action is consistent with the exemptions as outlined in Section 1.6(d) of the Executive Order. This provision does not apply to information contained in records that are more than 25 years old and have been determined to have permanent historical value under Title 44 United States Code.
(iv) He/She may exempt from declassification within 10 years specific information, which is consistent with the exemptions as outlined in Section 1.6 (d) of the Executive Order.
(2) Extending Duration of Classification. Extensions of classification are not automatic. If an original classification authority with jurisdiction over the information does not extend the date or event for declassification, the information is automatically declassified upon the occurrence of the date or event. If an original classification authority has assigned a date or event for declassification that is 10 years or less from the date of classification, an original classification authority with jurisdiction over the information may extend the classification duration of such information for additional periods not to exceed 10 years at a time. Records determined to be of historical value may not exceed the duration of 25 years.
(b) When extending the duration of classification, the original classification authority must:
(1) Be an original classification authority with jurisdiction over the information.
(2) Ensure that the information continues to meet the standards for classification under the Executive Order.
(3) Make reasonable attempts to notify all known holders of the information. Information classified under prior orders marked with a specific date or event for declassification is automatically declassified upon that date or event. Information classified under prior orders marked with Originating Agency's Determination Required (OADR) shall:
(i) Be declassified by a declassification authority as defined in Section 3.1 of the Executive Order.
(ii) Be re-marked by an authorized original classification authority with jurisdiction over the information to establish a duration of classification consistent with the Executive Order.
(iii) Be subject to Section 3.4 of the Executive Order if the records are determined to be of historical value and are to remain classified for 25 years
from the date of its original classification.
§ 1312.7
Derivative classification.
A
derivative classification
means that the information is in substance the same information that is currently classified, usually by another agency or classification authority. The application of derivative classification markings is the responsibility of the person who incorporates, restates, paraphrases, or generates in new form information that is already classified, or one who applies such classification markings in accordance with instructions from an authorized classifier or classification guide. Extreme care must be taken to continue classification and declassification markings when such information is incorporated into OMB documents. The duplication or reproduction of existing classified information is not derivative classification. Persons who use derivative classification need not possess original classification authority.
§ 1312.8
Standard identification and markings.
(a)
Original classification.
At the time classified material is produced, the classifier shall apply the following markings on the face of each originally classified document, including electronic media:
(1)
Classification authority.
The name/personal identifier, and position title of the original classifier shall appear on the “Classified By” line.
(2)
Agency and office of origin.
If not otherwise evident, the agency and office of origin shall be identified and placed below the name on the “Classified By” line.
(3)
Reasons for classification.
Identify the reason(s) to classify. The classifier shall include, at a minimum, a brief reference to the pertinent classification category(ies), or the number 1.5 plus the letter(s) that corresponds to that classification category in Section 1.5 of the Executive Order.
(4)
Declassification instructions.
These instructions shall indicate the following:
(i) The duration of the original classification decision shall be placed on the “Declassify On” line.
(ii) The date or event for declassification that corresponds to the lapse of the information's national security sensitivity, which may not exceed 10 years from the date of the original decision.
(iii) When a specific date or event within 10 years cannot be established, the classifier will apply the date that is 10 years from the date of the original decision.
(iv) The exemption category from declassification. Upon determination that the information must remain classified beyond 10 years, the classifier will apply the letter “X” plus a brief recitation of the exemption category(ies), or the letter “X” plus the number that corresponds to the exemption category(ies) in Section 1.6(d) of the Executive Order.
(v) An original classification authority may extend the duration of classification for successive periods not to exceed 10 years at a time. The “Declassify On” line shall be revised to include the new declassification instructions and shall include the identity of the person authorizing the extension and the date of the action.
(vi) Information exempted from automatic declassification at 25 years should on the “Declassify On” line be revised to include the symbol “25X” plus a brief reference to the pertinent exemption categories/numbers of the Executive Order.
(5) The overall classification of the document is the highest level of information in the document and will be conspicuously placed stamped at the top and bottom of the outside front and back cover, on the title page, and on the first page.
(6) The highest classification of individual pages will be stamped at the top and bottom of each page, to include “unclassified” when it is applicable.
(7) The classification of individual portions of the document, (ordinarily a paragraph, but including subjects, titles, graphics) shall be marked by using the abbreviations (TS), (S), (C), or (U), will be typed or marked at the beginning or end of each paragraph or section of the document. If all portions of the document are classified at the same level, this may be indicated by a statement to that effect.
(b)
Derivative classification.
Information classified derivatively on the basis of source documents shall carry the following markings on those documents:
(1) The derivative classifier shall concisely identify the source document(s) or the classification guide on the “Derived From” line, including the agency and where available the office of origin and the date of the source or guide. When a document is classified derivatively on the basis of more than one source document or classification guide, the “Derived From” line shall appear as “Derived From: Multiple Sources”.
(2) The derivative classifier shall maintain the identification of each source with the file or record copy of the derivatively classified document. Where practicable the copies of the document should also have this list attached.
(3) A document derivatively classified on the basis of a source document that is itself marked “Multiple Sources” shall cite the source document on its “Derived From” line rather than the term “Multiple Sources”.
(4) The reason for the original classification decision, as reflected in the source document, is not required to be transferred in a derivative classification action.
(5) Declassification instructions shall carry forward the instructions on the “Declassify On” line from the source document to the derivation document or the duration instruction from the classification guide. Where there are multiple sources, the longest duration of any of its sources shall be used.
(6) When a source document or classification guide contains the declassification instruction “Originating Agency's Determination Required” (OADR) the derivative document shall carry forward the fact that the source document(s) were so marked and the date of origin of the most recent source document (s).
(7) The derivatively classified document shall be conspicuously marked with the highest level of classification of information.
(8) Each portion of a derivatively classified document shall be marked in accordance with its source.
(9) Each office shall, consistent with Section 3.8 of the Executive Order, establish and maintain a database of information that has been declassified.
(c)
Additional Requirements.
(1) Markings other than “Top Secret”, “Secret”, and “Confidential” shall not be used to identify classified national security information.
(2) Transmittal documents will be stamped to indicate the highest classification of the information transmitted, and shall indicate conspicuously on its face the following or something similar “Unclassified When classified Enclosure Removed” to indicate the classification of the transmittal document standing alone.
(3) The classification data for material other than documents will be affixed by tagging, stamping, recording, or other means to insure that recipients are aware of the requirements for the protection of the material.
(4) Documents containing foreign government information shall include the markings “This Document Contains (country of origin) Information”. If the identity of the specific government must be concealed, the document shall be marked” This Document Contains Foreign Government Information,” and pertinent portions marked “FGI” together with the classification level, e.g., “(FGI-C)”. In such cases, separate document identifying the government shall be maintained in order to facilitate future declassification actions.
(5) Documents, regardless of medium, which are expected to be revised prior to the preparation of a finished product—working papers—shall be dated when created, marked with highest classification, protected at that level, and destroyed when no longer needed. When any of the following conditions exist, the working papers shall be controlled and marked in the same manner as prescribed for a finished classified document:
(i) Released by the originator outside the originating activity;
(ii) Retained more than 180 days from the date of origin;
(iii) Filed permanently.
(6) Information contained in unmarked records, or Presidential or related materials, and which pertain to
the national defense or foreign relations of the U.S. and has been maintained and protected as classified information under prior orders shall continue to be treated as classified information under the Executive Order and is subject to its provisions regarding declassification.
§ 1312.9
Downgrading and declassification.
Classified information originated by OMB offices will be downgraded or declassified as soon as it no longer qualifies for continued protection under the provisions of the classification guides. Authority to downgrade or declassify OMB-originated information is granted to those authorized to classify (See § 1312.5). Additionally, the Associate Director (or Assistant Director) for Administration is authorized to exercise downgrading and declassification actions up to and including the Top Secret level.
(a)
Transferred material.
Information which was originated by an agency that no longer exists, or that was received by OMB in conjunction with a transfer of functions, is deemed to be OMB-originated material. Information which has been transferred to another agency for storage purposes remains the responsibility of OMB.
(b)
Periodic review of classified material.
Each office possessing classified material will review that material on an annual basis or in conjunction with the transfer of files to non-current record storage and take action to downgrade or declassify all material no longer qualifying for continued protection at that level. All material transferred to non-current record storage must be properly marked with correct downgrade and declassification instructions.
§ 1312.10
Systematic review guidelines.
The EOP Security Officer will prepare and keep current such guidelines as are required by Executive Order 12958 for the downgrading and declassification of OMB material that is in the custody of the Archivist of the United States.
§ 1312.11
Challenges to classifications.
OMB employees are encouraged to familiarize themselves with the provisions of Executive Order 12958 and with OMB Manual Sections 1010, 1020, and 1030. Employees are also encouraged to question or to challenge those classifications they believe to be improper, unnecessary, or for an inappropriate time. Such questions or challenges may be addressed to the originator of the classification, unless the challenger desires to remain anonymous, in which case the question may be directed to the EOP Security Officer.
§ 1312.12
Security Program Review Committee.
The Associate Director (or Assistant Director) for Administration will chair the OMB Security Program Review Committee, which will act on suggestions and complaints about the OMB security program.

# Subpart B—Control and Accountability of Classified Information
§ 1312.21
Purpose and authority.
This subpart sets forth procedures for the receipt, storage, accountability, and transmission of classified information at the Office of Management and Budget. It is issued under the authority of Executive Order 12958, (60 FR 19825, 3 CFR, 1995 Comp., P.333), as implemented by Information Security Oversight Office Directive No 1 (32 CFR part 2001), and is applicable to all OMB employees.
§ 1312.22
Responsibilities.
The effective direction by supervisors and the alert performance of duty by employees will do much to ensure the adequate security of classified information in the possession of OMB offices. Each employee has a responsibility to protect and account for all classified information that he/she knows of within his/her area of responsibility. Such information will be made available only to those persons who have an official need to know and who have been granted the appropriate security clearance. Particular care must be taken not to discuss classified information
over unprotected communications circuits (to include intercom and closed-circuit TV), at non-official functions, or at any time that it might be revealed to unauthorized persons. Classified information may only be entered into computer systems meeting the appropriate security criteria.
(a)
EOP Security Officer.
In cooperation with the Associate Director (or Assistant Director) for Administration, the EOP Security Officer supervises the administration of this section. Specifically, he/she:
(1) Promotes the correct understanding of this section and insures that initial and annual briefings about security procedures are given to all new employees.
(2) Provides for periodic inspections of office areas and reviews of produced documents to ensure full compliance with OMB regulations and procedures.
(3) Takes prompt action to investigate alleged violations of security, and recommends appropriate administrative action with respect to violators.
(4) Supervises the annual inventories of Top Secret material.
(5) Ensures that containers used to store classified material meet the appropriate security standards and that combinations to security containers are changed as required.
(b)
Heads of Offices.
The head of each division or office is responsible for the administration of this section in his/her area. These responsibilities include:
(1) The appointment of accountability control clerks as prescribed in § 1312.26.
(2) The maintenance of the prescribed control and accountability records for classified information within the office.
(3) Establishing internal procedures to ensure that classified material is properly safeguarded at all times.
§ 1312.23
Access to classified information.
Classified information may be made available to a person only when the possessor of the information establishes that the person has a valid “need to know” and the access is essential to the accomplishment of official government duties. The proposed recipient is eligible to receive classified information only after he/she has been granted a security clearance by the EOP Security Officer. Cover sheets will be used to protect classified documents from inadvertent disclosure while in use. An SF-703 will be used for Top Secret material; an SF-704 for Secret material, and an SF-705 for Confidential material. The cover sheet should be removed prior to placing the document in the files.
§ 1312.24
Access by historical researchers and former Presidential appointees.
(a) The requirements of Section 4.2(a)(3) of Executive Order 12958 may be waived for persons who are engaged in historical research projects, or who previously have occupied policy-making positions to which they were appointed by the President. Waivers may be granted only if the Associate Director (or Assistant Director) for Administration, in cooperation with the EOP Security Officer:
(1) Determines in writing that access is consistent with the interest of national security;
(2) Takes appropriate steps to protect classified information from unauthorized disclosure or compromise, and ensures that the information is safeguarded in a manner consistent with the order; and
(3) Limits the access granted to former Presidential appointees to items that the person originated, reviewed, signed, or received while serving as a Presidential appointee.
(b) In the instances described in paragraph (a) of this section, the Associate Director (or Assistant Director) for Administration, in cooperation with the EOP Security Officer, will make a determination as to the trustworthiness of the requestor and will obtain written agreement from the requestor to safeguard the information to which access is given. He/She will also obtain written consent to the review by OMB of notes and manuscripts for the purpose of determining that no classified information is contained therein. Upon the completion of these steps, the material to be researched will be reviewed
by the division/office of primary interest to ensure that access is granted only to material over which OMB has classification jurisdiction.
§ 1312.25
Storage.
All classified material in the possession of OMB will be stored in a GSA-approved container or in vault-type rooms approved for Top Secret storage. Under the direction of the EOP Security Officer, combinations to safes used in the storage of classified material will be changed when the equipment is placed in use, whenever a person knowing the combination no longer requires access to it, whenever the combination has been subjected to possible compromise, whenever the equipment is taken out of service, or at least once a year. Knowledge of combinations will be limited to the minimum number of persons necessary, and records of combinations will be assigned a classification no lower than the highest level of classified information stored in the equipment concerned. An SF-700, Security Container Information, will be used in recording safe combinations. Standard Form-702, Security Container check sheet, will be posted to each safe and will be used to record opening, closing, and checking the container whenever it is used.
§ 1312.26
Control of secret and confidential material.
Classified material will be accounted for by the office having custody of the material. OMB Form 87, Classified Document Control, will be used to establish accountability controls on all Secret material received or produced within OMB offices. No accountability controls are prescribed for Confidential material, but offices desiring to control and account for such material should use the procedures applicable to Secret material. Information classified by another agency shall not be disclosed without that agency's authorization.
(a)
Accountability Control Clerks.
Each division or office head will appoint one person as the Accountability Control Clerk (ACC). The ACC will be the focal point for the receipt, routing, accountability, dispatch, and declassification downgrading or destruction of all classified material in the possession of the office.
(b)
OMB Form 87.
One copy of OMB Form 87 will be attached to the document, and one copy retained in the accountability control file for each active document within the area of responsibility of the ACC. Downgrading or destruction actions, or other actions removing the document from the responsibility of the ACC will be recorded on the OMB Form 87, and the form filed in an inactive file. Inactive control forms will be cut off annually, held for two additional years, then destroyed.
(c)
Working papers and drafts.
Working papers and drafts of classified documents will be protected according to their security classification, but will not be subject to accountability control unless they are forwarded outside of OMB.
(d)
Typewriter ribbons.
Typewriter ribbons, cassettes, and other devices used in the production of classified material will be removed from the machine after each use and protected as classified material not subject to controls. Destruction of such materials will be as prescribed in § 1312.29.
(e)
Reproduction.
Classified material will be reproduced only as required unless prohibited by the originator for the conduct of business and reproduced copies are subject to the same controls as are the original documents. Top Secret material will be reproduced only with the written permission of the originating agency.
§ 1312.27
Top secret control.
The EOP Security Officer serves as the Top Secret Control Officer (TSCO) for OMB. He will be assisted by the Alternate TSCOs in each division/office Holding Top Secret material. The ATSCOs will be responsible for the accountability and custodianship of Top Secret material within their divisions/offices. The provisions of this section do not apply to special intelligence material, which will be processed as prescribed by the controlling agency.
(a)
Procedures.
All Top Secret material produced or received in OMB will be taken to the appropriate ATSCO for receipting, establishment of custodianship, issuance to the appropriate action
officer, and, as appropriate, obtaining a receipt. Top Secret material in the custody of the TSCO or ATSCO will normally be segregated from other classified material and will be stored in a safe under his or her control. Such material will be returned to the appropriate ATSCO by action officers as soon as action is completed. OMB Form 87 will be used to establish custody, record distribution, routing, receipting and destruction of Top Secret material. Top Secret Access Record and Cover Sheet (Standard Form 703) will be attached to each Top Secret document while it is in the possession of OMB.
(b)
Inventory.
The Associate Director (or Assistant Director) for Administration will notify each appropriate OMB office to conduct an inventory of its Top Secret material by May 1 each year. The head of each office will notify the EOP Security Officer when the inventory has been satisfactorily completed. Each Top Secret item will be examined to determine whether it can be downgraded or declassified, and the inventory will be adjusted accordingly. Discrepancies in the inventory, indicating loss or possible compromise, will be thoroughly investigated by the EOP Security Officer or by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, as appropriate. Each ATSCO will retain his/her division's inventory in accordance with the security procedures set forth in this regulation.
§ 1312.28
Transmission of classified material.
Prior to the transmission of classified material to offices outside OMB, such material will be enclosed in opaque inner and outer covers or envelopes. The inner cover will be sealed and marked with the classification, and the address of the sender and of the addressee. The receipt for the document, OMB Form 87, (not required for Confidential material) will be attached to or placed within the inner envelope to be signed by the recipient and returned to the sender. Receipts will identify the sender, the addressee, and the document, and will contain no classified information. The outer cover or envelope will be sealed and addressed with no identification of its contents.
(a)
Transmittal of Top Secret material.
The transmittal of Top Secret material shall be by personnel specifically designated by the EOP Security Officer, or by Department of State diplomatic pouch, by a messenger-courier system specifically created for that purpose. Alternatively, it shall be taken to the White House Situation Room for transmission over secure communications circuits.
(b)
Transmittal of Secret material.
The transmittal of Secret material shall be as follows:
(1) Within and between the fifty States, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico: Use one of the authorized means for Top Secret material, or transmit by U.S. Postal Service express or registered mail.
(2) Other Areas. Use the same means authorized for Top Secret, or transmit by U.S. registered mail through Military Postal Service facilities.

# Subpart C—Mandatory Declassification Review
§ 1312.32
Purpose and authority.
Other government agencies, and individual members of the public, frequently request that classified information in OMB files be reviewed for possible declassification and release. This subpart prescribes the procedures for such review and subsequent release or denial. It is issued under the authority of Executive Order 12958 (60 FR 19825, 3 CFR, 1995 Comp., p. 333), as implemented by Information Security Oversight Office Directive No. 1 (32 CFR part 2001).
§ 1312.33
Responsibility.
All requests for the mandatory declassification review of classified information in OMB files should be addressed to the Associate Director (or Assistant Director) for Administration, who will acknowledge receipt of the request. When a request does not reasonably describe the information sought, the requester shall be notified that unless additional information is provided, or the scope of the request is narrowed, no further action will be taken. All requests will receive a response within 180 days of receipt of the request.
§ 1312.34
Information in the custody of OMB.
Information contained in OMB files and under the exclusive declassification jurisdiction of the office will be reviewed by the office of primary interest to determine whether, under the declassification provisions of the Order, the requested information may be declassified. If so, the information will be made available to the requestor unless withholding is otherwise warranted under applicable law. If the information may not be released, in whole or in part, the requestor shall be given a brief statement as to the reasons for denial, a notice of the right to appeal the determination to the Deputy Director, OMB, and a notice that such an appeal must be filed within 60 days in order to be considered.
§ 1312.35
Information classified by another agency.
When a request is received for information that was classified by another agency, the Associate Director (or Assistant Director) for Administration will forward the request, along with any other related materials, to the appropriate agency for review and determination as to release. Recommendations as to release or denial may be made if appropriate. The requester will be notified of the referral, unless the receiving agency objects on the grounds that its association with the information requires protection.
§ 1312.36
Appeal procedure.
Appeals received as a result of a denial, see § 1312.34, will be routed to the Deputy Director who will take action as necessary to determine whether any part of the information may be declassified. If so, he will notify the requester of his determination and make that information available that is declassified and otherwise releasable. If continued classification is required, the requestor shall be notified by the Deputy Director of the reasons thereafter. Determinations on appeals will normally be made within 60 working days following receipt. If additional time is needed, the requestor will be notified and this reason given for the extension. The agency's decision can be appealed to the Interagency Security Classification Appeals Panel.
§ 1312.37
Fees.
There will normally be no fees charged for the mandatory review of classified material for declassification under this section.

(i) May pay the entire invoice on the due date for the commodity with the earliest due date, if it is considered in the best interests of the agency;
(ii) May make split payments by the due date applicable to each category;
(iii) Shall pay in accordance with the contractual payment provisions (which may not exceed the statutory mandated periods specified in paragraph (g)(2) of this section); and
(iv) Shall not require vendors to submit multiple invoices for payment of individual orders by the agency.
(5)
Notification of improper invoice.
When an agency fails to make notification of an improper invoice within seven days according to paragraph (c)(2) of this section (three days for meat and meat food, fish and seafood products; and five days for perishable agricultural commodities, dairy products, edible fats or oils and food products prepared from edible fats or oils), the number of days allowed for payment of the corrected proper invoice will be reduced by the number of days between the seventh day (or the third or fifth day, as otherwise specified in this paragraph (g)(4)) and the day notification was transmitted to the vendor. Calculation of interest penalties, if any, will be based on an adjusted due date reflecting the reduced number of days allowable for payment;
(h)
Payment date.
Payment will be considered to be made on the settlement date for an electronic funds transfer (EFT) payment or the date of the check for a check payment. Payments falling due on a weekend or federal holiday may be made on the following business day without incurring late payment interest penalties.
(i)
Late payment.
When payments are made after the due date, interest will be paid automatically in accordance with the procedures provided in this part.
(j)
Timely payment.
An agency shall make payments no more than seven days prior to the payment due date, but as close to the due date as possible, unless the agency head or designee has determined, on a case-by-case basis for specific payments, that earlier payment is necessary. This authority must be used cautiously, weighing the benefits of making a payment early against the good stewardship inherent in effective cash management practices. An agency may use the “accelerated payment methods” in § 1315.5 when it determines that such earlier payment is necessary.
(k)
Payments for partial deliveries.
Agencies shall pay for partial delivery of supplies or partial performance of services after acceptance, unless specifically prohibited by the contract. Payment is contingent upon submission of a proper invoice if required by the contract.
[64 FR 52586, Sept. 29, 1999, as amended at 65 FR 78405, Dec. 15, 2000]
§ 1315.5
Accelerated payment methods.
(a)
A single invoice under $2,500.
Payments may be made as soon as the contract, proper invoice , receipt and acceptance documents are matched except where statutory authority prescribes otherwise and except where otherwise contractually stipulated (e.g., governmentwide commercial purchase card.) Vendors shall be entitled to interest penalties if invoice payments are made after the payment due date.
(b)
Small business (as defined in FAR 19.001 (48 CFR 19.001)).
Agencies may pay a small business as quickly as possible, when all proper documentation, including acceptance, is received in the payment office and before the payment due date. Such payments are not subject to payment restrictions stated elsewhere in this part. Vendors shall be entitled to interest penalties if invoice payments are made after the payment due date.
(c)
Emergency payments.
Payments related to emergencies and disasters (as defined in the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief Act and Emergency Assistance, Pub. L. 93-288, as amended (42 U.S.C. 5 121
et seq.
); payments related to the release or threatened release of hazardous substances (as defined in the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, Pub. L. 96-510, 42 U.S.C. 9606); and payments made under a military contingency (as defined in 10 U.S.C. 101(a)(13)) may be made as soon as the contract, proper invoice, receipt and acceptance documents or any other agreement are matched. Vendors shall be entitled to interest penalties if invoice payments are made after the payment due date.
(d)
Interim payments under cost-reimbursement contracts for services.
For interim payments under cost-reimbursement service contracts, agency heads may make payments earlier than seven days prior to the payment due date in accordance with agency regulations or policies.
[64 FR 52586, Sept. 29, 1999, as amended at 65 FR 78405, Dec. 15, 2000]
§ 1315.6
Payment without evidence that supplies have been received (fast payment).
(a) In limited situations, payment may be made without evidence that supplies have been received. Instead, a contractor certification that supplies have been shipped may be used as the basis for authorizing payment. Payment may be made within 15 days after the date of receipt of the invoice. This payment procedure may be employed only when all of the following conditions are present:
(1) Individual orders do not exceed $25,000 (except where agency heads permits a higher amount on a case-by-case basis);
(2) Deliveries of supplies are to occur where there is both a geographical separation and a lack of adequate communications facilities between Government receiving and disbursing activities that make it impracticable to make timely payments based on evidence of Federal acceptance;
(3) Title to supplies will vest in the Government upon delivery to a post office or common carrier for mailing or shipment to destination or upon receipt by the Government if the shipment is by means other than the Postal Service or a common carrier; and
(4) The contractor agrees to replace, repair, or correct supplies not received at destination, damaged in transit, or not conforming to purchase requirements.
(b) Agencies shall promptly inspect and accept supplies acquired under these procedures and shall ensure that receiving reports and payment documents are matched and steps are taken to correct discrepancies.
(c) Agencies shall ensure that specific internal controls are in place to assure that supplies paid for are received.
(d) As authorized by the 1988 Amendment to the Prompt Payment Act (Section 11(b)(1)(C)), a contract clause at 48
CFR 52.213-1 is provided in the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) at 48 CFR part 13, subpart 13.4 “Fast Payment Procedure,” for use when using this fast payment procedure.
§ 1315.7
Discounts.
Agencies shall follow these procedures in taking discounts and determining the payment due dates when discounts are taken:
(a)
Economically justified discounts.
If an agency is offered a discount by a vendor, whether stipulated in the contract or offered on an invoice, an agency may take the discount if economically justified (see discount formula in Treasury Financial Manual (TFM) 6-8040.40)
3
but only after acceptance has occurred. Agencies are encouraged to include discount terms in a contract to give agencies adequate time to take the discount if it is determined to be economically justified.
3
The Treasury Financial Manual is available by calling the Prompt Payment Hotline at 800-266-9667 or the Prompt Payment web site at
http://www.fms.treas.gov/prompt/index.html.
(b)
Discounts taken after the discount date.
If an agency takes the discount after the deadline, the agency shall pay an interest penalty on any amount remaining unpaid as prescribed in § 1315.10(a)(6).
(c)
Payment date.
When a discount is taken, payment will be made as close as possible to, but no later than, the discount date.
(d)
Start date.
The period for taking the discount is calculated from the date placed on the proper invoice by the vendor. If there is no invoice date on the invoice by the vendor, the discount period will begin on the date a proper invoice is actually received and date stamped or otherwise annotated by the designated agency office.
§ 1315.8
Rebates.
Agencies shall determine governmentwide commercial purchase card payment dates based on an analysis of the total costs and total benefits to the Federal government as a whole, unless specified in a contract. When calculating costs and benefits, agencies are expected to include the cost to the government of paying early. This cost is the interest the government would have earned, at the Current Value of Funds rate, for each day that payment was not made. Agencies may factor in benefits gained from paying early due to, for example, streamlining the payment process or other efficiencies. A rebate formula is provided in § 1315.17 and at the Prompt Payment website at
www.fms.treas.gov/prompt/index.html.
§ 1315.9
Required documentation.
Agencies are required to ensure the following payment documentation is established to support payment of invoices and interest penalties:
(a) The following information from the contract is required as payment documentation:
(1) Payment due date(s) as defined in § 1315.4(g);
(2) A notation in the contract that partial payments are prohibited, if applicable;
(3) For construction contracts, specific payment due dates for approved progress payments or milestone payments for completed phases, increments, or segments of the project;
(4) If applicable, a statement that the special payment provisions of the Packers and Stockyard Act of 1921 (7 U.S.C. 182(3)), or the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act of 1930 (7 U.S.C. 499a(4)), or Fish and Seafood Promotion Act of 1986 (16 U.S.C. 4003(3)) shall apply;
(5) Where considered appropriate by the agency head, the specified acceptance period following delivery to inspect and/or test goods furnished or to evaluate services performed is stated;
(6) Name (where practicable), title, telephone number, and complete mailing address of officials of the Government's designated agency office, and of the vendor receiving the payments;
(7) Reference to requirements under the Prompt Payment Act, including the payment of interest penalties on late invoice payments (including progress payments under construction contracts);
(8) Reference to requirements under the Debt Collection Improvement Act (Pub. L. 104-134, 110 Stat. 1321), including the requirement that payments must be made electronically except in
situations where the EFT requirement is waived under 31 CFR 208.4. Where electronic payment is required, the contract will stipulate that banking information must be submitted no later than the first request for payment;
(9) If using Fast Payment, the proper FAR clause stipulating Fast Payment is required.
(b)(1) Except for interim payment requests under cost-reimbursement service contracts, which are covered by paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the following correct information constitutes a proper invoice and is required as payment documentation:
(i) Name of vendor;
(ii) Invoice date;
(iii) Government contract number, or other authorization for delivery of goods or services;
(iv) Vendor invoice number, account number, and/or any other identifying number agreed to by contract;
(v) Description (including, for example, contract line/subline number), price, and quantity of goods and services rendered;
(vi) Shipping and payment terms (unless mutually agreed that this information is only required in the contract);
(vii) Taxpayer Identifying Number (TIN), unless agency procedures provide otherwise;
(viii) Banking information, unless agency procedures provide otherwise, or except in situations where the EFT requirement is waived under 31 CFR 208.4;
(ix) Contact name (where practicable), title and telephone number;
(x) Other substantiating documentation or information required by the contract.
(2) An interim payment request under a cost-reimbursement service contract constitutes a proper invoice for purposes of this part if it correctly includes all the information required by the contract or by agency procedures.
(c) Except for interim payment requests under cost-reimbursement service contracts, the following information from receiving reports, delivery tickets, and evaluated receipts is required as payment documentation:
(1) Name of vendor;
(2) Contract or other authorization number;
(3) Description of goods or services;
(4) Quantities received, if applicable;
(5) Date(s) goods were delivered or services were provided;
(6) Date(s) goods or services were accepted;
(7) Signature (or electronic alternative when supported by appropriate internal controls), printed name, telephone number, mailing address of the receiving official, and any additional information required by the agency.
(d) When a delivery ticket is used as an invoice, it must contain information required by agency procedures. The requirements in paragraph (b) of this section do not apply except as provided by agency procedures.
[64 FR 52586, Sept. 29, 1999, as amended at 65 FR 78405, Dec. 15, 2000]
§ 1315.10
Late payment interest penalties.
(a)
Application and calculation.
Agencies will use the following procedures in calculating interest due on late payments:
(1) Interest will be calculated from the day after the payment due date through the payment date at the interest rate in effect on the day after the payment due date;
(2) Adjustments will be made for errors in calculating interest;
(3) For up to one year, interest penalties remaining unpaid at the end of any 30 day period will be added to the principal and subsequent interest penalties will accrue on that amount until paid;
(4) When an interest penalty is owed and not paid, interest will accrue on the unpaid amount until paid, except as described in paragraph (a)(5) of this section;
(5) Interest penalties under the Prompt Payment Act will not continue to accrue:
(i) After the filing of a claim for such penalties under the Contract Disputes Act of 1978 (41 U.S.C. 601
et seq.
); or
(ii) For more than one year;
(6) When an agency takes a discount after the discount date, interest will be paid on the amount of the discount taken. Interest will be calculated for the period beginning the day after the
specified discount date through the date of payment of the discount erroneously taken;
(7) Interest penalties of less than one dollar need not be paid;
(8) If the banking information supplied by the vendor is incorrect, interest under this regulation will not accrue until seven days after such correct information is received (provided that the vendor has been given notice of the incorrect banking information within seven days after the agency is notified that the information is incorrect);
(9) Interest calculations are to be based on a 360 day year; and
(10) The applicable interest rate may be obtained by calling the Department of Treasury's Financial Management Service (FMS) Prompt Payment help line at 1-800-266-9667.
(b)
Payment.
Agencies will meet the following requirements in paying interest penalties:
(1) Interest may be paid only after acceptance has occurred; when title passes to the government in a fast payment contract when title passing to the government constitutes acceptance for purposes of determining when interest may be paid; or when the payment is an interim payment under a cost-reimbursement service contract;
(2) Late payment interest penalties shall be paid without regard to whether the vendor has requested payment of such penalty, and shall be accompanied by a notice stating the amount of the interest penalty, the number of days late and the rate used;
(3) The invoice number or other agreed upon transaction reference number assigned by the vendor should be included in the notice to assist the vendor in reconciling the payment. Additionally, it is optional as to whether or not an agency includes the contract number in the notice to the vendor;
(4) The temporary unavailability of funds does not relieve an agency from the obligation to pay these interest penalties or the additional penalties required under § 1315.11; and
(5) Agencies shall pay any late payment interest penalties (including any additional penalties required under § 1315.11) under this part from the funds available for the administration of the program for which the penalty was incurred. The Prompt Payment Act does not authorize the appropriation of additional amounts to pay penalties.
(c)
Penalties not due.
Interest penalties are not required:
(1) When payment is delayed because of a dispute between a Federal agency and a vendor over the amount of the payment or other issues concerning compliance with the terms of a contract. Claims concerning disputes, and any interest that may be payable with respect to the period, while the dispute is being settled, will be resolved in accordance with the provisions in the Contract Disputes Act of 1978, (41 U.S.C. 601
et seq.
), except for interest payments required under 31 U.S.C. 3902(h)(2);
(2) When payments are made solely for financing purposes or in advance, except for interest payment required under 31 U.S.C. 3902(h)(2);
(3) For a period when amounts are withheld temporarily in accordance with the contract;
(4) When an EFT payment is not credited to the vendor's account by the payment due date because of the failure of the Federal Reserve or the vendor's bank to do so; or
(5) When the interest penalty is less than $1.00.
[64 FR 52586, Sept. 29, 1999, as amended at 65 FR 78405, Dec. 15, 2000]
§ 1315.11
Additional penalties.
(a)
Vendor entitlements.
A vendor shall be entitled to an additional penalty payment when the vendor is owed a late payment interest penalty by an agency of $1.00 or more, if it:
(1) Receives a payment dated after the payment due date which does not include the interest penalty also due to the vendor;
(2) Is not paid the interest penalty by the agency within 10 days after the actual payment date; and
(3) Makes a written request that the agency pay such an additional penalty. Such request must be postmarked, received by facsimile, or by electronic mail, by the 40th day after payment was made. If there is no postmark or if it is illegible, the request will be valid if it is received and annotated with the date of receipt by the agency by the
40th day. The written request must include the following:
(i) Specific assertion that late payment interest is due for a specific invoice, and request payment of all overdue late payment interest penalty and such additional penalty as may be required; and
(ii) A copy of the invoice on which late payment interest was due but not paid and a statement that the principal has been received, and the date of receipt of the principle.
(b)
Maximum penalty.
The additional penalty shall be equal to one hundred (100) percent of the original late payment interest penalty but must not exceed $5,000.
(c)
Minimum penalty.
Regardless of the amount of the late payment interest penalty, the additional penalty paid shall not be less than $25. No additional penalty is owed, however, if the amount of the interest penalty is less than $1.00.
(d)
Penalty basis.
The penalty is based on individual invoices. Where payments are consolidated for disbursing purposes, the penalty determinations shall be made separately for each invoice therein.
(e)
Utility payments.
The additional penalty does not apply to the payment of utility bills where late payment penalties for these bills are determined through the tariff rate-setting process.
§ 1315.12
Payments to governmentwide commercial purchase card issuers.
Standards for payments to government wide commercial purchase card issuers follow:
(a)
Payment date.
All individual purchase card invoices under $2,500 may be paid at any time, but not later than 30 days after the receipt of a proper invoice. Matching documents is not required before payment. The payment due date for invoices in the amount of $2,500 or more shall be determined in accordance with § 1315.8. I TFM 4-4535.10
4
permits payment of the bill in full prior to verification that goods or services were received.
4
See footnote 3 in § 1315.7(a).
(b)
Disputed line items.
Disputed line items do not render the entire invoice an improper invoice for compliance with this proposed regulation. Any undisputed items must be paid in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section.
§ 1315.13
Commodity Credit Corporation payments.
As provided in § 1315.1(d), the provisions of this part apply to payments relating to the procurement of property and services made by the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) pursuant to Section 4(h) of the Act of June 29, 1948 (15 U.S.C. 714b(h)) (“CCC Charter Act”) and payments to which producers on a farm are entitled under the terms of an agreement entered into pursuant to the Agricultural Act of 1949 (7 U.S.C. 1421
et seq.
) (“1949 Act”.) Such payments shall be subject to the following provisions:
(a)
Payment standards.
Payments to producers on a farm under agreements entered into under the 1949 Act and payments to vendors providing property and services under the CCC Charter Act, shall be made as close as possible to the required payment date or loan closing date.
(b)
Interest penalties.
An interest penalty shall be paid to vendors or producers if the payment has not been made by the required payment or loan closing date. The interest penalty shall be paid:
(1) On the amount of payment or loan due;
(2) For the period beginning on the first day beginning after the required payment or loan closing date and, except as determined appropriate by the CCC consistent with applicable law, ending on the date the amount is paid or loaned; and
(3) Out of funds available under Section 8 of the CCC Charter Act (15 U.S.C. 714f).
(c)
Contract Disputes Act of 1978.
Insofar as covered CCC payments are concerned, provisions relating to the Contract Disputes Act of 1978 (41 U.S.C. 601
et seq.
) in § 1315.10(a)(5)(i) and § 1315.6(a) do not apply.
(d)
Extended periods for payment.
Notwithstanding other provisions of this part, the CCC may allow claims for such periods of time as are consistent with authorities applicable to its operations.
§ 1315.14
Payments under construction contracts.
(a)
Payment standards.
Agencies shall follow these standards when making progress payments under construction contracts:
(1) An agency may approve a request for progress payment if the application meets the requirements specified in paragraph (b) of this section;
(2) The certification by the prime vendor as defined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section is not to be construed as final acceptance of the subcontractor's performance;
(3) The agency shall return any such payment request which is defective to the vendor within seven days after receipt, with a statement identifying the defect(s);
(4) A vendor is obligated to pay interest to the Government on unearned amounts in its possession from:
(i) The eighth day after receipt of funds from the agency until the date the vendor notifies the agency that the performance deficiency has been corrected, or the date the vendor reduces the amount of any subsequent payment request by an amount equal to the unearned amount in its possession, when the vendor discovers that all or a portion of a payment received from the agency constitutes a payment for the vendor's performance that fails to conform to the specifications, terms, and conditions of its contract with the agency, under 31 U.S.C. 3905(a); or
(ii) The eighth day after the receipt of funds from the agency until the date the performance deficiency of a subcontractor is corrected, or the date the vendor reduces the amount of any subsequent payment request by an amount equal to the unearned amount in its possession, when the vendor discovers that all or a portion of a payment received from the agency would constitute a payment for the subcontractor's performance that fails to conform to the subcontract agreement and may be withheld, under 31 U.S.C. 3905(e);
(5) Interest payment on unearned amounts to the government under 31 U.S.C. 3905(a)(2) or 3905(e)(6), shall:
(i) Be computed on the basis of the average bond equivalent rates of 91-day Treasury bills auctioned at the most recent auction of such bills prior to the date the vendor received the unearned amount;
(ii) Be deducted from the next available payment to the vendor; and
(iii) Revert to the Treasury.
(b)
Required documentation.
(1) Substantiation of the amount(s) requested shall include:
(i) An itemization of the amounts requested related to the various elements of work specified in the contract;
(ii) A listing of the amount included for work performed by each subcontractor under the contract;
(iii) A listing of the total amount for each subcontract under the contract;
(iv) A listing of the amounts previously paid to each subcontractor under the contract; and
(v) Additional supporting data and detail in a form required by the contracting officer.
(2) Certification by the prime vendor is required, to the best of the vendor's knowledge and belief, that:
(i) The amounts requested are only for performance in accordance with the specifications, terms, and conditions of the contract;
(ii) Payments to subcontractors and suppliers have been made from previous payments received under the contract, and timely payments will be made from the proceeds of the payment covered by the certification, in accordance with their subcontract agreements and the requirements of 31 U.S.C. chapter 39; and
(iii) The application does not include any amounts which the prime vendor intends to withhold or retain from a subcontractor or supplier, in accordance with the terms and conditions of their subcontract.
(c)
Interest penalties.
(1) Agencies will pay interest on:
(i) A progress payment request (including a monthly percentage-of-completion progress payment or milestone payments for completed phases, increments, or segments of any project) that is approved as payable by the agency pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, and remains unpaid for:
(A) A period of more than 14 days after receipt of the payment request by the designated agency office; or
(B) A longer period specified in the solicitation and/or contract if required,
to afford the Government a practicable opportunity to adequately inspect the work and to determine the adequacy of the vendor's performance under the contract;
(ii) Any amounts that the agency has retained pursuant to a prime contract clause providing for retaining a percentage of progress payments otherwise due to a vendor and that are approved for release to the vendor, if such retained amounts are not paid to the vendor by a date specified in the contract, or, in the absence of such a specified date, by the 30th day after final acceptance;
(iii) Final payments, based on completion and acceptance of all work (including any retained amounts), and payments for partial performances that have been accepted by the agency, if such payments are made after the later of:
(A) The 30th day after the date on which the designated agency office receives a proper invoice; or
(B) The 30th day after agency acceptance of the completed work or services. Acceptance shall be deemed to have occurred on the effective date of contract settlement on a final invoice where the payment amount is subject to contract settlement actions.
(2) For the purpose of computing interest penalties, acceptance shall be deemed to have occurred on the seventh day after work or services have been completed in accordance with the terms of the contract.
§ 1315.15
Grant recipients.
Recipients of Federal assistance may pay interest penalties if so specified in their contracts with contractors. However, obligations to pay such interest penalties will not be obligations of the United States. Federal funds may not be used for this purpose, nor may interest penalties be used to meet matching requirements of federally assisted programs.
§ 1315.16
Relationship to other laws.
(a)
Contract Disputes Act of 1978 (41 U.S.C. 605).
(1) A claim for an interest penalty (including the additional penalty for non-payment of interest if the vendor has complied with the requirements of § 1315.9) not paid under this part may be filed under Section 6 of the Contract Disputes Act.
(2) An interest penalty under this part does not continue to accrue after a claim for a penalty is filed under the Contract Disputes Act or for more than one year. Once a claim is filed under the Contract Disputes Act interest penalties under this part will never accrue on the amounts of the claim, for any period after the date the claim was filed. This does not prevent an interest penalty from accruing under Section 13 of the Contract Disputes Act after a penalty stops accruing under this part. Such penalty may accrue on an unpaid contract payment and on the unpaid penalty under this part.
(3) This part does not require an interest penalty on a payment that is not made because of a dispute between the head of an agency and a vendor over the amount of payment or compliance with the contract. A claim related to such a dispute and interest payable for the period during which the dispute is being resolved is subject to the Contract Disputes Act.
(b)
Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 644(k)).
This Act has been amended to require that any agency with an Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization must assist small business concerns to obtain payments, late payment interest penalties, additional penalties, or information due to the concerns.
§ 1315.17
Formulas.
(a)
Rebate formula.
(1) Agencies shall determine credit card payment dates based on an analysis of the total benefits to the Federal government as a whole. Specifically, agencies should compare daily basis points offered by the card issuer with the corresponding daily basis points of the government's Current Value of Funds (CVF) rate. If the basis points offered by the card issuer are greater than the daily basis points of the government” funds, the government will maximize savings by paying on the earliest possible date. If the basis points offered by the card issuer are less than the daily basis points of the government” funds, the government will minimize costs by paying on the Prompt Payment due
date or the date specified in the contract.
(2) Agencies may use a rebate spreadsheet which automatically calculates the net savings to the government and whether the agency should pay early or late. The only variables required for input to this spreadsheet are the CVF rate, the Maximum Discount Rate, that is, the rate from which daily basis points offered by the card issuer are derived, and the amount of debt. This spreadsheet is available for use on the prompt payment website at
www.fms.treas.gov/prompt/index/.html.
(3) If agencies chose not to use the spreadsheet, the following may be used to determine whether to pay early or late. To calculate whether to pay early or late, agencies must first determine the respective basis points. To obtain Daily Basis Points offered by card issuer, refer to the agency's contract with the card issuer. Use the following formula to calculate the average daily basis points of the CVF rate:
(CVF/360) * 100
(4) For example: The daily basis points offered to agency X by card issuer Y are 1.5 basis points. That is, for every day the agency delays paying the card issuer the agency loses 1.5 basis points in savings. At a CVF of 5 percent, the daily basis points of the Current Value of Funds Rate are 1.4 basis points. That is, every day the agency delays paying, the government earns 1.4 basis points. The basis points were calculated using the formula:
(CVF/360) * 100
(5/360) * 100 = 1.4
(5) Because 1.5 is greater than 1.4, the agency should pay as early as possible. If the basis points offered by the card issuer are less than the daily basis points of the government” funds (if for instance the rebate equaled 1.3 basis points and the CVF was still 1.4 basis points or if the rebate equaled 1.5 but the CVF equaled 1.6), the government will minimize costs by paying as late as possible, but by the payment due date.
(b)
Daily simple interest formula.
(1) To calculate daily simple interest the following formula may be used:
P(r/360*d)
Where:
P
is the amount of principle or invoice amount;
r
equals the Prompt Payment interest rate; and
d
equals the numbers of days for which interest is being calculated.
(2) For example, if a payment is due on April 1 and the payment is not made until April 11, a simple interest calculation will determine the amount of interest owed the vendor for the late payment. Using the formula above, at an invoice amount of $1,500 paid 10 days late and an interest rate of 6.5%, the amount of interest owed is calculated as follows:
$1,500 (.065/360*10) = $2.71
(c)
Monthly compounding interest formula.
(1) To calculate interest as required in § 1315.10(a)(3), the following formula may be used:
P(1+r/12)
n
*(1+(r/360*d))−P
Where:
P equals the principle or invoice amount;
r
equals the interest rate;
n
equals the number of months; and
d
equals the number of days for which interest is being calculated.
(2) The first part of the equation calculates compounded monthly interest. The second part of the equation calculates simple interest on any additional days beyond a monthly increment.
(3) For example, if the amount owed is $1,500, the payment due date is April 1, the agency does not pay until June 15 and the applicable interest rate is 6 percent, interest is calculated as follows:
$1,500(1+.06/12)

§ 1320.1
Purpose.
The purpose of this part is to implement the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. chapter 35)(the Act) concerning collections of information. It is issued under the authority of section 3516 of the Act, which provides that “The Director
shall promulgate rules, regulations, or procedures necessary to exercise the authority provided by this chapter.” It is designed to reduce, minimize and control burdens and maximize the practical utility and public benefit of the information created, collected, disclosed, maintained, used, shared and disseminated by or for the Federal government.
§ 1320.2
Effect.
(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, this part takes effect on October 1, 1995.
(b)(1) In the case of a collection of information for which there is in effect on September 30, 1995, a control number issued by the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. Chapter 35, the provisions of this Part shall take effect beginning on the earlier of:
(i) The date of the first extension of approval for or modification of that collection of information after September 30, 1995; or
(ii) The date of the expiration of the OMB control number after September 30, 1995.
(2) Prior to such extension of approval, modification, or expiration, the collection of information shall be subject to 5 CFR part 1320, as in effect on September 30, 1995.
§ 1320.3
Definitions.
For purposes of implementing the Act and this Part, the following terms are defined as follows:
(a)
Agency
means any executive department, military department, Government corporation, Government controlled corporation, or other establishment in the executive branch of the government, or any independent regulatory agency, but does not include:
(1) The General Accounting Office;
(2) Federal Election Commission;
(3) The governments of the District of Columbia and the territories and possessions of the United States, and their various subdivisions; or
(4) Government-owned contractor-operated facilities, including laboratories engaged in national defense research and production activities.
(b)(1)
Burden
means the total time, effort, or financial resources expended by persons to generate, maintain, retain, or disclose or provide information to or for a Federal agency, including:
(i) Reviewing instructions;
(ii) Developing, acquiring, installing, and utilizing technology and systems for the purpose of collecting, validating, and verifying information;
(iii) Developing, acquiring, installing, and utilizing technology and systems for the purpose of processing and maintaining information;
(iv) Developing, acquiring, installing, and utilizing technology and systems for the purpose of disclosing and providing information;
(v) Adjusting the existing ways to comply with any previously applicable instructions and requirements;
(vi) Training personnel to be able to respond to a collection of information;
(vii) Searching data sources;
(viii) Completing and reviewing the collection of information; and
(ix) Transmitting, or otherwise disclosing the information.
(2) The time, effort, and financial resources necessary to comply with a collection of information that would be incurred by persons in the normal course of their activities (e.g., in compiling and maintaining business records) will be excluded from the “burden” if the agency demonstrates that the reporting, recordkeeping, or disclosure activities needed to comply are usual and customary.
(3) A collection of information conducted or sponsored by a Federal agency that is also conducted or sponsored by a unit of State, local, or tribal government is presumed to impose a Federal burden except to the extent that the agency shows that such State, local, or tribal requirement would be imposed even in the absence of a Federal requirement.
(c)
Collection of information
means, except as provided in § 1320.4, the obtaining, causing to be obtained, soliciting, or requiring the disclosure to an agency, third parties or the public of information by or for an agency by means of identical questions posed to, or identical reporting, recordkeeping, or disclosure requirements imposed on, ten or more persons, whether such collection of information is mandatory, voluntary, or required to obtain or retain a benefit. “Collection of information”
includes any requirement or request for persons to obtain, maintain, retain, report, or publicly disclose information. As used in this Part, “collection of information” refers to the act of collecting or disclosing information, to the information to be collected or disclosed, to a plan and/or an instrument calling for the collection or disclosure of information, or any of these, as appropriate.
(1) A “collection of information” may be in any form or format, including the use of report forms; application forms; schedules; questionnaires; surveys; reporting or recordkeeping requirements; contracts; agreements; policy statements; plans; rules or regulations; planning requirements; circulars; directives; instructions; bulletins; requests for proposal or other procurement requirements; interview guides; oral communications; posting, notification, labeling, or similar disclosure requirements; telegraphic or telephonic requests; automated, electronic, mechanical, or other technological collection techniques; standard questionnaires used to monitor compliance with agency requirements; or any other techniques or technological methods used to monitor compliance with agency requirements. A “collection of information” may implicitly or explicitly include related collection of information requirements.
(2) Requirements by an agency for a person to obtain or compile information for the purpose of disclosure to members of the public or the public at large, through posting, notification, labeling or similar disclosure requirements constitute the “collection of information” whenever the same requirement to obtain or compile information would be a “collection of information” if the information were directly provided to the agency. The public disclosure of information originally supplied by the Federal government to the recipient for the purpose of disclosure to the public is not included within this definition.
(3) “Collection of information” includes questions posed to agencies, instrumentalities, or employees of the United States, if the results are to be used for general statistical purposes, that is, if the results are to be used for statistical compilations of general public interest, including compilations showing the status or implementation of Federal activities and programs.
(4) As used in paragraph (c) of this section, “ten or more persons” refers to the persons to whom a collection of information is addressed by the agency within any 12-month period, and to any independent entities to which the initial addressee may reasonably be expected to transmit the collection of information during that period, including independent State, territorial, tribal or local entities and separately incorporated subsidiaries or affiliates. For the purposes of this definition of “ten or more persons,” “persons” does not include employees of the respondent acting within the scope of their employment, contractors engaged by a respondent for the purpose of complying with the collection of information, or current employees of the Federal government (including military reservists and members of the National Guard while on active duty) when acting within the scope of their employment, but it does include retired and other former Federal employees.
(i) Any recordkeeping, reporting, or disclosure requirement contained in a rule of general applicability is deemed to involve ten or more persons.
(ii) Any collection of information addressed to all or a substantial majority of an industry is presumed to involve ten or more persons.
(d)
Conduct or Sponsor.
A Federal agency is considered to “conduct or sponsor” a collection of information if the agency collects the information, causes another agency to collect the information, contracts or enters into a cooperative agreement with a person to collect the information, or requires a person to provide information to another person, or in similar ways causes another agency, contractor, partner in a cooperative agreement, or person to obtain, solicit, or require the disclosure to third parties or the public of information by or for an agency. A collection of information undertaken by a recipient of a Federal grant is considered to be “conducted or sponsored” by an agency only if:
(1) The recipient of a grant is conducting the collection of information at the specific request of the agency; or
(2) The terms and conditions of the grant require specific approval by the agency of the collection of information or collection procedures.
(e)
Director
means the Director of OMB, or his or her designee.
(f)
Display
means:
(1) In the case of forms, questionnaires, instructions, and other written collections of information sent or made available to potential respondents (other than in an electronic format), to place the currently valid OMB control number on the front page of the collection of information;
(2) In the case of forms, questionnaires, instructions, and other written collections of information sent or made available to potential respondents in an electronic format, to place the currently valid OMB control number in the instructions, near the title of the electronic collection instrument, or, for on-line applications, on the first screen viewed by the respondent;
(3) In the case of collections of information published in regulations, guidelines, and other issuances in the
Federal Register,
to publish the currently valid OMB control number in the
Federal Register
(for example, in the case of a collection of information in a regulation, by publishing the OMB control number in the preamble or the regulatory text for the final rule, in a technical amendment to the final rule, or in a separate notice announcing OMB approval of the collection of information). In the case of a collection of information published in an issuance that is also included in the Code of Federal Regulations, publication of the currently valid control number in the Code of Federal Regulations constitutes an alternative means of “display.” In the case of a collection of information published in an issuance that is also included in the Code of Federal Regulations, OMB recommends for ease of future reference that, even where an agency has already “displayed” the OMB control number by publishing it in the
Federal Register
as a separate notice or in the preamble for the final rule (rather than in the regulatory text for the final rule or in a technical amendment to the final rule), the agency also place the currently valid control number in a table or codified section to be included in the Code of Federal Regulations. For placement of OMB control numbers in the Code of Federal Regulations, see 1 CFR 21.35.
(4) In other cases, and where OMB determines in advance in writing that special circumstances exist, to use other means to inform potential respondents of the OMB control number.
(g)
Independent regulatory agency
means the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Federal Communications Commission, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the Federal Housing Finance Board, the Federal Maritime Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the Interstate Commerce Commission, the Mine Enforcement Safety and Health Review Commission, the National Labor Relations Board, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission, the Postal Rate Commission, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and any other similar agency designated by statute as a Federal independent regulatory agency or commission.
(h)
Information
means any statement or estimate of fact or opinion, regardless of form or format, whether in numerical, graphic, or narrative form, and whether oral or maintained on paper, electronic or other media. “Information” does not generally include items in the following categories; however, OMB may determine that any specific item constitutes “information”:
(1) Affidavits, oaths, affirmations, certifications, receipts, changes of address, consents, or acknowledgments; provided that they entail no burden other than that necessary to identify the respondent, the date, the respondent's address, and the nature of the instrument (by contrast, a certification would likely involve the collection of “information” if an agency conducted or sponsored it as a substitute for a
collection of information to collect evidence of, or to monitor, compliance with regulatory standards, because such a certification would generally entail burden in addition to that necessary to identify the respondent, the date, the respondent's address, and the nature of the instrument);
(2) Samples of products or of any other physical objects;
(3) Facts or opinions obtained through direct observation by an employee or agent of the sponsoring agency or through nonstandardized oral communication in connection with such direct observations;
(4) Facts or opinions submitted in response to general solicitations of comments from the public, published in the
Federal Register
or other publications, regardless of the form or format thereof, provided that no person is required to supply specific information pertaining to the commenter, other than that necessary for self-identification, as a condition of the agency's full consideration of the comment;
(5) Facts or opinions obtained initially or in follow-on requests, from individuals (including individuals in control groups) under treatment or clinical examination in connection with research on or prophylaxis to prevent a clinical disorder, direct treatment of that disorder, or the interpretation of biological analyses of body fluids, tissues, or other specimens, or the identification or classification of such specimens;
(6) A request for facts or opinions addressed to a single person;
(7) Examinations designed to test the aptitude, abilities, or knowledge of the persons tested and the collection of information for identification or classification in connection with such examinations;
(8) Facts or opinions obtained or solicited at or in connection with public hearings or meetings;
(9) Facts or opinions obtained or solicited through nonstandardized follow-up questions designed to clarify responses to approved collections of information; and
(10) Like items so designated by OMB.
(i)
OMB
refers to the Office of Management and Budget.
(j)
Penalty
includes the imposition by an agency or court of a fine or other punishment; a judgment for monetary damages or equitable relief; or the revocation, suspension, reduction, or denial of a license, privilege, right, grant, or benefit.
(k)
Person
means an individual, partnership, association, corporation (including operations of government-owned contractor-operated facilities), business trust, or legal representative, an organized group of individuals, a State, territorial, tribal, or local government or branch thereof, or a political subdivision of a State, territory, tribal, or local government or a branch of a political subdivision;
(l)
Practical utility
means the actual, not merely the theoretical or potential, usefulness of information to or for an agency, taking into account its accuracy, validity, adequacy, and reliability, and the agency's ability to process the information it collects (or a person's ability to receive and process that which is disclosed, in the case of a third-party or public disclosure) in a useful and timely fashion. In determining whether information will have “practical utility,” OMB will take into account whether the agency demonstrates actual timely use for the information either to carry out its functions or make it available to third-parties or the public, either directly or by means of a third-party or public posting, notification, labeling, or similar disclosure requirement, for the use of persons who have an interest in entities or transactions over which the agency has jurisdiction. In the case of recordkeeping requirements or general purpose statistics (see § 1320.3(c)(3)), “practical utility” means that actual uses can be demonstrated.
(m)
Recordkeeping requirement
means a requirement imposed by or for an agency on persons to maintain specified records, including a requirement to:
(1) Retain such records;
(2) Notify third parties, the Federal government, or the public of the existence of such records;
(3) Disclose such records to third parties, the Federal government, or the public; or
(4) Report to third parties, the Federal government, or the public regarding such records.
§ 1320.4
Coverage.
(a) The requirements of this part apply to all agencies as defined in § 1320.3(a) and to all collections of information conducted or sponsored by those agencies, as defined in § 1320.3 (c) and (d), wherever conducted or sponsored, but, except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, shall not apply to collections of information:
(1) During the conduct of a Federal criminal investigation or prosecution, or during the disposition of a particular criminal matter;
(2) During the conduct of a civil action to which the United States or any official or agency thereof is a party, or during the conduct of an administrative action, investigation, or audit involving an agency against specific individuals or entities;
(3) By compulsory process pursuant to the Antitrust Civil Process Act and section 13 of the Federal Trade Commission Improvements Act of 1980; or
(4) During the conduct of intelligence activities as defined in section 3.4(e) of Executive Order No. 12333, issued December 4, 1981, or successor orders, or during the conduct of cryptologic activities that are communications security activities.
(b) The requirements of this Part apply to the collection of information during the conduct of general investigations or audits (other than information collected in an antitrust investigation to the extent provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this section) undertaken with reference to a category of individuals or entities such as a class of licensees or an entire industry.
(c) The exception in paragraph (a)(2) of this section applies during the entire course of the investigation, audit, or action, whether before or after formal charges or complaints are filed or formal administrative action is initiated, but only after a case file or equivalent is opened with respect to a particular party. In accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, collections of information prepared or undertaken with reference to a category of individuals or entities, such as a class of licensees or an industry, do not fall within this exception.
§ 1320.5

(
2
) A summary of the collection of information;
(
3

(
4
) A description of the likely respondents, including the estimated number of likely respondents, and proposed frequency of response to the collection of information;
(
5
) An estimate of the total annual reporting and recordkeeping burden that will result from the collection of information;
(
6
) Notice that comments may be submitted to OMB; and
(
7
) The time period within which the agency is requesting OMB to approve or disapprove the collection of information if, at the time of submittal of a collection of information for OMB review under § 1320.10, § 1320.11 or § 1320.12, the agency plans to request or has requested OMB to conduct its review on an emergency basis under § 1320.13; and
(2) OMB has approved the proposed collection of information, OMB's approval has been inferred under § 1320.10(c), § 1320.11(i), or § 1320.12(e), or OMB's disapproval has been voided by an independent regulatory agency under § 1320.15; and
(3) The agency has obtained from the Director a control number to be displayed upon the collection of information.
(b) In addition to the requirements in paragraph (a) of this section, an agency shall not conduct or sponsor a collection of information unless:
(1) The collection of information displays a currently valid OMB control number; and
(2)(i) The agency informs the potential persons who are to respond to the collection of information that such persons are not required to respond to the collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number.
(ii) An agency shall provide the information described in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section in a manner that is reasonably calculated to inform the public.
(A) In the case of forms, questionnaires, instructions, and other written collections of information sent or made available to potential respondents (other than in an electronic format), the information described in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section is provided “in a manner that is reasonably calculated to inform the public” if the agency includes it either on the form, questionnaire or other collection of information, or in the instructions for such collection.
(B) In the case of forms, questionnaires, instructions, and other written collections of information sent or made available to potential respondents in an electronic format, the information described in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section is provided “in a manner that is reasonably calculated to inform the public” if the agency places the currently valid OMB control number in the instructions, near the title of the electronic collection instrument, or, for on-line applications, on the first screen viewed by the respondent.
(C) In the case of collections of information published in regulations, guidelines, and other issuances in the
Federal Register,
the information described in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section is provided “in a manner that is reasonably calculated to inform the public” if the agency publishes such information in the
Federal Register
(for example, in the case of a collection of information in a regulation, by publishing such information in the preamble or the regulatory text, or in a technical amendment to the regulation, or in a separate notice announcing OMB approval of the collection of information). In the case of a collection of information published in an issuance that is also included in the Code of Federal Regulations, publication of such information in the Code of Federal Regulations constitutes an alternative means of providing it “in a manner that is reasonably calculated to inform the public.” In the case of a collection of information published in an issuance that is also included in the Code of Federal Regulations, OMB recommends for ease of future reference that, even where an agency has already provided such information “in a manner that is reasonably calculated to inform the public” by publishing it in the
Federal Register
as a separate notice or in the preamble for the final rule (rather than in the regulatory text for
the final rule or in a technical amendment to the final rule), the agency also publish such information along with a table or codified section of OMB control numbers to be included in the Code of Federal Regulations (see § 1320.3(f)(3)).
(D) In other cases, and where OMB determines in advance in writing that special circumstances exist, to use other means that are reasonably calculated to inform the public of the information described in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section.
(c)(1) Agencies shall submit all collections of information, other than those contained in proposed rules published for public comment in the
Federal Register
or in current regulations that were published as final rules in the
Federal Register,
in accordance with the requirements in § 1320.10. Agencies shall submit collections of information contained in interim final rules or direct final rules in accordance with the requirements of § 1320.10.
(2) Agencies shall submit collections of information contained in proposed rules published for public comment in the
Federal Register
in accordance with the requirements in § 1320.11.
(3) Agencies shall submit collections of information contained in current regulations that were published as final rules in the
Federal Register
in accordance with the requirements in § 1320.12.
(4) Special rules for emergency processing of collections of information are set forth in § 1320.13.
(5) For purposes of time limits for OMB review of collections of information, any submission properly submitted and received by OMB after 12:00 noon will be deemed to have been received on the following business day.
(d)(1) To obtain OMB approval of a collection of information, an agency shall demonstrate that it has taken every reasonable step to ensure that the proposed collection of information:
(i) Is the least burdensome necessary for the proper performance of the agency's functions to comply with legal requirements and achieve program objectives;
(ii) Is not duplicative of information otherwise accessible to the agency; and
(iii) Has practical utility. The agency shall also seek to minimize the cost to itself of collecting, processing, and using the information, but shall not do so by means of shifting disproportionate costs or burdens onto the public.
(2) Unless the agency is able to demonstrate, in its submission for OMB clearance, that such characteristic of the collection of information is necessary to satisfy statutory requirements or other substantial need, OMB will not approve a collection of information—
(i) Requiring respondents to report information to the agency more often than quarterly;
(ii) Requiring respondents to prepare a written response to a collection of information in fewer than 30 days after receipt of it;
(iii) Requiring respondents to submit more than an original and two copies of any document;
(iv) Requiring respondents to retain records, other than health, medical, government contract, grant-in-aid, or tax records, for more than three years;
(v) In connection with a statistical survey, that is not designed to produce valid and reliable results that can be generalized to the universe of study;
(vi) Requiring the use of a statistical data classification that has not been reviewed and approved by OMB;
(vii) That includes a pledge of confidentiality that is not supported by authority established in statute or regulation, that is not supported by disclosure and data security policies that are consistent with the pledge, or which unnecessarily impedes sharing of data with other agencies for compatible confidential use; or
(viii) Requiring respondents to submit proprietary, trade secret, or other confidential information unless the agency can demonstrate that it has instituted procedures to protect the information's confidentiality to the extent permitted by law.
(e) OMB shall determine whether the collection of information, as submitted by the agency, is necessary for the proper performance of the agency's functions. In making this determination, OMB will take into account the criteria set forth in paragraph (d) of
this section, and will consider whether the burden of the collection of information is justified by its practical utility. In addition:
(1) OMB will consider necessary any collection of information specifically mandated by statute or court order, but will independently assess any collection of information to the extent that the agency exercises discretion in its implementation; and
(2) OMB will consider necessary any collection of information specifically required by an agency rule approved or not acted upon by OMB under § 1320.11 or § 1320.12, but will independently assess any such collection of information to the extent that it deviates from the specifications of the rule.
(f) Except as provided in § 1320.15, to the extent that OMB determines that all or any portion of a collection of information is unnecessary, for any reason, the agency shall not engage in such collection or portion thereof. OMB will reconsider its disapproval of a collection of information upon the request of the agency head or Senior Official only if the sponsoring agency is able to provide significant new or additional information relevant to the original decision.
(g) An agency may not make a substantive or material modification to a collection of information after such collection of information has been approved by OMB, unless the modification has been submitted to OMB for review and approval under this Part.
(h) An agency should consult with OMB before using currently approved forms or other collections of information after the expiration date printed thereon (in those cases where the actual form being used contains an expiration date that would expire before the end of the use of the form).
§ 1320.6
Public protection.
(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no person shall be subject to any penalty for failing to comply with a collection of information that is subject to the requirements of this part if:
(1) The collection of information does not display, in accordance with § 1320.3(f) and § 1320.5(b)(1), a currently valid OMB control number assigned by the Director in accordance with the Act; or
(2) The agency fails to inform the potential person who is to respond to the collection of information, in accordance with § 1320.5(b)(2), that such person is not required to respond to the collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number.
(b) The protection provided by paragraph (a) of this section may be raised in the form of a complete defense, bar, or otherwise to the imposition of such penalty at any time during the agency administrative process in which such penalty may be imposed or in any judicial action applicable thereto.
(c) Whenever an agency has imposed a collection of information as a means for proving or satisfying a condition for the receipt of a benefit or the avoidance of a penalty, and the collection of information does not display a currently valid OMB control number or inform the potential persons who are to respond to the collection of information, as prescribed in § 1320.5(b), the agency shall not treat a person's failure to comply, in and of itself, as grounds for withholding the benefit or imposing the penalty. The agency shall instead permit respondents to prove or satisfy the legal conditions in any other reasonable manner.
(1) If OMB disapproves the whole of such a collection of information (and the disapproval is not overridden under § 1320.15), the agency shall grant the benefit to (or not impose the penalty on) otherwise qualified persons without requesting further proof concerning the condition.
(2) If OMB instructs an agency to make a substantive or material change to such a collection of information (and the instruction is not overridden under § 1320.15), the agency shall permit respondents to prove or satisfy the condition by complying with the collection of information as so changed.
(d) Whenever a member of the public is protected from imposition of a penalty under this section for failure to comply with a collection of information, such penalty may not be imposed by an agency directly, by an agency through judicial process, or by any
other person through administrative or judicial process.
(e) The protection provided by paragraph (a) of this section does not preclude the imposition of a penalty on a person for failing to comply with a collection of information that is imposed on the person by statute—e.g., 26 U.S.C. § 6011(a) (statutory requirement for person to file a tax return), 42 U.S.C. § 6938(c) (statutory requirement for person to provide notification before exporting hazardous waste).
§ 1320.7
Agency head and Senior Official responsibilities.
(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, each agency head shall designate a Senior Official to carry out the responsibilities of the agency under the Act and this part. The Senior Official shall report directly to the head of the agency and shall have the authority, subject to that of the agency head, to carry out the responsibilities of the agency under the Act and this part.
(b) An agency head may retain full undelegated review authority for any component of the agency which by statute is required to be independent of any agency official below the agency head. For each component for which responsibility under the Act is not delegated to the Senior Official, the agency head shall be responsible for the performance of those functions.
(c) The Senior Official shall head an office responsible for ensuring agency compliance with and prompt, efficient, and effective implementation of the information policies and information resources management responsibilities established under the Act, including the reduction of information collection burdens on the public.
(d) With respect to the collection of information and the control of paperwork, the Senior Official shall establish a process within such office that is sufficiently independent of program responsibility to evaluate fairly whether proposed collections of information should be approved under this Part.
(e) Agency submissions of collections of information for OMB review, and the accompanying certifications under § 1320.9, may be made only by the agency head or the Senior Official, or their designee.
§ 1320.8
Agency collection of information responsibilities.
The office established under § 1320.7 shall review each collection of information before submission to OMB for review under this part.
(a) This review shall include:
(1) An evaluation of the need for the collection of information, which shall include, in the case of an existing collection of information, an evaluation of the continued need for such collection;
(2) A functional description of the information to be collected;
(3) A plan for the collection of information;
(4) A specific, objectively supported estimate of burden, which shall include, in the case of an existing collection of information, an evaluation of the burden that has been imposed by such collection;
(5) An evaluation of whether (and if so, to what extent) the burden on respondents can be reduced by use of automated, electronic, mechanical, or other technological collection techniques or other forms of information technology, e.g., permitting electronic submission of responses;
(6) A test of the collection of information through a pilot program, if appropriate; and
(7) A plan for the efficient and effective management and use of the information to be collected, including necessary resources.
(b) Such office shall ensure that each collection of information:
(1) Is inventoried, displays a currently valid OMB control number, and, if appropriate, an expiration date;
(2) Is reviewed by OMB in accordance with the clearance requirements of 44 U.S.C. § 3507; and
(3) Informs and provides reasonable notice to the potential persons to whom the collection of information is addressed of—
(i) The reasons the information is planned to be and/or has been collected;
(ii) The way such information is planned to be and/or has been used to further the proper performance of the functions of the agency;
(iii) An estimate, to the extent practicable, of the average burden of the collection (together with a request that the public direct to the agency any comments concerning the accuracy of this burden estimate and any suggestions for reducing this burden);
(iv) Whether responses to the collection of information are voluntary, required to obtain or retain a benefit (citing authority), or mandatory (citing authority);
(v) The nature and extent of confidentiality to be provided, if any (citing authority); and
(vi) The fact that an agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number.
(c)(1) An agency shall provide the information described in paragraphs (b)(3)(i) through (v) of this section as follows:
(i) In the case of forms, questionnaires, instructions, and other written collections of information sent or made available to potential respondents (except in an electronic format), such information can be included either on the form, questionnaire or other collection of information, as part of the instructions for such collection, or in a cover letter or memorandum that accompanies the collection of information.
(ii) In the case of forms, questionnaires, instructions, and other written collections of information sent or made available to potential respondents in an electronic format, such information can be included either in the instructions, near the title of the electronic collection instrument, or, for on-line applications, on the first screen viewed by the respondent;
(iii) In the case of collections of information published in regulations, guidelines, and other issuances in the
Federal Register,
such information can be published in the
Federal Register
(for example, in the case of a collection of information in a regulation, by publishing such information in the preamble or the regulatory text to the final rule, or in a technical amendment to the final rule, or in a separate notice announcing OMB approval of the collection of information).
(iv) In other cases, and where OMB determines in advance in writing that special circumstances exist, agencies may use other means to inform potential respondents.
(2) An agency shall provide the information described in paragraph (b)(3)(vi) of this section in a manner that is reasonably calculated to inform the public (see § 1320.5(b)(2)(ii)).
(d)(1) Before an agency submits a collection of information to OMB for approval, and except as provided in paragraphs (d)(3) and (d)(4) of this section, the agency shall provide 60-day notice in the
Federal Register,
and otherwise consult with members of the public and affected agencies concerning each proposed collection of information, to solicit comment to:
(i) Evaluate whether the proposed collection of information is necessary for the proper performance of the functions of the agency, including whether the information will have practical utility;
(ii) Evaluate the accuracy of the agency's estimate of the burden of the proposed collection of information, including the validity of the methodology and assumptions used;
(iii) Enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information to be collected; and
(iv) Minimize the burden of the collection of information on those who are to respond, including through the use of appropriate automated, electronic, mechanical, or other technological collection techniques or other forms of information technology, e.g., permitting electronic submission of responses.
(2) If the agency does not publish a copy of the proposed collection of information, together with the related instructions, as part of the
Federal Register
notice, the agency should—
(i) Provide more than 60-day notice to permit timely receipt, by interested members of the public, of a copy of the proposed collection of information and related instructions; or
(ii) Explain how and from whom an interested member of the public can request and obtain a copy without charge, including, if applicable, how the public can gain access to the collection of information and related instructions electronically on demand.
(3) The agency need not separately seek such public comment for any proposed collection of information contained in a proposed rule to be reviewed under § 1320.11, if the agency provides notice and comment through the notice of proposed rulemaking for the proposed rule and such notice specifically includes the solicitation of comments for the same purposes as are listed under paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
(4) The agency need not seek or may shorten the time allowed for such public comment if OMB grants an exemption from such requirement for emergency processing under § 1320.13.
§ 1320.9
Agency certifications for proposed collections of information.
As part of the agency submission to OMB of a proposed collection of information, the agency (through the head of the agency, the Senior Official, or their designee) shall certify (and provide a record supporting such certification) that the proposed collection of information—
(a) Is necessary for the proper performance of the functions of the agency, including that the information to be collected will have practical utility;
(b) Is not unnecessarily duplicative of information otherwise reasonably accessible to the agency;
(c) Reduces to the extent practicable and appropriate the burden on persons who shall provide information to or for the agency, including with respect to small entities, as defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601(6)), the use of such techniques as:
(1) Establishing differing compliance or reporting requirements or timetables that take into account the resources available to those who are to respond;
(2) The clarification, consolidation, or simplification of compliance and reporting requirements; or
(3) An exemption from coverage of the collection of information, or any part thereof;
(d) Is written using plain, coherent, and unambiguous terminology and is understandable to those who are to respond;
(e) Is to be implemented in ways consistent and compatible, to the maximum extent practicable, with the existing reporting and recordkeeping practices of those who are to respond;
(f) Indicates for each recordkeeping requirement the length of time persons are required to maintain the records specified;
(g) Informs potential respondents of the information called for under § 1320.8(b)(3);
(h) Has been developed by an office that has planned and allocated resources for the efficient and effective management and use of the information to be collected, including the processing of the information in a manner which shall enhance, where appropriate, the utility of the information to agencies and the public;
(i) Uses effective and efficient statistical survey methodology appropriate to the purpose for which the information is to be collected; and
(j) To the maximum extent practicable, uses appropriate information technology to reduce burden and improve data quality, agency efficiency and responsiveness to the public.
§ 1320.10
Clearance of collections of information, other than those contained in proposed rules or in current rules.
Agencies shall submit all collections of information, other than those contained either in proposed rules published for public comment in the
Federal Register
(which are submitted under § 1320.11) or in current rules that were published as final rules in the
Federal Register
(which are submitted under § 1320.12), in accordance with the following requirements:
(a) On or before the date of submission to OMB, the agency shall, in accordance with the requirements in § 1320.5(a)(1)(iv), forward a notice to the
Federal Register
stating that OMB approval is being sought. The notice shall direct requests for information, including copies of the proposed collection of information and supporting documentation, to the agency, and shall request that comments be submitted to OMB within 30 days of the notice's publication. The notice shall direct comments to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs of OMB, Attention: Desk Officer for [name of agency]. A
copy of the notice submitted to the
Federal Register,
together with the date of expected publication, shall be included in the agency's submission to OMB.
(b) Within 60 days after receipt of the proposed collection of information or publication of the notice under paragraph (a) of this section, whichever is later, OMB shall notify the agency involved of its decision to approve, to instruct the agency to make a substantive or material change to, or to disapprove, the collection of information, and shall make such decision publicly available. OMB shall provide at least 30 days for public comment after receipt of the proposed collection of information before making its decision, except as provided under § 1320.13. Upon approval of a collection of information, OMB shall assign an OMB control number and, if appropriate, an expiration date. OMB shall not approve any collection of information for a period longer than three years.
(c) If OMB fails to notify the agency of its approval, instruction to make substantive or material change, or disapproval within the 60-day period, the agency may request, and OMB shall assign without further delay, an OMB control number that shall be valid for not more than one year.
(d) As provided in § 1320.5(b) and § 1320.6(a), an agency may not conduct or sponsor a collection of information unless the collection of information displays a currently valid OMB control number and the agency informs potential persons who are to respond to the collection of information that such persons are not required to respond to the collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number.
(e)(1) In the case of a collection of information not contained in a published current rule which has been approved by OMB and has a currently valid OMB control number, the agency shall:
(i) Conduct the review established under § 1320.8, including the seeking of public comment under § 1320.8(d); and
(ii) After having made a reasonable effort to seek public comment, but no later than 60 days before the expiration date of the OMB control number for the currently approved collection of information, submit the collection of information for review and approval under this part, which shall include an explanation of how the agency has used the information that it has collected.
(2) The agency may continue to conduct or sponsor the collection of information while the submission is pending at OMB.
(f) Prior to the expiration of OMB's approval of a collection of information, OMB may decide on its own initiative, after consultation with the agency, to review the collection of information. Such decisions will be made only when relevant circumstances have changed or the burden estimates provided by the agency at the time of initial submission were materially in error. Upon notification by OMB of its decision to review the collection of information, the agency shall submit it to OMB for review under this part.
(g) For good cause, after consultation with the agency, OMB may stay the effectiveness of its prior approval of any collection of information that is not specifically required by agency rule; in such case, the agency shall cease conducting or sponsoring such collection of information while the submission is pending, and shall publish a notice in the
Federal Register
to that effect.
§ 1320.11
Clearance of collections of information in proposed rules.
Agencies shall submit collections of information contained in proposed rules published for public comment in the
Federal Register
in accordance with the following requirements:
(a) The agency shall include, in accordance with the requirements in § 1320.5(a)(1)(iv) and § 1320.8(d)(1) and (3), in the preamble to the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking a statement that the collections of information contained in the proposed rule, and identified as such, have been submitted to OMB for review under section 3507(d) of the Act. The notice shall direct comments to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs of OMB, Attention: Desk Officer for [name of agency].
(b) All such submissions shall be made to OMB not later than the day on which the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking is published in the
Federal
Register,
in such form and in accordance with such procedures as OMB may direct. Such submissions shall include a copy of the proposed regulation and preamble.
(c) Within 60 days of publication of the proposed rule, but subject to paragraph (e) of this section, OMB may file public comments on collection of information provisions. The OMB comments shall be in the form of an OMB Notice of Action, which shall be sent to the Senior Official or agency head, or their designee, and which shall be made a part of the agency's rulemaking record.
(d) If an agency submission is not in compliance with paragraph (b) of this section, OMB may, subject to paragraph (e) of this section, disapprove the collection of information in the proposed rule within 60 days of receipt of the submission. If an agency fails to submit a collection of information subject to this section, OMB may, subject to paragraph (e) of this section, disapprove it at any time.
(e) OMB shall provide at least 30 days after receipt of the proposed collection of information before submitting its comments or making its decision, except as provided under § 1320.13.
(f) When the final rule is published in the
Federal Register,
the agency shall explain how any collection of information contained in the final rule responds to any comments received from OMB or the public. The agency shall include an identification and explanation of any modifications made in the rule, or explain why it rejected the comments. If requested by OMB, the agency shall include OMB's comments in the preamble to the final rule.
(g) If OMB has not filed public comments under paragraph (c) of this section, or has approved without conditions the collection of information contained in a rule before the final rule is published in the
Federal Register,
OMB may assign an OMB control number prior to publication of the final rule.
(h) On or before the date of publication of the final rule, the agency shall submit the final rule to OMB, unless it has been approved under paragraph (g) of this section (and not substantively or materially modified by the agency after approval). Not later than 60 days after publication, but subject to paragraph (e) of this section, OMB shall approve, instruct the agency to make a substantive or material change to, or disapprove, the collection of information contained in the final rule. Any such instruction to change or disapprove may be based on one or more of the following reasons, as determined by OMB:
(1) The agency has failed to comply with paragraph (b) of this section;
(2) The agency had substantially modified the collection of information contained in the final rule from that contained in the proposed rule without providing OMB with notice of the change and sufficient information to make a determination concerning the modified collection of information at least 60 days before publication of the final rule; or
(3) In cases in which OMB had filed public comments under paragraph (c) of this section, the agency's response to such comments was unreasonable, and the collection of information is unnecessary for the proper performance of the agency's functions.
(i) After making such decision to approve, to instruct the agency to make a substantive or material change to, or disapprove, the collection of information, OMB shall so notify the agency. If OMB approves the collection of information or if it has not acted upon the submission within the time limits of this section, the agency may request, and OMB shall assign an OMB control number. If OMB disapproves or instructs the agency to make substantive or material change to the collection of information, it shall make the reasons for its decision publicly available.
(j) OMB shall not approve any collection of information under this section for a period longer than three years. Approval of such collection of information will be for the full three-year period, unless OMB determines that there are special circumstances requiring approval for a shorter period.
(k) After receipt of notification of OMB's approval, instruction to make a substantive or material change to, disapproval of a collection of information, or failure to act, the agency shall publish a notice in the
Federal Register
to inform the public of OMB's decision.
(l) As provided in § 1320.5(b) and § 1320.6(a), an agency may not conduct or sponsor a collection of information unless the collection of information displays a currently valid OMB control number and the agency informs potential persons who are to respond to the collection of information that such persons are not required to respond to the collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number.
§ 1320.12
Clearance of collections of information in current rules.
Agencies shall submit collections of information contained in current rules that were published as final rules in the
Federal Register
in accordance with the following procedures:
(a) In the case of a collection of information contained in a published current rule which has been approved by OMB and has a currently valid OMB control number, the agency shall:
(1) Conduct the review established under § 1320.8, including the seeking of public comment under § 1320.8(d); and
(2) After having made a reasonable effort to seek public comment, but no later than 60 days before the expiration date of the OMB control number for the currently approved collection of information, submit the collection of information for review and approval under this part, which shall include an explanation of how the agency has used the information that it has collected.
(b)(1) In the case of a collection of information contained in a published current rule that was not required to be submitted for OMB review under the Paperwork Reduction Act at the time the collection of information was made part of the rule, but which collection of information is now subject to the Act and this part, the agency shall:
(i) Conduct the review established under § 1320.8, including the seeking of public comment under § 1320(8)(d); and
(ii) After having made a reasonable effort to seek public comment, submit the collection of information for review and approval under this part, which shall include an explanation of how the agency has used the information that it has collected.
(2) The agency may continue to conduct or sponsor the collection of information while the submission is pending at OMB. In the case of a collection of information not previously approved, approval shall be granted for such period, which shall not exceed 60 days, unless extended by the Director for an additional 60 days, and an OMB control number assigned. Upon assignment of the OMB control number, and in accordance with § 1320.3(f) and § 1320.5(b), the agency shall display the number and inform the potential persons who are to respond to the collection of information that such persons are not required to respond to the collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number.
(c) On or before the day of submission to OMB under paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section, the agency shall, in accordance with the requirements set forth in § 1320.5(a)(1)(iv), forward a notice to the
Federal Register
stating that OMB review is being sought. The notice shall direct requests for copies of the collection of information and supporting documentation to the agency, and shall request that comments be submitted to OMB within 30 days of the notice's publication. The notice shall direct comments to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs of OMB, Attention: Desk Officer for [name of agency]. A copy of the notice submitted to the
Federal Register,
together with the date of expected publication, shall be included in the agency's submission to OMB.
(d) Within 60 days after receipt of the collection of information or publication of the notice under paragraph (c) of this section, whichever is later, OMB shall notify the agency involved of its decision to approve, to instruct the agency to make a substantive or material change to, or to disapprove, the collection of information, and shall make such decision publicly available. OMB shall provide at least 30 days for public comment after receipt of the proposed collection of information before making its decision, except as provided under § 1320.13.
(e)(1) Upon approval of a collection of information, OMB shall assign an OMB control number and an expiration date. OMB shall not approve any collection of information for a period longer than three years. Approval of any collection
of information submitted under this section will be for the full three-year period, unless OMB determines that there are special circumstances requiring approval for a shorter period.
(2) If OMB fails to notify the agency of its approval, instruction to make substantive or material change, or disapproval within the 60-day period, the agency may request, and OMB shall assign without further delay, an OMB control number that shall be valid for not more than one year.
(3) As provided in § 1320.5(b) and § 1320.6(a), an agency may not conduct or sponsor a collection of information unless the collection of information displays a currently valid OMB control number and the agency informs potential persons who are to respond to the collection of information that such persons are not required to respond to the collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number.
(f)(1) If OMB disapproves a collection of information contained in an existing rule, or instructs the agency to make a substantive or material change to a collection of information contained in an existing rule, OMB shall:
(i) Publish an explanation thereof in the
Federal Register
; and
(ii) Instruct the agency to undertake a rulemaking within a reasonable time limited to consideration of changes to the collection of information contained in the rule and thereafter to submit the collection of information for approval or disapproval under § 1320.10 or § 1320.11, as appropriate; and
(iii) Extend the existing approval of the collection of information (including an interim approval granted under paragraph (b) of this section) for the duration of the period required for consideration of proposed changes, including that required for OMB approval or disapproval of the collection of information under § 1320.10 or § 1320.11, as appropriate.
(2) Thereafter, the agency shall, within a reasonable period of time not to exceed 120 days, undertake such procedures as are necessary in compliance with the Administrative Procedure Act and other applicable law to amend or rescind the collection of information, and shall notify the public through the
Federal Register.
Such notice shall identify the proposed changes in the collections of information and shall solicit public comment on retention, change, or rescission of such collections of information. If the agency employs notice and comment rulemaking procedures for amendment or rescission of the collection of information, publication of the above in the
Federal Register
and submission to OMB shall initiate OMB clearance procedures under section 3507(d) of the Act and § 1320.11. All procedures shall be completed within a reasonable period of time to be determined by OMB in consultation with the agency.
(g) OMB may disapprove, in whole or in part, any collection of information subject to the procedures of this section, if the agency:
(1) Has refused within a reasonable time to comply with an OMB instruction to submit the collection of information for review;
(2) Has refused within a reasonable time to initiate procedures to change the collection of information; or
(3) Has refused within a reasonable time to publish a final rule continuing the collection of information, with such changes as may be appropriate, or otherwise complete the procedures for amendment or rescission of the collection of information.
(h)(1) Upon disapproval by OMB of a collection of information subject to this section, except as provided in paragraph (f)(1)(iii) of this section, the OMB control number assigned to such collection of information shall immediately expire, and no agency shall conduct or sponsor such collection of information. Any such disapproval shall constitute disapproval of the collection of information contained in the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking or other submissions, and also of the preexisting information collection instruments directed at the same collection of information and therefore constituting essentially the same collection of information.
(2) The failure to display a currently valid OMB control number for a collection of information contained in a current rule, or the failure to inform the potential persons who are to respond to the collection of information that such
persons are not required to respond to the collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number, does not, as a legal matter, rescind or amend the rule; however, such absence will alert the public that either the agency has failed to comply with applicable legal requirements for the collection of information or the collection of information has been disapproved, and that therefore the portion of the rule containing the collection of information has no legal force and effect and the public protection provisions of 44 U.S.C. 3512 apply.
(i) Prior to the expiration of OMB's approval of a collection of information in a current rule, OMB may decide on its own initiative, after consultation with the agency, to review the collection of information. Such decisions will be made only when relevant circumstances have changed or the burden estimates provided by the agency at the time of initial submission were materially in error. Upon notification by OMB of its decision to review the collection of information, the agency shall submit it to OMB for review under this Part.
§ 1320.13
Emergency processing.
An agency head or the Senior Official, or their designee, may request OMB to authorize emergency processing of submissions of collections of information.
(a) Any such request shall be accompanied by a written determination that:
(1) The collection of information:
(i) Is needed prior to the expiration of time periods established under this Part; and
(ii) Is essential to the mission of the agency; and
(2) The agency cannot reasonably comply with the normal clearance procedures under this part because:
(i) Public harm is reasonably likely to result if normal clearance procedures are followed;
(ii) An unanticipated event has occurred; or
(iii) The use of normal clearance procedures is reasonably likely to prevent or disrupt the collection of information or is reasonably likely to cause a statutory or court ordered deadline to be missed.
(b) The agency shall state the time period within which OMB should approve or disapprove the collection of information.
(c) The agency shall submit information indicating that it has taken all practicable steps to consult with interested agencies and members of the public in order to minimize the burden of the collection of information.
(d) The agency shall set forth in the
Federal Register
notice prescribed by § 1320.5(a)(1)(iv), unless waived or modified under this section, a statement that it is requesting emergency processing, and the time period stated under paragraph (b) of this section.
(e) OMB shall approve or disapprove each such submission within the time period stated under paragraph (b) of this section, provided that such time period is consistent with the purposes of this Act.
(f) If OMB approves the collection of information, it shall assign a control number valid for a maximum of 90 days after receipt of the agency submission.
§ 1320.14
Public access.
(a) In order to enable the public to participate in and provide comments during the clearance process, OMB will ordinarily make its paperwork docket files available for public inspection during normal business hours. Notwithstanding other provisions of this Part, and to the extent permitted by law, requirements to publish public notices or to provide materials to the public may be modified or waived by the Director to the extent that such public participation in the approval process would defeat the purpose of the collection of information; jeopardize the confidentiality of proprietary, trade secret, or other confidential information; violate State or Federal law; or substantially interfere with an agency's ability to perform its statutory obligations.
(b) Agencies shall provide copies of the material submitted to OMB for review promptly upon request by any person.
(c) Any person may request OMB to review any collection of information
conducted by or for an agency to determine, if, under this Act and this part, a person shall maintain, provide, or disclose the information to or for the agency. Unless the request is frivolous, OMB shall, in coordination with the agency responsible for the collection of information:
(1) Respond to the request within 60 days after receiving the request, unless such period is extended by OMB to a specified date and the person making the request is given notice of such extension; and
(2) Take appropriate remedial action, if necessary.
§ 1320.15
Independent regulatory agency override authority.
(a) An independent regulatory agency which is administered by two or more members of a commission, board, or similar body, may by majority vote void:
(1) Any disapproval, instruction to such agency to make material or substantive change to, or stay of the effectiveness of OMB approval of, any collection of information of such agency; or
(2) An exercise of authority under § 1320.10(g) concerning such agency.
(b) The agency shall certify each vote to void such OMB action to OMB, and explain the reasons for such vote. OMB shall without further delay assign an OMB control number to such collection of information, valid for the length of time requested by the agency, up to three years, to any collection of information as to which this vote is exercised. No override shall become effective until the independent regulatory agency, as provided in § 1320.5(b) and § 1320.6(2), has displayed the OMB control number and informed the potential persons who are to respond to the collection of information that such persons are not required to respond to the collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number.
§ 1320.16
Delegation of approval authority.
(a) OMB may, after complying with the notice and comment procedures of the Administrative Procedure Act, delegate OMB review of some or all of an agency's collections of information to the Senior Official, or to the agency head with respect to those components of the agency for which he or she has not delegated authority.
(b) No delegation of review authority shall be made unless the agency demonstrates to OMB that the Senior Official or agency head to whom the authority would be delegate:
(1) Is sufficiently independent of program responsibility to evaluate fairly whether proposed collections of information should be approved;
(2) Has sufficient resources to carry out this responsibility effectively; and
(3) Has established an agency review process that demonstrates the prompt, efficient, and effective performance of collection of information review responsibilities.
(c) OMB may limit, condition, or rescind, in whole or in part, at any time, such delegations of authority, and reserves the right to review any individual collection of information, or part thereof, conducted or sponsored by an agency, at any time.
(d) Subject to the provisions of this part, and in accordance with the terms and conditions of each delegation as specified in appendix A to this part, OMB delegates review and approval authority to the following agencies:
(1) Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System; and
(2) Managing Director of the Federal Communications Commission.
§ 1320.17
Information collection budget.

Pt. 1320, App. A

# Appendix A to Part 1320—Agencies With Delegated Review and Approval Authority

# 1. The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System
(a) Authority to review and approve collection of information requests, collection of information requirements, and collections of information in current rules is delegated to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.
(1) This delegation does not include review and approval authority over any new collection of information or any modification to an existing collection of information that:
(i) Is proposed to be collected as a result of a requirement or other mandate of the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council, or other Federal executive branch entities with authority to require the Board to conduct or sponsor a collection of information.
(ii) Is objected to by another Federal agency on the grounds that agency requires information currently collected by the Board, that the currently collected information is being deleted from the collection, and the deletion will have a serious adverse impact on the agency's program, provided that such objection is certified to OMB by the head of the Federal agency involved, with a copy to the Board, before the end of the comment period specified by the Board on the
Federal Register
notices specified in paragraph (1)(3)(i) of this section 1.
(iii) Would cause the burden of the information collections conducted or sponsored by the Board to exceed by the end of the fiscal year the Information Collection Budget allowance set by the Board and OMB for the fiscal year-end.
(2) The Board may ask that OMB review and approve collections of information covered by this delegation.
(3) In exercising delegated authority, the Board will:
(i) Provide the public, to the extent possible and appropriate, with reasonable opportunity to comment on collections of information under review prior to taking final action approving the collection. Reasonable opportunity for public comment will include publishing a notice in the
Federal Register
informing the public of the proposed collection of information, announcing the beginning of a 60-day public comment period, and the availability of copies of the “clearance package,” to provide the public with the opportunity to comment. Such
Federal Register
notices shall also advise the public that they may also send a copy of their comments to the Federal Reserve Board and to the OMB/OIRA Desk Officer.
(A) Should the Board determine that a new collection of information or a change in an existing collection must be instituted quickly and that public participation in the approval process would defeat the purpose of the collection or substantially interfere with the Board's ability to perform its statutory obligation, the Board may temporarily approve of the collection of information for a period not to exceed 90 days without providing opportunity for public comment.
(B) At the earliest practical date after approving the temporary extension to the collection of information, the Board will publish a
Federal Register
notice informing the public of its approval of the collection of information and indicating why immediate action was necessary. In such cases, the Board will conduct a normal delegated review and publish a notice in the
Federal Register
soliciting public comment on the intention to extend the collection of information for a period not to exceed three years.
(ii) Provide the OMB/OIRA Desk Officer for the Federal Reserve Board with a copy of the Board's
Federal Register
notice not later than the day the Board files the notice with the Office of the Federal Register.
(iii) Assure that approved collections of information are reviewed not less frequently than once every three years, and that such reviews are normally conducted before the expiration date of the prior approval. Where
the review has not been completed prior to the expiration date, the Board may extend the report, for up to three months, without public notice in order to complete the review and consequent revisions, if any. There may also be other circumstances in which the Board determines that a three-month extension without public notice is appropriate.
(iv) Take every reasonable step to conduct the review established under 5 CFR 1320.8, including the seeking of public comment under 5 CFR 1320.8(d). In determining whether to approve a collection of information, the Board will consider all comments received from the public and other agencies. The Board will not approve a collection of information that it determines does not satisfy the guidelines set forth in 5 CFR 1320.5(d)(2), unless it determines that departure from these guidelines is necessary to satisfy statutory requirements or other substantial need.
(v)(A) Assure that each approved collection of information displays, as required by 5 CFR 1320.6, a currently valid OMB control number and the fact that a person is not required to respond to a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number.
(B) Assure that all collections of information, except those contained in regulations, display the expiration date of the approval, or, in case the expiration date has been omitted, explain the decision that it would not be appropriate, under 5 CFR 1320.5(a)(1)(iii)(C), for a proposed collection of information to display an expiration date.
(C) Assure that each collection of information, as required by 5 CFR 1320.8(b)(3), informs and provides fair notice to the potential respondents of why the information is being collected; the way in which such information is to be used; the estimated burden; whether responses are voluntary, required to obtain or retain a benefit, or mandatory; the confidentiality to be provided; and the fact that an agency may not conduct or sponsor, and the respondent is not required to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number.
(vi) Assure that each approved collection of information, together with a completed form OMB 83-I, a supporting statement, a copy of each comment received from the public and other agencies in response to the Board's
Federal Register
notice or a summary of these comments, the certification required by 5 CFR 1320.9, and a certification that the Board has approved of the collection of information in accordance with the provisions of this delegation is transmitted to OMB for incorporation into OMB's public docket files. Such transmittal shall be made as soon as practical after the Board has taken final action approving the collection. However, no collection of information may be instituted until the Board has delivered this transmittal to OMB.
(b) OMB will:
(1) Provide the Board in advance with a block of control numbers which the Board will assign in sequential order to and display on, new collections of information.
(2) Provide a written notice of action to the Board indicating that the Board approvals of collections of information that have been received by OMB and incorporated into OMB's public docket files and an inventory of currently approved collections of information.
(3) Review any collection of information referred by the Board in accordance with the provisions of section 1(a)(2) of this Appendix.
(c) OMB may review the Board's paperwork review process under the delegation. The Board will cooperate in carrying out such a review. The Board will respond to any recommendations resulting from such review and, if it finds the recommendations to be appropriate, will either accept the recommendations or propose an alternative approach to achieve the intended purpose.
(d) This delegation may, as provided by 5 CFR 1320.16(c), be limited, conditioned, or rescinded, in whole or in part at any time. OMB will exercise this authority only in unusual circumstances and, in those rare instances, will do so, subject to the provisions of 5 CFR 1320.10(f) and 1320.10(g), prior to the expiration of the time period set for public comment in the Board's
Federal Register
notices and generally only if:
(1) Prior to the commencement of a Board review (e.g., during the review for the Information Collection Budget). OMB has notified the Board that it intends to review a specific new proposal for the collection of information or the continued use (with or without modification) of an existing collection;
(2) There is substantial public objection to a proposed information collection: or
(3) OMB determines that a substantially inadequate and inappropriate lead time has been provided between the final announcement date of the proposed requirement and the first date when the information is to be submitted or disclosed. When OMB exercises this authority it will consider that the period of its review began the date that OMB received the
Federal Register
notice provided for in section 1(a)(3)(i) of this Appendix.
(e) Where OMB conducts a review of a Board information collection proposal under section 1(a)(1), 1(a)(2), or 1(d) of this Appendix, the provisions of 5 CFR 1320.13 continue to apply.

# 2. The Managing Director of the Federal Communications Commission
(a) Authority to review and approve currently valid (OMB-approved) collections of
information, including collections of information contained in existing rules, that have a total annual burden of 5,000 hours or less and a burden of less than 500 hours per respondent is delegated to the Managing Director of the Federal Communications Commission.
(1) This delegation does not include review and approval authority over any new collection of information, any collections whose approval has lapsed, any substantive or material modification to existing collections, any reauthorization of information collections employing statistical methods, or any information collections that exceed a total annual burden of 5,000 hours or an estimated burden of 500 hours per respondent.
(2) The Managing Director may ask that OMB review and approve collections of information covered by the delegation.
(3) In exercising delegated authority, the Managing Director will:
(i) Provide the public, to the extent possible and appropriate, with reasonable opportunity to comment on collections of information under review prior to taking final action on reauthorizing an existing collection. Reasonable opportunity for public comment will include publishing a notice in the
Federal Register
and an FCC Public Notice informing the public that a collection of information is being extended and announcing the beginning of a 60-day comment period, notifying the public of the “intent to extend an information collection,” and providing the public with the opportunity to comment on the need for the information, its practicality, the accuracy of the agency's burden estimate, and on ways to minimize burden, including the use of automated, electronic, mechanical, or other technological collection techniques or other forms of information technology, e.g., permitting electronic submission of responses. Such notices shall advise the public that they may also send a copy of their comments to the OMB/Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs desk officer for the Commission.
(A) Should the Managing Director determine that a collection of information that falls within the scope of this delegation must be reauthorized quickly and that public participation in the reauthorization process interferes with the Commission's ability to perform its statutory obligation, the Managing Director may temporarily reauthorize the extension of an information collection, for a period not to exceed 90 days, without providing opportunity for public comment.
(B) At the earliest practical date after granting this temporary extension to an information collection, the Managing Director will conduct a normal delegated review and publish a
Federal Register
notice soliciting public comment on its intention to extend the collection of information for a period not to exceed three years.
(ii) Assure that approved collections of information are reviewed not less frequently than once every three years and that such reviews are conducted before the expiration date of the prior approval. When the review is not completed prior to the expiration date, the Managing Director will submit the lapsed information collection to OMB for review and reauthorization.
(iii) Assure that each reauthorized collection of information displays an OMB control number and, except for those contained in regulations or specifically designated by OMB, displays the expiration date of the approval.
(iv) Inform and provide fair notice to the potential respondents, as required by 5 CFR 1320.8(b)(3), of why the information is being collected; the way in which such information is to be used; the estimated burden; whether responses are voluntary, required, required to obtain or retain a benefit, or mandatory; the confidentiality to be provided; and the fact that an agency may not conduct or sponsor, and the respondent is not required to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number.
(v) Transmit to OMB for incorporation into OMB's public docket files, a report of delegated approval certifying that the Managing Director has reauthorized each collection of information in accordance with the provisions of this delegation. The Managing Director shall also make the certification required by 5 CFR 1320.9, e.g., that the approved collection of information reduces to the extent practicable and appropriate, the burden on respondents, including, for small business, local government, and other small entities, the use of the techniques outlined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act. Such transmittals shall be made no later than 15 days after the Managing Director has taken final action reauthorizing the extension of an information collection.
(vi) Ensure that the personnel in the Commission's functional bureaus and offices responsible for managing information collections receive periodic training on procedures related to meeting the requirements of this part and the Act.
(b) OMB will:
(1) Provide notice to the Commission acknowledging receipt of the report of delegated approval and its incorporation into OMB's public docket files and inventory of currently approved collections of information.
(2) Act upon any request by the Commission to review a collection of information referred by the Commission in accordance with the provisions of section 2(a)(2) of this appendix.
(3) Periodically assess, at its discretion, the Commission's paperwork review process as administered under the delegation. The
Managing Director will cooperate in carrying out such an assessment. The Managing Director will respond to any recommendations resulting from such a review and, if it finds the recommendations to be appropriate, will either accept the recommendation or propose an alternative approach to achieve the intended purpose.
(c) This delegation may, as provided by 5 CFR 1320.16(c), be limited, conditioned, or rescinded, in whole or in part at any time. OMB will exercise this authority only in unusual circumstances.

It is important that each Recognized Statistical Agency or Unit have the capacity to carry out the fundamental responsibilities set forth in this part.
(1) If a parent agency and a Recognized Statistical Agency or Unit determine (
e.g.,
through the agency capacity assessment or other means) that the Recognized Statistical Agency or Unit does not have the capacity to carry out the fundamental responsibilities set forth in this part, the parent agency and the Recognized Statistical Agency or Unit should jointly develop options for addressing capacity needs and, to the extent practicable, make the necessary resources available.
(2) If the Recognized Statistical Agency or Unit determines it does not have the capacity to carry out the fundamental responsibilities set forth in this part, the head of the Recognized Statistical Agency or Unit should submit to the Chief Statistician of the United States and the relevant Resource Management Office in the Office of Management and Budget a written explanation of the capacity deficit, including an estimate of the amount of resources, labor, or other support needed to address the capacity deficit and a detailed description of the anticipated impact of the current capacity.
(3) When a Recognized Statistical Agency or Unit relies on a support component from a parent agency:
(i) The Recognized Statistical Agency or Unit must, to the greatest extent possible, allocate labor resources to ensure that one or more employees, depending on the size of the Recognized Statistical Agency or Unit, are knowledgeable of the support component, its
policies and processes, and best practices for interacting with the support component.
(ii) The parent agency must designate at least one employee of each support component to serve as a liaison for the Recognized Statistical Agency and Unit and ensure each designated employee is knowledgeable of the Recognized Statistical Agency or Unit and its fundamental responsibilities and is capable of effective intra-agency communication.
(iii) The support component and the Recognized Statistical Agency or Unit must work collaboratively to ensure the support component meets the relevant needs of the Recognized Statistical Agency or Unit in a manner that complies with this part and all applicable laws.
(4) When a Recognized Statistical Agency or Unit relies on services or software from a support component:
(i) Prior to making or renewing an award for services or software that will directly affect a Recognized Statistical Agency or Unit's ability to meet the fundamental responsibilities, the relevant support component official must coordinate with the head of the Recognized Statistical Agency or Unit to avoid binding actions and decisions that would conflict with the Recognized Statistical Agency or Unit's ability to carry out its fundamental responsibilities.
(ii) The relevant support component official must ensure that the service or software is sufficient for the Recognized Statistical Agency or Unit to meet its obligation to carry out its fundamental responsibilities. The head of the Recognized Statistical Agency or Unit must clearly communicate the needs of the Recognized Statistical Agency or Unit to meet its obligation to carry out its fundamental responsibilities. If requested by the relevant support component official, the head of the Recognized Statistical Agency or Unit must provide a written list explicitly defining the requirements needed of the service or software to meet its obligation to carry out its fundamental responsibilities.
(iii) If requested by the head of the Recognized Statistical Agency or Unit, the head of the Recognized Statistical Agency or Unit and the head of the support component must enter into a written agreement, and the support component must provide the service or software in accordance with such agreement.
(iv) The Recognized Statistical Agency or Unit may obtain the service or software separately from the parent agency or support component if they are unable to reach an agreement or, at any point in time, the service or software is not able to be supplied in accordance with the agreement.
(v) If the Recognized Statistical Agency or Unit determines it is necessary to obtain services or software separately from the parent agency, the Recognized Statistical Agency or Unit, in coordination with relevant core component officials, must notify the parent agency head. This notification must include an explanation of why it is necessary to obtain services or software separately and an attestation that the Recognized Statistical Agency or Unit remains in compliance with relevant law and policy. If the parent agency is unable to provide the separate service or software, the parent agency, in coordination with the Recognized Statistical Agency or Unit, must notify the Office of Management and Budget in the written explanation required under paragraph (g)(3) of this section.
(i)

Regulations identical to this subpart appear at 5 CFR part 430, subpart D.
§ 1330.401
Purpose.
(a) This subpart implements 5 U.S.C. 5307(d), as added by section 1322 of the Chief Human Capital Officers Act of 2002 (Title XIII of Public Law 107-296, the Homeland Security Act of 2002; November 25, 2002), which provides a higher aggregate limitation on pay for certain members of the Senior Executive Service (SES) under 5 U.S.C. 5382 and 5383 and employees in senior-level (SL) and scientific or professional (ST) positions paid under 5 U.S.C. 5376. In addition, this subpart is necessary to administer rates of basic pay for members of the SES under 5 U.S.C. 5382, as amended by section 1125 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004. The regulations in this subpart strengthen the application of pay-for-performance principles to senior executives and senior professionals. Specifically, the statutory provisions authorize an agency to apply a higher maximum rate of basic pay for senior executives (consistent with 5 CFR part 534, subpart D, when effective) and apply a higher aggregate limitation on pay (consistent with 5 CFR part 530, subpart B) to its senior employees, but only after OPM, with OMB concurrence, has certified that the design and application of the agency's appraisal systems for these employees make meaningful distinctions based on relative performance. This subpart establishes the certification criteria and procedures that OPM will apply in considering agency requests for such certification.
(b) Senior executives generally may receive an annual rate of basic pay up to the rate for level III of the Executive Schedule under 5 U.S.C. 5382 and 5 CFR part 534, subpart D, when effective. Senior employees generally may receive total compensation in a calendar year up to the rate for level I of the Executive Schedule under 5 U.S.C. 5307(a) and 5 CFR 530.203(a). Only employees covered by an appraisal system that OPM, with OMB concurrence, certifies under this subpart are eligible for a maximum annual rate of basic pay for senior executives up to the rate for level II of the Executive Schedule (consistent with 5 U.S.C. 5382 and 5 CFR part 534, subpart D, when effective) and a higher aggregate pay limitation equivalent to the total annual compensation payable to the Vice President (consistent with 5 U.S.C. 5307(d) and 5 CFR 530.203(b)).

§ 1330.403
System certification.
(a) The performance appraisal system(s) covering senior employees must be certified by OPM, with OMB concurrence, as making meaningful distinctions based on relative performance before an agency may apply a maximum annual rate of basic pay for senior executives equal to the rate for level II of the Executive Schedule or apply an annual aggregate limitation on payments to senior employees equal to the salary of the Vice President under 5 U.S.C. 5307(d)). OPM, with OMB concurrence, will certify an agency's appraisal system(s) only when a review of that system's design, application, and administration reveals that the agency meets the certification criteria established in § 1330.404 and has followed the procedures for certifying agency appraisal systems in § 1330.405.
(b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, agencies subject to 5 U.S.C. chapter 43 and 5 CFR part 430 seeking certification of their appraisal systems must submit systems that have been approved by OPM under § 430.312 or § 430.210, as applicable. In some agencies, the performance appraisal system(s) covers employees in many organizations and/or components, and their ability to meet the certification criteria in § 1330.404 may vary significantly. In such cases, an agency may establish and/or submit separate performance appraisal systems for each of these distinct organizations and/or components to ensure timely certification of those performance appraisal system(s) that meet the criteria. New appraisal systems established under 5 CFR part 430, subpart B or C, as applicable based on the employees covered, must be approved by OPM.
(c) When an agency establishes a new appraisal system for the purpose of seeking certification under this subpart, the agency may submit that system for certification even if it has not yet been approved by OPM under § 430.312 or § 430.210, as applicable. OPM will certify, with OMB concurrence, only those systems that OPM determines meet the approval requirements
of 5 CFR part 430, subpart B or C, as applicable.
(d) An agency must establish an appraisal system(s), as defined in § 1330.402, for its senior professionals that meets the requirements of 5 CFR part 430, subpart B, and is separate from the system(s) established to cover its SES members under 5 CFR part 430, subpart C. For the purpose of certification under this subpart, such senior professional appraisal system(s) must meet the certification criteria set forth in § 1330.404. At its discretion, an agency may include system features in its senior professional appraisal system(s) that are the same as, or similar to, the features of its SES appraisal system(s), as appropriate, including procedures that correspond to the higher level review procedures under § 430.308(b) and PRB reviews of summary ratings under § 430.308(c).
(e) For agencies subject to 5 U.S.C. chapter 43 and 5 CFR part 430, OPM approval of the agency performance appraisal system(s) is a prerequisite to certification. Agencies not subject to the appraisal provisions of 5 U.S.C. chapter 43 and 5 CFR part 430 and which are seeking certification of their appraisal system(s) under this subpart must submit appropriate documentation to demonstrate that each system complies with the appropriate legal authority that governs the establishment, application, and administration of that system.
§ 1330.404
Certification criteria.
(a) To be certified, an agency's applicable appraisal system(s) for senior executives or senior professionals must make meaningful distinctions based on relative performance and meet the other requirements of 5 U.S.C. chapter 43, as applicable, in addition to the particular criterion cited here (
i.e.
, consultation). Such system(s) must provide for the following:
(1) Alignment, so that the performance expectations for individual senior employees derive from, and clearly link to, the agency's mission, GPRA strategic goals, program and policy objectives, and/or annual performance plans and budget priorities;
(2) Consultation, so that the performance expectations for senior employees meet the requirements of 5 CFR part 430, subparts B and C, as applicable, and/or other applicable legal authority; are developed with the input and involvement of the individual senior employees who are covered thereby; and are communicated to them at the beginning of the applicable appraisal period, and/or at appropriate times thereafter;
(3) Results, so that the performance expectations for individual senior employees apply to their respective areas of responsibility; reflect expected agency and/or organizational outcomes and outputs, performance targets or metrics, policy/program objectives, and/or milestones; identify specific programmatic crosscutting, external, and partnership-oriented goals or objectives, as applicable; and are stated in terms of observable, measurable, and/or demonstrable performance;
(4) Balance, so that in addition to expected results, the performance expectations for individual senior employees include appropriate measures or indicators of employee and/or customer/stakeholder feedback; quality, quantity, timeliness, and cost effectiveness, as applicable; and those technical, leadership and/or managerial competencies or behaviors that contribute to and are necessary to distinguish outstanding performance;
(5) Appropriate assessments of the agency's performance—overall and with respect to each of its particular missions, components, programs, policy areas, and support functions—such as reports of the agency's GPRA goals, annual performance plans and targets, program performance measures, and other appropriate indicators, as well as evaluation guidelines based, in part, upon those assessments, that are communicated by the agency head, or an individual specifically designated by the agency head for such purpose, to senior employees, appropriate senior employee rating and reviewing officials, and PRB members. These assessments and guidelines are to be provided at the conclusion of the appraisal period but before individual senior employee performance ratings are recommended, so that they may serve as a basis for individual performance evaluations, as appropriate. The guidance
provided may not take the form of quantitative limitations on the number of ratings at any given rating level, and must conform to 5 CFR part 430, subpart B or C, as applicable;
(6) Oversight by the agency head or the individual specifically designated under paragraph (a)(5) of this section, who certifies, for a particular senior employee appraisal system, that—
(i) The senior employee appraisal process makes meaningful distinctions based on relative performance;
(ii) The results of the senior employee appraisal process take into account, as appropriate, the agency's assessment of its performance against program performance measures, as well as other relevant considerations; and
(iii) Pay adjustments, cash awards, and levels of pay based on the results of the appraisal process accurately reflect and recognize individual performance and/or contribution to the agency's performance;
(7) Accountability, so that final agency head decisions and any PRB recommendations regarding senior employee ratings consistent with 5 CFR part 430, subparts B and C, individually and overall, appropriately reflect the employee's performance expectations, relevant program performance measures, and such other relevant factors as the PRB may find appropriate; in the case of supervisory senior employees, ratings must reflect the degree to which performance standards, requirements, or expectations for individual subordinate employees clearly link to organizational mission, GPRA strategic goals, or other program or policy objectives and take into account the degree of rigor in the appraisal of their subordinate employees;
(8) Performance differentiation, so that the system(s) includes at least one summary level of performance above fully successful, including a summary level that reflects outstanding performance, as defined in § 1330.402, and so that its annual administration results in meaningful distinctions based on relative performance that take into account the assessment of the agency's performance against relevant program performance measures, as described in paragraph (a)(6) of this section, employee performance expectations, and such other relevant factors as may be appropriate. Relative performance does not require ranking senior employees against each other; such ranking is prohibited for the purpose of determining performance ratings. For equivalent systems that do not use summary ratings, the appraisal system must provide for clear differentiation of performance at the outstanding level; and
(9) Pay differentiation, so that those senior employees who have demonstrated the highest levels of individual performance and/or contribution to the agency's performance receive the highest annual summary ratings or ratings of record, as applicable, as well as the largest corresponding pay adjustments, cash awards, and levels of pay, particularly above the rate for level III of the Executive Schedule. Agencies must provide for transparency in the processes for making pay decisions, while assuring confidentiality.
(b) Consistent with the requirements in section 3(a) of the Inspector General Act of 1978, an agency's Inspector General or an official he or she designates must perform the functions listed in paragraphs (a)(5) and (6) of this section for senior employees in the Office of the Inspector General.
§ 1330.405
Procedures for certifying agency appraisal systems.
(a)
General.
To receive system certification, an agency must provide documentation demonstrating that its appraisal system(s), in design, application, and administration, meets the certification criteria in § 1330.404 as well as the procedural requirements set forth in this section.
(b)
Certification requests.
In order for an agency's appraisal system to be certified, the head of the agency or designee must submit a written request for full or provisional certification of its appraisal system(s) to OPM. Certification requests may cover an agencywide system or a system that applies to one or more agency organizations or components and must include—
(1) A full description of the appraisal system(s) to be certified, including—
(i) Organizational and employee coverage information;
(ii) Applicable administrative instructions and implementing guidance; and
(iii) The system's use of rating levels that are capable of clearly differentiating among senior employees based on appraisals of their relative performance against performance expectations in any given appraisal period reflecting performance evaluation results that make meaningful distinctions based on relative performance, and which include—
(A) For the agency's senior executives covered by 5 CFR part 430, subpart C, at least four, but not more than five, summary rating levels—an outstanding level, a fully successful level, an optional level between outstanding and fully successful, a minimally satisfactory level, and an unsatisfactory level;
(B) For the agency's senior professionals covered by 5 CFR part 430, subpart B, at least three, but not more than five, summary levels—an outstanding level, a fully successful level, an optional level between outstanding and fully successful, an unacceptable level, and an optional level between fully successful and unacceptable; and
(C) For agencies not subject to 5 CFR part 430, subparts B and C, a summary rating level that reflects outstanding performance or a methodology that clearly differentiates outstanding performance, as defined in § 1330.402;
(2) A clearly defined process for reviewing—
(i) The initial summary ratings and ratings of record, as applicable, of senior employees to ensure that annual summary ratings or ratings of record are not distributed arbitrarily or on a rotational basis, and
(ii) In the case of senior employees with supervisory responsibilities—
(A) The performance standards, requirements, or expectations for the employees they supervise to ensure that they clearly link to organizational mission, GPRA strategic goals, or other program and policy objectives, as appropriate, and
(B) The performance standards, requirements, or expectations and the performance ratings of the employees they supervise to ensure that they reflect distinctions in individual and organizational performance, as appropriate;
(3) Documentation showing that the appraisal system(s) meets the applicable certification criteria, as follows:
(i) For provisional certification, the requirements in § 1330.404(a)(1)-(4); and
(ii) For full certification, all of the requirements in § 1330.404.
(4) For full certification, data on senior executive annual summary ratings and senior professional ratings of record, as applicable (or other documentation for agencies that do not use summary ratings), for the two appraisal periods preceding the request, as well as corresponding pay adjustments, cash awards, and levels of pay provided to those senior employees; and
(5) Any additional information that OPM and OMB may require to make a determination regarding certification.
(c)
Certification actions.
At the request of an agency, the Director of OPM, at his or her discretion and in accordance with the requirements of this subpart and with OMB concurrence, may grant full or provisional certification of the agency's appraisal system(s). OPM, with OMB concurrence, may—
(1) Grant full certification of an agency's senior employee appraisal system(s) for 2 calendar years when an agency has demonstrated that it has designed and fully implemented and applied an appraisal system(s) for its senior executives or senior professionals, as applicable, that meets the certification criteria in § 1330.404 and the documentation requirements of this section.
(2) Grant provisional certification of an agency's senior employee appraisal system(s) for 1 calendar year when an agency has designed, but not yet fully implemented or applied, an appraisal system(s) for its senior executives or senior professionals, as applicable, that meets the certification criteria in § 1330.404. OPM may extend provisional certification into the following calendar year in order to permit an agency to take any actions needed to adjust pay based on annual summary ratings, ratings of record, or other performance appraisal results determined during the
calendar year for which the system was certified; or
(3) Suspend certification under paragraph (h) of this section if, at any time during the certification period, OPM, with OMB concurrence, determines that the agency appraisal system is not in compliance with certification criteria.
(d)
Pay limitations.
Absent full or provisional certification of its appraisal system(s), an agency must—
(1) Set a senior executive's rate of basic pay at a rate that does not exceed the rate for level III of the Executive Schedule, consistent with 5 CFR part 534, subpart D, when effective; and
(2) Limit aggregate compensation paid to senior employees in a calendar year to the rate for level I of the Executive Schedule, consistent with 5 CFR 530.203(b).
(e)
Full certification.
(1) OPM, with OMB concurrence, may grant full certification when a review of the agency's request and accompanying documentation demonstrates that the design, application, and administration of the agency's appraisal system(s) meet the criteria in § 1330.404 and the documentation requirements of this section.
(2) An agency with a fully-certified appraisal system(s) may set the rate of basic pay under 5 CFR part 534, subpart D, when effective, for a senior executive covered by a certified system at a rate that does not exceed the rate for level II of the Executive Schedule and pay senior employees covered by certified system(s) aggregate compensation in a certified calendar year in an amount up to the Vice President's salary under 3 U.S.C. 104.
(3) Full certification of an agency's appraisal system will be renewed automatically for an additional 2 calendar years, if—
(i) The agency meets the annual reporting requirements in paragraph (g) of this section; and
(ii) Based on those annual reports, OPM determines, and OMB concurs, that the appraisal system(s) continues to meet the certification criteria and procedural requirements set forth in this subpart.
(f)
Provisional certification.
(1) OPM, with OMB concurrence, may grant provisional certification when the design of an agency's appraisal system(s) for senior executives or senior professionals, as applicable, meets the requirements set forth in this subpart, but insufficient documentation exists to determine whether the actual application and administration of the appraisal system(s) meet the requirements for full certification. OPM, with OMB concurrence, may grant provisional certification to an agency more than once.
(2) During the 1-year period of provisional certification, an agency may set the rate of basic pay for a senior executive covered by the provisionally certified system at a rate that does not exceed the rate for level II of the Executive Schedule (consistent with 5 CFR part 534, subpart D, when effective) and pay senior employees covered by provisionally certified systems aggregate compensation in the certified calendar year in an amount up to the Vice President's salary under 3 U.S.C. 104 (consistent with 5 CFR part 530, subpart B).
(3) An agency must resubmit an application requesting provisional certification for every calendar year for which it intends to maintain provisional certification. An agency with a provisionally certified appraisal system(s) may request that OPM, with OMB concurrence, grant full certification upon a showing that its performance appraisal systems for senior executives and senior professionals, as applicable, meet the certification criteria in § 1330.404 and the documentation requirements in this section, particularly with respect to the implementation and administration of the system(s) over at least two consecutive performance appraisal periods.
(g)
Annual reporting requirement.
Agencies with certified appraisal systems must provide OPM with a general summary of the annual summary ratings and ratings of record, as applicable, and rates of basic pay, pay adjustments, cash awards, and aggregate total compensation (including any lump-sum payments in excess of the applicable aggregate limitation on pay that were paid in the current calendar year as required by § 530.204) for their senior employees covered by a certified
appraisal system at the conclusion of each appraisal period that ends during a calendar year for which the certification is in effect, in accordance with OPM instructions.
(h)
Suspension of certification.
(1) When OPM determines that an agency's certified appraisal system is no longer in compliance with certification criteria, OPM, with OMB concurrence, may suspend such certification, as provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this section.
(2) An agency's system certification is automatically suspended when OPM withdraws performance appraisal system approval or mandates corrective action because of misapplication of the system as authorized under §§ 430.210(c), 430.312(c), and 1330.403(e).
(3) OPM will notify the head of the agency at least 30 calendar days in advance of the suspension and the reason(s) for the suspension, as well as any expected corrective action. Upon such notice, and until its system certification is reinstated, the agency must set a senior executive's rate of basic pay under 5 CFR part 534, subpart D, when effective, at a rate that does not exceed the rate for level III of the Executive Schedule. While certification is suspended, an agency must limit aggregate compensation received in a calendar year by a senior employee to the rate for level I of the Executive Schedule. Pay adjustments, cash awards, and levels of pay in effect prior to that notice will remain in effect unless OPM finds that any such decision and subsequent action was in violation of law, rule, or regulation.
(4) OPM, with OMB concurrence, may reinstate an agency's suspended certification only after the agency has taken appropriate corrective action.
(5) OPM may reinstate the certification of an appraisal system that has been automatically suspended under paragraph (h)(2) of this section upon the agency's compliance with the applicable OPM-mandated corrective action(s).

# Subpart B—Designation and Investigative Requirements
§ 1400.201
Sensitivity level designations and investigative requirements.
(a) For purposes of this part, the head of each agency must designate, or cause to be designated, a position within the department or agency as a national security position pursuant to § 1400.102(a). National security positions must then be designated, based on the degree of potential damage to the national security, at one of the following three sensitivity levels:
(1) Noncritical-Sensitive positions are national security positions which have the potential to cause significant or serious damage to the national security, including but not limited to:
(i) Positions requiring eligibility for access to Secret, Confidential, or “L” classified information; or
(ii) Positions not requiring eligibility for access to classified information, but having the potential to cause significant or serious damage to the national security.
(2) Critical-Sensitive positions are national security positions which have the potential to cause exceptionally grave damage to the national security, including but not limited to:
(i) Positions requiring eligibility for access to Top Secret or “Q” classified information;
(ii) Positions not requiring eligibility for access to classified information, but having the potential to cause exceptionally grave damage to the national security;
(iii) Positions involving development or approval of war plans, major or special military operations, or critical and extremely important items of war;
(iv) National security policy-making or policy-determining positions;
(v) Positions with investigative duties, including handling of completed counterintelligence or background investigations, the nature of which have the potential to cause exceptionally grave damage to the national security;
(vi) Positions involving national security adjudicative determinations or granting of personnel security clearance eligibility;
(vii) Positions involving duty on personnel security boards;
(viii) Senior management positions in key programs, the compromise of which could result in exceptionally grave damage to the national security;
(ix) Positions having direct involvement with diplomatic relations and negotiations;
(x) Positions involving independent responsibility for planning or approving continuity of Government operations;
(xi) Positions involving major and immediate responsibility for, and the ability to act independently without detection to compromise or exploit, the protection, control, and safety of the nation's borders and ports or immigration or customs control or policies, where there is a potential to cause exceptionally grave damage to the national security;
(xii) Positions involving major and immediate responsibility for, and the ability to act independently without detection to compromise or exploit, the design, installation, operation, or maintenance of critical infrastructure systems or programs;
(xiii) Positions in which the occupants have the ability to independently damage public health and safety with devastating results;
(xiv) Positions in which the occupants have the ability to independently compromise or exploit biological select agents or toxins, chemical agents, nuclear materials, or other hazardous materials;
(xv) Positions in which the occupants have the ability to independently compromise or exploit the nation's nuclear or chemical weapons designs or systems;
(xvi) Positions in which the occupants obligate, expend, collect or control revenue, funds or items with monetary value in excess of $50 million, or procure or secure funding for goods and/or services with monetary value in excess of $50 million annually, with the potential for exceptionally grave damage to the national security;
(xvii) Positions in which the occupants have unlimited access to and control over unclassified information, which may include private, proprietary or other controlled unclassified information, but only where the unauthorized disclosure of that information could cause exceptionally grave damage to the national security;
(xviii) Positions in which the occupants have direct, unrestricted control over supplies of arms, ammunition, or explosives or control over any weapons of mass destruction;
(xix) Positions in which the occupants have unlimited access to or control of access to designated restricted areas or restricted facilities that maintain national security information classified at the Top Secret or “Q” level;
(xx) Positions working with significant life-critical/mission-critical systems, such that compromise or exploitation of those systems would cause exceptionally grave damage to essential Government operations or national infrastructure; or
(xxi) Positions in which the occupants conduct internal and/or external investigation, inquiries, or audits related to the functions described in paragraphs (a)(2)(i) through (xx) of this section, where the occupant's neglect, action, or inaction could cause exceptionally grave damage to the national security.
(3) Special-Sensitive positions are those national security positions which have the potential to cause inestimable damage to the national security, including but not limited to positions requiring eligibility for access to Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI), requiring eligibility for access to any other intelligence-related Special Sensitive information, requiring involvement in Top Secret Special Access Programs (SAP), or positions which the agency head determines must be designated higher than Critical-Sensitive consistent with Executive order.
(b) OPM and ODNI issue, and periodically revise, a Position Designation System which describes in greater detail agency requirements for designating positions that could bring about a material adverse effect on the national security. Agencies must use the Position Designation System to designate the sensitivity level of each position covered by this part. All positions receiving a position sensitivity designation under this part shall also receive a risk designation under 5 CFR part 731 (see 5 CFR 731.106) as provided in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section.
(c) Any position receiving a position sensitivity designation under this part at the critical-sensitive or special-sensitive level shall automatically carry with that designation, without further agency action, a risk designation under 5 CFR 731.106 at the high level.
(d) Any position receiving a position sensitivity designation at the noncritical-sensitive level shall automatically carry with that designation, without further agency action, a risk designation under 5 CFR 731.106 at the moderate level, unless the agency determines that the position should be designated at the high level. Agencies shall designate the position at the high level where warranted on the basis of criteria set forth in OPM issuances as described in § 731.102(c) of this title.
§ 1400.202
Waivers and exceptions to preappointment investigative requirements.
(a)
Waivers
—(1)
General.
A waiver of the preappointment investigative requirement contained in section 3(b) of Executive Order 10450 for employment in a national security position may be made only for a limited period:
(i) In case of emergency if the head of the department or agency concerned finds that such action is necessary in the national interest; and
(ii) When such finding is made a part of the records of the department or agency.
(2)
Specific waiver requirements.
(i) The preappointment investigative requirement may not be waived for appointment to positions designated Special-Sensitive under this part.
(ii) For positions designated Critical-Sensitive under this part, the records of the department or agency required by paragraph (a)(1) of this section must document the decision as follows:
(A) The nature of the emergency which necessitates an appointment prior to completion of the investigation and adjudication process;
(B) A record demonstrating the successful initiation of the required investigation based on a completed questionnaire; and
(C) A record of the Federal Bureau of Investigation fingerprint check portion of the required investigation supporting a preappointment waiver.
(iii) When a waiver for a position designated Noncritical-Sensitive is granted under this part, the agency head will determine documentary requirements needed to support the waiver decision. In these cases, the agency must favorably evaluate the completed questionnaire and expedite the submission of the request for an investigation at the appropriate level.
(iv) When waiving the preappointment investigation requirements, the applicant must be notified that the preappointment decision was made based on limited information, and that the ultimate appointment decision depends upon favorable completion and adjudication of the full investigative results.
(b)
Exceptions to investigative requirements.
Pursuant to section 3(a) of E.O. 10450, upon request of an agency head, the Office of Personnel Management may, in its discretion, authorize such less investigation as may meet the requirement of national security with respect to:
(1) Positions that are intermittent, seasonal, per diem, or temporary, not to exceed an aggregate of 180 days in either a single continuous appointment or series of appointments; or
(2) Positions filled by aliens employed outside the United States.
(c)
Applicability.
This section does not apply to:
(1) Investigations, waivers of investigative requirements, and exceptions from investigative requirements under 42 U.S.C. 2165(b);
(2) Investigative requirements for eligibility for access to classified information under Executive Order 12968; or
(3) Standards for temporary eligibility for access to classified information established by the Security Executive Agent pursuant to section 3.3(a)(2) of Executive Order 12968.
§ 1400.203
Periodic reinvestigation requirements.
(a) The incumbent of a national security position requiring eligibility for access to classified information is subject to the reinvestigation requirements of E.O. 12968.
(b) The incumbent of a national security position that does not require eligibility for access to classified information is subject to periodic reinvestigation at least once every five years. Such reinvestigation must be conducted using a national security questionnaire, and at a frequency and scope
that will satisfy the reinvestigation requirements for both national security and public trust positions.
§ 1400.204
Reassessment of current positions.
(a) Agency heads must assess each position covered by this part within the agency using the standards set forth in this regulation as well as guidance provided in OPM issuances to determine whether changes in position sensitivity designations are necessary within 24 months of July 6, 2015.
(b) Where the sensitivity designation of the position is changed, and requires a higher level of investigation than was previously required for the position,
(1) The agency must initiate the investigation no later than 14 working days after the change in designation; and
(2) The agency will determine whether the incumbent's retention in sensitive duties pending the outcome of the investigation is consistent with the national security.
(c) Agencies may provide advance notice of the redesignation of a position to allow time for completion of the forms, releases, and other information needed from the incumbent to initiate the investigation.
(d) Agencies may request an extension, pursuant to guidance issued jointly by OPM and ODNI, of the timeframe for redesignation of positions or initiation of reinvestigations, if justified by severe staffing, budgetary, or information technology constraints, or emergency circumstances.
§ 1400.205
Savings provision.
No provision of the rule in this part may be applied to make an adverse inference in pending administrative proceedings. However, the redesignation of a position may require that the occupant of that position undergo a new adjudication. An administrative proceeding is deemed to be pending from the date of the agency or OPM notice described in § 1400.301(c)(1).

# Subpart C—Procedural Rights and Reporting
§ 1400.301
Procedural rights.
When an agency makes an adjudicative decision based on an OPM investigation or an investigation conducted under an OPM delegation of authority, or when an agency, as a result of information in such an investigation, changes a tentative favorable placement or clearance decision to an unfavorable decision, the agency must comply with all applicable administrative procedural requirements, as provided by law, rule, regulation, or Executive order, including E.O. 12968, and the agency's own procedural regulations, and must:
(a) Ensure that the records used in making the decision are accurate, relevant, timely, and complete to the extent reasonably necessary to assure fairness to the individual in any determination;
(b) Consider all available, relevant information in reaching its final decision; and
(c) At a minimum, subject to requirements of law, rule, regulation, or Executive order:
(1) Provide the individual concerned notice of the specific reason(s) for the decision, an opportunity to respond, and notice of appeal rights, if any; and
(2) Keep any record of the agency action required by OPM as published in its issuances.

(c) To comply with process efficiency requirements, additional data may be collected from agencies conducting investigations or taking action under this part. These collections will be identified in separate OPM and ODNI guidance, issued as necessary under § 1400.103.

§ 1501.8
Grounds for determinations of the Board.
(a)
Standard.
The standard to be used by the Board in making any advisory determination relating to the loyalty of a United States citizen who is an employee of, or is being considered for employment in, a public international organization of which the United States is a member, shall be whether or not on all the evidence there is a reasonable doubt as to the loyalty of the person involved to the Government of the United States.
(b)
Activities and associations.
Among the activities and associations of the employee or person being considered for employment which may be considered in connection with a determination of disloyalty may be one or more of the following:

(2) Treason or sedition or advocacy thereof.
(3) Advocacy of revolution or force or violence to alter the constitutional form of government of the United States.

(6) Membership in, or affiliation or sympathetic association with, any foreign or domestic organization, association, movement, or group or combination of persons, designated by the Attorney General as totalitarian, fascist, communist, or subversive, or as having adopted a policy of advocating or approving the commission of acts of force or violence to deny other persons their rights under the Constitution of the United States, or as seeking to alter the form of government of the United States by unconstitutional means.
§ 1501.9
Cases reviewable by the Board.
All cases in which an investigation has been made under Executive Order 10422, as amended, shall be referred to and reviewed by the Board in accordance with the Executive Order and the rules and regulations of the Board.
§ 1501.10
Consideration of reports of investigation.
(a) In all cases the Board shall consider the reports of investigation in the light of the standard as set forth in § 1501.8 and shall determine whether such reports warrant a finding favorable to the individual or appear to call for further processing of the case with a view to a possible unfavorable determination.
(b) If the Board reaches a favorable conclusion in a case involving a question of loyalty, it shall make a determination that on all the evidence there is not a reasonable doubt as to the individual's loyalty.
(c) If the Board determines that the reports do not warrant a finding favorable to the individual, or the Board determines that the evidence is of such a nature that a hearing may be required before a final decision is made, the Board shall send by registered mail, or in such other manner as the Board in a particular case may decide, a written interrogatory to the individual. Such interrogatory shall state the nature of
the evidence against him, setting forth with particularity the facts and circumstances involved, in as much detail as security conditions permit, in order to enable him to submit his answer, defense or explanation and to submit affidavits. It will also inform the applicant or employee, of his opportunity to reply to the interrogatory in writing, under oath or affirmation, within ten (10) calendar days of the date of receipt by him of the interrogatory or such longer time as the Board in specific cases may prescribe, and of his opportunity for a hearing on the issues before the Board or a panel of the Board, including his right to appear personally at such hearing, to be represented by counsel of a representative of his own choosing, to present evidence in his own behalf, and to cross-examine witnesses offered in support of the derogatory information.
§ 1501.11
Consideration of complete file before hearing.
(a) Following delivery to the applicant or employee of the interrogatory and after expiration of the time limit for filing an answer to the interrogatory, the Board shall proceed to consider the case on the complete file, including the answer, if any, to the interrogatory.
(b) If, upon such consideration, the Board concludes that a finding favorable to the individual may be made, no hearing shall be required.
(c) If, upon such consideration, the Board concludes that a determination favorable to the individual cannot be made on the basis of the information in the file, it shall set a time and place for a hearing and shall give notice thereof to the individual.
§ 1501.12
Obtaining further information.
At any stage in its review and consideration of a case, if the Board deems it advisable or necessary to obtain information or clarification of any matter, the Board may request further investigation, or submit a written questionnaire to the individual whose case is before the Board, or request such individual to furnish information in an oral interview.
§ 1501.13
Conduct of hearings.
(a) Not less than three members of a panel of the Board shall be present at all hearings. The Board shall conduct its hearings in such manner as to protect from disclosure information affecting the national security. The chairman of the panel shall preside and be responsible for the maintenance of decorum and order in the hearing.
(b) Attendance at hearings shall be limited to the applicant or employee, his attorney or representative, the panel of the Board assigned to the case, Board members, Board staff employees participating in the case, the witness who is testifying, and such other persons as in the opinion of the panel are required for the proper presentation of the case. Representation for an applicant or employee shall be limited to one attorney or representative and one bona fide assistant, both representing the applicant or employee only.
(c) Hearings shall begin with the reading of the interrogatory. The applicant or employee shall thereupon be informed of his right to participate in the hearing, to be represented by counsel, to present witnesses and other evidence in his behalf, and to cross-examine witnesses offered in support of the derogatory information.
(d) Testimony shall be given under oath or affirmation.
(e) Strict legal rules of evidence shall not be applied at the hearings, but reasonable bounds shall be maintained as to competency, relevancy, and materiality and due allowance shall be made for the effect of any nondisclosure to the individual of information or the absence of any opportunity to cross-examine persons who supplied information but who do not appear and testify. Both the Government and the applicant or employee may introduce such evidence as the panel may deem proper in the particular case.
(f) A complete verbatim stenographic transcript shall be made of the hearing, and the transcript shall constitute a permanent part of the record.
(g) Applicants and employees must pay their own travel and subsistence expenses incident to attendance at hearings, except that the Board may authorize the payment of travel and subsistence expenses to applicants or
employees when the hearing is held at a place other than the place outside the continental limits of the United States where the employee works, or the applicant resides, and such payment is considered in the interest of good administration and funds are available for this purpose.
[18 FR 6371, Oct. 7, 1953, as amended at 21 FR 5249, July 14, 1956]
§ 1501.14
Decision of the Board.
After the employee or person being considered for employment has been given a hearing, the Board shall promptly make its decision. The determination of the Board shall be in writing and shall be signed by the members of the panel. It shall state the action taken, together with the reasons therefor, and shall be made a permanent part of the file in every case.
§ 1501.15
Transmission of Determination to the Secretary of State.
The Board shall transmit its determination in each case to the Secretary of State for transmission to the Secretary General of the United Nations, or the executive head of any other public international organization concerned. In each case in which the Board determines that, on all the evidence, there is a reasonable doubt as to the loyalty of the person involved to the Government of the United States, it shall also transmit a statement of the reasons for the Board's determination in as much detail as the Board deems that security considerations permit.
§ 1501.16
Notification of individual concerned.
A copy of the determination of the Board, but not of the statement of reasons, shall be furnished in each case to the person who is the subject thereof.

§ 1600.21
Contributions in whole percentages or whole dollar amounts.
(a) Civilian employees may elect to contribute a percentage of basic pay or a dollar amount, subject to the limits described in § 1600.22.

If a participant elects to contribute a dollar amount to his or her traditional balance and a dollar amount to his or her Roth balance, but the total dollar amount elected is more than the amount available to be deducted from the participant's basic pay, the employing agency will deduct traditional contributions first and Roth contributions second.
(b) Uniformed services members may elect to contribute from basic pay and, if they elect to contribute from basic pay, special or incentive pay (including bonus pay) subject to the limits described in § 1600.22. The election may be expressed as a whole percentage, a dollar amount, or both as determined by the member's service.
[77 FR 26423, May 4, 2012, as amended at 87 FR 31672, May 24, 2022]

# Subpart D—Rollovers From Other Qualified Retirement Plans

# Source:
87 FR 31672, May 24, 2022, unless otherwise noted.
§ 1600.30
Accounts eligible for rollover.
(a) A participant who has an open TSP account and is entitled to receive (or receives) an eligible rollover distribution from an eligible employer plan within the meaning of section 402(c) of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 402(c)), or from a traditional IRA may roll over that distribution into his or her existing TSP account in accordance with § 1600.31.
(b) The only balances that the TSP record keeper will accept are balances that would otherwise be includible in gross income if the distribution were paid to the participant. The TSP record keeper will not accept any balances that have already been subjected to Federal income tax (after-tax monies) or balances from a uniformed services TSP account that will not be subject to Federal income tax (tax-exempt monies).
(c) Notwithstanding paragraph (b) of this section, the TSP record keeper will accept Roth funds that are transferred via direct rollover from an eligible employer plan that maintains a qualified Roth contribution program described in section 402A of the Internal Revenue Code.
(d) The TSP record keeper will accept a rollover only to the extent the rollover is permitted by the Internal Revenue Code.
§ 1600.31
Methods for rolling over eligible rollover distribution to the TSP.
(a)
Direct rollover.
(1) A participant may request that the administrator or trustee of an eligible employer plan or traditional IRA roll over any or all of his or her account directly to the TSP in the form and manner prescribed by the TSP record keeper. The administrator or trustee must provide to the
TSP record keeper the distribution, information about the type of money included in the distribution (
i.e.,
tax-deferred and/or Roth amounts), and sufficient evidence from which to reasonably conclude that a contribution is a valid rollover contribution (as defined by 26 CFR 1.401(a)(31)-1, Q
A-14). By way of example, sufficient evidence to conclude a contribution is a valid rollover contribution includes a copy of the plan's determination letter, a letter or other statement from the plan administrator or trustee indicating that it is an eligible employer plan or traditional IRA, a check indicating that the contribution is a direct rollover, a payment confirmation, distribution statement or a tax notice from the plan to the participant indicating that the participant could receive a rollover from the plan.
(2) If the distribution is from a Roth account maintained by an eligible employer plan, the plan administrator must also provide to the TSP record keeper a statement indicating the first year of the participant's Roth 5 year non-exclusion period under the distributing plan and either:
(i) The portion of the direct rollover amount that represents Roth contributions (
i.e.,
basis); or
(ii) A statement that the entire amount of the direct rollover is a qualified Roth distribution (as defined by Internal Revenue Code section 402A(d)(2)).
(b)
Indirect rollover by participant.
A participant who has already received a distribution from an eligible employer plan or traditional IRA may request to roll over all or part of the distribution into the TSP in the form and manner prescribed by the TSP record keeper. However, the TSP record keeper will not accept a rollover by the participant of Roth funds distributed from an eligible employer plan. A distribution of Roth funds from an eligible employer plan may be rolled into the TSP by direct rollover only. The TSP record keeper will accept a rollover by the participant of tax-deferred amounts if the following requirements and conditions are satisfied:
(1) The participant must request to roll over the amounts in the form and manner prescribed by the TSP record keeper.
(2) The administrator or trustee must provide to the TSP record keeper information about the type of money included in the distribution (
i.e.,
tax-deferred and/or Roth) and sufficient evidence from which to reasonably conclude that a contribution is a valid rollover contribution. By way of example, sufficient evidence to conclude a contribution is a valid rollover contribution includes a copy of the plan's determination letter, a letter or other statement from the plan indicating that it is an eligible employer plan or traditional IRA, a check indicating that the contribution is a direct rollover, a payment confirmation, distribution statement or a tax notice from the plan to the participant indicating that the participant could receive a rollover from the plan.
(3) The participant must submit a certified check, cashier's check, cashier's draft, money order, treasurer's check from a credit union, or personal check, made out to the “Thrift Savings Plan,” for the entire amount of the rollover, along with any other information required by the TSP record keeper. A participant may roll over the full amount of the distribution by making up, from his or her own funds, the amount that was withheld from the distribution for the payment of Federal taxes.
(4) The transaction must be completed within 60 days of the participant's receipt of the distribution from his or her eligible employer plan or traditional IRA. The transaction is not complete until the TSP record keeper receives the guaranteed funds for the amount to be rolled over, information sufficient to conclude that the amount is a valid rollover contribution, and any other information required by the TSP record keeper.
(c)
Participant's certification.
When rolling over a distribution to the TSP by either a direct or indirect rollover, the participant must certify that the distribution is eligible for roll over into the TSP, as follows:
(1)
Distribution from an eligible employer plan.
The participant must certify that the distribution:
(i) Is not one of a series of substantially equal periodic payments made over the life expectancy of the participant (or the joint lives of the participant and designated beneficiary, if applicable) or for a period of 10 years or more;
(ii) Is not a minimum distribution required by I.R.C. section 401(a)(9) (26 U.S.C. 401(a)(9));
(iii) Is not a hardship distribution;
(iv) Is not a plan loan that is deemed to be a taxed loan because of default;
(v) Is not a return of excess elective deferrals; and
(vi) If not rolled over, would be includible in gross income for the tax year in which the distribution is paid. This paragraph (c)(1)(vi) shall not apply to Roth funds distributed from an eligible employer plan.
(2)
Distribution from a traditional IRA.
The participant must certify that the distribution:
(i) Is not a minimum distribution required under I.R.C. section 401(a)(9) (26 U.S.C. 401(a)(9)); and
(ii) If not rolled over, would be includible in gross income for the tax year in which the distribution is paid.
§ 1600.32
Treatment accorded rollover funds.
(a) All funds rolled over to the TSP pursuant to §§ 1600.30 and 1600.31 will be treated as employee contributions.
(b) All funds rolled over to the TSP pursuant to §§ 1600.30 and 1600.31 will be invested in accordance with the participant's investment election on file at the time the rollover is completed.
(c) Funds rolled over to the TSP pursuant to §§ 1600.30 and 1600.31 are not subject to the limits on contributions described in § 1600.22.
§ 1600.33
Combining uniformed services accounts and civilian accounts.
Uniformed services TSP account balances and civilian TSP account balances may be combined (thus producing one account), subject to paragraphs (a) through (g) of this section:
(a) An account balance can be combined with another once the TSP record keeper is informed (by the participant's employing agency) that the participant has separated from Government service.
(b) Tax-exempt contributions may not be transferred from a uniformed services TSP account to a civilian TSP account.
(c) A traditional balance and a Roth balance cannot be combined.
(d) Funds transferred to the gaining account will be allocated among the TSP core funds according to the investment election in effect for the account into which the funds are transferred.
(e) Funds transferred to the gaining account will be treated as employee contributions and otherwise invested as described at 5 CFR part 1600.
(f) A uniformed service member must obtain the consent of his or her spouse before combining a uniformed services TSP account balance with his or her civilian account, even if the civilian account is not subject to FERS spousal rights. A request for an exception to the spousal consent requirement will be evaluated under the rules explained in 5 CFR part 1650.
(g) A loan cannot be transferred between accounts. Before the accounts can be combined, any outstanding loans from the losing account must be closed as described in 5 CFR part 1655.

§ 1600.34
Automatic enrollment program.
(a) All newly hired civilian employees who are eligible to participate in the Thrift Savings Plan and those civilian employees who are rehired after a separation in service of 31 or more calendar days and who are eligible to participate in the TSP will automatically have 5% of their basic pay contributed to the employee's traditional TSP balance (default employee contribution) unless, by the end of the employee's first pay period (subject to the agency's processing time frames), they elect:
(1) To not contribute;
(2) To contribute at some other level; or
(3) To make Roth contributions in addition to, or in lieu of, traditional contributions.
(b) All uniformed service members who either enter service on or after January 1, 2018 or re-enter service after a separation in service of 31 or more calendar days after having been covered by BRS at the time of separation will automatically have 5% of their basic pay contributed to the member's traditional TSP balance (default employee contribution) beginning the first full pay period following the date that is 60 days after the member's PEBD unless they elect by the end of that 60 day period:
(1) To not contribute;
(2) To contribute at some other level; or
(3) To make Roth contributions in addition to, or in lieu of, traditional contributions.
(c) If, for any calendar year, a uniformed service member described in paragraph (b) of this section does not make a contribution in the final full pay period of such calendar year due to the member's election to terminate contributions prior to the final full pay period, then that member will automatically have 5% of his or her basic pay contributed to his or her traditional TSP balance beginning the first full pay period of the following calendar year unless he or she makes a subsequent election by December 31st:
(1) To not contribute;
(2) To contribute at some other level;
(3) To make Roth contributions in addition to, or in lieu of, traditional contributions.

§ 1600.35
Refunds of default employee contributions.
(a) Subject to the limitations in paragraph (f) of this section, a participant may request a refund of any default employee contributions made on his or her behalf (
i.e.,
the contributions made while under the automatic enrollment program) provided the request is received within 90 days after the date that the first default employee contribution was processed. The election may be made on the TSP website or by completing the TSP's refund request form and must be received by the TSP's record keeper prior to the expiration of the 90-day period.
(1) The distribution of a refund will be reported as income to the participant on IRS Form 1099-R, but it will not be subject to the additional tax under 26 U.S.C. 72(t) (the early withdrawal penalty tax).
(2) A participant who requests a refund will receive the amount of any default employee contributions (adjusted for allocable gains and losses).
(3) Processing of refunds will be subject to the rules set out at 5 CFR part 1650.
(b) A participant will no longer be considered to be covered by the automatic enrollment program if the participant files a contribution election. Consequently, if a participant makes a contribution election during the 90-day period, the participant will only be eligible to receive as a refund an amount equal to his or her default employee contributions (adjusted for allocable gains and losses).
(c) After the expiration of the period allowed for the refund, any withdrawal must be made pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 8433 and 5 CFR part 1650.
(d) A married participant may request a refund of default employee contributions without obtaining the consent of his or her spouse or having the TSP record keeper notify the spouse of the request.
(e) The rules applicable to frozen accounts (5 CFR 1650.3) and applicable to deceased participants (5 CFR 1650.6) also apply to refunds of the default employee contributions.
(f) A participant may not receive a refund of default employee contributions made pursuant to § 1600.34(c).

§ 1600.36
Matching contributions.
(a) A participant is not entitled to keep the matching contributions and their associated earnings that are attributable to refunded default employee contributions.
(b) The matching contributions and associated earnings attributable to refunded default employee contributions
shall be forfeited to the TSP and used to offset administrative expenses.
§ 1600.37
Notice.
The TSP record keeper shall furnish all new employees and all rehired employees covered by the automatic enrollment program, and all employees described in paragraph (c) of § 1600.34, covered by the automatic enrollment program a notice that accurately describes:
(a) That default employee contributions equal to 5 percent of the employee's basic pay will be deducted from the employee's pay and contributed to the employee's traditional TSP balance on the employee's behalf if the employee does not make an affirmative contribution election;
(b) The employee's right to elect to not have default employee contributions made to the TSP on the employee's behalf, to elect to have a different percentage or amount of basic pay contributed to the TSP, or to make Roth contributions;
(c) The TSP core fund in which the default employee and agency contributions will be invested unless the employee makes an investment election;
(d) The employee's ability (or inability) to request a refund of any default employee contributions (adjusted for allocable gains and losses) and the procedure to request such a refund; and
(e) That an investment in any fund other than the G Fund is made at the employee's risk, that the employee is not protected by the United States Government or the Board against any loss on the investment, and that neither the United States Government nor the Board guarantees any return on the investment.

# Subpart B—Investing Future Deposits

# Source:
87 FR 31674, May 24, 2022, unless otherwise noted.
§ 1601.11
Applicability.
This subpart applies only to the investment of future deposits to the TSP core funds, including contributions, loan payments, and rollovers from traditional IRAs and eligible employer plans; it does not apply to fund reallocations or fund transfers within the TSP core funds, which is covered in subpart C of this part, or fund transfers to and from the mutual fund window, which is covered in subpart F of this part.
§ 1601.12
Investing future deposits in the TSP core funds.
(a)
Allocation.
Future deposits in the TSP, including contributions, loan payments, and rollovers from traditional IRAs and eligible employer plans, will be allocated among the TSP core funds based on the most recent investment election on file for the participant.
(b)
TSP core funds availability.
All participants may elect to invest all or any portion of their deposits in any of the TSP core funds.
§ 1601.13
Elections.
(a)
Investment election.
Each participant may indicate his or her choice of TSP core funds for the allocation of future deposits in the form and manner prescribed by the TSP record keeper. Paragraphs (a)(1) through (5) of this section apply to investment elections:
(1) Investment elections must be made in one percent increments. The sum of the percentages elected for all of the TSP core funds must equal 100 percent.
(2) The percentage elected by a participant for investment of future deposits in a TSP core fund will be applied to all sources of contributions and rollovers from traditional IRAs and eligible employer plans. A participant may not make different percentage elections for different sources of contributions.
(3) The following default investment rules shall apply to civilian participants:
(i) All deposits made on behalf of a civilian participant enrolled prior to September 5, 2015, who does not have an investment election in effect will be invested in the G Fund. A civilian participant who is enrolled prior to September 5, 2015, and subsequently rehired on or after September 5, 2015, and has a positive account balance will be considered enrolled prior to September 5, 2015 for purposes of this paragraph (a)(3)(i); and
(ii) All deposits made on behalf of a civilian participant first enrolled on or after September 5, 2015, who does not have an investment election in effect will be invested in the age-appropriate TSP Lifecycle Fund.
(iii) A civilian participant enrolled prior to September 5, 2015, who elects for the first time to invest in a TSP core fund other than the G Fund must execute an acknowledgement of risk in accordance with § 1601.33.
(4) The default investment rule in paragraphs (a)(4)(i) through (iv) of this section apply to uniformed services participants:
(i) All deposits made on behalf of a uniformed services participant who first entered service prior to January 1, 2018, has not elected to be covered by BRS, and does not have an investment election in effect will be invested in the G Fund.
(ii) All deposits made on behalf of a uniformed services participant who first entered service on or after January 1, 2018, and who does not have an investment election in effect will be invested in the age-appropriate TSP Lifecycle Fund.
(iii) If a uniformed services participant makes an election to be covered by BRS as described in 5 CFR 1600.14
and does not have an investment election in effect at the time of the election, then all deposits made after the date of such election will be invested in the age-appropriate TSP Lifecycle Fund. Deposits made prior to the date of the election will remain invested in the G Fund.
(iv) A uniformed services participant who first entered service prior to January 1, 2018, and has not made an election to be covered by the BRS who elects for the first time to invest in a TSP core fund other than the G Fund must execute an acknowledgement of risk in accordance with § 1601.33.
(5) Once an investment election becomes effective, it remains in effect until it is superseded by a subsequent investment election or the participant's account balance is reduced to zero. If a rehired participant has a positive account balance and an investment election in effect, then the participant's investment election will remain in effect until a new election is made. If, however, the participant (other than a participant described in paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section) has a zero account balance, then the participant's contributions will be allocated to the age-appropriate TSP Lifecycle Fund until a new investment election is made.
(b)
Effect of rejection of investment election.
If a participant does not correctly complete an investment election, the attempted investment election will have no effect. The TSP record keeper will provide the participant with a written statement of the reason the transaction was rejected.
(c)
Contribution elections.
A participant may designate the amount or type of employee contributions he or she wishes to make to the TSP or may stop contributions only in accordance with 5 CFR part 1600.

# Subpart C—Fund Reallocations and Fund Transfers

# Source:
87 FR 31674, May 24, 2022, unless otherwise noted.
§ 1601.21
Applicability.
This subpart applies only to fund reallocations and fund transfers involving the movement of money from TSP core fund to one (or more) TSP core fund(s); it does not apply to the investment of future deposits, which is covered in subpart B of this part, nor does it apply to fund transfers involving the movement of money from the TSP core funds to the mutual fund window (and vice versa), which is covered in subpart F of this part.
§ 1601.22
Methods of requesting a fund reallocation.
(a) Participants may make a fund reallocation in the form and manner prescribed by the TSP record keeper. Paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section apply to a fund reallocation request:
(1) Fund reallocation requests must be made in whole percentages (one percent increments). The sum of the percentages elected for all of the TSP core funds must equal 100 percent.
(2) The percentages elected by the participant will be applied to the balances in each source of contributions and to both traditional and Roth balances and tax-deferred and tax-exempt balances on the effective date of the fund reallocation.
(b) A fund reallocation request has no effect on deposits made after the effective date of the fund reallocation request; subsequent deposits will continue to be allocated among the TSP core funds in accordance with the participant's investment election made under subpart B of this part.
(c) If a fund reallocation is found to be invalid pursuant to § 1601.34, the purported fund reallocation will not be made.
§ 1601.23
Methods of requesting a fund transfer.
(a) Participants may make a fund transfer from one or more TSP core fund to a different TSP core fund(s) in the form and manner prescribed by the TSP record keeper. Paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section apply to a fund transfer request:

into for all of the TSP core funds must equal 100 percent.
(2) The percentages elected by the participant will be applied to the balances in each source of contributions and to both traditional and Roth balances and tax-deferred and tax-exempt balances on the effective date of the fund transfer.
(b) A fund transfer request has no effect on deposits made after the effective date of the fund transfer request; subsequent deposits will continue to be allocated among the TSP core funds in accordance with the participant's investment election made under subpart B of this part.
(c) If a fund transfer is found to be invalid pursuant to § 1601.34, the purported fund transfer will not be made.

# Subpart D—Investment Elections and Fund Reallocation and Fund Transfer Requests

# Source:
87 FR 31675, May 24, 2022, unless otherwise noted.
§ 1601.31
Applicability.
This subpart applies to investment elections made under subpart B of this part, fund reallocations and fund transfers made under subpart C of this part, and fund transfers made under subpart F of this part.
§ 1601.32
Timing and posting dates.
(a)
Posting dates.
The date on which an investment election or fund reallocation or fund transfer request (transaction request) is processed is subject to a number of factors, including some that are outside of the control of the TSP, such as power outages, the failure of telephone service, unusually heavy transaction volume, and acts of God. These factors also could affect the availability of the TSP website and the ThriftLine. Therefore, the TSP cannot guarantee that a transaction request will be processed on a particular day. However, the TSP will process transaction requests under ordinary circumstances described in paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section:
(1) A transaction request other than an investment election request entered into the TSP record keeping system by a participant who uses the TSP website or the ThriftLine, before 12 noon eastern time of any business day, will ordinarily be posted that business day. A transaction request other than an investment election request entered into the system at or after 12 noon eastern time of any business day will ordinarily be posted on the next business day. A transaction request that is an investment election request will ordinarily be posted immediately and be effective the next business day.
(2) A transaction request made on the TSP website or the ThriftLine on a non-business day will ordinarily be posted on the next business day.
(3) A transaction request made on a paper TSP form will ordinarily be posted under the rules in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, based on when the TSP record keeper enters the form into the TSP system. The TSP record keeper ordinarily enters such forms into the system within 48 hours of their receipt.
(4) In most cases, the share price(s) applied to a fund reallocation or fund transfer request is the value of the shares on the date the relevant transaction is posted. In some circumstances, such as error correction, the share price(s) for an earlier date will be used.
(b)
Limit.
There is no limit on the number of investment election requests. A participant may make a total of two unrestricted fund reallocations and/or fund transfers per account (e.g., civilian or uniformed services), per calendar month. A fund reallocation or fund transfer will count toward the monthly total on the date posted by the TSP record keeper and not on the date requested by a participant. After a participant has made a total of two fund reallocations and/or fund transfers in a calendar month, the participant may make additional fund reallocations or fund transfers only into the G Fund until the first day of the next calendar month.
§ 1601.33
Acknowledgment of risk.
(a) Uniformed services participants who first entered service prior to January 1, 2018, and who have not elected to be covered by BRS and civilian participants who enrolled prior to September
5, 2015, must execute an acknowledgement of risk in order to invest in a TSP core fund other than the G Fund. If a required acknowledgment of risk has not been executed, no transactions involving the fund(s) for which the acknowledgment is required will be accepted.
(b) The acknowledgment of risk may be executed in association with an investment election, a fund reallocation, or a fund transfer in the form and manner prescribed by the TSP record keeper.
§ 1601.34
Error correction.
Errors in processing investment elections and fund reallocation or fund transfer requests, or errors that otherwise cause money to be invested in the wrong investment fund, will be corrected in accordance with the error correction regulations found at 5 CFR part 1605.

# Subpart E—Lifecycle Funds
§ 1601.40
Lifecycle Funds.
The Executive Director will establish TSP Lifecycle Funds, which are target date asset allocation portfolios. The TSP Lifecycle Funds will invest solely in the funds established pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 8438(b)(1)(A)-(E).

# Subpart F—Mutual Fund Window

# Source:
87 FR 27922, May 10, 2022, unless otherwise noted.
§ 1601.51
Applicability.
This subpart applies only to the transfer of amounts between the TSP core funds and the mutual fund window; it does not apply to the investment of future deposits, which is covered in subpart B of this part, or fund reallocations or fund transfers among the TSP core funds, which is covered in subpart C of this part.
§ 1601.52
Fund transfers.
(a)
Fund transfers into mutual fund window.
A participant may elect to make one or more fund transfers to the mutual fund window from the portion of his or her TSP balance invested in the TSP core funds, subject to the following rules:
(1) The participant must establish a mutual fund window account that is separate from his or her TSP account. A participant with more than one TSP account may establish a separate mutual fund window account for each TSP account, and the limitations and fees described in subpart will apply separately to each account;
(2) If the participant does not have an acknowledgment of risk on file as of the date of his or her initial fund transfer request to the mutual fund window, the participant must complete an acknowledgment of risk for the fund transfer to be processed;
(3) Fund transfers must be made in whole dollar increments (percentages are not permitted);
(4) The following limitations must be satisfied:

(1) A forced transfer may occur if the balance invested in the TSP core funds is insufficient to cover:
(i) Amounts necessary to comply with a court order, legal process, or levy described in 5 CFR part 1653;
(ii) A beneficiary asset transfer;
(iii) A required minimum distribution;
(iv) An automatic cash out distribution; or
(v) Any other payment or transfer that the Board is required by law to make from the participant's TSP account balance;
(2) The amount of the forced transfer shall be equal to the amount of the insufficiency described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, plus $1,000; except, however, that if the participant's mutual fund window account balance is less than $25,000, the entire mutual fund window account balance shall be transferred to the TSP core funds;
(3) Forced transfers shall be liquidated from the participant's mutual fund window account first from amounts held in the sweep money market fund; and then from amounts invested in mutual funds, beginning with the position with the highest balance;
(4) Forced transfers from a participant's mutual fund window account to the TSP core funds shall be invested according to the participant's existing contribution allocation; and
(5) The participant shall be responsible for any fees incurred as a result of the forced transfer.
§ 1601.53
Fees.
(a) The Board will allocate a portion of the TSP's administrative expenses to mutual fund users by charging an administrative fee of $55.00 annually. The amount of this fee will be redetermined once every three years by multiplying the average mutual fund window account balance by the TSP administrative expense ratio, as of the date of redetermination.
(b) The fee described in paragraph (a) of this section is in addition to any mutual fund window account maintenance fees, trading fees, and fees and expenses associated with the specific mutual fund(s) in which the participant chooses to invest.

Attributable pay date
means:
(i) The pay date of a contribution that is being redesignated from traditional to Roth, or vice versa;
(ii) In the case of the uniformed services, the pay date of a contribution that is being recharacterized from tax-deferred to tax-exempt, or vice versa; or
(iii) The pay date of an erroneous contribution for which a negative adjustment is being made. However, if the erroneous contribution for which a negative adjustment is being made was a makeup or late contribution, the attributable pay date is the “as of” date of the erroneous makeup or late contribution.
Breakage
means the loss incurred or the gain realized on makeup or late contributions.
BRS participant

Error
means any act or omission by the Board, the TSP record keeper, or the participant's employing agency that is not in accordance with applicable statutes, regulations, or administrative procedures that are made available to employing agencies and/or TSP participants. It does not mean an act or omission caused by events that are beyond the control of the Board, the TSP record keeper, or the participant's employing agency.
FERCCA correction
means the correction of a retirement coverage error pursuant to the Federal Erroneous Retirement Coverage Corrections Act, title II, Public Law 106-265, 114 Stat. 770.
Late contributions

(i) Employee contributions that were timely deducted from a participant's basic pay but were not timely reported to the TSP record keeper for investment;
(ii) Employee contributions that were timely reported to the TSP record keeper but were not timely posted to the participant's account by the TSP record keeper because the payment record on which they were submitted contained errors;
(iii) Agency matching contributions attributable to employee contributions referred to in paragraph (i) or (ii) of this definition; and
(iv) Delayed agency automatic (1%) contributions.
Makeup contributions
are employee contributions that should have been deducted from a participant's basic pay or employer contributions that should have been charged to an employing agency on an earlier date, but were not deducted or charged and, consequently, are being deducted or charged currently.
Negative adjustment

Recharacterization is a method of error correction only. It applies only to the traditional balance of a uniformed services account.
Recharacterization record
means a data record submitted by an employing agency to recharacterize a tax-deferred contribution that the employing agency erroneously submitted as a tax-exempt contribution (or vice versa).
Redesignation
means the process of moving a contribution (and its associated positive earnings) from a participant's traditional balance to the participant's Roth balance or vice versa in order to correct an employing agency error that caused the contribution to be submitted to the wrong balance.

§ 1605.2
Calculating, posting, and charging breakage on late contributions and loan payments.
(a)
General criteria.
The TSP will calculate breakage on late contributions, makeup agency contributions, and loan payments as described by § 1605.15(b). This breakage calculation is subject to the criteria in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section:
(1) The TSP record keeper will not calculate breakage if contributions or loan payments are posted within 30 days of the “as of” date, or if the total amount on a late payment record or the total agency contributions on a current payment record is less than $1.00; and
(2) The TSP record keeper will not take the participant's fund reallocations and fund transfers into account when determining breakage.
(b)
Calculating breakage.
The TSP record keeper will calculate breakage for all contributions or loan payment corrections as follows:
(1) Use the participant's investment election on file for the “as of” date to determine how the funds would have been invested, going back to the earliest daily share prices available. If there is no investment election on file, or one cannot be derived based on the investment of contributions, the TSP record keeper will consider the funds to have been invested in the default investment fund in effect for the participant on the “as of” date;
(2) Determine the number of shares of the applicable investment funds the participant would have received had the contributions or loan payments been made on time. If the “as of” date is before TSP account balances were converted to shares, this determination will be the number of shares the participant would have received on the conversion date, and will include the daily
earnings the participant would have received had the contributions or loan payments been made on the “as of” date;
(3) Determine the dollar value on the posting date of the number of shares the participant would have received had the contributions or loan payments been made on time. If the contributions or loan payments would have been invested in a Lifecycle fund that is retired on the posting date, the share price of the L Income Fund will be used. The dollar value shall be the number of shares the participant would have received had the contributions or loan payments been made on time multiplied by the share price; and
(4) The difference between the dollar value of the contribution or loan payment on the posting date and the dollar value of the contribution or loan payment on the “as of” date is the breakage.
(c)
Posting contributions and loan payments.
Makeup and late contributions, late loan payments, and breakage, will be posted to the participant's account according to his or her investment election on file for the posting date. If there is no investment election on file for the posting date, they will be posted to the default investment fund in effect for the participant.
(d)
Charging breakage.
If the dollar amount posted to the participant's account is greater than the dollar amount of the makeup or late contribution or late loan payment, the TSP record keeper will charge the agency the additional amount. If the dollar amount posted to the participant's account is less than the dollar amount of the makeup or late contribution, or late loan payment, the difference between the amount of the contribution and the amount posted will be forfeited to the TSP.
(e)
Posting of multiple contributions.
If the TSP record keeper posts multiple makeup or late contributions or late loan payments with different “as of” dates for a participant on the same business day, the amount of breakage charged to the employing agency or forfeited to the TSP will be determined separately for each transaction, without netting any gains or losses attributable to different “as of” dates. In addition, gains and losses from different sources of contributions or different TSP core funds will not be netted against each other. Instead, breakage will be determined separately for each as-of date, TSP core fund, and source of contributions.
[87 FR 31676, May 24, 2022]
§ 1605.3
Calculating, posting, and charging breakage on errors involving investment in the wrong fund.
(a) The TSP record keeper will calculate and post breakage on date of birth errors that result in default investment in the wrong L Fund, investment election errors, and fund reallocation and fund transfer errors.
(b) The TSP record keeper will charge the employing agency for positive breakage on incorrect dates of birth caused by employing agency error that result in default investment in the wrong L Fund. A date of birth change received from an employing agency will not trigger corrective action other than to update the date of birth. To initiate a breakage calculation for an employee, the employing agency must notify the TSP record keeper that the participant is entitled to breakage.
(c) If a uniformed services participant's retirement system is misclassified and the error results in default investment in the wrong fund, when the error is corrected pursuant to § 1605.14(f)-(g), the TSP record keeper will charge the employing agency for any positive breakage that results from the incorrect default investment. The retirement misclassification correction received from an employing agency will not trigger corrective action other than to update the participant's retirement system coverage. To initiate a breakage calculation for the uniformed service member, the employing agency must notify the TSP record keeper that the participant is entitled to breakage.

# Subpart B—Employing Agency Errors
§ 1605.11
Makeup of missed or insufficient contributions.
(a)
Applicability.
This section applies whenever, as the result of an employing agency error, a participant does not receive all of the TSP contributions to which he or she is entitled. This includes situations in which an employing agency error prevents a participant from making an election to contribute to his or her TSP account, in which an employing agency fails to implement a contribution election properly submitted by a participant, in which an employing agency fails to make agency automatic (1%) contributions or agency matching contributions that it is required to make, or in which an employing agency otherwise erroneously contributes less to the TSP for a participant's account than it should have. The corrections required by this section must be made in accordance with this part and the procedures provided to employing agencies by the Board and/or the TSP record keeper in bulletins or other guidance. It is the responsibility of the employing agency to determine whether it has made an error that entitles a participant to error correction under this section.
(b)
Employer makeup contributions.
If an employing agency has failed to make agency automatic contributions that are required under 5 U.S.C. 8432(c)(1)(A) and 5 U.S.C. 8440e(e)(3)(A), or agency matching contributions that are required under section 8432(c)(2) and 5 U.S.C. 8440e(e)(3)(B), the following rules apply:
(1) The employing agency must promptly submit all missed contributions to the TSP record keeper on behalf of the affected participant. For each pay date involved, the employing agency must submit a separate payment record showing the “as of” date for the contributions.
(2) The TSP record keeper will calculate the breakage due to the participant and post both the contributions and the associated breakage to the participant's account in accordance with § 1605.2.
(c)
Employee makeup contributions.
Within 30 days of receiving information from his or her employing agency indicating that the employing agency acknowledges that an error has occurred which has caused a smaller amount of employee contributions to be made to the participant's account than should have been made, a participant may elect to establish a schedule to make up the deficient contributions through future payroll deductions. Employee makeup contributions can be made in addition to any TSP contributions that the participant is otherwise entitled to make. The following rules apply to employee makeup contributions:
(1) The schedule of makeup contributions elected by the participant must establish the dollar amount of the contributions and the type of employee contributions (traditional or Roth) to be made each pay period over the duration of the schedule. The contribution amount per pay period may vary during the course of the schedule, but the total amount to be contributed must be established when the schedule is created. After the schedule is created, a participant may, with the agreement of his or heremploying agency, elect to change his or her payment amount (e.g., to accelerate payment) or elect to change the type of employee contributions (traditional or Roth). The length of the schedule may not exceed four times the number of pay periods over which the error occurred.
(2) At its discretion, an employing agency may set a ceiling on the length of a schedule of employee makeup contributions which is less than four times the number of pay periods over which the error occurred. The ceiling may not, however, be less than twice the number of pay periods over which the error occurred.
(3) The employing agency must implement the participant's schedule of makeup contributions as soon as practicable.
(4) For each pay date involved, the employing agency must submit a separate payment record showing the “as of” date for which the employee contribution should have been made.
(5) Employee makeup contributions will be invested in accordance with the
participant's currentinvestment election. The number of shares of each TSP core fund which will be purchased will be determined by dividing the amount of the makeup contributions by the share price of the applicable fund(s) on the posting date.
(6) Employee makeup contributions will be included for purposes of applying the annual limit contained in Internal Revenue Code (I.R.C.) section 402(g) (26 U.S.C. 402(g)(1)). For purposes of applying that limit, employee makeup contributions will be applied against the limit for the year of the “as of” date.
(i) Before establishing a schedule of employee makeup contributions, the employing agency must review any schedule proposed by the affected participant, as well as the participant's prior TSP contributions, if any, to determine whether the makeup contributions, when combined with prior contributions for the same year, would exceed the annual contribution limit(s) contained in I.R.C. section 402(g) for the year(s) with respect to which the contributions are being made.
(ii) The employing agency must not permit contributions that, when combined with prior contributions, would exceed the applicable annual contribution limit contained in I.R.C. section 402(g).
(7) A schedule of employee makeup contributions may be suspended if a participant has insufficient net pay to permit the makeup contributions. If this happens, the period of suspension should not be counted against the maximum number of pay periods to which the participant is entitled in order to complete the schedule of makeup contributions.
(8) A participant may elect to terminate a schedule of employee makeup contributions at any time, but a termination is irrevocable. If a participant separates from Government service, the participant may elect to accelerate the payment schedule by a lump sum contribution from his or her final paycheck.
(9) At the same time that a participant makes up missed employee contributions, the employing agency must make any agency matching contributions that would have been made had the error not occurred. Agency matching contributions must be submitted pursuant to the rules set forth in paragraph (b) of this section. A participant may not receive agency matching contributions associated with any employee contributions that are not actually made up. If employee makeup contributions are suspended in accordance with paragraph (c)(7) of this section, the payment of agency matching contributions must also be suspended.
(10) If a participant transfers to an employing agency different from the one by which the participant was employed at the time of the missed contributions, it remains the responsibility of the former employing agency to determine whether employing agency error was responsible for the missed contributions. If it is determined that such an error has occurred, the current agency must take any necessary steps to correct the error. The current agency may seek reimbursement from the former agency of any amount that would have been paid by the former agency had the error not occurred.
(11) Employee makeup contributions may be made only by payroll deduction from basic pay or, for uniformed services participants, from basic pay, incentive pay, or special pay, including bonus pay. Contributions by check, money order, cash, or other form of payment directly from the participant to the TSP, or from the participant to the employing agency for deposit to the TSP, are not permitted.
(12) A participant is not eligible to contribute makeup contributions with an “as of” date occurring prior to May 5, 2012 to his or her Roth balance.
(13) If the “as of” date of a Roth contribution that is submitted as a makeup contribution is earlier than the participant's existing Roth initiation date, the TSP record keeper will adjust the participant's Roth initiation date.
(d)
Missed bonus contributions.
This paragraph (d) applies when an employing agency fails to implement a contribution election that was properly submitted by a uniformed service member requesting that a TSP contribution be deducted from bonus pay. Within 30 days of receiving the employing agency's acknowledgment of the error, a uniformed service member may
establish a schedule of makeup contributions with his or her employing agency to replace the missed contribution through future payroll deductions. These makeup contributions can be made in addition to any TSP contributions that the uniformed service member is otherwise entitled to make.
(1) The schedule of makeup contributions may not exceed four times the number of months it would take for the uniformed service member to earn basic pay equal to the dollar amount of the missed contribution. For example, a uniformed service member who earns $29,000 yearly in basic pay and who missed a $2,500 bonus contribution to the TSP can establish a schedule of makeup contributions with a maximum duration of 8 months. This is because it takes the uniformed service member 2 months to earn $2,500 in basic pay (at $2,416.67 per month).
(2) At its discretion, an employing agency may set a ceiling on the length of a schedule of employee makeup contributions. The ceiling may not, however, be less than twice the number of months it would take for the uniformed service member to earn basic pay equal to the dollar amount of the missed contribution.
[68 FR 35498, June 13, 2003, as amended at 70 FR 32210, June 1, 2005; 77 FR 26425, May 4, 2012; 82 FR 60104, Dec. 19, 2017; 87 FR 31676, May 24, 2022]
§ 1605.12
Removal of erroneous contributions.
(a)
Applicability.
This section applies to the removal of funds erroneously contributed to the TSP. This action is called a negative adjustment, and agencies may only request negative adjustments of erroneous contributions made on or after January 1, 2000. Excess contributions addressed by this section include, for example, excess employee contributions that result from employing agency error and excess employer contributions. This section does not address excess contributions resulting from a FERCCA correction; those contributions are addressed in § 1605.14.
(b)
Method of correction.
Negative adjustment records must be submitted by employing agencies in accordance with this part and any other procedures provided by the Board and/or the TSP record keeper.
(1) To remove money from a participant's account, the employing agency must submit, for each attributable pay date involved, a negative adjustment record stating the attributable pay date and the amount, by source, of the erroneous contribution.
(2) A negative adjustment record may be for any part of the contributions made for the attributable pay date. However, for each source of contributions, the negative adjustment may not exceed the amount of the contributions made for that date, minus any prior negative adjustments for the same date.
(c)
Processing negative adjustments.
To determine current value, a negative adjustment will be allocated among the TSP core funds as it would have been allocated on the attributable pay period (as reported by the employing agency). The TSP record keeper will, for each source of contributions and TSP core fund:
(1) If the attributable pay date for the erroneous contribution is on or before the date TSP accounts were converted to shares (and on or after January 1, 2000), the TSP record keeper will, for each source of contributions and investment fund:
(i) Determine the dollar value of the amount to be removed by using the daily returns for the applicable TSP core fund;
(ii) Determine the number of shares that the dollar value determined in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section would have purchased on the conversion date; and
(iii) Multiply the price per share for the date the adjustment is posted by the number of shares calculated in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section.
(2) If the attributable pay date of the negative adjustment is after the date TSP accounts were converted to shares, the TSP record keeper will, for each source of contributions and TSP core fund:
(i) Determine the number of shares that represent the amount of the contribution to be removed using the share price on the attributable pay date; and
(ii) Multiply the price per share on the date the adjustment is posted by the number of shares calculated in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section. If the contribution was erroneously contributed to a Lifecycle fund that is retired on the date the adjustment is posted, the share price of the L Income Fund will be used.
(d)
Employee contributions.
The following rules apply to negative adjustments involving employee contributions:
(1) If, on the posting date, the amount calculated under paragraph (c) of this section is equal to or greater than the amount of the proposed negative adjustment, the full amount of the adjustment will be removed from the participant's account and returned to the employing agency. Earnings on the erroneous contribution will remain in the participant's account. However, positive earnings on an erroneous contribution to the participant's Roth balance will be moved to the participant's traditional balance;
(2) If, on the posting date, the amount calculated under paragraph (c) of this section is less than the amount of the proposed negative adjustment, the amount of the adjustment, reduced by the investment loss, will be removed from the participant's account and returned to the employing agency. However, the employing agency must refund to the participant the full amount of the erroneous contribution;
(3) If an employing agency requests the removal of erroneous employee contributions from a participant's account, it must also request the removal, under paragraph (e) of this section, of any attributable agency matching contributions; and
(4) If all employee contributions are removed from a participant's account under the rules set forth in this section, the earnings attributable to those contributions will remain in the account until the participant removes them with a TSP withdrawal. If the participant is not eligible to maintain a TSP account, the employing agency must submit an employee data record to the TSP record keeper indicating that the participant has separated from Government service (this will allow the TSP-ineligible participant to make a post-employment distribution election).
(e)
Employer contributions.
The following rules apply to negative adjustments involving erroneous employer contributions:
(1) The amount calculated under paragraph (c) of this section will be removed from the participant's account.
(2) Erroneous employer contributions will be returned to the employing agency only if the negative adjustment record is posted by the TSP record keeper within one year of the date the erroneous contribution was posted. If one year or more has elapsed when the negative adjustment record is posted, the amount computed under paragraph (c) of this section will be removed from the participant's account and used to offset TSP administrative expenses;
(3) If the erroneous contribution has been in the participant's account for less than one year when the negative adjustment record is posted and the amount computed under paragraph (c) of this section is equal to or greater than the amount of the adjustment, the employing agency will receive the full amount of the erroneous contribution. Any earnings attributable to the erroneous contribution will be removed from the participant's account and used to offset TSP administrative expenses;
(4) If the erroneous contribution has been in the participant's account for less than one year when the negative adjustment record is posted, and the amount computed under paragraph (c) of this section is less than the amount of the adjustment, the employing agency will receive the amount of the erroneous contribution reduced by the investment loss; and
(5) An employing agency's obligation to submit negative adjustment records to remove erroneous contributions from a participant's account is not affected by the length of time the contributions have been in the account.
(f)
Multiple negative adjustments.
(1) If multiple negative adjustments for the same attributable pay date for a participant are posted on the same business day, the amount removed from the participant's account and used to offset TSP administrative expenses, or returned to the employing agency, will
be determined separately for each adjustment. Earnings and losses for erroneous contributions made on different dates will not be netted against each other. In addition, for a negative adjustment for any attributable pay date, gains and losses from different sources of contributions or different TSP core funds will not be netted against each other. Instead, for each attributable pay date each source of contributions and each TSP core fund will be treated separately for purposes of these calculations. The amount computed by applying the rules in this section will be removed from the participant's account pro rata from all funds, by source, based on the allocation of the participant's account among the TSP core funds when the transaction is posted; and
(2) If there is insufficient money in the same source of contributions to cover the amount to be removed or the amount of the requested adjustment, the negative adjustment record will be rejected.
[70 FR 32210, June 1, 2005, as amended at 75 FR 74608, Dec. 1, 2010; 77 FR 26425, May 4, 2012; 85 FR 40570, July 7, 2020; 87 FR 31677, May 24, 2022]
§ 1605.13
Back pay awards and other retroactive pay adjustments.
(a)
Participant not employed.
The following rules apply to participants who receive a back pay award or other retroactive pay adjustment for a period during which the participant was separated from Government service or was not appointed to a position that is covered by FERS, CSRS, or an equivalent system under which TSP participation is authorized:
(1) If the participant is reinstated or retroactively appointed to a hich TSP participation is authorized, immediately upon reinstatement or retroactive appointment the employing agency must give the participant the opportunity to submit a contribution election to make current contributions. The contribution election will be effective as soon as administratively feasible, but no later than the first day of the first full pay period after it is received.
(2) The employing agency must give a reinstated or retroactively appointed participant the following options for electing makeup contributions:
(i) The reinstated or retroactively appointed participant may submit a new contribution election for purposes of makeup contributions if he or she would have been eligible to make such an election but for the erroneous separation or erroneous failure to appoint; or
(ii) If a reinstated participant had a contribution election on file when he or she separated, the contribution election the participant had on file when he or she separated may be reinstated for purposes of makeup contributions.
(3) All contributions made under this paragraph (a) and associated breakage will be invested according to the participant's investment election on the posting date. Breakage will be calculated using the share prices for the default investment fund in effect for the participant in accordance with § 1605.2 unless otherwise required by the employing agency or the court or other tribunal with jurisdiction over the back pay case.
(b)
Participant employed.
The following rules apply to participants who receive a back pay award or other retroactive pay adjustment for a period during which the participant was employed in a position that is covered by FERS, CSRS, or an equivalent system under which TSP participation is authorized:
(1) The participant will be entitled to make up contributions for the period covered by the back pay award or retroactive pay adjustment only if for that period—
(i) The participant had designated a percentage of basic pay to be contributed to the TSP; or
(ii) The participant had designated a dollar amount of contributions each pay period which equaled the applicable ceiling (FERS or CSRS) on contributions per pay period, and which, therefore, was limited as a result of the reduction in pay that is made up by the back pay award or other retroactive pay adjustment;
(2) The employing agency must compute the amount of additional employee contributions, agency matching contributions, and agency automatic (1%) contributions that would have
been contributed to the participant's account had the reduction in pay leading to the back pay award or other retroactive pay adjustment not occurred; and
(3) All contributions under this paragraph (b) and associated breakage will be posted to the participant's account based on the participant's investment election on the posting date. Breakage will be calculated in accordance with § 1605.2.
(c)
Contributions to be deducted before payment or other retroactive pay adjustment.
Employee makeup contributions required under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section:
(1) Must be computed before the back pay award or other retroactive pay adjustment is paid, deducted from the back pay or other retroactive pay adjustment, and submitted to the TSP record keeper;
(2) Must not cause the participant to exceed the annual contribution limit(s) contained in sections 402(g), 415(c), or 414(v) of the I.R.C. (26 U.S.C. 402(g), 415(c), 414(v)) for the year(s) with respect to which the contributions are being made, taking into consideration the TSP contributions already made in (or with respect to) that year; and
(3) Must be accompanied by attributable agency matching contributions. In any event, regardless of whether a participant elects to make up employee contributions, the employing agency must make all appropriate agency automatic (1%) contributions associated with the back pay award or other retroactive pay adjustment.
(d)
Prior withdrawal of TSP account.
If a participant has received a post-employment distribution in any form other than an annuity, and the separation from Government service upon which the post-employment distribution was based is reversed, resulting in reinstatement of the participant without a break in service, the participant will have the option to restore the amount distributed to his or her TSP account. The right to restore the distributed funds will expire if the participant does not notify the TSP record keeper within 90 days of reinstatement. If the participant returns the funds that were distributed, the number of shares purchased will be determined by using the share price of the applicable investment fund on the posting date. Restored funds will not incur breakage.
(e)
Reinstating a loan.
Participants who are covered by paragraph (d) of this section and who elect to return funds that were distributed may also elect to reinstate a loan which was previously declared to be a loan foreclosure.

§ 1605.14
Misclassified retirement system coverage.
(a) If a CSRS participant is misclassified by an employing agency as a FERS participant, when the misclassification is corrected:
(1) Employee contributions that exceed the applicable contribution percentage for the pay period(s) involved may remain in the participant's account. The participant may request the return of excess employee contributions made on or after January 1, 2000; those contributed before January 1, 2000, must remain in the participant's account. If the participant requests a refund of employee contributions, the employing agency must submit a negative adjustment record to remove these funds under the procedure described in § 1605.12.
(2) All agency contributions that were made to a CSRS participant's account will be forfeited. An employing agency may submit a negative adjustment record to request the return of an erroneous contribution that has been in the participant's account for less than one year.
(b) If a FERS participant is misclassified by an employing agency as a CSRS participant, when the misclassification is corrected:
(1) The participant may not elect to have the contributions made while classified as CSRS removed from his or her account;
(2) The participant may, under the rules of § 1605.11, elect to make up contributions that he or she would have been eligible to make as a FERS participant during the period of misclassification;
(3) The employing agency must, under the rules of § 1605.11, make agency automatic (1%) contributions and agency matching contributions on employee contributions that were made while the participant was misclassified;
(4) If the retirement coverage correction is a FERCCA correction, the employing agency must submit makeup employee contributions on late payment records. The participant is entitled to breakage on contributions from all sources. Breakage will be calculated pursuant to § 1605.2. If the retirement coverage correction is not a FERCCA correction, the employing agency must submit makeup employee contributions on current payment records; in such cases, the employee is not entitled to breakage. Agency makeup contributions may be submitted on either current or late payment records; and
(5) If employee contributions were made up before the Office of Personnel Management implemented its regulations on FERCCA correction, and the correction is considered to be a FERCCA correction, an amount to replicate TSP lost earnings will be calculated by the Office of Personnel Management pursuant to its regulations and provided to the employing agency for transmission to the TSP record keeper.
(c) If a participant was misclassified as either FERS or CSRS and the retirement coverage is corrected to FICA only, the participant is no longer eligible to participate in the TSP.
(1) Employee contributions in the account are subject to the rules in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
(2) Employer contributions in the account are subject to the rules in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
(3) The TSP record keeper will consider a participant to be separated from Government service for all TSP purposes and the employing agency must submit an employee data record to reflect separation from Government service. If the participant has an outstanding loan, it will be subject to the provisions of part 1655 of this chapter. The participant may make a TSP post-employment distribution election pursuant to 5 CFR part 1650, subpart B, and the distribution will be subject to the provisions of 5 CFR 1650.60(b).
(d) If a FERS or CSRS participant is misclassified by an employing agency as FICA only, when the misclassification is corrected the participant may, pursuant to § 1605.11 of this part, elect to make up contributions that he or she would have been eligible to make as a FERS or CSRS participant during the period of misclassification. If the participant makes up employee contributions, the rules in paragraph (b)(5) of this section apply. If the participant is corrected to FERS, the rules in paragraphs (b)(3) and (b)(4) of this section also apply.
(e) The provisions of paragraph (c) of this section shall apply to any TSP contributions relating to a period for which an employee elects retroactive Nonappropriated Fund retirement coverage.
(f) If a BRS participant is misclassified by an employing agency as a non-BRS participant, when the misclassification is corrected:
(1) The participant may not elect to have the contributions made while classified as non-BRS removed from his or her account;
(2) The participant may, under the rules of § 1605.11, elect to make up contributions that he or she would have been eligible to make as a BRS participant during the period of misclassification;
(3) The employing agency must, under the rules of § 1605.11, make agency automatic (1%) contributions and agency matching contributions on employee contributions that were made while the participant was misclassified; and
(4) The employing agency must submit makeup employee contributions on current payment records and service makeup contributions may be submitted on either current or late payment records.
(g) If a non-BRS participant is misclassified by an employing agency as a BRS participant, when the misclassification is corrected:

§ 1605.15
Reporting and processing late contributions and late loan payments.
(a) The employing agency must promptly submit late contributions to the TSP record keeper on behalf of the affected participant on late payment records as soon as the error is discovered. For each pay date involved, the employing agency must submit a separate record showing the “as of” date for the contributions. Breakage for both employee and agency contributions will be calculated, posted, and charged to the agency or forfeited to the TSP in accordance with § 1605.2.
(b) If an employing agency deducts loan payments from a participant's pay, but fails to submit those payments to the TSP record keeper for the pay date for which they were deducted (or submits them in a manner that prevents them from being timely credited to the participant's account), the employing agency will be responsible for paying breakage using the procedure described in § 1605.2. The loan payment record must contain the “as of” date for which the loan payment was deducted.
(c) All contributions or loan payments on payment records contained in a payroll submission that was received from an employing agency more than 30 days after the pay date associated with the payroll submission (as reported on the appropriate journal voucher), will be subject to breakage calculated, posted, and charged to the employing agency (or forfeited to the TSP) in accordance with § 1605.2. The employing agency will be apprised of the breakage due for each record reported on the late submission.
(d) If the “as of” date of a late Roth contribution is earlier than the participant's existing Roth initiation date, the TSP record keeper will adjust the participant's Roth initiation date.
[68 FR 35501, June 13, 2003, as amended at 77 FR 26426, May 4, 2012; 87 FR 31678, May 24, 2022]
§ 1605.16
Claims for correction of employing agency errors; time limitations.
(a)
Agency's discovery of error.
(1) Upon discovery of an error made within the past six months involving the correct or timely remittance of payments to the TSP record keeper (other than a retirement system misclassification error, as covered in paragraph (c) of this section), an employing agency must promptly correct the error on its own initiative. If the error was made more than six months before it was discovered, the agency may exercise sound discretion in deciding whether to correct it, but, in any event, the agency must act promptly in doing so.
(2) For errors involving incorrect dates of birth caused by employing agency error that result in default investment in the wrong L Fund, the employing agency must promptly notify the TSP record keeper that the participant is entitled to breakage if the error is discovered within 30 days of either the date the TSP record keeper provides the participant with a notice reflecting the error or the date the TSP or its record keeper makes available on its website a participant statement reflecting the error, whichever is earlier. If it is discovered after that time, the employing agency may use its sound discretion in deciding whether to pay breakage, but, in any event, must act promptly in doing so.
(b)
Participant's discovery of error.
(1) If an agency fails to discover an error of which a participant has knowledge involving the correct or timely remittance of a payment to the TSP record keeper (other than a retirement system misclassification error as covered by paragraph (c) of this section), the participant may file a claim with his or
her employing agency to have the error corrected without a time limit. The agency must promptly correct any such error for which the participant files a claim within six months of its occurrence; if the participant files a claim to correct any such error after that time, the agency may do so at its sound discretion.
(2) For errors involving incorrect dates of birth that result in default investment in the wrong L Fund of which a participant or beneficiary has knowledge, he or she may file a claim for breakage with the employing agency no later than 30 days after either the date the TSP record keeper provides the participant with a notice reflecting the error or the date the TSP or its record keeper makes available on its website a participant statement reflecting the error, whichever is earlier. The employing agency must promptly notify the TSP record keeper that the participant is entitled to breakage.
(3) If a participant or beneficiary fails to file a claim for breakage for errors involving incorrect dates of birth in a timely manner, the employing agency may nevertheless, in its sound discretion, pay breakage on any such error that is brought to its attention.
(c)
Retirement system misclassification error.
Errors arising from retirement system misclassification must be corrected no matter when they are discovered, whether by an agency or a participant.
(d)
Agency procedures.
Each employing agency must establish procedures for participants to submit claims for correction under this subpart. Each employing agency's procedures must include the following:
(1) The employing agency must provide the participant with a decision on any claim within 30 days of its receipt, unless the employing agency provides the participant with good cause for requiring a longer period to decide the claim. A decision to deny a claim in whole or in part must be in writing and must include the reasons for the denial, citations to any applicable statutes, regulations, or procedures, a description of any additional material that would enable the participant to perfect the claim, and a statement of the steps necessary to appeal the denial;
(2) The employing agency must permit a participant at least 30 days to appeal the employing agency's denial of all or any part of a claim for correction under this subpart. The appeal must be in writing and addressed to the agency official designated in the initial decision or in procedures promulgated by the agency. The participant may include with his or her appeal any documentation or comments that the participant deems relevant to the claim;
(3) The employing agency must issue a written decision on a timely appeal within 30 days of receipt of the appeal, unless the employing agency provides the participant with good cause for requiring a longer period to decide the appeal. The employing agency decision must include the reasons for the decision, as well as citations to any applicable statutes, regulations, or procedures; and
(4) If the agency decision on the appeal is not issued in a timely manner, or if the appeal is denied in whole or in part, the participant will be deemed to have exhausted his or her administrative remedies and will be eligible to file suit against the employing agency under 5 U.S.C. 8477. There is no administrative appeal to the Board of a final agency decision.
[66 FR 44277, Aug. 22, 2001, as amended at 70 FR 32212, June 1, 2005; 80 FR 57070, Sept. 22, 2015; 87 FR 31678, May 24, 2022]
§ 1605.17
Redesignation and recharacterization.
(a)
Applicability.
This section applies to the redesignation of contributions which, due to employing agency error, were contributed to the participant's traditional balance when they should have been contributed to the participant's Roth balance or were contributed to the participant's Roth balance when they should have been contributed to the participant's traditional balance. This section also applies to the recharacterization of contributions which, due to employing agency error, were contributed as tax-deferred contributions when they should have been
contributed as tax-exempt contributions (or vice versa). It is the responsibility of the employing agency to determine whether it has made an error that entitles a participant to error correction under this section.
(b)
Method of correction.
The employing agency must promptly submit a redesignation record or a recharacterization record in accordance with this part and the procedures provided to employing agencies by the Board and/or the TSP record keeper in bulletins or other guidance.
(c)
Processing redesignations and recharacterizations.
(1) Upon receipt of a properly submitted redesignation record, the TSP record keeper shall treat the erroneously submitted contribution (and associated positive earnings) as if the contribution had been made to the correct balance on the date that it was contributed to the wrong balance. The TSP record keeper will adjust the participant's traditional balance and the participant's Roth balance accordingly. The TSP record keeper will also adjust the participant's Roth initiation date as necessary.
(2) Upon receipt of a properly submitted recharacterization record or recharacterization request, the TSP record keeper will update the tax characterization of the erroneously characterized contribution.
(3) Agency automatic (1%) contributions and agency matching contributions cannot be redesignated as Roth contributions or recharacterized as tax-exempt contributions.
(4) There is no breakage associated with redesignation or recharacterization actions.

# Subpart C—Board or TSP Record Keeper Errors
§ 1605.21
Plan-paid breakage and other corrections.
(a)
Plan-paid breakage.
(1) Subject to paragraph (a)(3) of this section, if, because of an error committed by the Board or the TSP record keeper, a participant's account is not credited or charged with the investment gains or losses the account would have received had the error not occurred, the account will be credited accordingly.
(2) Errors that warrant the crediting of breakage under paragraph (a)(1) of this section include, but are not limited to:
(i) Delay in crediting contributions or other money to a participant's account;
(ii) Improper issuance of a loan or TSP withdrawal payment to a participant or beneficiary which requires the money to be restored to the participant's account; and
(iii) Investment of all or part of a participant's account in the wrong investment fund(s).
(3) A participant will not be entitled to breakage under paragraph (a)(1) of this section if the participant had the use of the money on which the investment gains would have accrued.
(4) If the participant continued to have a TSP account, or would have continued to have a TSP account but for the Board or TSP record keeper's error, the TSP record keeper will compute gains or losses under paragraph (a)(1) of this section for the relevant period based upon the investment funds in which the affected money would have been invested had the error not occurred. If the participant did not have, and should not have had, a TSP account during this period, then the TSP will use the rate of return set forth in § 1605.2(b) for the relevant period and return the money to the participant.
(b)
Other corrections.
The Executive Director may, in his or her discretion and consistent with the requirements of applicable law, correct any other errors not specifically addressed in this section, including payment of breakage, if the Executive Director determines that the correction would serve the interests of justice and fairness and equity among all participants of the TSP.
[87 FR 31678, May 24, 2022]
§ 1605.22
Claims for correction of Board or TSP record keeper errors; time limitations.
(a)
Filing claims.
Claims for correction of Board or TSP record keeper errors under this subpart may be submitted initially either to the TSP
record keeper or the Board. The claim must be in writing and may be from the affected participant or beneficiary.
(b)
Board's or TSP record keeper's discovery of error.
(1) Upon discovery of an error made within the past six months involving a receipt or a disbursement, the Board or TSP record keeper must promptly correct the error on its own initiative. If the error was made more than six months before its discovery, the Board or the TSP record keeper may exercise sound discretion in deciding whether to correct the error, but, in any event, must act promptly in doing so.
(2) For errors involving an investment in the wrong fund caused by Board or TSP record keeper error, the Board or the TSP record keeper must promptly pay breakage if it is discovered within 30 days of the issuance of the most recent TSP participant (or loan) statement, transaction confirmation, or other notice that reflected the error, whichever is earlier. If it is discovered after that time, the Board or TSP record keeper may use its sound discretion in deciding whether to pay breakage, but, in any event, must act promptly in doing so.
(c)
Participant's or beneficiary's discovery of error.
(1) If the Board or TSP record keeper fails to discover an error of which a participant or beneficiary has knowledge involving a receipt or a disbursement, the participant or beneficiary may file a claim for correction of the error with the Board or the TSP record keeper without time limit. The Board or the TSP record keeper must promptly correct any such error for which the participant or beneficiary filed a claim within six months of its occurrence; the correction of any such error for which the participant or beneficiary filed a claim after that time is in the sound discretion of the Board or TSP record keeper.
(2) For errors involving an investment in the wrong fund of which a participant or beneficiary has knowledge, he or she may file a claim for breakage with the Board or TSP record keeper no later than 30 days after the TSP provides the participant with a transaction confirmation or other notice reflecting the error, or makes available on its Web site a participant statement reflecting the error, whichever is earlier. The Board or TSP record keeper must promptly pay breakage for such errors.
(3) If a participant or beneficiary fails to file a claim for breakage concerning an error involving an investment in the wrong fund in a timely manner, the Board or TSP record keeper may nevertheless, in its sound discretion, pay breakage for any such error that is brought to its attention.
(d)
Processing claims.
(1) If the initial claim is submitted to the TSP record keeper, the TSP record keeper may either respond directly to the claimant, or may forward the claim to the Board for response. If the TSP record keeper responds to a claim, and all or any part of the claim is denied, the claimant may request review by the Board within 90 days of the date of the TSP record keeper's response.
(2) If the Board denies all or any part of a claim (whether upon review of a TSP record keeper denial or upon an initial review by the Board), the claimant will be deemed to have exhausted his or her administrative remedy and may file suit under 5 U.S.C. 8477. If the claimant does not submit a request to the Board for review of a claim denial by the TSP record keeper within the 90 days permitted under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the claimant will be deemed to have accepted the TSP record keeper's decision.

# Subpart D—Miscellaneous Provisions
§ 1605.31
Contributions missed as a result of military service.
(a)
Applicability.
This section applies to employees who meet the conditions specified at 5 CFR 1620.40 and who are eligible to make up employee contributions or to receive employing agency contributions missed as a result of military service.
(b)
Missed employee contributions.
An employee who separates or enters nonpay status to perform military service may be eligible to make up TSP contributions when he or she is reemployed or restored to pay status in the
civilian service. Eligibility for making up missed employee contributions will be determined in accordance with the rules specified at 5 CFR part 1620, subpart E. Missed employee contributions must be made up in accordance with the rules set out in § 1605.11(c) and 5 CFR 1620.42.
(c)
Missed agency contributions.
This paragraph (c) applies only to an employee who would have been eligible to receive agency contributions had he or she remained in civilian service or pay status. A FERS employee who separates or enters nonpay status to perform military service is eligible to receive agency makeup contributions when he or she is reemployed or restored to pay status in the civilian service, as follows:
(1) The employee is entitled to receive the agency automatic (1%) contributions that he or she would have received had he or she remained in civilian service or pay status. Within 60 days of the employee's reemployment or restoration to pay status, the employing agency must calculate the makeup agency automatic (1%) contributions and report those contributions to the record keeper, subject to any reduction in agency automatic (1%) contributions required by paragraph (c)(5) of this section.
(2) An employee who contributed to a uniformed services TSP account during the period of military service is also immediately entitled to receive makeup agency matching contributions to his or her civilian account for the employee contributions to the uniformed services account that were deducted from his or her basic pay, subject to any reduction in agency matching contributions required by paragraph (c)(4) of this section. However, an employee is not entitled to receive makeup agency matching makeup contributions on contributions that were deducted from his or her incentive pay or special pay, including bonus pay, while performing military service.
(3) An employee who makes up missed contributions is entitled to receive attributable makeup agency matching contributions (unless the employee has already received the maximum amount of matching contributions, as described in paragraphs (c)(2) and (4) of this section).
(4) If the employee received uniformed services agency matching contributions, the makeup agency matching contributions will be reduced by the amount of the uniformed services agency matching contributions.
(5) If the employee received uniformed services agency automatic (1%) contributions, the agency automatic (1%) contributions will be reduced by the amount of the uniformed services agency automatic (1%) contributions.
(d)
Breakage.
The employee is entitled to breakage on agency contributions made under paragraph (c) of this section. Breakage will be calculated based on the investment election(s) on file for the participant during the period of military service.

# Subpart A—General
§ 1620.1
Application.
The Federal Employees' Retirement System Act of 1986 (codified as amended largely at 5 U.S.C. 8351 and 8401 through 8479) originally limited TSP eligibility to specifically named groups of employees. On various occasions, Congress has since expanded TSP eligibility to other groups. Depending on the circumstances, that subsequent legislation requires retroactive contributions or provides other special features. Where necessary, this part describes those special features. The employees and employing agencies covered by this part are also governed by the other regulations in 5 CFR chapter VI to the extent that they do not conflict with the regulations of this part.
[64 FR 31057, June 9, 1999, as amended at 70 FR 32213, June 1, 2005]

(c)
Reimbursement by agency ultimately chargeable with expense.

[64 FR 31057, June 9, 1999, as amended at 67 FR 49526, July 30, 2002]
§ 1620.45
Suspending TSP loans, restoring post-employment distributions, and reversing loan foreclosures..
(a)
Suspending TSP loans during nonpay status.
If the TSP record keeper is notified that an employee entered into a nonpay status to perform military service, any outstanding TSP loan from a civilian TSP account will be suspended, that is, it will not be declared a loan foreclosure while the employee is performing military service.
(1) Interest will accrue on the loan balance during the period of suspension. When the employee returns to civilian pay status, the employing agency will resume deducting loan payments from the participant's basic pay and the TSP record keeper will reamortize the loan (which will include interest accrued during the period of military service). The maximum loan repayment term will be extended by the employee's period of military service. Consequently, when the employee returns to pay status, the TSP record keeper must receive documentation to show the beginning and ending dates of military service.
(2) The TSP record keeper may close the loan account and declare it to be a loan foreclosure if the TSP record keeper does not receive documentation that the employee entered into nonpay status. However, this can be reversed in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.
(b)
Restoring post-employment distributions.
An employee who separates from civilian service to perform military service and who receives an automatic payment pursuant to § 1650.11 may return to the TSP an amount equal to the amount of the payment. The employee must notify the TSP record keeper of his or her intent to return the distributed funds within 90 days of the date the employee returns to civilian service or pay status; if the employee is eligible to return a distribution, the TSP record keeper will then inform the employee of the actions that must be taken to return the funds.
(c)
Reversing loan foreclosures.
An employee may request that a loan foreclosure be reversed it resulted from the employee's separation or placement in nonpay status to perform military service. The TSP record keeper will reverse the loan foreclosure under the process described as follows:
(1) An employee who received a post-employment distribution when he or she separated to perform military service can have a loan foreclosure reversed only if the distributed amount is returned as described in paragraph (b) of this section;
(2) A loan foreclosure can be reversed either by reinstating the loan or by repaying it in full. The TSP loan can be reinstated only if the employee agrees to repay the loan within the maximum loan repayment term plus the length of military service, and if, after reinstatement of the loan, the employee will have no more than two outstanding loans, only one of which is a residential loan; and
(3) The employee must notify the TSP record keeper of his or her intent to reverse a loan foreclosure within 90 days of the date the employee returns to civilian service or pay status; if the employee is eligible to reverse a loan foreclosure, the TSP record keeper will then inform the employee of the actions that must be taken to reverse the distribution.
(d)
Breakage.
Employees will not receive breakage on amounts returned to their accounts under this section.
[87 FR 31679, May 24, 2022]
§ 1620.46
Agency responsibilities.
(a)
General.
Each employing agency must establish procedures for implementing these regulations. These procedures must at a minimum require agency personnel to identify eligible employees and notify them of their options under these regulations and the time period within which these options must be exercised.
(b)
Agency records; procedure for reimbursement.
The agency making payments to the record keeper for all contributions and attributable breakage will obtain from prior employing agencies whatever information is necessary to make accurate payments. If a prior employing agency is ultimately chargeable under § 1620.43(b) for all or part of this expense, the agency making the payments to the TSP record keeper will determine the procedure to follow in order to collect amounts owed to it by the agency ultimately chargeable with the expense.
(c)
Payment schedule; matching contributions report.
Agencies will, with the employee's consent, prepare a payment schedule for making retroactive employee contributions which will be consistent with the procedures established at 5 CFR part 1605 for the correction of employing agency errors.
(d)
Agency automatic (1%) contributions.
Employing agencies must calculate the agency automatic (1%) contributions for all reemployed (or restored) FERS employees and report those contributions to the TSP record keeper within 60 days of reemployment.
(e)
Forfeiture restoration.
When notified by an employee that a forfeiture of the agency automatic (1%) contributions occurred after the employee separated to perform military service, the employing agency must complete and file the appropriate paper TSP form with the TSP record keeper in accordance with the form's instructions to have those funds restored.
(f)
Thrift Savings Plan Service Computation Date.
The agencies must include the period of military service in the Thrift Savings Plan Service Computation Date (TSP-SCD) of all reemployed FERS employees. If the period of military service has not been credited, the agencies must submit an employee data record to the TSP record keeper containing the correct TSP Service Computation Date.

(b)
Non-TSP Board records.
An individual who wishes to know if a specific system of records maintained by the Board contains a record pertaining to him or her, or who wishes access to such records, shall address a written request to the Privacy Act Officer, Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board, 77 K Street, NE., Suite 1000, Washington, DC 20002. The request letter should contain the complete name and identifying number of the pertinent system as published in the annual
Federal Register
notice describing the Board's Systems of Records; the
full name and address of the subject individual; the subject's Social Security number if a Board employee; a brief description of the nature, time, place, and circumstances of the individual's prior association with the Board; and any other information the individual believes would help the Privacy Act Officer determine whether the information about the individual is included in the system of records. In instances where the information is insufficient to ensure disclosure to the subject individual to whom the record pertains, the Board reserves the right to ask the requester for additional identifying information. The words “PRIVACY ACT REQUEST” should be printed on both the letter and the envelope.
[55 FR 18852, May 7, 1990, as amended at 59 FR 55331, Nov. 7, 1994; 64 FR 67693, 67695, Dec. 3, 1999; 71 FR 50319, Aug. 25, 2006; 72 FR 51353, Sept. 7, 2007; 77 FR 11384, Feb. 27, 2012; 79 FR 68094, Nov. 14, 2014; 85 FR 12431, Mar. 3, 2020]

[55 FR 18852, May 7, 1990, as amended at 59 FR 26409, May 20, 1994; 64 FR 67694, Dec. 3, 1999]
§ 1630.6
Action on request.
(a) For TSP records, the record keeper designee, and for non-TSP records, the Privacy Act Officer will answer or acknowledge the inquiry within 10 work days of the date it is received. When the answer cannot be made within 10 work days, the record keeper or Privacy Act Officer will provide the requester with the date when a response may be expected and, whenever possible, the specific reasons for the delay.
(b) At a minimum, the acknowledgement to a request for access shall include:
(1) When and where the records will be available;
(2) Name, title and telephone number of the official who will make the records available;

§ 1630.7
Identification requirements.
(a)
In person.
An individual should be prepared to identify himself or herself by signature,
i.e.,
to note by signature the date of access, Social Security number, and to produce one photographic form of identification (driver's license, employee identification, annuitant card, passport, etc.). If an individual is unable to produce adequate identification, the individual must sign a statement asserting his or her identity and acknowledging that knowingly or willfully seeking or obtaining access to records about another person under false pretenses may result in a fine of up to $5,000 (see § 1630.18). In addition, depending upon the sensitivity of the records, the Privacy Act Officer or record keeper designee after consulting with the appropriate system manager may require further reasonable assurances, such as statements of other individuals who can attest to the identity of the requester.
(b)
In writing.
A participant shall provide his or her name, date of birth, and account number or Social Security number and shall sign the request. Most other individuals shall provide the participant's account number or Social Security number, shall provide a statement of relationship to the participant unless it is clearly identified in the nature of the correspondence,
and shall sign the request. If a request for access is granted by mail and, in the opinion of the Privacy Act Officer or record keeper designee after consulting with the appropriate system manager, the disclosure of the records through the mail may result in harm or embarrassment (if a person other than the subject individual were to receive the records), a notarized statement of identity or some other similar assurance of identity will be required.
(c)
By telephone.
(1) Telephone identification procedures apply only to requests from participants and spouses, former spouses, or beneficiaries of participants for information in FRTIB-1, Thrift Savings Plan Records, which is retrieved by their respective account numbers (or case reference numbers) or Social Security numbers.
(2) A participant or a spouse, former spouse, or beneficiary of a participant must identify himself or herself by providing to the record keeper designee his or her name, account number (or case reference number) or Social Security number, and any other information requested. If the record keeper designee determines that any of the information provided by telephone is incorrect, the requester will be required to submit a request in writing.
(3) A participant may also access the TSP website or call the TSP ThriftLine to obtain account information. These systems may require identity and account verification information and may require the participant to verify his or her identity by providing identifying particulars.
[55 FR 18852, May 7, 1990, as amended at 64 FR 67694, Dec. 3, 1999; 72 FR 51354, Sept. 7, 2007; 85 FR 12431, Mar. 3, 2020]
§ 1630.8

(b) No official or employee of the Board, or any contractor of the Board or other Federal agency operating a Board system of records under an interagency agreement, shall disclose any record to any person or to another agency without the express written consent of the subject individual, unless the disclosure is:
(1) To officers or employees (including contract employees) of the Board or the record keeper who need the information to perform their official duties;
(2) Pursuant to the requirements of the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552;

and are available from the Board's Privacy Act Officer);
(4) To the Bureau of the Census for uses under title 13 of the United States Code;
(5) To a person or agency which has given the Board or the record keeper advance written notice of the purpose of the request and certification that the record will be used only for statistical purposes. (In addition to deleting personal identifying information from records released for statistical purposes, the Privacy Act Officer or record keeper designee shall ensure that the identity of the individual cannot reasonably be deduced by combining various statistical records);
(6) To the National Archives of the United States if a record has sufficient historical or other value to warrant its continued preservation by the United States Government, or for evaluation by the Archivist of the United States or the designee of the Archivist to determine whether the record has such value;
(7) In response to a written request that identifies the record and the purpose of the request made by another agency or instrumentality of any Government jurisdiction within or under the control of the United States for civil or criminal law enforcement activity, if that activity is authorized by law;
(8) To a person pursuant to a showing of compelling circumstances affecting the health or safety of an individual, if upon such disclosure a notification is transmitted to the last known address of the subject individual;
(9) To either House of Congress, or to a Congressional committee or subcommittee if the subject matter is within its jurisdiction;
(10) To the Comptroller General, or an authorized representative, in the course of the performance of the duties of the General Accounting Office;
(11) Pursuant to the order of a court of competent jurisdiction; or
(12) To a consumer reporting agency in accordance with section 3711(f) of Title 31.
[55 FR 18852, May 7, 1990, as amended at 64 FR 67694, Dec. 3, 1999]
§ 1630.9
Access to the history (accounting) of disclosures from records.
Rules governing access to the accounting of disclosures are the same as those for granting access to the records as set forth in § 1630.4.
§ 1630.10
Denials of access.
(a) The Privacy Act Officer or the record keeper designee for records covered by system FRTIB-1, may deny an individual access to his or her record if:
(1) In the opinion of the Privacy Act Officer or the record keeper designee, the individual seeking access has not provided proper identification to permit access; or
(2) The Board has published rules in the
Federal Register
exempting the pertinent system of records from the access requirement.
(b) If access is denied, the requester shall be informed of the reasons for denial and the procedures for obtaining a review of the denial.
[55 FR 18852, May 7, 1990, as amended at 64 FR 67695, Dec. 3, 1999]
§ 1630.11
Requirements for requests to amend records.
(a)
TSP records.
(1) A spouse, former spouse or beneficiary of a TSP participant who wants to correct or amend his or her record must write to the TSP record keeper. A participant in the TSP who wants to correct or amend a TSP record pertaining to him or her shall submit a written request in accordance with the following chart:
To correct or amend a TSP record
If the type of record is:
If you are a participant who is a current Federal employee write to:
If you are a participant who has separated from Federal employment write to:
Personnel or personal records (e.g., age, address, Social Security number, date of birth).
Write to your employing agency.
Write to TSP record keeper.
The agency's and the participant's contributions, and adjustments to contributions.
Write to your employing agency.
Write to your former employing agency.
Earnings, investment allocation, interfund transfers, loans, loan repayments, and withdrawals
Write to TSP record keeper.
Write to TSP record keeper.
(2) The address of the record keeper is listed in § 1630.4(a).
(3) Requests for amendments which are claims for money because of administrative error will be processed in accordance with the Board's Error Correction regulations found at 5 CFR part l605. Sections 1630.12(b)-1630.14 of this part do not apply to such money claim amendments to TSP records as the Error Correction regulations are an equivalent substitute. Non-money claim TSP record appeals are covered by §§ 1630.12-1630.14, or if covered by the above chart the employing, or former employing, agency's Privacy Act procedures.
(4) Corrections to TSP account records which are made by the Board, its recordkeeper or the employing agency or the former employing agency on its own motion because of a detected administrative error will be effected without reference to Privacy Act procedures.
(5) A participant in the TSP who is currently employed by a Federal agency should be aware that the employing agency provides to the Board personal and payroll records on the participant, such as his or her date of birth, Social Security number, retirement code, address, loan repayments, the amount of participant's contribution, amount of the Government's contribution, if the participant is covered by the Federal Employees' Retirement System Act (FERSA, 5 U.S.C. Chapter 84), and adjustments to contributions. Requests submitted to the Board, or its recordkeeper, to correct information provided by the employing Federal agency
will be referred to the employing agency. The reason for this referral is that the Board receives information periodically for the TSP accounts; if the employing agency does not resolve the alleged error, the Board will continue to receive the uncorrected information periodically regardless of a one-time Board correction. The employing agency also has custody of the election form (which is maintained in the Official Personnel Folder). Requests for amendment or correction of records described in this paragraph should be made to the employing agency.
(b)
Non-TSP records.
(1) Any other individual who wants to correct or amend a record pertaining to him or her shall submit a written request to the Board's Privacy Act Officer whose address is listed in § 1630.4. The words “Privacy Act—Request to Amend Record” should be written on the letter and the envelope.
(2) The request for amendment or correction of the record should, if possible, state the exact name of the system of records as published in the
Federal Register
; a precise description of the record proposed for amendment; a brief statement describing the information the requester believes to be inaccurate or incomplete, and why; and the amendment or correction desired. If the request to amend the record is the result of the individual's having gained access to the record in accordance with §§ 1630.4, 1630.5, 1630.6 or § 1630.7, copies of previous correspondence between the requester and the Board should be attached, if possible.
(3) If the individual's identity has not been previously verified, the Board may require documentation of identification as described in § 1630.7.
[55 FR 18852, May 7, 1990, as amended at 64 FR 67694, 67695, Dec. 3, 1999]
§ 1630.12
Action on request to amend a record.
(a) For TSP records, the record keeper will acknowledge a request for amendment of a record, which is to be decided by that office in accordance with the chart in § 1630.11, within 10 work days. Requests received by the record keeper which are to be decided by the current or former employing agency will be sent to that agency by the record keeper within 3 work days of the date of receipt. A copy of the transmittal letter will be sent to the requester.
(b) For non-TSP records, the Privacy Act Officer will acknowledge a request for amendment of a record within 10 work days of the date the Board receives it. If a decision cannot be made within this time, the requester will be informed by mail of the reasons for the delay and the date when a reply can be expected, normally within 30 work days from receipt of the request.
(c) The final response will include the decision whether to grant or deny the request. If the request is denied, the response will include:
(1) The reasons for the decision;
(2) The name and address of the official to whom an appeal should be directed;
(3) The name and address of the official designated to assist the individual in preparing the appeal;
(4) A description of the appeal process with the Board; and
(5) A description of any other procedures which may be required of the individual in order to process the appeal.
[55 FR 18852, May 7, 1990, as amended at 64 FR 67695, Dec. 3, 1999]
§ 1630.13
Procedures for review of determination to deny access to or amendment of records.
(a) Individuals who disagree with the refusal to grant them access to or to amend a record about them should submit a written request for review to the Executive Director, Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board, 77 K Street, NE., Suite 1000, Washington, DC 20002. The words “PRIVACY ACT—APPEAL” should be written on the letter and the envelope. Individuals who need assistance preparing their appeal should contact the Board's Privacy Act Officer.
(b) The appeal letter must be received by the Board within 30 calendar days from the date the requester received the notice of denial. At a minimum, the appeal letter should identify:
(1) The records involved;
(2) The date of the initial request for access to or amendment of the record;
(3) The date of the Board's denial of that request; and
(4) The reasons supporting the request for reversal of the Board's decision.
Copies of previous correspondence from the Board denying the request to access or amend the record should also be attached, if possible.
(c) The Board reserves the right to dispose of correspondence concerning the request to access or amend a record if no request for review of the Board's decision is received within 180 days of the decision date. Therefore, a request for review received after 180 days may, at the discretion of the Privacy Act Officer, be treated as an initial request to access or amend a record.
[55 FR 18852, May 7, 1990, as amended at 59 FR 55331, Nov. 7, 1994; 77 FR 11384, Feb. 27, 2012]
§ 1630.14
Appeals process.
(a) Within 20 work days of receiving the request for review, the Executive Director will make a final determination on appeal. If a final decision cannot be made in 20 work days, the Privacy Act Officer will inform the requester of the reasons for the delay and the date on which a final decision can be expected. Such extensions are unusual, and should not exceed an additional 30 work days.
(b) If the original request was for access and the initial determination is reversed, the procedures in § 1630.7 will be followed. If the initial determination is upheld, the requester will be so informed and advised of the right to judicial review pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(g).
(c) If the initial denial of a request to amend a record is reversed, the Board or the record keeper will correct the record as requested and inform the individual of the correction. If the original decision is upheld, the requester will be informed and notified in writing of the right to judicial review pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(g) and the right to file a concise statement of disagreement with the Executive Director. The statement of disagreement should include an explanation of why the requester believes the record is inaccurate, irrelevant, untimely, or incomplete. The Executive Director shall maintain the statement of disagreement with the disputed record, and shall include a copy of the statement of disagreement to any person or agency to whom the record has been disclosed, if the disclosure was made pursuant to § 1630.9.
[55 FR 18852, May 7, 1990, as amended at 64 FR 67695, Dec. 3, 1999; 79 FR 68094, Nov. 14, 2014]

§ 1631.2
Purpose and scope.
This subpart contains the regulations of the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board, implementing 5 U.S.C. 552. The regulations of this subpart describe the procedures by which records may be obtained from all organizational units within the Board and from its recordkeeper. Official records of the Board, except those already published in bulk by the Board, available pursuant to the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 552 shall be furnished to members of the public only as prescribed by this subpart. To the extent that it is not prohibited by other laws the Board also will make available records which it is authorized to withhold under 5 U.S.C. 552 whenever it determines that such disclosure is in the interest of the Thrift Savings Plan.
§ 1631.3
Organization and functions.
(a) The Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board was established by the Federal Employees' Retirement System Act of 1986 (Pub. L. 99-335, 5 U.S.C. 8401 et seq.). Its primary function is to manage and invest the Thrift Savings Fund for the exclusive benefit of its participants (e.g., participating Federal employees, Federal judges, and Members of Congress). The Board is responsible for investment of the assets of the Thrift Savings Fund and the management of the Thrift Savings Plan. The Board consists of:
(1) The five part-time members who serve on the Board;
(2) The Office of the Executive Director;
(3) The Office of Participant Experience;
(4) The Office of General Counsel;
(5) The Office of Investments;
(6) The Office of Planning and Risk;
(7) The Office of External Affairs;
(8) The Office of Chief Financial Officer;
(9) The Office of Resource Management; and
(10) The Office of Technology Services.
(b) The Board has no field organization; however, it provides for its recordkeeping responsibility by contract or interagency agreement. The recordkeeper may be located outside of the Washington, DC area. Thrift Savings Plan records maintained for the Board by its recordkeeper are Board records subject to these regulations. Board offices are presently located at 77 K Street, NE., Suite 1000, Washington, DC 20002.

§ 1631.4
Proactive disclosure of Board records.
(a) Records that are required by the FOIA to be made available for public inspection and copying may be accessed through the Board's Web site at
https://www.frtib.gov
. The Board is responsible for determining which of its records are required to be made publicly available, as well as identifying additional records of interest to the public that are appropriate for public disclosure, and for posting and indexing such records. The Board shall ensure that its Web site of posted records and indices is reviewed and updated on an ongoing basis. The Board has a FOIA Public Liaison who can assist individuals in locating records particular to a component. The FOIA Public Liaison can be contacted at
frtibfoialiaison@tsp.gov
.
(b) The FOIA Officer shall maintain an index of Board regulations, directives, bulletins, and published materials.
(c) The FOIA officer shall also maintain a file open to the public, which shall contain copies of all grants or denials of FOIA requests, appeals, and appeal decisions by the Executive Director. The materials shall be filed by chronological number of request within each calendar year, indexed according to the exceptions asserted, and, to the extent feasible, indexed according to the type of records requested.

§ 1631.5
Records of other agencies.
Requests for records that originated in another agency and that are in the custody of the Board may, in appropriate circumstances, be referred to
that agency for consultation or processing, and the requestor shall be notified of the part or parts of the request that have been referred and provided with a point of contact within the receiving agency.

§ 1631.6
How to request records—form and content.
(a) A request made under the FOIA may be submitted by one of the following methods:
(1) In writing addressed to FOIA Officer, Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board, 77 K Street NE., Suite 1000, Washington, DC 20002. The words “FOIA Request” should be clearly marked on both the letter and the envelope.
(2) By electronic mail at
FOIAREQUEST@tsp.gov.
The subject should include the words “FOIA Request.”
(3) By facsimile, Attn: FOIA Officer, at 202-942-1676. The facsimile should be clearly marked with the words “FOIA Request.”
(b) Each request must reasonably describe the record(s) sought, including, when known: Entity/individual originating the record, date, subject matter, type of document, location, and any other pertinent information which would assist in promptly locating the record(s). Each request should also describe the type of entity the requester is for fee purposes. See § 1631.11.
(c) When a request is not considered reasonably descriptive, or requires the production of voluminous records, or places an extraordinary burden on the Board, seriously interfering with its normal functioning to the detriment of the Thrift Savings Plan, the Board may require the person or agent making the FOIA request to confer with a Board representative in order to attempt to verify, and, if possible, narrow the scope of the request.
(d) Upon initial receipt of the FOIA request, the FOIA Officer will determine which official or officials within the Board shall have the primary responsibility for collecting and reviewing the requested information and drafting a proposed response.
(e) Any Board employee or official who receives a FOIA request shall promptly forward it to the FOIA Officer, at the above address. Any Board employee or official who receives an oral request for records shall inform the requestor that FOIA requires requests to be in writing according to the procedures set out herein.
(f) When a person requesting expedited access to records has demonstrated a compelling need, or when the Board has determined that it is appropriate to expedite its response, the Board will process the request ahead of other requests.
(g) To demonstrate compelling need in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section, the requester must submit a written statement that contains a certification that the information provided therein is true and accurate to the best of the requester's knowledge and belief. The statement must demonstrate that:
(1) The failure to obtain the record on an expedited basis could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual; or
(2) The requester is a person primarily engaged in the dissemination of information, and there is an urgent need to inform the public concerning an actual or alleged Federal Government activity that is the subject of the request.
[55 FR 41052, Oct. 9, 1990, as amended at 59 FR 55331, Nov. 7, 1994; 63 FR 41708, Aug. 5, 1998; 77 FR 11384, Feb. 27, 2012; 77 FR 61229, Oct. 9, 2012; 82 FR 24826, May 31, 2017]
§ 1631.7
Initial determination.
The FOIA Officer shall have the authority to approve or deny requests received pursuant to these regulations. The decision of the FOIA Officer shall be final, subject only to administrative review as provided in § 1631.10.
§ 1631.8
Prompt response.
(a)(1) When the FOIA Officer receives a request for expedited processing, he or she will determine within 10 work days whether to process the request on an expedited basis.
(2) When the FOIA Officer receives a request for records which he or she, in good faith, believes is not reasonably descriptive, he or she will so advise the requester within 5 work days. The time
limit for processing such a request will not begin until receipt of a request that reasonably describes the records being sought.
(b) The FOIA Officer will either approve or deny a reasonably descriptive request for records within 20 workdays after receipt of the request. Whenever the Board cannot meet the statutory time limit for processing a request because of “unusual circumstances,” as defined in the FOIA, and the Board extends the time limit on that basis, the Board must, before expiration of the 20-day period to respond, notify the requester in writing of the unusual circumstances involved and of the date by which the Board estimates processing of the request will be completed. Where the extension exceeds 10 working days, the Board must, as described by the FOIA, provide the requester with an opportunity to modify the request or arrange an alternative time period for processing the original or modified request through the Board's FOIA Public Liaison or FOIA Officer.
(c) When additional time is required for one of the reasons stated in paragraph (b) of this section, the FOIA Officer will extend this time period for an additional 10 work days by written notice to the requester. If the Board will be unable to process the request within this additional time period, the requester will be notified and given the opportunity to—
(1) Limit the scope of the request; or
(2) Arrange with the FOIA Officer an alternative time frame for processing the request.

§ 1631.9
Responses—form and content.
(a) When a requested record has been identified and is available, the FOIA officer shall notify the person making the request as to where and when the record is available for inspection or that copies will be made available. The notification shall also provide the requestor with an estimated amount of fees assessed under § 1631.13 of this part, including a breakdown of the fees for search, review, and/or duplication.
(b) A denial or partial denial of a request for a record shall be in writing signed by the FOIA Officer and shall include:
(1) The name and title of the person making the determination;
(2) A statement of fees assessed, if any; and
(3) A reference to the specific exemption under the FOIA authorizing the withholding of the record, and a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record withheld; or
(4) If appropriate, a statement that, after diligent effort, the requested records have not been found or have not been adequately examined during the time allowed by § 1631.8, and that the denial will be reconsidered as soon as the search or examination is complete; and
(5) A statement that the denial may be appealed to the Executive Director within 90 calendar days of receipt of the denial or partial denial, that the requestor has the option to contact the Agency's FOIA Liaison at
frtibfoialiaison@tsp.gov,
and that the requestor has the option to contact the Office of Government Information Service (OGIS) as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation.
(c) If, after diligent effort, existing requested records have not been found, or are known to have been destroyed or otherwise disposed of, the FOIA Officer shall so notify the requester.
[55 FR 41052, Oct. 9, 1990, as amended at 79 FR 68094, Nov. 14, 2014; 82 FR 24827, May 31, 2017]
§ 1631.10
Appeals to the Executive Director from initial denials.
(a) A requestor may appeal any adverse determinations to the Executive Director. The appeal must be made in writing and for it to be considered timely it must be postmarked, or in the case of electronic submissions, transmitted, within 90 calendar days of receipt of the denial or partial denial. The appeal should be addressed to the Executive Director, Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board, 77 K Street NE., Suite 1000, Washington, DC 20002, and should be clearly labeled as a “Freedom of Information Act Appeal.”
(b)(1) The Executive Director will act upon the appeal of a denial of a request for expedited processing within 5 work days of its receipt.
(2) The Executive Director will act upon the appeal of a denial of a request for records within 20 work days of its receipt.
(c) The Executive Director will decide the appeal in writing and mail the decision to the requester.
(d) If the appeal concerns an expedited processing request and the decision is in favor of the person making the request, the Executive Director will order that the request be processed on an expedited basis. If the decision concerning a request for records is in favor of the requester, the Executive Director will order that the subject records be promptly made available to the person making the request.
(e) If the appeal of a request for expedited processing of records is denied, in whole or in part, the Executive Director's decision will set forth the basis for the decision. If the appeal of a request for records is denied, in whole or in part, the Executive Director's decision will set forth the exemption relied on and a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the records withheld and the reasons for asserting it, if different from the reasons described by the FOIA Officer under § 1631.9. The denial of a request for records will state that the person making the request may, if dissatisfied with the decision on appeal, file a civil action in Federal court. (A Federal court does not have jurisdiction to review a denial of a request for expedited processing after the Board has provided a complete response to the request.) The denial will also inform the requester of the mediation services offered by the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) of the National Archives and Records Administration as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation. If the FOIA Officer's decision is remanded or modified on appeal, the requestor will be notified of that determination in writing.
(f) No personal appearance, oral argument, or hearing will ordinarily be permitted in connection with an appeal of a request for expedited processing or an appeal for records.
(g) On appeal of a request concerning records, the Executive Director may reduce any fees previously assessed.
(h) Seeking mediation and dispute resolution services through OGIS is a voluntary process. If the requestor chooses to use these services, the Board will work with OGIS to resolve disputes between requestors and the Board as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation.
(i) Before seeking review by a court of the FOIA Officer's adverse determination, a requestor generally must first submit a timely administrative appeal to the Executive Director.

§ 1631.11
Fees to be charged—categories of requesters.
(a) In general, the Board will charge for processing requests under the FOIA in accordance with the provisions of this section and with the OMB Guidelines. For purposes of assessing fees there are three categories of FOIA requestors—commercial use requestors, non-commercial scientific or educational institutions or news media requesters, and all other requestors.
(1) Fees shall be limited to reasonable standard charges for document search, duplication, and review, when records are requested for commercial use. Commercial users are not entitled to two hours of free search time or 100 free pages of reproduction of documents. The full allowable direct cost of searching for, and reviewing records will be charged even if there is ultimately no disclosure of records. A commercial use request is a request that asks for information for a use or a purpose that furthers a commercial, trade, or profit interest, which can include furthering those interests through litigation. The Board's decision to place a requester in the commercial use category will be made on a case-by-case basis based on the requester's intended use of the information. The Board will notify requesters of their placement in this category.
(2) Fees shall be limited to reasonable standard charges for document duplication when records are not sought for commercial use and the request is made by a representative of the news media. A representative of the news media is any person or entity that
gathers information of potential interest to a segment of the public, uses its editorial skills to turn the raw materials into a distinct work, and distributes that work to an audience. The term “news” means information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. The Board will advise requesters of their placement in this category.
(3) Fees shall be limited to reasonable standard charges for document duplication when records are not sought for commercial use and the request is made by an educational or noncommercial scientific institution, whose purpose is scholarly or scientific research. A noncommercial scientific institution is an institution that is not operated on a “commercial” basis, as defined in paragraph (a)(1) of this section and that is operated solely for the purpose of conducting scientific research the results of which are not intended to promote any particular product or industry. A requester in this category must show that the request is authorized by and is made under the auspices of a qualifying institution and that the records are sought to further scientific research and are not for a commercial use. The Board will advise requesters of their placement in this category.
(4) For any request which does not meet the criteria contained in paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this section, fees shall be limited to reasonable standard charges for document search and duplication, except that the first 100 pages of reproduction and the first two hours of search time will be furnished without charge. If computer search time is required, the first two hours of computer search time will be based on the hourly cost of operating the central processing unit and the operator's hourly salary plus 23.5 percent. When the cost of the computer search, including the operator time and the cost of operating the computer to process the request, equals the equivalent dollar amount of two hours of the salary of the person performing the search,
i.e.,
the operator, the Board shall begin assessing charges for computer search. Requests from individuals requesting records about themselves filed in the Board's systems of records shall continue to be treated under the provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974, which permit fees only for reproduction. The Board's fee schedule is set out in § 1631.14 of this part.
(b) Except for requests that are for a commercial use, the Board may not charge for the first two hours of search time or for the first 100 pages of reproduction. However, a requestor may not file multiple requests at the same time, each seeking portions of a document or documents, solely in order to avoid payment of fees. When the Board believes that a requester or, on rare occasions, a group of requesters acting in concert, is attempting to break a request down into a series of requests for the purpose of evading the assessment of fees, the Board may aggregate any such requests and charge accordingly. For example, it would be reasonable to presume that multiple requests of this type made within a 30 calendar day period had been made to avoid fees. For requests made over a long period, however, the Board must have a reasonable basis for determining that aggregation is warranted in such cases. Before aggregating requests from more than one requester, the Board must have a reasonable basis on which to conclude that the requesters are acting in concert and are acting specifically to avoid payment of fees. In no case may the Board aggregate multiple requests on unrelated subjects from one requester.
(c) In accordance with the prohibition of section (4)(A)(iv) of the Freedom of Information Act, as amended, the Board shall not charge fees to any requester, including commercial use requesters, if the cost of collecting a fee would be equal to or greater than the fee itself.
(1) For commercial use requesters, if the direct cost of searching for, reviewing for release, and duplicating the records sought would not exceed $25, the Board shall not charge the requester any costs.
(2) For requests from representatives of news media or educational and noncommercial scientific institutions, excluding the first 100 pages which are provided at no charge, if the duplication cost would not exceed $25, the Board shall not charge the requester any costs.
(3) For all other requests not falling within the category of commercial use requests, representatives of news media, or educational and noncommercial scientific institutions, if the direct cost of searching for and duplicating the records sought, excluding the first two hours of search time and first 100 pages which are free of charge, would not exceed $25, the Board shall not charge the requester any costs.
(d) Except as provided in paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(3) of this section, the Board will not assess any search fees (or duplication fees for requesters under (a)(2) or (3) of this section) if the Board fails to comply with the time limits set forth in § 1631.8.
(1) If the Board determines that “unusual circumstances,” as defined in the FOIA, apply and the Board provided a timely written notice to the requester in accordance with § 1631.8, the Board is excused for an additional 10 days from the restrictions of this section.
(2) If the Board has determined that unusual circumstances apply and more than 5,000 pages are necessary to respond to the request, the Board may charge search fees (or duplication fees for requesters under (a)(2) or (3) of this section) if the Board provided a timely written notice to the requester in accordance with § 1631.8 and the Board has discussed with the requester, or made not less than 3 good-faith attempts to do so, how the requester could effectively limit the scope of the request.
(3) If a court has determined that exceptional circumstances exist, as defined in the FOIA, the Agency's delay shall be excused in accordance with the court order.
[55 FR 41052, Oct. 9, 1990, as amended at 63 FR 41708, Aug. 5, 1998; 82 FR 24827, May 31, 2017]
§ 1631.12
Waiver or reduction of fees.
(a) The Board may waive all fees or levy a reduced fee when disclosure of the information requested is deemed to be in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the Board or Federal Government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. In making its decision on waiving or reducing fees, the Board will consider the following factors:
(1) Whether the subject of the requested records concerns the operations or activities of the Board or the Government,
(2) Whether the disclosure is likely to contribute to an understanding of Government operations or activities (including those of the Board),
(3) Whether the disclosure is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of TSP or Government operations or activities,
(4) Whether the requester has a commercial interest that would be furthered by the requested disclosure, and
(5) Whether the magnitude of the identified commercial interest of the requester is sufficiently large, in comparison with the public interest in disclosure, that disclosure is primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.
(b) A fee waiver request must indicate the existence and magnitude of any commercial interest that the requester has in the records that are the subject of the request.
§ 1631.13
Prepayment of fees over $250.
(a) When the Board estimates or determines that allowable charges that a requester may be required to pay are likely to exceed $250.00, the Board may require a requester to make an advance payment of the entire fee before continuing to process the request.
(b) When a requester has previously failed to pay a fee charged in a timely fashion (
i.e.,
within 30 calendar days of the date of the billing), the Board may require the requester to pay the full amount owed plus any applicable interest as provided in § 1631.14(d), and to make an advance payment of the full amount of the estimated fee before the agency begins to process a new request or a pending request from that requester.
