# Explanation
The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.
Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:
Title 1 through Title 16
as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27
as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41
as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50
as of October 1
The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.

# LEGAL STATUS
The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

# HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS
The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, July 1, 2025), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

# EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES
Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.

# OMB CONTROL NUMBERS
The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request.
Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.

# PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE
Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.

# “[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY
The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not dropped in error.

# INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE
What is incorporation by reference?
Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.
What is a proper incorporation by reference?
The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:
(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.
(b) The matter incorporated is adequately summarized in the preamble of the final rule and is available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.
(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?
If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or email fr.inspection@nara.gov.

# CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES
A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR
Index and Finding Aids.
This volume contains the Parallel Table of Authorities and Rules. A list of CFR titles, chapters, subchapters, and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in this volume.
An index to the text of “Title 3—The President” is carried within that volume.
The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. This index is based on a consolidation of the “Contents” entries in the daily Federal Register.
A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

# REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL
There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing in the Code of Federal Regulations.

# Editorial Note:
At 82 FR 54924, Nov. 17, 2017, as required by the Congressional Review Act and Public Law 115-5, the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement removed all amendments to part 700 made effective on Jan. 19, 2017, at 81 FR 93319, Dec. 20, 2016.
§ 700.1
Scope.
The regulations in chapter VII of 30 CFR, consisting of parts 700 through 899, establish the procedures through which the Secretary of the Interior will implement the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (Pub. L. 95-87, 91 Stat. 445 (30 U.S.C. 1201
et. seq.
)). Chapter VII is divided into 13 subchapters.
(a) Subchapter A contains introductory information intended to serve as a guide to the rest of the chapter and to the regulatory requirements and definitions generally applicable to the programs and persons covered by the Act.
(b) Subchapter B contains regulations covering the initial regulatory program which apply before the applicability of permanent program regulations to persons conducting surface coal mining and reclamation operations and other persons covered by the Act.
(c) Subchapter C sets forth regulations covering applications for and decisions on permanent State programs; the process to be followed for substituting a Federal program for an approved State program, if necessary; the process for assuming temporary Federal enforcement of an approved State program; and the process for implementing a Federal program in a State when required by the Act.
(d) Subchapter D of this chapter identifies the procedures that apply to surface coal mining and reclamation operations conducted on Federal lands rather than State or private lands and incorporates by reference the requirements of the applicable regulatory program and the inspection and enforcement requirements of subchapter L of this chapter.
(e) Subchapter E of this chapter contains regulations that apply to surface coal mining and reclamation operations conducted on Indian lands.
(f)(1) Subchapter F implements the requirements of the Act for—
(i) Designating lands which are unsuitable for all or certain types of surface coal mining operations;
(ii) Terminating designations no longer found to be appropriate; and
(iii) Prohibiting surface coal mining and reclamation operations on those lands or areas where the Act states that surface coal mining operations should not be permitted or should be permitted only after specified determinations are made.
(2) Subchapter F does not include regulations governing designation of areas unsuitable for noncoal mining under the terms of section 601 of the Act or the designation of Federal lands under the Federal lands review provisions of section 522(b) of the Act. The Bureau of Land Management of the Department of the Interior is responsible for these provisions which will be implemented when promulgated by regulations in title 43 of the Code of Federal Regulations.
(g) Subchapter G governs applications for and decisions on permits for surface coal mining and reclamation operations on non-Indian and non-Federal lands under a State or Federal program. It also governs coal exploration and permit application and decisions on permits for special categories of coal mining on non-Indian and non-Federal lands under a State or Federal
program. Regulations implementing the experimental practices provision of the Act are also included in subchapter G.
(h) Subchapter J sets forth requirements for performance bonds and public liability insurance for both surface mining and underground mining activities.
(i) Subchapter K sets forth the environmental and other performance standards which apply to coal exploration and to surface coal mining and reclamation operations during the permanent regulatory program. The regulations establish the minimum requirements for operations under State and Federal programs. Performance standards applicable to special mining situations such as anthracite mines, steep slope mining, alluvial valley floors, and prime farmlands are included.
(j) Subchapter L sets forth the inspection, enforcement, and civil penalty provisions that apply to a State, Federal, or Federal lands program.
(k) Subchapter M sets forth the requirements for the training, examination, and certification of blasters.
(l) Subchapter P sets forth the provisions for protection of employees who initiate proceedings under the Act or testify in any proceedings resulting from the administration or enforcement of the Act.
(m) Subchapter R sets forth the regulations for the abandoned mine land reclamation program. These regulations include the fee collection requirements and the mechanisms for implementing the State and Federal portions of the abandoned mine land reclamation program.
(n) Subchapter S sets forth the regulations that apply to grants for mining and mineral research institutes and grants for mineral research projects.
[44 FR 15313, Mar. 13, 1979, as amended at 48 FR 6934, Feb. 16, 1983; 49 FR 38477, Sept. 28, 1984]
§ 700.2
Objective.
The objective of chapter VII is to fulfill the purposes of the Act found in section 102 in a manner which is consistent with the language of the Act, its legislative history, other applicable laws, and judicial interpretations.
§ 700.3
Authority.
The Secretary is authorized to administer the requirements of the Act, except the following:
(a) Provisions of the Act that authorize the Secretary of Agriculture to establish programs for the reclamation of rural lands, identification of prime agricultural lands, and other responsibilities described in the Act. Regulations promulgated by the Secretary of Agriculture are in 7 CFR;
(b) Provisions of the Act for which responsibility is specifically assigned to other Federal agencies, including the Department of Labor, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Corps of Engineers, the Council on Environmental Quality, and the Department of Energy; and
(c) Authority retained by the States to enforce State laws or regulations which are not inconsistent with the Act and this chapter, including the authority to enforce more stringent land use and environmental controls and regulations.
§ 700.4
Responsibility.
(a) The Director of the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement, under the general direction of the Assistant Secretary, Energy and Minerals, is responsible for exercising the authority of the Secretary, except for the following:
(1) Approval, disapproval or withdrawal of approval of a State program and implementation of a Federal program. The Director is responsible for exercising the authority of the Secretary to substitute Federal enforcement of a State program under section 521(b) of the Act.
(2) Designation of non-Federal lands or Federal lands without the concurrence of the Federal surface managing agency as unsuitable for all or certain types of surface coal mining operations under section 522 of the Act and as unsuitable for non-coal mining under section 601 of the Act; and
(3) Authority to approve or disapprove mining plans to conduct surface coal mining and reclamation operations on Federal lands.
(b) The Director is responsible for consulting with Federal land-managing
agencies and Federal agencies with responsibility for natural and historic resources on Federal lands on actions which may have an effect on their responsibilities.
(c) The States are responsible for the regulation of surface coal mining and reclamation operations under the initial regulatory program and surface coal mining and reclamation operations and coal exploration under an approved State program and the reclamation of abandoned mine lands under an approved State Reclamation Plan on non-Federal and non-Indian lands in accordance with procedures in this chapter.
(d) The Secretary may delegate to a State through a cooperative agreement certain authority relating to the regulation of surface coal mining and reclamation operations on Federal lands in accordance with 30 CFR part 745.
(e) The Director, Office of Hearings and Appeals, U.S. Department of the Interior, is responsible for the administration of administrative hearings and appeals required or authorized by the Act pursuant to the regulations in 43 CFR part 4.

Information collected in § 700.13 identifies the person and nature of a citizen's suit, so that OSMRE or a state can respond appropriately.
[53 FR 44363, Nov. 2, 1988]
§ 700.11
Applicability.
(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, this chapter applies to all coal exploration and surface coal mining and reclamation operations, except:
(1) The extraction of coal by a landowner for his or her own noncommercial use from land owned or leased by him or her. Noncommercial use does not include the extraction of coal by one unit of an integrated company or other business or nonprofit entity which uses the coal in its own manufacturing or power plants;
(2) The extraction of 250 tons of coal or less by a person conducting a surface coal mining and reclamation operation. A person who intends to remove more than 250 tons is not exempted;
(3) The extraction of coal as an incidental part of Federal, State or local government-financed highway or other construction in accordance with part 707 of this chapter;
(4) The extraction of coal incidental to the extraction of other minerals where coal does not exceed 16
2/3
percent of the total tonnage of coal and other minerals removed for purposes of commercial use or sale in accordance with part 702 of this chapter.
(5) Coal exploration on lands subject to the requirement of 43 CFR parts 3480-3487.
(b) This chapter does not apply to the extraction of coal for commercial purposes where the surface coal mining and reclamation operation, together with any related operations, has or will have an affected area of two acres or less. For purposes of this paragraph:
(1) Where a segment of a road is used for access or coal haulage by more than one surface coal mining operation, the entire segment shall be included in the affected area of each of those operations; provided, that two or more operations which are deemed related pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section shall be considered as one operation for purposes of this paragraph.
(2) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, surface coal mining operations shall be deemed related if they occur within twelve months of each other, are physically related, and are under common ownership or control.
(i) Operations shall be deemed physically related if drainage from both operations flows into the same watershed at or before a point within five aerial miles of either operation.
(ii) Operations shall be deemed under common ownership or control if they are owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by or on behalf of:
(A) The same person;
(B) Two or more persons, one of whom controls, is under common control with, or is controlled by the other; or
(C) Members of the same family and their relatives, unless it is established that there is no direct or indirect business relationship between or among them;
(iii) For purposes of this paragraph,
control
means: Ownership of 50 percent or more of the voting shares of, or general partnership in, an entity; any relationship which gives one person the ability in fact or law to direct what the other does; or any relationship which gives one person express or implied authority to determine the manner in which coal at different sites will be mined, handled, sold or disposed of.
(3) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the regulatory authority may determine, in accordance with the procedures applicable to requests for determination of exemption pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section, that two or more surface coal mining operations shall not be deemed related if, considering the history and circumstances relating to the coal, its location, the operations at the sites in question, all related operations and all persons mentioned in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, the regulatory authority concludes in writing that the operations are not of the type which the Act was intended to regulate and that there is no intention on the part of such operations or persons to evade the requirements of the Act or the applicable regulatory program.
(4) The exemption provided by paragraph (b) of this section applies only to operations with an affected area of less than two acres where coal is being extracted for commercial purposes and to surface coal mining operations within that affected area incidental to such operations.
(c) The regulatory authority may on its own initiative and shall, within a reasonable time of a request from any person who intends to conduct surface coal mining operations, make a written determination whether the operation is exempt under this section. The regulatory authority shall give reasonable notice of the request to interested persons. Prior to the time a determination is made, any person may submit, and the regulatory authority shall consider, any written information relevant to the determination. A person requesting that an operation be declared exempt shall have the burden of establishing the exemption. If a written determination of exemption is reversed through subsequent administrative or judicial action, any person who, in good faith, has made a complete and accurate request for an exemption and relied upon the determination, shall not be cited for violations which occurred prior to the date of the reversal.
(d)(1) A regulatory authority may terminate its jurisdiction under the regulatory program over the reclaimed site of a completed surface coal mining and reclamation operation, or increment thereof, when:
(i) The regulatory authority determines in writing that under the initial program, all requirements imposed under subchapter B of this chapter have been successfully completed; or
(ii) The regulatory authority determines in writing that under the permanent program, all requirements imposed under the applicable regulatory program have been successfully completed or, where a performance bond was required, the regulatory authority has made a final decision in accordance with the State or Federal program counterpart to part 800 of this chapter to release the performance bond fully.
(2) Following a termination under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the regulatory authority shall reassert jurisdiction under the regulatory program over a site if it is demonstrated that the bond release or written determination referred to in paragraph (d)(1) of this section was based upon fraud,
collusion, or misrepresentation of a material fact.

§ 702.1
Scope.
This part implements the exemption contained in section 701(28) of the Act concerning the extraction of coal incidental to the extraction of other minerals where coal does not exceed 16
2/3
percent of the total tonnage of coal and other minerals removed for purposes of commercial use or sale.
§ 702.5
Definitions.
As used in this part, the following terms have the meaning specified, except where otherwise indicated:
(a)
Cumulative measurement period
means the period of time over which both cumulative production and cumulative revenue are measured.
(1) For purposes of determining the beginning of the cumulative measurement period, subject to regulatory authority approval, the operator must select and consistently use one of the following:
(i) For mining areas where coal or other minerals were extracted prior to August 3, 1977, the date extraction of coal or other minerals commenced at that mining area or August 3, 1977, or
(ii) For mining areas where extraction of coal or other minerals commenced on or after August 3, 1977, the date extraction of coal or other minerals commenced at that mining area, whichever is earlier.
(2) For annual reporting purposes pursuant to § 702.18 of this part, the end of the period for which cumulative production and revenue is calculated is either
(i) For mining areas where coal or other minerals were extracted prior to April 1, 1990, March 31, 1990, and every March 31 thereafter; or
(ii) For mining areas where extraction of coal or other minerals commenced on or after April 1, 1990, the last day of the calendar quarter during which coal extraction commenced, and each anniversary of that day thereafter.
(b)
Cumulative production
means the total tonnage of coal or other minerals extracted from a mining area during the cumulative measurement period. The inclusion of stockpiled coal and other mineral tonnages in this total is governed by § 702.16.
(c)
Cumulative revenue
means the total revenue derived from the sale of coal or other minerals and the fair market value of coal or other minerals transferred or used, but not sold, during the cumulative measurement period.
(d)
Mining area
means an individual excavation site or pit from which coal, other minerals and overburden are removed.
(e)
Other minerals
means any commercially valuable substance mined for its mineral value, excluding coal, topsoil, waste and fill material.
§ 702.10
Information collection.
The collections of information contained in §§ 702.11, 702.12, 702.13, 702.15 and 702.18 of this part have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501
et seq.
and assigned clearance number 1029-0089. The information will be used to determine the initial and continuing applicability of the incidental mining exemption to a particular mining operation. Response is required to obtain and maintain the incidental mining exemption in accordance with section 701(28) of the Act.
Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average one hour per response, including the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Send comments regarding this burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing the burden, to Information Collection Clearance Officer, OSM Department of the Interior, 1951 Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20240; and to the Office of Management and Budget, Paperwork Reduction Project (1029-0089), OMB, Washington, DC 20503.
§ 702.11
Application requirements and procedures.
(a)(1) Any person who plans to commence or continue coal extraction after April 1, 1990, under a Federal program or on Indian lands, or after the effective date of counterpart provisions in a State program, in reliance on the incidental mining exemption shall file a complete application for exemption with the regulatory authority for each mining area.
(2) Following incorporation of an exemption application approval process into a regulatory program, a person may not commence coal extraction based upon the exemption until the regulatory authority approves such application, except as provided in paragraph (e)(3) of this section.
(b) Existing operations. Any person who has commenced coal extraction at a mining area in reliance upon the incidental mining exemption prior to April 1, 1990, in a State with a Federal program or on Indian lands, or prior to the effective date of counterpart provisions in a State program, may continue mining operations for 60 days after such effective date. Coal extraction may not continue after such 60-day period unless that person files an administratively complete application for exemption with the regulatory authority. If an administratively complete application is filed within 60 days, the person may continue extracting coal in reliance on the exemption beyond the 60-
day period until the regulatory authority makes an administrative decision on such application.
(c) Additional information. The regulatory authority shall notify the applicant if the application for exemption is incomplete and may at any time require submittal of additional information.
(d) Public comment period. Following publication of the newspaper notice required by § 702.12(g), the regulatory authority shall provide a period of no less than 30 days during which time any person having an interest which is or may be adversely affected by a decision on the application may submit written comments or objections.
(e) Exemption determination. (1) No later than 90 days after filing of an administratively complete application, the regulatory authority shall make a written determination whether, and under what conditions, the persons claiming the exemption are exempt under this part, and shall notify the applicant and persons submitting comments on the application of the determination and the basis for the determination.
(2) The determination of exemption shall be based upon information contained in the application and any other information available to the regulatory authority at that time.
(3) If the regulatory authority fails to provide an applicant with the determination as specified in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, an applicant who has not begun may commence coal extraction pending a determination on the application unless the regulatory authority issues an interim finding, together with reasons therefor, that the applicant may not begin coal extraction.
(f) Administrative review. (1) Any adversely affected person may request administrative review of a determination under paragraph (e) of this section within 30 days of the notification of such determination in accordance with procedures established under 43 CFR 4.1280 when OSM is the regulatory authority or under corresponding State procedures when a State is the regulatory authority.
(2) A petition for administrative review filed under 43 CFR 4.1280 or under corresponding State procedures shall not suspend the effect of a determination under paragraph (e) of this section.

(c) Information requested to be held as confidential under paragraph (b) of this section shall not be made publicly available until after notice and opportunity to be heard is afforded persons both seeking and opposing disclosure of the information.
§ 702.14
Requirements for exemption.
(a) Activities are exempt from the requirements of the Act if all of the following are satisfied:
(1) The cumulative production of coal extracted from the mining area determined annually as described in this paragraph does not exceed 16
2/3
percent of the total cumulative production of coal and other minerals removed during such period for purposes of bona fide sale or reasonable commercial use.
(2) Coal is produced from a geological stratum lying above or immediately below the deepest stratum from which other minerals are extracted for purposes of bona fide sale or reasonable commercial use.
(3) The cumulative revenue derived from the coal extracted from the mining area determined annually shall not exceed 50 percent of the total cumulative revenue derived from the coal and other minerals removed for purposes of bona fide sale or reasonable commercial use. If the coal extracted or the minerals removed are used by the operator or transferred to a related entity for use instead of being sold in a bona fide sale, then the fair market value of the coal or other minerals shall be calculated at the time of use or transfer and shall be considered rather than revenue.
(b) Persons seeking or that have obtained an exemption from the requirements of the Act shall comply with the following:
(1) Each other mineral upon which an exemption under this part is based must be a commercially valuable mineral for which a market exists or which is mined in bona fide anticipation that a market will exist for the mineral in the reasonably foreseeable future, not to exceed twelve months from the end
of the current period for which cumulative production is calculated. A legally binding agreement for the future sale of other minerals is sufficient to demonstrate the above standard.
(2) If either coal or other minerals are transferred or sold by the operator to a related entity for its use or sale, the transaction must be made for legitimate business purposes.
§ 702.15
Conditions of exemption and right of inspection and entry.
A person conducting activities covered by this part shall:

§ 705.1
Purpose.
This part sets forth the minimum policies and procedures that States must establish and use to implement section 517(g) of the Act in order to eligible for reimbursement of costs of enforcing and administering the initial regulatory program under section 502, or for grants for developing, administering and enforcing a State regulatory program under section 705 of the Act, or to assume primary regulatory authority under section 503 of the Act (Pub. L. 95-87). Compliance with the policies and procedures in this part will satisfy the requirements of section 517(g) of the Act. Section 517(g) prohibits certain employees of the State Regulatory Authority from having any direct or indirect financial interest in any underground or surface coal mining operation. The regulations in this part are applicable to employees of the State Regulatory Authority as defined in § 705.5.
§ 705.2
Objectives.
The objectives of this part are:
(a) To ensure that the States adopt a standard program for implementing the provisions in section 517(g) of the Act.
(b) To establish methods which will ensure, as required by section 517(g) of the Act, that each employee of the State Regulatory Authority who performs any function or duty under the Act does not have a direct or indirect financial interest in any underground or surface coal mining operation.
(c) To establish the methods by which the monitoring, enforcing and reporting responsibilities of the Secretary of the Interior as stated in section 517(g) will be accomplished.

Send comments regarding this burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing the burden, to the Information Collection Clearance Officer, Office of Surface Mining, 1951 Constitution Avenue NW., room 5415-L, Washington, DC 20240; and the Office of Management and Budget, Paperwork Reduction Project 1029-0067, Washington, DC 20503.
[56 FR 46988, Sept. 17, 1991]
§ 705.11
Who shall file.
(a) Any employee who performs any function or duty under the Act is required to file a statement of employment and financial interests. Members of advisory boards and commissions established in accordance with State laws or regulations to represent multiple interests, who perform a function or duty under the Act, must file a statement of employment and financial interests. An employee who occupies a position which has been determined by the Head of the State Regulatory Authority not to involve performance of any function or duty under the Act or who is no longer employed by the State Regulatory Authority at the time a filing is due, is not required to file a statement.
(b) The Head of each State Regulatory Authority shall prepare a list of those positions within the State Regulatory Authority that do not involve performance of any functions or duties under the Act. State Regulatory Authorities may be organized to include
more activities than are covered by the Act. For example, if a State has identified its Department of Natural Resources as the State Regulatory Authority there may be only one or two offices within that Department which have employees who perform any functions, or duties under the Act. In those cases, the Head of the State Regulatory Authority shall list the title of boards, offices, bureaus or divisions within the State Regulatory Authority which do not perform any functions or duties under the Act and list the positions not performing functions or duties under the Act for only those boards, offices, bureaus or divisions that do have some employees performing functions or duties under the Act. Only those employees who are employed in a listed organizational unit or who occupy a listed position will be exempted from the filing requirements of section 517(g) of the Act.
(c) The Head of each State Regulatory Authority shall prepare and submit to the director, an initial listing of positions that do not involve performance of any functions or duties under the Act within 60 days of the effective date of these regulations.
(d) The Head of each State Regulatory Authority shall annually review and update this listing. For monitoring and reporting reasons, the listing must be submitted to the Director and must contain a written justification for inclusion of the positions listed. Proposed revisions or a certification that revision is not required shall be submitted to the Director by no later than September 30 of each year. The Head of each State Regulatory Authority may revise the listing by the addition or deletion of positions at any time he or she determines such revisions are required to carry out the purpose of the law or the regulations of this part. Additions to and deletions from the listing of positions are effective upon notification to the incumbents of the positions added or deleted.
(e) The Secretary or the Director may modify the listing at any time one or both of them determines that the listing submitted by the Head of a State Regulatory Authority indicates that coverage is not sufficient to carry out the purpose of the law or the regulations of this part.
[42 FR 56060, Oct. 20, 1977, as amended at 51 FR 37122, Oct. 17, 1986]
§ 705.13
When to file.
(a) Employees and members of advisory boards and commissions representing multiple interests performing functions or duties under the Act shall file:
(1) Within 120 days of the effective date of these regulations; and
(2) Annually on February 1 of each year, or at such other date as may be agreed to by the Director, provided that such alternative date will allow sufficient time to obtain information needed by the Director for his or her annual report to the Congress.
(b) New employees and new members of advisory boards and commissions representing multiple interest hired, appointed, or transferred to perform functions or duties under the Act will be required to file at the time of entrance to duty.
(c) New employees and new members of advisory boards and commissions representing multiple interests are not required to file an annual statement on the subsequent annual filing date if this date occurs within two months after their initial statement was filed. For example, an employee entering duty on December 2, 1986 would file a statement on that date. Because December 2 is within two months of February 1 the employee would not be required to file his or her next annual statement until February 1, 1988.
[51 FR 37122, Oct. 17, 1986]
§ 705.15
Where to file.
The head of the State Regulatory Authority shall file his or her statement with the Director. All other employees and members of advisory boards and commissions representing multiple interests, as provided in § 705.11, shall file their statements with the head of the State Regulatory Authority or such other official as may be designated by State law or regulation.
[51 FR 37122, Oct. 17, 1986]
§ 705.17
What to report.
(a) Each employee shall report all information required on the statement of employment and financial interests of the employee, his or her spouse, minor children, or other relatives who are fulltime residents of the employee's home. The report shall be on OSM Form 23 as provided by the Office. The statement consists of three major parts, (1) a listing of all financial interests, including employment, security, real property, creditor and other financial interests held during the course of the preceding year, (2) a certification that none of the listed financial interests represent a direct or indirect financial interest in an underground or surface coal mining operation except as specifically identified and described by the employee as part of the certificate and (3) a certification by the reviewer that the form was reviewed, that prohibited interests have been resolved, and that no other prohibited interests have been identified from the statement.
(b) Listing of all financial interests. The statement will set forth the following information regarding any financial interest:
(1)
Employment.
Any continuing financial interests in business entities and nonprofit organizations through a pension or retirement plan, shared income, salary or other income arrangement as a result of prior or current employment. The employee, his or her spouse or other resident relative is not required to report a retirement plan from which he or she will receive a guaranteed income. A guaranteed income is one which is unlikely to be changed as a result of actions taken by the State Regulatory Authority.
(2)
Securities.
Any financial interest in business entities and nonprofit organizations through ownership of stock, stock options, bonds, securities or other arrangements including trusts. An employee is not required to report mutual funds, investment clubs or regulated investment companies not specializing in underground and surface coal mining operations.
(3)
Real Property.
Ownership, lease, royalty or other interests or rights in lands or minerals. Employees are not required to report lands developed and occupied for a personal residence.
(4)
Creditors.
Debts owed to business entities and nonprofit organizations. Employees are not required to report debts owed to financial institutions (banks, savings and loan associations, credit unions, and the like) which are chartered to provide commercial or personal credit. Also excluded are charge accounts and similar short term debts for current and ordinary household and living expenses.
(c) Employee certification, and, if applicable, a listing of exceptions.
(1) The statement will provide for a signed certification by the employee that to the best of his or her knowledge, (i) none of the listed financial interests represent an interest in an underground or surface coal mining operation except as specifically identified and described as exceptions by the employee as part of the certificate, and (ii) the information shown on the statement is true, correct, and complete.
(2) An employee is expected to (i) have complete knowledge of his or her personal involvement in business enterprises such as a sole proprietorship and partnership, his or her outside employment and the outside employment of the spouse and other covered relatives, and (ii) be aware of the information contained in the annual financial statement or other corporate or business reports routinely circulated to investors or routinely made available to the public.
(3) The exceptions shown in the employee certification of the form must provide enough information for the Head of the State Regulatory Authority to determine the existence of a direct or indirect financial interest. Accordingly, the exceptions should:
(i) List the financial interests;
(ii) Show the number of shares, estimated value or annual income of the financial interests; and
(iii) Include any other information which the employee believes should be considered in determining whether or not the interest represents a prohibited interest.
(4) Employees are cautioned to give serious consideration to their direct and indirect financial interests before
signing the statement of certification. Signing the certification without listing known prohibited financial interests may be cause for imposing the penalties prescribed in § 705.6(a).
[42 FR 56060, Oct. 20, 1977, as amended at 56 FR 46988, Sept. 17, 1991]
§ 705.18
Gifts and gratuities.
(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, employees shall not solicit or accept, directly or indirectly, any gift, gratuity, favor, entertainment, loan or any other thing of monetary value, from a coal company which:
(1) Conducts or is seeking to conduct, operations or activities that are regulated by the State Regulatory Authority; or
(2) Has interests that may be substantially affected by the performance or non-performance of the employee's official duty.
(b) The prohibitions in paragraph (a) of this section do not apply in the context of obvious family or personal relationships, such as those between the parents, children, or spouse of the employee and the employee, when the circumstances make it clear that it is those relationships rather than the business of the persons concerned which are the motivating factors. An employee may accept:
(1) Food and refreshments of nominal value on infrequent occasions in the ordinary course of a luncheon, dinner, or other meeting where an employee may properly be in attendance; and
(2) Unsolicited advertising or promotional material, such as pens, pencils, note pads, calendars and other items of nominal value.
(c) Employees found guilty of violating the provisions of this section will be subject to administrative remedies in accordance with existing or adopted State regulations or policies.
§ 705.19
Resolving prohibited interests.
(a) Actions to be taken by the Head of the State Regulatory Authority:
(1) Remedial action to effect resolution. If an employee has a prohibited financial interest, the Head of the State Regulatory Authority shall promptly advise the employee that remedial action which will resolve the prohibited interest is required within 90 days.
(2) Remedial action may include:
(i) Reassignment of the employee to a position which performs no function or duty under the Act, or
(ii) Divestiture of the prohibited financial interest, or
(iii) Other appropriate action which either eliminates the prohibited interest or eliminates the situation which creates the conflict.
(3) Reports of noncompliance. If 90 days after an employee is notified to take remedial action that employee is not in compliance with the requirements of the Act and these regulations, the Head of the State Regulatory Authority shall report the facts of the situation to the Director who shall determine whether action to impose the penalties prescribed by the Act should be initiated. The report to the Director shall include the original or a certified true copy of the employee's statement and any other information pertinent to the Director's determination, including a statement of actions being taken at the time the report is made.
(b) Actions to be taken by the Director:
(1) Remedial action to effect resolution. Violations of the regulations in this part of the Head of a State Regulatory Authority, will be cause for remedial action by the Governor of the State or other appropriate State official based on recommendations from the Director on behalf of the Secretary. The Governor or other appropriate State official shall promptly advise the Head of the State Regulatory Authority that remedial action which will resolve the prohibited interest is required within 90 days.
(2) Remedial action should be consistent with the procedures prescribed for other State employees by § 705.19(a)(2).
(3) Reports on noncompliance.
(i) If 90 days after the Head of State Regulatory Authority is notified to take remedial action the Governor or other appropriate State official notifies the Director that the Head of the State Regulatory Authority is not in compliance with the Act and these regulations, the Director shall report the facts of the situation to the Secretary who shall determine whether the action to impose the penalties prescribed
by the Act, or to impose the eligibility restrictions prescribed by § 705.1 should be initiated.
(ii) Within 30 days of receipt of a noncompliance report from the Head of a Regulatory Authority under § 705.19(a)(3), the Director shall notify the Head of the State Regulatory Authority and the employee involved of additional action to be taken. Actions which the Director may take include but are not limited to the granting of additional time for resolution or the initiation of action to impose the penalties prescribed by the Act.
§ 705.21
Appeals procedures.
Employees have the right to appeal an order for remedial action under § 705.19, and shall have 30 days to exercise this right before disciplinary action is initiated.

[42 FR 56060, Oct. 20, 1977, as amended at 56 FR 46988, Sept. 19, 1991]
§ 706.6
Penalties.
(a) Criminal penalties are imposed by section 201(f) of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977, Pub. L. 95-87, which prohibits each employee of the Office or any other Federal employee who performs any function or duty under the Act from having a direct or indirect financial interest in underground or surface coal mining operations. The Act provides that whoever knowingly violates the provisions of section 201(f) shall, upon conviction, be punished by a fine of not more than $2,500, or by imprisonment for not more than one year, or both.
(b) Regulatory penalties are imposed by this part. The provisions in section 201(f) of the Act make compliance with the financial interest requirements a condition of employment for all Office employees and for other Federal employees who perform any functions or duties under the Act. Accordingly, an employee who fails to file the required financial statement will be considered in violation of the intended employment provisions of section 201(f) and will be subject to removal from his or her position.
§ 706.11
Who shall file.
(a) Every employee in the Office is required to file a statement of employment and financial interests.
(b) Any other Federal employee who performs any function or duty under the Act is required to file a statement of employment and financial interests. The Head of each other Federal agency and the Heads of other bureaus and offices within the U.S. Department of the Interior shall prepare and submit a report within 60 days of the effective date of these regulations, either listing the Federal positions identified as performing functions or duties under the Act, or listing the organizational unit and showing the total number of employees within the unit who must file a statement. Revision to the listing or certification that revision is not required shall be submitted to the Director by no later than September 30 of each year. The Secretary, the Director, or the Heads of the other affected Federal organizations may revise the list by the addition or deletion of positions at any time such revisions are required to carry out the purpose of the law or regulations of this part. Additions to or deletions from the list of positions are effective upon notification to the incumbents.
§ 706.13
When to file.
(a) Employees performing functions or duties under the Act will be required to file:
(1) Within 120 days of the effective date of these regulations, and
(2) Annually on February 1 of each year or at such other date as may be agreed to by the Director, provided that such alternative date will allow sufficient time to obtain information needed by the Director for his or her annual report to the Congress.
(b) New employees hired, appointed, or transferred to perform functions or duties under the Act will be required to file at the time of entrance to duty.
(c) New employees are not required to file an annual statement on the subsequent annual filing date if this date occurs within two months after their initial statement was filed. For example, an employee entering duty on December 1, 1978 would file a statement on that date. Because December 1 is within two months of February 1 the employee would not be required to file his or her next annual statement until February 1, 1980.
§ 706.15
Where to file.
(a) Each Office employee shall file his or her statement of employment and financial interests with the Director.
(b) Each Department of the Interior employee, who is not an Office employee but does perform any function or duty under the Act, shall file a statement of employment and financial interests with his or her appropriate Ethics Counselor as identified in 43 CFR 20.735-22(c).
(c) Each employee of another Federal agency who performs a function or duty under the Act shall file a statement of employment and financial interests with the official designated by the Head of the other Federal agency.
§ 706.17
What to report.
(a) Each employee shall report all information required on the statement of employment and financial interests of the employee, his or her spouse, minor children, or other relatives who are fulltime residents of the employee's home. The report shall be on a form provided by the Office or on a similar form adopted by another Federal agency. The statement shall consist of three major parts, (1) a listing of all financial interests, including employment, security, real property, creditor and other financial interests held during the course of the preceding year, (2) a certification that none of the listed financial interests represent a direct or indirect financial interest in an underground or surface coal mining operation except as specifically identified and described by the employee as part of the certificate, and (3) a certification by the reviewer that the form was reviewed, that prohibited interests have been resolved, and that no other prohibited interests have been identified from the statement.
(b) Listing of all financial interests. The statement will set forth the following information regarding any financial interest:
(1)
Employment.
Any continuing financial interests in business entities and nonprofit organizations through a pension or retirement plan, shared income, salary or other income arrangement as a result of prior or current employment. The employee, his or her spouse or other resident relative is not required to report a statement plan from which he or she will receive a guaranteed income. A guaranteed income is one which is unlikely to be changed as a result of actions taken by the Federal Government under the Act.
(2)
Securities.
Any financial interest in business entities and nonprofit organizations through ownership of stock, stock options, bonds, securities or other arrangements including trusts. An employee is not required to report holdings in widely diversified mutual funds, investment clubs or regulated investment companies not specializing in underground and surface coal mining operations.
(3)
Real property.
Ownership, lease, royalty or other interests or rights in lands or minerals. Employees are not required to report lands developed and occupied for a personal residence.
(4)
Creditors.
Debts owed to business entities and nonprofit organizations. Employees are not required to report debts owed to financial institutions (banks, savings and loan associations, credit unions, and the like) which are chartered to provide commercial or personal credit. Also excluded are charge accounts and similar short term debts for current and ordinary household and living expenses.
(c) Employee certification, and if applicable, a listing of exceptions.
(1) The statement will provide for a signed certification by the employee that to the best of his or her knowledge, (i) none of the listed financial interests represent an interest in an underground or surface coal mining operation except as specifically identified and described as exceptions by the employee as part of the certificate, and (ii) the information shown on the
statement is true, correct, and complete.
(2) An employee is expected to (i) have complete knowledge of his or her personal involvement in business enterprises such as a sole proprietorship and partnership, his or her outside employment and the outside employment of the spouse and other covered relatives, and (ii) be aware of the information contained in the annual financial statements or other corporate or business reports routinely circulated to investors or routinely made available to the public.
(3) The exceptions shown in the employee certification of the form must provide enough information for the Director, the Head of another Federal agency, or the Head of other bureaus or offices within the U.S. Department of the Interior to determine the existence of a direct or indirect financial interest. Accordingly, the exceptions should:
(i) List the financial interests;
(ii) Show the number of shares, estimated value or annual income of the financial interests; and
(iii) Include any other information which the employee believes should be considered in determining whether or not the interest represents a prohibited interest.
(4) Employees are cautioned to give serious consideration to their direct and indirect financial interests before signing the statement of certification. Signing the certification without listing known prohibited financial interests may be cause for imposing the penalties prescribed in § 706.6(a).
§ 706.18
Gifts and gratuities.
(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, employees shall not solicit or accept, directly or indirectly, any gift, gratuity, favor, entertainment, loan, or any other thing of monetary value, from a coal company which:
(1) Conducts or is seeking to conduct operations or activities that are regulated by the Federal Government; or
(2) Has interests that may be substantially affected by the performance or nonperformance of the employee's official duty.
(b) The prohibitions in paragraph (a) of this section do not apply in the context of obvious family or personal relationships, such as those between the parents, children, or spouse of the employee and the employee, when the circumstances make it clear that it is those relationships rather than the business of the persons concerned which are the motivating factors. An employee may accept:
(1) Food and refreshments of nominal value on infrequent occasions in the ordinary course of a luncheon, dinner, or other meeting where an employee may properly be in attendance, and
(2) Unsolicited advertising or promotional material, such as pens, pencils, note pads, calendars and other items of nominal value.
(c) Employees found guilty of violating the provisions of this section will be subject to administrative remedies in accordance with existing Federal regulations or policies.
§ 706.19
Resolving prohibited interests.
Actions to be taken by the Director, the heads of other Federal agencies, and the heads of other affected bureaus and offices within the U.S. Department of the Interior include:
(a) Remedial action to effect resolution. If an employee has a prohibited financial interest, the head of the organizational entity (Department, bureau, office, etc.) where the employee works shall promptly advise the employee that remedial action which will resolve the prohibited interest is required within 90 days.
(b) Remedial action may include: (1) Reassignment of the employee to a position which performs no function or duty under the Act, or
(2) Divestiture of the prohibited financial interest, or
(3) Other appropriate action which either eliminates the prohibited financial interest or eliminates the situation which creates the conflict.
(c) Reports of noncompliance. If 90 days after an employee is notified to take remedial action that employee is not in compliance with the requirements of the Act and these regulations, the official, other than the Director, who ordered the remedial action shall
promptly report the facts of the situation to the Director. The reports to the Director shall include the original or a certified true copy of the employee's statement and any other information pertinent to the Director, including a statement of actions being taken at the time the report is made. Within 30 days of receipt of a noncompliance report, the Director shall notify the head of the employing organization and the employee involved of additional action to be taken. Actions which the Director may take include but are not limited to the granting of additional time for resolution or the initiation of action to impose the penalties prescribed by the Act.
§ 706.21
Appeals procedures.
Employees have the right to appeal an order for remedial action under § 706.19 and shall have 30 days to exercise this right before disciplinary action is initiated.
(a) Office employees and other Department of the Interior employees may file their appeal, in writing, in accordance with the provisions in 43 CFR 20.735-25(b).
(b) Employees of other Federal agencies may file their appeal, in writing, in accordance with the established procedures of their employing agency.

# Source:
44 FR 15322, Mar. 13, 1979, unless otherwise noted.
§ 707.1
Scope.
(a) This part establishes the procedures for determining those surface coal mining and reclamation operations which are exempt from the Act and this chapter because the extraction of coal is an incidental part of Federal, State, or local government-financed highway or other construction.
(b) This part exempts the extraction of coal which is incidental to government-financed construction from the requirements of the Act and this Chapter, if that extraction meets specified criteria which ensure that the construction is government-financed and that the extraction of coal is incidental to it.
§ 707.4
Responsibility.
(a) The regulatory authority is responsible for enforcing the requirements of this part.
(b) Any person conducting coal extraction as an incidental part of government-financed construction is responsible for possessing, on the site of the extraction operation, the documentation required by 30 CFR 707.12.
§ 707.5
Definitions.
As used in this part, the following terms have the specified meaning:
Extraction of coal as an incidental part
means the extraction of coal which is necessary to enable the construction to be accomplished. For purposes of this part, only that coal extracted from within the right-of-way, in the case of a road, railroad, utility line or other such construction, or within the boundaries of the area directly affected by other types of government-financed construction, may be considered incidental to that construction. Extraction of coal outside the right-of-way or boundary of the area directly affected by the construction shall be subject to the requirements of the Act and this chapter.
Government financing agency
means a Federal, State, county, municipal, or local unit of government, or a department, bureau, agency or office of the unit which, directly or through another unit of government, finances construction.
Government-financed construction
means construction funded at 50 percent or more by funds appropriated from a government financing agency's budget or obtained from general revenue bonds. Government financing at less than 50 percent may qualify if the
construction is undertaken as an approved reclamation project under Title IV of the Act. Construction funded through government financing agency guarantees, insurance, loans, funds obtained through industrial revenue bonds or their equivalent, or in-kind payments does not qualify as government-financed construction.
[44 FR 15322, Mar. 13, 1979, as amended at 64 FR 7482, Feb. 12, 1999; 68 FR 65625, Nov. 20, 2003]
§ 707.10
Information collection.
Since the information collection requirement contained in 30 CFR 707.12 consists only of expenditures on information collection activities that would be incurred by persons in the normal course of their activities, it is exempt from the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501
et seq.
) and does not require clearance by OMB.
[64 FR 7482, Feb. 12, 1999]
§ 707.11
Applicability.
(a) Coal extraction which is an incidental part of government-financed construction is exempt from the Act and this chapter.

§ 710.1
Scope.
(a) This part provides general introductory and applicability material for the initial regulatory program required by section 502 and other sections of the Act which require early implementation. The initial regulatory program is effective until permanent programs are approved in accordance with sections 503, 504, or 523 of the Act.
(b) The initial regulatory program which this part introduces includes—
(1) Environmental performance standards of parts 715 through 718 of this chapter.
(2) Inspection and enforcement procedures of parts 720 through 723 of this chapter; and
(3) Reimbursements to States of part 725 of this chapter.
§ 710.2
Objectives.
The objectives of the initial regulatory program are to—
(a) Protect the health and safety of the public and minimize the damage to the environment resulting from surface coal mining operations during the interval between enactment of the Act and adoption of a permanent State or Federal regulatory program; and
(b) Coordinate the State and Federal regulatory programs to accomplish the purposes of the Act.
§ 710.3
Authority.
(a) The Secretary is directed to implement an initial regulatory program within six months after the date of enactment of the Act in each State which regulates any aspect of surface coal mining under one or more State laws until a State program has been approved or until a Federal program has been implemented.
(b) The Secretary is also authorized to regulate surface coal mining and reclamation operations on Federal Lands by the Mineral Leasing Act of February 25, 1920, as amended (30 U.S.C. 181-287) and the Minerals, Leasing Act for Acquired Lands (30 U.S.C. 351-359) and on Indian lands by various Indian lands acts.

30 CFR part 211 was redesignated as 43 CFR part 3480 at 48 FR 41589, Sept. 16, 1983.
§ 710.4
Responsibility.
(a) Under the general direction of the Assistant Secretary, Energy and Minerals, the Director is responsible for administering the initial regulatory program established by the Secretary.
(b) The States are responsible for issuing permits and inspection and enforcement on lands on which operations are regulated by a State to insure compliance with the initial performance standards in parts 715 through 718 of this chapter. States are required to file copies of inspection reports with the Office. States are also responsible for assuring that permits are not issued which would be in conflict with the restriction on mining found in section 510 of the Act, particularly in regard to alluvial valley floors and prime farm lands, and section 522(e) of the Act in regard to prohibitions of mining on certain lands.
§ 710.5
Definitions.
As used throughout the initial regulatory program the following terms have the specified meanings unless otherwise indicated:
Acid drainage
means water with a pH of less than 6.0 discharged from active
or abandoned mines and from areas affected by coal mining operations.
Acid-forming materials
means earth materials that contain sulfide mineral or other materials which, if exposed to air, water, or weathering processes, will cause acids that may create acid drainage.
Alluvial valley floors
means unconsolidated stream-laid deposits holding streams where water availability is sufficient for subirrigation or flood irrigation agricultural activities but does not include upland areas which are generally overlain by a thin veneer of colluvial deposits composed chiefly of debris from sheet erosion, deposits by unconcentrated runoff or slope wash, together with talus, other mass movement accumulation and windblown deposits.
Approximate original contour
means that surface configuration achieved by backfilling and grading of the mined area so that the reclaimed area, including any terracing or access roads, closely resembles the general surface configuration of the land prior to mining and blends into and complements the drainage pattern of the surrounding terrain, with all highwalls and spoil piles eliminated; water impoundments may be permitted where the regulatory authority determines that they are in compliance with § 715.17.
Aquifer
means a zone, stratum, or group of strata that can store and transmit water in sufficient quantities for a specific use.
Combustible material
means organic material that is capable of burning either by fire or through a chemical process (oxidation) accompanied by the evolution of heat and a significant temperature rise.
Compaction
means the reduction of pore spaces among the particles of soil or rock, generally done by running heavy equipment over the earth materials.
Disturbed area
means those lands that have been affected by surface coal mining and reclamation operations.
Diversion
means a channel, embankment, or other manmade structure constructed for the purpose of diverting water from one area to another.
Downslope
means the land surface between a valley floor and the projected outcrop of the lowest coalbed being mined along each highwall.
Embankment
means an artificial deposit of material that is raised above the natural surface of the land and used to contain, divert, or store water, support roads or railways, or other similar purposes.
Essential hydrologic functions
means, with respect to alluvial valley floors, the role of the valley floor in collecting, storing, and regulating the natural flow of surface water and ground water, and in providing a place for irrigated and subirrigated farming, by reason of its position in the landscape and the characteristics of its underlying material.
Flood irrigation
means irrigation through natural overflow or the temporary diversion of high flows in which the entire surface of the soil is covered by a sheet of water.
Ground water
means subsurface water that fills available openings in rock or soil materials such that they may be considered water-saturated.
Head-of-hollow fill
means a fill structure consisting of any material, other than coal processing waste and organic material, placed in the uppermost reaches of a hollow where side slopes of the fill measured at the steepest point are greater than 20° or the profile of the hollow from the toe of the fill to the top of the fill is greater than 10°. In fills with less than 250.00 cubic yards of material, associated with contour mining, the top surface of the fill will be at the elevation of the coal seam. In all other head-of-hollow fills, the top surface of the fill, when completed, is at approximately the same elevation as the adjacent ridge line, and no significant area of natural drainage occurs above the fill draining into the fill area.
Highwall
means the face of exposed overburden and coal in an open cut of a surface or for entry to an underground coal mine.
Hydrologic balance
means the relationship between the quality and quantity of inflow to, outflow from, and storage in a hydrologic unit such as a drainage basin, aquifer, soil zone, lake,
or reservoir. It encompasses the quantity and quality relationships between precipitation, runoff, evaporation, and the change in ground and surface water storage.
Hydrologic regime
means the entire state of water movement in a given area. It is a function of the climate, and includes the phenomena by which water first occurs as atmospheric water vapor, passes into a liquid or solid form and falls as precipitation, moves thence along or into the ground surface, and returns to the atmosphere a vapor by means of evaporation and transpiration.
Impoundment
means a closed basin formed naturally or artificially built, which is dammed or excavated for the retention of water, sediment, or waste.
Intermittent or perennial stream
means a stream or part of a stream that flows continuously during all (perennial) or for at least one month (intermittent) of the calendar year as a result of ground-water discharge or surface runoff. The term does not include an ephemeral stream which is one that flows for less than one month of a calendar year and only in direct response to precipitation in the immediate watershed and whose channel bottom is always above the local water table.
Leachate
means a liquid that has percolated through soil, rock, or waste and has extracted dissolved or suspended materials.
Noxious plants
means species that have been included on official State lists of noxious plants for the State in which the operation occurs.
Overburden
means material of any nature, consolidated or unconsolidated, that overlies a coal deposit, excluding topsoil.
Outslope
means the exposed area sloping away from a bench or terrace being constructed as a part of a surface coal mining and reclamation operation.
Productivity
means the vegetative yield produced by a unit area for a unit of time.
Recharge capacity
means the ability of the soils and underlying materials to allow precipitation and runoff to infiltrate and reach the zone of saturation.
Roads
means access and haul roads constructed, used, reconstructed, improved, or maintained for use in surface coal mining and reclamation operations, including use by coal-hauling vehicles leading to transfer, processing, or storage areas. The term includes any such road used and not graded to approximate original contour within 45 days of construction other than temporary roads used for topsoil removal and coal haulage roads within the pit area. Roads maintained with public funds such as all Federal, State, county, or local roads are excluded.
Recurrence interval
means the precipitation event expected to occur, on the average, once in a specified interval. For example, the 10-year 24-hour precipitation event would be that 24-hour precipitation event expected to be exceeded on the average once in 10 years. Magnitude of such events are as defined by the National Weather Service Technical Paper No. 40, “Rainfall Frequency Atlas of the U.S.,” May 1961, and subsequent amendments or equivalent regional or rainfall probability information developed therefrom.
Runoff
means precipitation that flows overland before entering a defined stream channel and becoming streamflow.
Safety factor
means the ratio of the available shear strength to the developed shear stress on a potential surface of sliding determined by accepted engineering practice.
Sediment
means undissolved organic and inorganic material transported or deposited by water.
Sedimentation pond
means any natural or artificial structure or depression used to remove sediment from water and store sediment or other debris.
Slope
means average inclination of a surface, measured from the horizontal. Normally expressed as a unit of vertical distance to a given number of units of horizontal distance (e.g., 1
v
to 5
h
= 20 percent = 11.3 degrees).
Soil horizons
means contrasting layers of soil lying one below the other, parallel or nearly parallel to the land surface. Soil horizons are differentiated on the basis of field characteristics and laboratory data. The three major soil horizons are—
(a)
A horizon.
The uppermost layer in the soil profile often called the surface soil. It is the part of the soil in which
organic matter is most abundant, and where leaching of soluble or suspended particles is the greatest.
(b)
B horizon.
The layer immediately beneath the A horizon and often called the subsoil. This middle layer commonly contains more clay, iron, or aluminum than the A or C horizons.
(c)
C horizon.
The deepest layer of the soil profile. It consists of loose material or weathered rock that is relatively unaffected by biologic activity.
Spoil
means overburden that has been removed during surface mining.
Stabilize
means any method used to control movement of soil, spoil piles, or areas of disturbed earth and includes increasing bearing capacity, increasing shear strength, draining, compacting, or revegetating.
Subirrigation
means irrigation of plants with water delivered to the roots from underneath.
Surface water
means water, either flowing or standing, on the surface of the earth.
Suspended solids
means organic or inorganic materials carried or held in suspension in water that will remain on a 0.45 micron filter.
Toxic-forming materials
means earth materials or wastes which, if acted upon by air, water, weathering, or microbiological processes, are likely to produce chemical or physical conditions in soils or water that are detrimental to biota or uses of water.
Toxic-mine drainage
means water that is discharged from active or abandoned mines and other areas affected by coal mining operations and which contains a substance which through chemical action or physical effects is likely to kill, injure, or impair biota commonly present in the area that might be exposed to it.
Valley fill
means a fill structure consisting of any material other than coal waste and organic material that is placed in a valley where side slopes of the fill measured at the steepest point are greater than 20° or the profile of the hollow from the toe of the fill to the top of the fill is greater than 10°.
Waste
means earth materials, which are combustible, physically unstable, or acid-forming or toxic-forming, wasted or otherwise separated from product coal and are slurried or otherwise transported from coal processing facilities or preparation plants after physical or chemical processing, cleaning, or concentrating of coal.
Water table
means upper surface of a zone of saturation, where the body of ground water is not confined by an overlying impermeable zone.

(9) Proposals to change premining land uses of range, fish and wildlife habitat, forest land, hayland, or pasture to a postmining cropland use, where the cropland would require continuous maintenance such as seeding, plowing, cultivation, fertilization, or other similar practices to be practicable or to comply with applicable Federal, State, and local laws, shall be reviewed by the regulatory authority to assure that—
(i) There is a firm written commitment by the permittee or by the landowner or land manager to provide sufficient crop management after release of applicable performance bonds to assure that the proposed postmining cropland use remains practical and reasonable;
(ii) There is sufficient water available and committed to maintain crop production; and
(iii) Topsoil quality and depth are shown to be sufficient to support the proposed use.
(10) The regulatory authority has provided by public notice not less than 45 days nor more than 60 days for interested citizens and local, State and Federal agencies to review and comment on the proposed land use.
[42 FR 62680, Dec. 13, 1977; 43 FR 2721, Jan. 19, 1978]
§ 715.14
Backfilling and grading.
In order to achieve the approximate original contour, the permittee shall, except as provided in this section, transport, backfill, compact (where advisable to ensure stability or to prevent leaching of toxic materials), and grade all spoil material to eliminate all highwalls, spoil piles, and depressions. Cut-and-fill terraces may be used only in those situations expressly identified in this section. The postmining graded slopes must approximate the premining natural slopes in the area as defined in paragraph (a).
(a)
Slope measurements.
(1) To determine the natural slopes of the area before mining, sufficient slopes to adequately represent the land surface configuration, and as approved by the regulatory authority in accordance with site conditions, must be accurately measured and recorded. Each measurement shall consist of an angle of inclination along the prevailing slope extending 100 linear feet above and below or beyond the coal outcrop or the area to be disturbed; or, where this is impractical, at locations specified by the regulatory authority. Where the area has been previously mined, the measurements shall extend at least 100 feet beyond the limits of mining disturbances as determined by the regulatory authority to be representative of the premining configuration of the land. Slope measurements shall take into account natural variations in slope so as to provide accurate representation of the range of natural slopes and shall reflect geomorphic differences of the area to be disturbed. Slope measurements may be made from topographic maps showing contour lines, having sufficient detail and accuracy consistent with the submitted mining and reclamation plan.
(2) After the disturbed area has been graded, the final graded slopes shall be measured at the beginning and end of lines established on the prevailing slope at locations representative of premining slope conditions and approved by the regulatory authority. These measurements must not be made so as to allow unacceptably steep slopes to be constructed.
(b)
Final graded slopes.
(1) The final graded slopes shall not exceed either the approximate premining slopes as determined according to paragraph (a)(1) and approved by the regulatory authority or any lesser slope specified by the regulatory based on consideration of soil, climate, or other characteristics of the surrounding area. Postmining final graded slopes need not be uniform. The requirements of this paragraph may be modified by the regulatory authority where the mining is reaffecting previously mined lands that have not been restored to the
standards of this section and sufficient spoil is not available to return to the slope determined according to paragraph (a)(1). Where such modifications are approved, the permittee shall, as a minimum, be required to—
(i) Retain all overburden and spoil on the solid portion of existing or new benches; and
(ii) Backfill and grade to the most moderate slope possible to eliminate the highwall which does not exceed the angle of repose or such lesser slopes as is necessary to assure stability.
(2) On approval by the regulatory authority and in order to conserve soil moisture, ensure stability, and control erosion on final graded slopes, cut-and-fill terraces may be allowed if the terraces are compatible with the postmining land use approved under § 715.13, and are appropriate substitutes for construction of lower grades on the reclaimed lands. The terraces shall meet the following requirements:
(i) Where specialized grading, foundation conditions, or roads are required for the approved postmining land use, the final grading may include a terrace of adequate width to ensure the safety, stability, and erosion control necessary to implement the postmining land use plan.
(ii) The vertical distance between terraces shall be as specified by the regulatory authority to prevent excessive erosion and to provide long-term stability.
(iii) The slope of the terrace outslope shall not exceed 1
v:
2
h
(50 percent). Outslopes which exceed 1
v:
2
h
(50 percent) may be approved if they have a minimum static safety factor of more than 1.5 and provide adequate control over erosion and closely resemble the surface configuration of the land prior to mining. In no case may highwalls be left as part of terraces.
(iv) Culverts and underground rock drains shall be used on the terrace only when approved by the regulatory authority.
(3) All operations on steep slopes of 20 degrees or more or on such lesser slopes as the regulatory authority defines as a steep slope shall meet the provisions of § 716.2 of this chapter.
(c)
Mountaintop removal.
The requirements of this paragraph and of § 716.3 shall apply to surface mining operations which remove entire coal seams in the upper part of a mountain, ridge, or hill by removing all of the overburden, and where the requirements for achieving the approximate original contour of this section cannot be met. Final graded top plateau slopes on the mined area shall be less than 1
v:
5
h
so as to create a level plateau or gently rolling configuration and the outslopes of the plateau shall not exceed 1
v:
2
h,
except where engineering data substantiates and the regulatory authority finds that a minimum static safety factor of 1.5 (or higher factors specified by the regulatory authority) will be attained. Although the area need not be restored to approximate original contour, all highwalls, spoil piles, and depressions except as provided in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section shall be eliminated. All mountaintop removal operations shall in addition meet the provisions of § 716.3 of this chapter.
(d)
Small depressions.
The requirement of this section to achieve approximate original contour does not prohibit construction of small depressions if they are approved by the regulatory authority to minimize erosion, conserve soil moisture or promote revegetation. These depressions shall be compatible with the approved postmining land use and shall not be inappropriate substitutes for construction of lower grades on the reclaimed lands. Depressions approved under this section shall have a holding capacity of less than 1 cubic yard of water or, if it is necessary that they be larger, shall not restrict normal access throughout the area or constitute a hazard. Large, permanent impoundments shall be governed by paragraph (e) of this section and by § 715.17.
(e)
Permanent impoundments.
Permanent impoundments may be retained in mined and reclaimed areas provided all highwalls are eliminated by grading to appropriate contour and the provisions for postmining land use (§ 715.13) and protection of the hydrologic balance (§ 715.17) are met. No impoundments shall be constructed on top of areas in which excess materials are deposited pursuant to § 715.15 of this part. Impoundments shall not be used to meet
the requirements of paragraph (j) of this section.
(f)
Definition of thin and thick restored overburden.
The thin overburden provisions of paragraph (g) of this section may apply only where the final thickness is less than 0.8 of the initial thickness. The thick overburden provisions of paragraph (h) of this section may apply only where the final thickness is greater than 1.2 of the initial thickness. Initial thickness is the sum of the overburden thickness and coal thickness. Final thickness is the product of the overburden thickness times the bulking factor to be determined for each mine area. The provisions of paragraphs (g) and (h) apply only when operations cannot be carried out to comply with the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section to achieve the approximate original contour.
(g)
Thin overburden.
In surface coal mining operations carried out continuously in the same limited pit area for more than 1 year from the day coal-removal operations begin and where the volume of all available spoil and suitable waste materials is demonstrated to be insufficient to achieve approximate original contour, surface coal mining operations shall be conducted to meet, at a minimum, the following standards:
(1) Transport, backfill, and grade, using all available spoil and suitable waste materials from the entire mine area, to attain the lowest practicable stable grade, which may not exceed the angle of repose, and to provide adequate drainage and long-term stability of the regraded areas.
(2) Eliminate highwalls by grading or backfilling to stable slopes not exceeding 1
v:
2
h
(50 percent), or such lesser slopes as the regulatory authority may specify to reduce erosion, maintain the hydrologic balance, or allow the approved postmining land use.
(3) Transport, backfill, grade, and revegetate to achieve an ecologically sound land use compatible with the prevailing land use in unmined areas surrounding the permit area.
(4) Transport, backfill, and grade to ensure the impoundments are constructed only where it has been demonstrated to the regulatory authority's satisfaction that all requirements of § 715.17 have been met and that the impoundments have been approved by the regulatory authority as meeting the requirements of this part and all other applicable Federal and State regulations.
(h)
Thick overburden.
In surface coal mining operations where the volume of spoil is demonstrated to be more than sufficient to achieve the approximate original contour surface coal mining operations shall be conducted to meet at a minimum the following standards:
(1) Transport, backfill, and grade all spoil and wastes not required to achieve approximate original contour in the surface mining area to the lowest practicable grade.
(2) Deposit, backfill, and grade excess spoil and wastes only within the permit area and dispose of such materials in conformance with this part.
(3) Transport, backfill, and grade excess spoil and wastes to maintain the hydrologic balance in accordance with this part and to provide long-term stability.
(4) Transport, backfill, grade, and revegetate wastes and excess spoil to achieve an ecologically sound land use compatible with the prevailing land uses in unmined areas surrounding the permit area.
(5) Eliminate all highwalls and depressions except as stated in paragraph (e) of this section by backfilling with spoil and suitable waste materials.
(i)
Regrading or stabilizing rills and gullies.
When rills or gullies deeper than 9 inches form in areas that have been regraded and the topsoil replaced but vegetation has not yet been established the permittee shall fill, grade, or otherwise stabilize the rills and gullies and reseed or replant the areas according to § 715.20. The regulatory authority shall specify that rills or gullies of lesser size be stabilized if the rills or gullies will be disruptive to the approved postmining land use or may result in additional erosion and sedimentation.
(j)
Covering coal and acid-forming, toxic-forming, combustible, and other waste materials; stabilizing backfilled materials; and using waste material for fill
—(1)
Cover.
All exposed coal seams remaining after mining and any acid-forming, toxic-forming, combustible
materials, or any other waste materials identified by the regulatory authority that are exposed, used, or produced during mining shall be covered with a minimum of 4 feet of nontoxic and noncombustible material; or, if necessary, treated to neutralize toxicity in order to prevent water pollution and sustained combustion, and to minimize adverse effects on plant growth and land uses. Where necessary to protect against upward migration of salts, exposure by erosion, to provide an adequate depth for plant growth, or to otherwise meet local conditions, the regulatory authority shall specify thicker amounts of cover using nontoxic material. Acid-forming or toxic-forming material shall not be buried or stored in proximity to a drainage course so as to cause or pose a threat of water pollution or otherwise violate the provisions of § 715.17 of this part.
(2)
Stabilization.
Backfilled materials shall be selectively placed and compacted wherever necessary to prevent leaching of toxic-forming materials into surface or subsurface waters in accordance with § 715.17 and wherever necessary to ensure the stability of the backfilled materials. The method of compacting material and the design specifications shall be approved by the regulatory authority before the toxic materials are covered.
(3)
Use of waste materials as fill.
Before waste materials from a coal preparation or conversion facility or from other activities conducted outside the permit area such as municipal wastes are used for fill material, it must be demonstrated to the regulatory authority by hydrogeological means and chemical and physical analyses that use of these materials will not adversely affect water quality, water flow, and vegetation; will not present hazards to public health and safety; and will not cause instability in the backfilled area.
(k)
Grading along the contour.
All final grading, preparation of overburden before replacement of topsoil, and placement of topsoil, in accordance with § 715.16, shall be done along the contour to minimize subsequent erosion and instability. If such grading, preparation or placement along the contour would be hazardous to equipment operators then grading, preparation or placement in a direction other than generally parallel to the contour may be used. In all cases, grading, preparation, or placement shall be conducted in a manner which minimizes erosion and provides a surface for replacement of topsoil which will minimize slippage.

If such placement provides additional stability and prevents mass movement, fill materials suitable for disposal shall be placed upon or above a natural terrace, bench, or berm.
(6) The spoil shall be hauled or conveyed and placed in horizontal lifts in a controlled manner, concurrently compacted as necessary to ensure mass stability and prevent mass movement, covered, and graded to allow surface and subsurface drainage to be compatible with the natural surroundings and ensure a long-term static safety factor of 1.5.
(7) The final configuration of the fill must be suitable for postmining land uses approved in accordance with § 715.13, except that no depressions or impoundments shall be allowed on the completed fill.
(8) Terraces may be utilized to control erosion and enhance stability if approved by the regulatory authority and consistent with § 715.14(b)(2).
(9) Where the slope in the disposal area exceeds 1
v:
2.8
h
(36 percent), or such lesser slope as may be designated by the regulatory authority based on local conditions, keyway cuts (excavations to stable bedrock) or rock toe buttresses shall be constructed to stabilize the fill. Where the toe of the spoil rests on a downslope, stability analyses shall be performed to determine the size of rock toe buttresses and key way cuts.
(10) The fill shall be inspected for stability by a registered engineer or other qualified professional specialist experienced in the construction of earth and rockfill embankments at least quarterly throughout construction and during the following critical construction periods: (i) Removal of all organic material and topsoil, (ii) placement of underdrainage systems, (iii) installation of surface drainage systems, (iv) placement and compaction of fill materials, and (v) revegetation. The registered engineer or other qualified professional specialist shall provide to the regulatory authority a certified report within 2 weeks after each inspection that the fill has been constructed as specified in the design approved by the regulatory authority. A copy of the report shall be retained at the minesite.
(11) Coal processing wastes shall not be disposed of in head-of-hollow or valley fills, and may only be disposed of in other excess spoil fills, if such waste is—
(i) Demonstrated to be nontoxic and nonacid forming; and
(ii) Demonstrated to be consistent with the design stability of the fill.
(12) If the disposal area contains springs, natural or manmade watercourses, or wet-weather seeps, an underdrain system consisting of durable rock shall be constructed from the wet areas in a manner that prevents infiltration of the water into the spoil material. The underdrain system shall be protected by an adequate filter and shall be designed and constructed using standard geotechnical engineering methods.
(13) The foundation and abutments of the fill shall be stable under all conditions of construction and operation. Sufficient foundation investigation and laboratory testing of foundation materials shall be performed in order to determine the design requirements for stability of the foundation. Analyses of foundation conditions shall include the effect of underground mine workings, if any, upon the stability of the structure.
(14) Excess spoil may be returned to underground mine workings, but only in accordance with a disposal program approved by the regulatory authority and MSHA.
(15) Disposal of excess spoil from an upper actively mined bench to a lower pre-existing bench by means of gravity transport is permitted provided that:
(i) The operator receives the prior written approval of the regulatory authority upon demonstration by the operator that the spoil to be disposed of by gravity transport is not necessary for elimination of the highwall and return of the upper bench to approximate original contour;
(ii) The following conditions and performance standards in addition to the environmental performance standards of this part are met:
(A) The highwall of the lower bench intersects (meets) the upper actively
mined bench with no natural slope between them;
(B) The gravity transport points are determined on a site specific basis by the operator and approved by the regulatory authority to minimize hazards to health and safety and to ensure that damage will be minimized should spoil accidentally move down-slope of the lower bench;
(C) The excess spoil is placed only on solid portions of the lower pre-existing bench;
(D) All excess spoil on the lower solid bench, including that spoil immediately below the gravity transport points, is rehandled and placed in a controlled manner to eliminate as much of the lower highwall as practicable. Rehandling and placing the excess spoil on the lower solid bench shall consist of placing the excess spoil in horizontal lifts in a controlled manner, concurrently compacted as necessary to ensure mass stability and prevent mass movement, and graded to allow surface and subsurface drainage to be compatible with the natural surroundings to ensure a long term static safety factor of 1.3. Spoil on the bench prior to the current mining operation need not be rehandled except to ensure stability of the fill.
(E) A safety berm is constructed on the solid portion of the lower bench prior to gravity transport of the excess spoil. Where there is insufficient material on the lower bench to construct a safety berm, only that amount of spoil necessary for the construction of the berm may be gravity transported to the lower bench prior to construction of the berm. The safety berm must be removed by the operator by final grading operations;
(F) The area of the lower bench used to facilitate the disposal of excess spoil is considered a disturbed area.
(b)
Valley fills.
Valley fills shall meet all of the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section and the additional requirements of this section.

h
(50 percent). The regulatory authority may require a flatter slope.
(c)
Head-of-hollow fills.
Disposal of spoil in the head-of-hollow fill shall meet all standards set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) and the additional requirements of this section.
(1) The fill shall be designed to completely fill the disposal site to the approximate elevation of the ridgeline. A rock-core chimney drain may be utilized instead of the subdrain and surface diversion system required for valley fills. If the crest of the fill is not approximately at the same elevation as the low point of the adjacent ridgeline, the fill must be designed as specified in paragraph (b), with diversion of runoff around the fill. A fill associated with contour mining and placed at or near the coal seam, and which does not exceed 250,000 cubic yards may use the rock-core chimney drain.
(2) The alternative rock-core chimney drain system shall be designed and incorporated into the construction of head-of-hollow fills as follows:
(i) The fill shall have, along the vertical projection of the main buried stream channel or rill a vertical core of durable rock at least 16 feet thick which shall extend from the toe of the fill to the head of the fill, and from the base of the fill to the surface of the fill.

(3 percent). Instead of the requirements of paragraph (a)(7) of this section, a drainage pocket may be maintained at the head of the fill during and after construction, to intercept surface runoff and discharge the runoff through or over the rock drain, if stability of the fill is not impaired. In no case shall this pocket or sump have a potential for impounding more than 10,000 cubic feet of water. Terraces on the fill shall be graded with a 3- to 5-percent grade toward the fill and a 1-percent slope toward the rock core.
(3) The drainage control system shall be capable of passing safely the runoff from a 100-year, 24-hour precipitation event, or larger event specified by the regulatory authority.
(d)
Durable rock fills.
In lieu of the requirements of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section the regulatory authority may approve alternate methods for disposal of hard rock spoil, including fill placement by dumping in a single lift, on a site specific basis, provided the services of a registered professional engineer experienced in the design and construction of earth and rockfill embankments are utilized and provided the requirements of this paragraph and paragraph (a) are met. For this section, hard rock spoil shall be defined as rockfill consisting of at least 80 percent by volume of sandstone, limestone, or other rocks that do not slake in water. Resistance of the hard rock spoil to slaking shall be determined by using the slake index and slake durability tests in accordance with guidelines and criteria established by the regulatory authority.

End of construction
1.5
II
Earthquake
1.1
(3) The design of a head-of-hollow fill shall include an internal drainage system which will ensure continued free drainage of anticipated seepage from precipitation and from springs or wet weather seeps.
(i) Anticipated discharge from springs and seeps and due to precipitation shall be based on records and/or field investigations to determine seasonal variation. The design of the internal drainage system shall be based on the maximum anticipated discharge.
(ii) All granular material used for the drainage system shall be free of clay and consist of durable particles such as natural sands and gravels, sandstone, limestone or other durable rock which will not slake in water.
(iii) The internal drain shall be protected by a properly designed filter system.
(4) Surface water runoff from the areas adjacent to and above the fill shall not be allowed to flow onto the fill and shall be diverted into stabilized channels which are designed to pass safely the runoff from a 100-year, 24-hour precipitation event. Diversion design shall comply with the requirements of § 715.17(c).
(5) The top surface of the completed fill shall be graded such that the final slope after settlement will be no steeper than 1
v:
20
h
(5 percent) toward properly designed drainage channels in natural ground along the periphery of the fill. Surface runoff from the top surface of the fill shall not be allowed to flow over the outslope of the fill.
(6) Surface runoff from the outslope of the fill shall be diverted off the fill to properly designed channels which will pass safely a 100-year, 24-hour precipitation event. Diversion design shall comply with the requirements of § 715.17(c).
(7) Terraces shall be constructed on the outslope if required for control of erosion or for roads included in the approved postmining land use plan. Terraces shall meet the following requirements:

§ 715.16
Topsoil handling.
To prevent topsoil from being contaminated by spoil or waste materials, the permittee shall remove the topsoil as a separate operation from areas to be disturbed. Topsoil shall be immediately redistributed according to the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section on areas graded to the approved postmining configuration. The topsoil shall be segregated, stockpiled, and protected from wind and water erosion and from contaminants which lessen its capability to support vegetation if sufficient graded areas are not immediately available for redistribution.
(a)
Topsoil removal.
All topsoil to be salvaged shall be removed before any drilling for blasting, mining, or other surface disturbance.
(1) All topsoil shall be removed unless use of alternative materials is approved by the regulatory authority in accordance with paragraph (a)(4) of this section. Where the removal of topsoil results in erosion that may cause air or water pollution, the regulatory authority shall limit the size of the area from which topsoil may be removed at any one time and specify methods of treatment to control erosion of exposed overburden.
(2) All of the A horizon of the topsoil as identified by soil surveys shall be removed according to paragraph (a) and then replaced on disturbed areas as the surface soil layers. Where the A horizon is less than 6 inches, a 6-inch layer that includes the A horizon and the unconsolidated material immediately below the A horizon (or all unconsolidated material if the total available is less than 6 inches) shall be removed and the mixture segregated and replaced as the surface soil layer.
(3) Where necessary to obtain soil productivity consistent with postmining land use, the regulatory authority may require that the B horizon or portions of the C horizon or other underlying layers demonstrated to have comparable quality for root development be segregated and replaced as subsoil.
(4) Selected overburden materials may be used instead of, or as a supplement to, topsoil where the resulting soil medium is equal to or more suitable for vegetation, and if all the following requirements are met:
(i) The permittee demonstrates that the selected overburden materials or an overburden-topsoil mixture is more suitable for restoring land capability and productivity by the results of chemical and physical analyses. These analyses shall include determinations of pH, percent organic material, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, texture class, and water-holding capacity, and such other analyses as required by the regulatory authority. The regulatory authority also may require that results of field-site trials or greenhouse tests be used to demonstrate the feasibility of using such overburden materials.
(ii) The chemical and physical analyses and the results of field-site trials and greenhouse tests are accompanied by a certification from a qualified soil scientist or agronomist.
(iii) The alternative material is removed, segregated, and replaced in conformance with this section.
(b)
Topsoil redistribution.
(1) After final grading and before the topsoil is replaced, regraded land shall be scarified or otherwise treated to eliminate slippage surfaces and to promote root penetration.
(2) Topsoil shall be redistributed in a manner that—
(i) Achieves an approximate uniform thickness consistent with the postmining land uses;
(ii) Prevents excess compaction of the spoil and topsoil; and
(iii) Protects the topsoil from wind and water erosion before it is seeded and planted.
(c)
Topsoil storage.
If the permit allows storage of topsoil, the stockpiled topsoil shall be placed on a stable area within the permit area where it will not be disturbed or be exposed to excessive water, wind erosion, or contaminants which lessen its capability to support vegetation before it can be redistributed on terrain graded to final contour. Stockpiles shall be selectively placed and protected from wind and
water erosion, unnecessary compaction, and contamination by undesirable materials either by a vegetative cover as defined in § 715.20(g) or by other methods demonstrated to provide equal protection such as snow fences, chemical binders, and mulching. Unless approved by the regulatory authority, stockpiled topsoil shall not be moved until required for redistribution on a disturbed area.
(d)
Nutrients and soil amendments.
Nutrients and soil amendments in the amounts and analyses as determined by soil tests shall be applied to the surface soil layer so that it will support the postmining requirements of § 715.13 and the revegetation requirements of § 715.20.
§ 715.17
Protection of the hydrologic system.
The permittee shall plan and conduct coal mining and reclamation operations to minimize disturbance to the prevailing hydrologic balance in order to prevent long-term adverse changes in the hydrologic balance that could result from surface coal mining and reclamation operations, both on- and off-site. Changes in water quality and quantity, in the depth to ground water, and in the location of surface water drainage channels shall be minimized such that the postmining land use of the disturbed land is not adversely affected and applicable Federal and State statutes and regulations are not violated. The permittee shall conduct operations so as to minimize water pollution and shall, where necessary, use treatment methods to control water pollution. The permittee shall emphasize surface coal mining and reclamation practices that will prevent or minimize water pollution and changes in flows in preference to the use of water treatment facilities. Practices to control and minimize pollution include, but are not limited to, stabilizing disturbed areas through grading, diverting runoff, achieving quick growing stands of temporary vegetation, lining drainage channels with rock or vegetation, mulching, sealing acid-forming and toxic-forming materials, and selectively placing waste materials in backfill areas. If pollution can be controlled only by treatment, the permittee shall operate and maintain the necessary water-treatment facilities for as long as treatment is required.
(a)
Water quality standards and effluent limitations.
All surface drainage from the disturbed area, including disturbed areas that have been graded, seeded, or planted, shall be passed through a sedimentation pond or a series of sedimentation ponds before leaving the permit area. Sedimentation ponds shall be retained until drainage from the disturbed areas has met the water quality requirements of this section and the revegetation requirements of § 715.20 have been met. The regulatory authority may grant exemptions from this requirement only when the disturbed drainage area within the total disturbed area is small and if the permittee shows that sedimentation ponds are necessary to meet the effluent limitations of this paragraph and to maintain water quality in downstream receiving waters. For purpose of this section only, disturbed area shall not include those areas in which only diversion ditches, sedimentation ponds, or roads are installed in accordance with this section and the upstream area is not otherwise disturbed by the permittee. Sedimentation ponds required by this paragraph shall be constructed in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section in appropriate locations prior to any mining in the affected drainage area in order to control sedimentation or otherwise treat water in accordance with this paragraph. Discharges from areas disturbed by surface coal mining and reclamation operations must meet all applicable Federal and State laws and regulations and, at a minimum, the following numerical effluent limitations:

In Arizona, Colorado, Montana, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah, and Wyoming, total suspended solids limitations will be determined on a case-by-case basis, but they must not be greater than 45 mg/l (maximum allowable) and 30 mg/l (average of daily value for 30 consecutive discharge days) based on a representative sampling.
3
Where the application of neutralization and sedimentation treatment technology results in inability to comply with the manganese limitation set forth, the regulatory authority may allow the pH level in the discharge to exceed to a small extent the upper limit of 9.0 in order that the manganese limitations will be achieved.
4
Within the range 6.0 to 9.0.
(1) Any overflow or other discharge of surface water from the disturbed area within the permit area demonstrated by the permittee to result from a precipitation event larger than a 10-year, 24-hours frequency event will not be subject to the effluent limitations of paragraph (a).
(2) The permittee shall install, operate, and maintain adequate facilities to treat any water discharged from the disturbed area that violates applicable federal or State laws or regulations or the limitations of paragraph (a). If the pH of waters to be discharged from the disturbed area is normally less than 6.0, an automatic line feeder or other neutralization process approved by the regulatory authority shall be installed operated, and maintained. If, the regulatory authority finds (i) that small and infrequent treatment requirements to meet applicable standards do not necessitate use of an automatic neutralization process, and (ii) that the mine normally produces less than 500 tons of coal per day, then the regulatory authority may approve the use of a manual system if the permittee ensures consistent and timely treatment.
(3) The effluent limitations for manganese shall be applicable only to acid drainage.
(b)
Surface-water monitoring.
(1) The permittee shall submit for approval by the regulatory authority a surface-water monitoring program which meets the following requirements:
(i) Provides adequate monitoring of all discharge from the disturbed area.
(ii) Provides adequate data to describe the likely daily and seasonal variation in discharges from the disturbed area in terms of water flow, pH, total iron, total manganese, and total suspended solids and, if requested by the regulatory authority, any other parameter characteristic of the discharge.
(iii) Provides monitoring at appropriate frequencies to measure normal and abnormal variations in concentrations.
(iv) Provides an analytical quality control system including standard methods of analysis such as those specified in 40 CFR 136.
(v) Within sixty (60) days of the end of each sixty (60) day sample collection period, a report of all samples shall be made to the regulatory authority, unless the discharge for which water monitoring reports are required is subject to regulation by a National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit issued in compliance with the Clean Water Act of 1977 (33 U.S.C. 1251-1378), (A) which includes equivalent reporting requirements, and (B) which requires filing of the water monitoring report within 90 days or less of sample collection. For such discharges, the reporting requirements of this paragraph may be satisfied by submitting to the regulatory authority on the same time schedule as required by the NPDES permit or within ninety (90) days following sample collection, whichever is earlier, either (
1
) a copy of the completed reporting form filed to meet the NPDES permit requirements, or (
2
) a letter identifying the State or Federal government official with whom the reporting form was filed to meet the NPDES permit requirements and the date of filing. In all cases in which analytical results of the sample collections indicate a violation of a permit condition or applicable standard has occurred, the operator shall notify the regulatory authority immediately. Where an NPDES permit effluent limitation requirement has been violated, the permittee should forward a copy of the Discharge Monitoring Report, EPA Form 3320-1, concurrently with notification of the violation.
(2) After disturbed areas have been regraded and stabilized in accordance with this part, the permittee shall monitor surface water flow and quality. Data from this monitoring shall be used to demonstrate that the quality and quantity of runoff without treatment will be consistent with the requirement of this section to minimize
disturbance to the prevailing hydrologic balance and with the requirements of this part to attain the approved postmining land use. These data shall provide a basis for approval by the regulatory authority for removal of water quality or flow control systems and for determining when the requirements of this section are met. The regulatory authority shall determine the nature of data, frequency of collection, and reporting requirements.
(3) Equipment, structures, and other measures necessary to accurately measure and sample the quality and quantity of surface water discharges from the disturbed area of the permit area shall be properly installed, maintained, and operated and shall be removed when no longer required.
(c)
Diversion and conveyance of overland flow away from disturbed areas.
In order to minimize erosion and to prevent or remove water from contacting toxic-producing deposits, overland flow from undisturbed areas may, if required or approved by the regulatory authority, be diverted away from disturbed areas by means of temporary or permanent diversion structures. The following requirements shall be met:
(1) Temporary diversion structures shall be constructed to safely pass the peak runoff from a precipitation event with a one year recurrence interval, or a larger event as specified by the regulatory authority. The design criteria must assure adequate protection of the environment and public during the existence of the temporary diversion structure.
(2) Permanent diversion structures are those remaining after mining and reclamation and approved for retention by the regulatory authority and other appropriate State and Federal agencies. To protect fills and property and to avoid danger to public health and safety, permanent diversion structures shall be constructed to safely pass the peak runoff from a precipitation event with a 100-year recurrence interval, or a larger event as specified by the regulatory authority. Permanent diversion structures shall be constructed with gently sloping banks that are stabilized by vegetation. Asphalt, concrete, or other similar linings shall not be used unless specifically required to prevent seepage or to provide stability and are approved by the regulatory authority.
(3) Diversions shall be designed, constructed, and maintained in a manner to prevent additional contributions of suspended solids to streamflow or to runoff outside the permit area to the extent possible, using the best technology currently available. In no event shall such contributions be in excess of requirements set by applicable State or Federal law. Appropriate sediment control measures for these diversions shall include, but not be limited to, maintenances of appropriate gradients, channel lining, revegetation, roughness structures, and detention basins.
(d)
Stream channel diversions.

(i) All blasting shall be conducted only during the daytime hours, defined as sunrise until sunset. Based on public requests or other considerations, including the proximity to residential areas, the regulatory authority may specify more restrictive time periods.
(ii) Blasting may not be conducted at times different from those announced in the blasting schedule except in emergency situations where rain, lightning, other atmospheric conditions, or operator or public safety requires unscheduled detonation.
(iii) Warning and all-clear signals of different character that are audible within a range of one-half mile from the point of the blast shall be given. All persons within the permit area shall be notified of the meaning of the signals through appropriate instructions and signs posted as required by § 715.12.
(iv) Access to the blasting area shall be regulated to protect the public and livestock from the effects of blasting. Access to the blasting area shall be controlled to prevent unauthorized entry at least 10 minutes before each blast and until the permittee's authorized representative has determined that no unusual circumstances such as imminent slides or undetonated charges exist and access to and travel
in or through the area can safely resume.
(v) Areas in which charged holes are awaiting firing shall be guarded, barricaded and posted, or flagged against unauthorized entry.
(vi) Airblast shall be controlled such that it does not exceed 128 decibel linear-peak at any manmade dwelling or structure located within one-half mile of the permit area.
(vii) Except where lesser distances are approved by the regulatory authority (based upon a preblasting survey or other appropriate investigations) blasting shall not be conducted within—
(A) 1,000 feet of any building used as a dwelling, school, church, hospital, or nursing facility;
(B) 500 feet of facilities including, but not limited to, disposal wells, petroleum or gas-storage facilities, municipal water-storage facilities, fluid-transmission pipelines, gas or oil-collection lines, or water and sewage lines; and

§ 715.20
Revegetation.
(a)
General.
(1) The permittee shall establish on all land that has been disturbed, a diverse, effective, and permanent vegetative cover of species native to the area of disturbed land or species that will support the planned postmining uses of the land approved according to § 715.13. For areas designated as prime farmland, the reclamation procedures of § 716.7 shall apply.
(2) Revegetation shall be carried out in a manner that encourages a prompt vegetative cover and recovery of productivity levels compatible with approved land uses. The vegetative cover shall be capable of stabilizing the soil surface with respect to erosion. All disturbed lands, except water areas and surface areas of roads that are approved as a part of the postmining land use, shall be seeded or planted to achieve a vegetative cover of the same seasonal variety native to the area of disturbed land. If both the pre- and postmining land use is intensive agriculture, planting of the crops normally grown will meet the requirement. Vegetative cover will be considered of the same seasonal variety when it consists of a mixture of species of equal or superior utility for the intended land use when compared with the utility of naturally occurring vegetation during each season of the year.
(3) On Federal lands, the surface management agency shall be consulted for approval prior to revegetation regarding what species are selected, and following revegetation, to determine when the area is ready to be used.
(b)
Use of introduced species.
Introduced species may be substituted for native species only if appropriate field trials have demonstrated that the introduced species are of equal or superior utility for the approved postmining land use, or are necessary to achieve a quick, temporary, and stabilizing cover. Such species substitution shall be approved by the regulatory authority. Introduced species shall meet applicable State and Federal seed or introduced species statutes, and shall not include poisonous or potentially toxic species.
(c)
Timing of revegetation.
Seeding and planting of disturbed areas shall be
conducted during the first normal period for favorable planting conditions after final preparation. The normal period for favorable planting shall be that planting time generally accepted locally for the type of plant materials selected to meet specific site conditions and climate. Any disturbed areas, except water areas and surface areas or roads that are approved under § 715.13 as part of the postmining land use, which have been graded shall be seeded with a temporary cover of small grains, grasses, or legumes to control erosion until an adequate permanent cover is established. When rills or gullies, that would preclude the successful establishment of vegetation or the achievement of the postmining land use, form in regraded topsoil and overburden materials as specified in § 715.14, additional regrading or other stabilization practices will be required before seeding and planting.
(d)
Mulching.
Mulch shall be used on all regraded and topsoiled areas to control erosion, to promote germination of seeds, and to increase the moisture retention of the soil. Mulch shall be anchored to the soil surface where appropriate, to insure effective protection of the soil and vegetation. Mulch means vegetation residues or other suitable materials that aid in soil stabilization and soil moisture conservation, thus providing micro-climatic conditions suitable for germination and growth, and do not interfere with the postmining use of the land. Annual grains such as oats, rye and wheat may be used instead of mulch when it is shown to the satisfaction of the regulatory authority that the substituted grains will provide adequate stability and that they will later be replaced by species approved for the postmining use.
(e)
Methods of revegetation.
(1) The permittee shall use technical publications or the results of laboratory and field tests approved by the regulatory authority to determine the varieties, species, seeding rates, and soil amendment practices essential for establishment and self-regeneration of vegetation. The regulatory authority shall approve species selection and planting plans.
(2) Where hayland, pasture, or range is to be the postmining land use, the species of grasses, legumes, browse, trees, or forbes for seeding or planting and their pattern of distribution shall be selected by the permittee to provide a diverse, effective, and permanent vegetative cover with the seasonal variety, succession, distribution, and regenerative capabilities native to the area. Livestock grazing will not be allowed on reclaimed land until the seedlings are established and can sustain managed grazing. The regulatory authority, in consultation with the permittee and the landowner or in concurrence with the governmental landmanaging agency having jurisdiction over the surface, shall determine when the revegetated area is ready for livestock grazing.
(3) Where forest is to be the postmining land use, the permittee shall plant trees adapted for local site conditions and climate. Trees shall be planted in combination with an herbaceous cover of grains, grasses, legumes, forbs, or woody plants to provide a diverse, effective, and permanent vegetation cover with the seasonal variety, succession, and regeneration capabilities native to the area.
(4) Where wildlife habitat is to be included in the postmining land use, the permittee shall consult with appropriate State and Federal wildlife and land management agencies and shall select those species that will fulfill the needs of wildlife, including food, water, cover, and space. Plant groupings and water resources shall be spaced and distributed to fulfill the requirements of wildlife.
(f)
Standards for measuring success of revegetation.
(1) Success of revegetation shall be measured on the basis of reference areas approved by the regulatory authority. Reference areas mean land units of varying size and shape identified and maintained under appropriate management for the purpose of measuring ground cover, productivity and species diversity that are produced naturally. The reference areas must be representative of geology, soils, slope, aspect, and vegetation in the permit area. Management of the reference area shall be comparable to that which will be required for the approved
postmining land use of the area to be mined. The regulatory authority shall approve the estimating techniques that will be used to determine the degree of success in the revegetated area.
(2) The ground cover of living plants on the revegetated area shall be equal to the ground cover of living plants of the approved reference area for a minimum of two growing seasons. The ground cover shall not be considered equal if it is less than 90 percent of the ground cover of the reference area for any significant portion of the mined area. Exceptions may be authorized by the regulatory authority for—
(i) Previously mined areas that were not reclaimed to the standards required by this chapter prior to the effective date of these regulations. The ground cover of living plants for such areas shall not be less than required to control erosion, and in no case less than that existing before redisturbance.
(ii) Areas to be developed immediately for industrial or residential use. The ground cover of living plants shall not be less than required to control erosion. As used in this paragraph,
immediately
means less than 2 years after regrading has been completed for the area to be used; and
(iii) Areas to be used for agricultural cropland purposes. Success in revegetation of cropland shall be determined on the basis of crop production from the mined area compared to the reference area. Crop production from the mined area shall be equal to that of the approved reference area for a minimum of two growing seasons. Production shall not be considered equal if it is less than 90 percent of the production of the reference area for any significant portion of the mined area.
(3) Species diversity, distribution, seasonal variety, and vigor shall be evaluated on the basis of the results which could reasonably be expected using the methods of revegetation approved under paragraph (e) of this section.
(g)
Seeding of stockpiled topsoil.
Topsoil stockpiled in compliance with § 715.16 must be seeded or planted with an effective cover of nonnoxious, quick growing annual and perennial plants during the first normal period for favorable planting conditions or protected by other approved measures as specified in § 715.16.
§ 715.200
Interpretative rules related to general performance standards.
The following interpretations of rules promulgated in part 715 of this chapter have been adopted by the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement.
(a)-(b) [Reserved]
(c)
Interpretation of § 715.16(a)(4)—Topsoil Removal.
(1) Results of physical and chemical analyses of topsoil and selected overburden materials to demonstrate that the selected overburden materials or overburden materials/topsoil mixture is more suitable for restoring land capability and productivity than the available topsoil, provided the analyses, trials, or tests are certified by a qualified soil scientist or agronomist, may be obtained from any one or a combination of the following sources:
(i) U.S. Department of Agriculture Soil Conservation Service published data based on established soil series;
(ii) U.S. Department of Agriculture Soil Conservation Service Technical Guides;
(iii) State agricultural agency, university, Tennessee Valley Authority, Bureau of Land Management or U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service published data based on soil series properties and behavior; or
(iv) Results of physical and chemical analyses, field site trials, or greenhouse tests of the topsoil and overburden materials (soil series) from the permit area.
(2) If the operator demonstrates through soil survey or other data that the topsoil and unconsolidated material are insufficient and substitute materials will be used, only the substitute materials must be analyzed in accordance with 30 CFR 715.16(a)(4)(i).

in this part
from the requirements of part 715.
§ 716.2
Steep-slope mining.
The permittee conducting surface coal mining and reclamation operations on natural slopes that exceed 20 degrees, or on lesser slopes that require measures to protect the area from disturbance, as determined by the regulatory authority after consideration of soils, climate, the method of operation, geology, and other regional characteristics, shall meet the following performance standards. The standards of this section do not apply where mining is done on a flat or gently rolling terrain with an occasional steep slope through which the mining proceeds and leaves a plain or predominantly flat area; or where the mining is governed by § 716.3.
(a) Spoil, waste materials or debris, including that from clearing and grubbing, and abandoned or disabled equipment, shall not be placed or allowed to remain on the downslope.
(b) The highwall shall be completely covered with spoil and the disturbed are a graded to comply with the provisions of § 715.14 of this chapter. Land above the highwall shall not be disturbed unless the regulatory authority finds that the disturbance will facilitate compliance with the requirements of this section.
(c) Material in excess of that required to meet the provisions of § 715.14 of this chapter shall be disposed of in accordance with the requirements of § 715.15 of this chapter.
(d) Woody materials may be buried in the backfilled area only when burial does not cause, or add to, instability of the backfill. Woody materials may be chipped and distributed through the backfill when approved by the regulatory authority.
(e)
Variances from approximate original contour restoration requirements.
(1) This section applies to surface coal mining operations on steep slopes where the operation is not to be reclaimed to achieve the approximate original contour and is not a mountaintop removal operation.
(2) The objective of this subsection is to allow for a variance from the approximate original contour restoration requirements on steep slopes to—
(i) Improve watershed control of the area; and
(ii) Allow the land to be used for an industrial, commercial, residential, or public use, including recreational facilities.
(3) The regulatory authority may grant a variance from the requirement for restoration of the affected lands to their approximate original contour only if it first finds, in writing, on the basis of a showing made by the permittee, that all of the following requirements are met:
(i) The permittee has demonstrated that the purpose of the variance is to
make the lands to be affected within the permit area suitable for an industrial, commercial, residential, or public use postmining land use and that the proposed industrial, commercial, residential, or public use is likely to occur.
(ii) The proposed use, after consultation with the appropriate land-use planning agencies, if any, constitutes an equal or better economic or public use.
(iii) The permittee has demonstrated that compliance with the requirements for acceptable alternative postmining industrial, commercial, residential or public land uses of 30 CFR 715.13 has been achieved except for the requirement at § 715.13(d)(3) and (4) to provide letters of commitment. The permittee must demonstrate to the regulatory authority that necessary public facilities are likely to be provided and that the plan is financially feasible.
(iv) The permittee has demonstrated that the watershed of the area will be improved as compared to the condition of the watershed before mining. The watershed will be deemed improved only if—
(A) There will be a reduction in the amount of total suspended solids or other pollutants discharged to ground or surface waters from the area as compared to such discharges; or, there will be reduced flood hazards or more even flow within the watershed containing the area due to reduction of the peak flow discharges from precipitation events or thaws; or any other criterion authority in the granting of the variance. While improving one or more variables, the permittee must also at least maintain the variables not improved at their premining levels;
(B) The total volume of flows from the proposed affected lands, during every season of the year, will not vary in a way that adversely affects the ecology of any surface water or any existing or planned use of surface or ground water; and
(C) The appropriate State environmental agency approves the plan.
(v) The permittee has demonstrated that the owner of the surface of the lands within the permit area has knowingly requested, in writing, as a part of the application, that a variance be granted. The request shall be made separately from any surface owner consent given for the operation and shall show an understanding that the variance could not be granted without the surface owner's request.
(vi) The proposal is designed and certified by a qualified registered professional engineer in conformance with professional standards established to assure the stability, drainage, and configuration necessary for the intended use of the site.
(vii) All other requirements of the Act and these regulations will be met by the proposed operations.
(4) Every permittee who obtains a variance under this subsection shall:
(i) Backfill completely the highwall with spoil material, in a manner which results in a static factor of safety of at least 1.3 using general geotechnical analysis.
(ii) Improve the watershed control of the area by reducing the peak flow from precipitation or thaw or reducing the total suspended solids or other pollutants in the surface water discharge during precipitation or thaw or by attaining the criteria approved by the regulatory authority in the granting of the variance. While improving one or more variables, the permittee must also at least maintain the variables not improved at their premining levels. The total volume of flow during every season of the year shall not vary in a way that adversely affects the ecology of any surface or ground water.
(iii) Disturb land above the highwall only to the extent that the regulatory authority deems appropriate and approves as necessary to facilitate compliance with the provisions of this section. The regulatory authority may authorize such a disturbance above the highwall if it finds the disturbance is necessary to—
(A) Blend the solid highwall and the backfilled material; or
(B) Control surface runoff; or
(C) Provide access to the area above the highwall.
(iv) Place off the mine bench no more than the amount of spoil necessary to achieve the postmining land use, ensure the stability of spoil retained on the bench, and meet all other requirements of the Act and parts 710 through
725 of this chapter. All spoil not retained on the bench shall be placed in accordance with the Act and these regulations.
(5) The regulatory authority shall review every variance granted pursuant to this subsection not more than three years from the date of issuance of the permit to ensure that the proposed alternative postmining use is proceeding in accordance with the terms of the approved plan, unless the permittee affirmatively so demonstrates.

§ 716.3
Mountaintop removal.
(a) Surface coal mining and reclamation operations that remove entire coal seams running through the upper fraction of a mountain, ridge, or hill by removing all of the overburden and creating a level plateau or gently rolling contour with no highwalls remaining are exempt from the requirements of § 715.14 of this chapter for achieving approximate original contour, if the following requirements are met:
(1) An industrial, commercial, agricultural, residential, or public facility (including recreational facilities) use is proposed for the affected land.
(2) The alternative land use criteria in § 715.13(d) of this chapter are met and the proposal is approved by the regulatory authority.
(3) All other applicable requirements of part 715 of this chapter can be met.
(b) Surface coal mining and reclamation operations conducted under this section shall comply with the following standards:
(1) An outcrop barrier of sufficient width consisting of the toe of the lowest coal seam, and its associated overburden shall be retained to prevent slides and erosion.
(2) The final graded top plateau slopes on the mined area shall be less than 1
v:
5
h
so as to create a level plateau or gently rolling configuration and the outslopes of the plateau shall not exceed 1
v:
2
h,
except where engineering data substantiates and the regulatory authority finds that a minimum static safety factor of 1.5 will be attained.
(3) The resulting level or gently rolling contour shall be graded to drain inward from the outslope except at specific points where it drains over the outslope in protected stable channels.
(4) Damage to natural watercourses below the area to be mined shall be prevented.
(5) Spoil shall be placed on the mountaintop bench as is necessary to achieve the postmining land use approved under § 715.13 of this chapter. All excess spoil material not retained on the mountaintop shall be placed in accordance with the standards of § 715.15 of this chapter.
(c)(1) All permits giving approval for mountaintop removal shall be reviewed not more than 3 years from the date of issuance of the permit, unless the permittee affirmatively demonstrates and the regulatory authority finds that all operations are proceeding in accordance with the terms of the permit and applicable requirements of the Act and the regulations of this part. The terms of the permit shall be in accordance with the requirements of the Act and the regulations of this part.
(2) The terms of a permit for mountaintop removal may be modified by the regulatory authority if it determines that more stringent measures are necessary to prevent or control slides and erosion, prevent damage to natural water courses, avoid water pollution, or to assure successful revegetation.
§ 716.4
Special bituminous coal mines.
(a)
Definition.
Special bituminous coal surface mines as used in this section means those bituminous coal surface mines that are located in the State of Wyoming and that are being mined or will be mined according to the following criteria:
(1) Excavation of the mine pit takes place on a relatively limited site for an extended period of time. For the purposes of this section, mine pit means an open-pit mine in which the surface opening is at least the full size of the excavation and has a contiguous border. The pit generally is quite deep and is formed by the removal of relatively large amounts of overburden to obtain lesser amounts of coal. The term as used in this section applies only to mining operations that extract coal
from seams dipping 15 degrees or more from the horizontal.
(2) Excavation of the mine pit follows a coal seam that inclines 15 degrees or more from the horizontal, and as the excavation proceeds downward it expands laterally to maintain stability of the pitwall or as necessary to accommodate the orderly expansion of the total mining operations.
(3)(i) Surface coal mining operations in the mine pit have taken place since January 1, 1972, and
(A) Operations in the mine pit are removing more than one coal seam, and
(B) Mining has begun on the deepest coal seam scheduled to be mined; or
(ii) Surface coal mining operations which may be developed after August 3, 1977, and are conducted on lands immediately adjacent to operations meeting the criteria of paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section.
(4) The amount of material removed from the pit is large in proportion to the surface area disturbed.
(5) There is no practicable alternative to the deep open-pit method of mining the coal.
(6) There is no practicable way to entirely reclaim the land as required by part 715 of this chapter.
(b)
Requirements for special bituminous coal mines operating prior to July 1, 1973.
Those portions of a special bituminous coal mine approved for operation prior to July 1, 1973, including the orderly expansion of such a mine pit to the extent authorized by State law, shall at a minimum meet the general performance standards of part 715 of this chapter for all operations conducted on the permit area outside the mine pit and for those operations associated with spoil storage areas. The standards of part 715 also apply to the mine pit with the exception of § 715.14, which relates to backfilling and grading. Special requirements for backfilling and grading the mine pit area are as follows:
(1) In the final mine area, highwalls will be allowed to remain and benches will be allowed. Details of the benches shall be included in the mine plans submitted to the regulatory authority for approval.
(2) The exposed pit floors will be sloped and graded to provide access to the area, and topsoil shall be applied and the floor area seeded according to the requirements of §§ 715.16 and 715.20. Where water impoundments are included as part of the mine plan, riprap may be used if necessary to prevent erosion.
(3) Spoil piles will be graded and contoured with no more than overall slope of 17 degrees allowed, and terraces may be used to break the slope when it can be shown that terraces will accomplish the required reclamation. For the postmining land use, steeper slopes may be permitted upon approval of the regulatory authority, provided it can be demonstrated that such method will provide the required results.
(c)
Requirements for other special bituminous coal mines.
Those portions of a special bituminous coal mine which do not meet the criteria of paragraph (b) of this section shall, at minimum meet the general performance standards of part 715 of this chapter for all operations conducted on the permit area outside the mine pit and for these operations associated with spoil storage areas. The standards of part 715 also apply to the mine pit with the exception of § 715.14, which relates to backfilling and grading. Special requirements for backfilling and grading the mine pit area are as follows:
(1)
Slope specifications.
Slope specifications for the postmining land use shall be based on an average of the natural slopes measured in the immediate area of the mine site, and the maximum inclination of the slopes in the reclaimed area shall not be greater than this average slope. However, slopes steeper than the average of the natural slopes may be approved by the regulatory authority if it can be demonstrated that returning the minded area to a slope equal to or less than the average natural slope would greatly increase the amount of disturbed land. Measurements of individual slopes, locations at which measurements are made, and the average natural slope as determined from the individual slope measurements shall be submitted for approval to the regulatory authority. The regulatory authority may make an independent slope survey to verify the average natural slope.
(2)
Postmining land uses that do not include permanent water impoundments.
(i)
The final mine area shall be backfilled, graded, and contoured to the extent necessary to return the land to the use approved by the regulatory authority.
(ii) All backfilling, grading, and contouring shall be done in a manner to preserve the original drainage system or to provide substitute drainage systems approved by the regulatory authority.
(iii) Terraces or benches may be used only if it can be demonstrated that contouring methods will not provide the required results. Detailed plans of dimensions and design of the terraces or benches, check dams, erosion prevention techniques, and slopes of the terraces or benches and their intervals shall be submitted to the regulatory authority for approval before construction.
(iv) Depressions that will accumulate water shall not be allowed unless they are approved under paragraph (3).
(3)
Postmining land uses that include permanent water impoundments.
(i) The exposed mine pit area shall be sloped, graded, and contoured to blend with the topography of the surrounding terrain and to provide for access to the area. Where necessary to prevent erosion, riprap shall be used.
(ii) Under certain conditions where it can be demonstrated by the permittee that the pitwall can be stabilized by terracing or other techniques it may be permissible to leave one-half the proposed shoreline, as measured along the circumference, composed of the stabilized pitwall. The remaining part of the shoreline shall be graded and contoured to blend with the topography of the surrounding terrain and to provide access to the area. Detailed explanations of the techniques to be used to stabilize the pitwalls shall be submitted for approval to the regulatory authority. The regulatory authority may verify the effectiveness of the proposed stabilization techniques from a study made by an independent engineering company and based on this information and an onsite inspection, the regulatory authority will then determine the acceptability of the proposed stabilization techniques.
(d) In the event of an amendment or revision to the State of Wyoming's regulatory program, regulations, or decisions made thereunder governing special bituminous coal mines, the Secretary shall issue such additional regulations as necessary to meet the purposes of the Act.
§ 716.5
Anthracite coal mines.
(a) Permittees of anthracite surface coal mining and reclamation operations in those States where the mines are regulated by State environmental protection standards shall be subject to the environmental protection standards of the State regulatory program in existence on August 3, 1977, instead of part 715 and part 717 of this chapter.
(b) The environmental protection provisions of Title 25, Rules and Regulations, part 1, Department of Environmental Resources, Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, shall apply to reclamation of anthracite surface coal mining and reclamation operations in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania instead of part 715 and part 717 of this chapter. In addition, the regulations of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania pertaining to standards for air and water quality shall apply instead of the regulations of part 715 and part 717 of this chapter.
(c) If a State's regulatory program or regulations for anthracite surface coal mining and reclamation operations in force at the time of this Act are amended, the Secretary, upon receipt of a notice of amendment, shall issue additional regulations as necessary to meet the purposes of this Act.

§ 716.6
Coal mines in Alaska.
(a) Permittees of surface coal mining operations in Alaska from which coal has been mined on or after August 3, 1977, shall conduct operations in a manner that, at a minimum, meets the performance standards of this chapter.
(b) The Secretary, after consultation with the Governor of Alaska, may modify the applicability of any environmental protection standard to any surface coal mining operation if he determines that it is necessary to ensure the continued operation of the mine.
(c) Any person may petition the Secretary to modify the applicability of a performance standard to a coal mine in Alaska. No particular form of petition
is required. However, the petition shall be in writing and shall identify clearly—
(1) The performance standard involved;
(2) The alternative methods to be used to protect the environment and public health and safety;
(3) The reasons why a modification is requested with full descriptions of the impacts continued requirements for compliance with the performance standard to be modified would have on mining and reclamation and of the impacts the proposed method would have on the environment and public health and safety; and
(4) The location of the mine.
(d) If the Secretary determines that the petition presents reasonable justification for modifying the performance standard, he may grant a temporary suspension of enforcement of the performance standard, and he shall publish a notice of intention to modify the applicability of the performance standard in the
Federal Register
and in a newspaper of general circulation in the area of Alaska where the affected coal mine is located. A public hearing shall be held in Alaska and any person may testify for or against the proposed modification. The Secretary, after considering the public comments, and consulting with the Governor of Alaska, shall publish his decision in the
Federal Register
and in the same newspaper in which the original notice was published.
§ 716.7
Prime farmland.
(a)
Applicability.
(1) Permittees of surface coal mining and reclamation operations conducted on prime farmland shall comply with the general performance standards of part 715 of this chapter in addition to the special requirements of this section.
(2) Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, the requirements of the section are applicable to any lands covered by a permit application filed on or after August 3, 1977. This section does not apply to:
(i) Lands on which surface coal mining and reclamation operations are conducted pursuant to any permit issued prior to August 3, 1977; or
(ii) Lands on which surface coal mining and reclamation operations are conducted pursuant to any renewal or revision of a permit issued prior to August 3, 1977; or
(iii) Lands included in any existing surface coal mining operations for which a permit was issued for all or any part thereof prior to August 3, 1977, provided that:
(A) Such lands are part of a single continuous surface coal mining operation begun under a permit issued before August 3, 1977; and
(B) The permittee had a legal right to mine the lands prior to August 3, 1977, through ownership, contract, or lease but not including an option to buy, lease, or contract; and
(C) The lands contain part of a continuous recoverable coal seam that was being mined in a single continuous mining pit (or multiple pits if the lands are proven to be part of a single continuous surface coal mining operation) begun under a permit issued prior to August 3, 1977.
(3) For purposes of this section:
(i) “Renewal” of a permit shall mean a decision by the regulatory authority to extend the time by which the permittee may complete mining within the boundaries of the original permit, and “revision” of the permit shall mean a decision by the regulatory authority to allow changes in the method of mining operations within the original permit area, or the decision of the regulatory authority to allow incidental boundary changes to the original permit;
(ii) A pit shall be deemed to be a single continuous mining pit even if portions of the pit are crossed by a road, pipeline, railroad, or powerline or similar crossing;
(iii) A single continuous surface coal mining operation is presumed to consist only of a single continuous mining pit under a permit issued prior to August 3, 1977, but may include non-contiguous parcels if the operator can prove by clear and convincing evidence that, prior to August 3, 1977, the contiguous parcels were part of a single permitted operation. For the purposes of this paragraph, clear and convincing evidence includes, but is not limited to, contracts, leases, deeds or other
properly executed legal documents (not including options) that specifically treat physically separate parcels as one surface coal mining operation.
(b)
Definitions.
For purposes of this section, the following definitions are applicable.
(1)
Prime farmland
means those lands which are defined by the Secretary of Agriculture in 7 CFR 657 and which have been historically used for cropland.
(2)
Historically used for cropland
means (i) lands that have been used for cropland for any 5 years or more out of the 10 years immediately preceding the acquisition, including purchase, lease, or option, of the land for the purpose of conducting or allowing through resale, lease, or option the conduct of surface coal mining and reclamation operations; (ii) lands that the regulatory authority determines, on the basis of additional cropland history of the surrounding lands and the lands under consideration, that the permit area is clearly cropland but falls outside the specific 5-years-in-10 criterion, or (iii) lands that would likely have been used as cropland for any 5 out of the last 10 years immediately preceding such acquisition but for some fact of ownership or control of the land unrelated to the productivity of the land, in which case the regulations for prime farmland may be applied to include more years of cropland history only to increase the prime farmland acreage to be protected.
(3)
Cropland
means land used for the production of adapted crops for harvest, alone or in a rotation with grasses and legumes, and includes row crops, small grain crops, hay crops, nursery crops, orchard crops, and other similar specialty crops.
(4) The soils either have no water table or have a water table that is maintained at a sufficient depth during the cropping season to allow food, feed, fiber, forage, and oilseed crops common to the area to be grown.
(5) The soils can be managed so that in all horizons within a depth of 40 inches or in the root zone if the root zone is less than 40 inches deep, during part of each year the conductivity of saturation extract is less than 4 mmhos/cm and the exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP) is less than 15.
(6) The soils are not flooded frequently during the growing season (less often than once in 2 years).
(7) The soils have a product of
K
(erodibility factor) × percent slope of less than 2.0 and a product of
I
(soil erodibility) ×
C
(climatic factor) not exceeding 60.
(8) The soils have a permeability rate of at least 0.06 inch per hour in the upper 20 inches and the mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is less than 59 degrees F.; the permeability rate is not a limiting factor if the mean annual soil temperature is 59 degrees F. or higher.
(9) Less than 10 percent of the surface layer (upper 6 inches) in these soils consists of rock fragments coarser than 3 inches.
(c)
Identification of prime farmland.
Prime farmland shall be identified on the basis of soil surveys submitted by the applicant. The regulatory authority also may require data on irrigation, drainage, flood control, and subsurface water management. The requirement for submission of soil surveys may be waived by the regulatory authority, if the applicant can demonstrate according to the procedures in paragraph (d) of this section that no prime farmlands are involved. Soil surveys shall be conducted according to standards of the National Cooperative Soil Survey, which include the procedures set forth in U.S. Department of Agriculture Handbooks 436 (Soil Taxonomy) and 18 (Soil Survey Manual), and shall include—
(1) Data on moisture availability, temperature regime, flooding, water table, erosion characteristics, permeability, or other information that is needed to determine prime farmland in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section;
(2) A map designating the exact location and extent of the prime farmland; and
(3) A description of each soil mapping unit.
(d)
Negative determination of prime farmland.
The land shall not be considered as prime farmland where the applicant can demonstrate one or more of the following situations—
(1) Lands within the proposed permit boundaries have not been historically used for cropland.
(2) The slope of all land within the permit area is 10 percent or greater.
(3) Land within the permit area is not irrigated or naturally subirrigated, has no developed water supply that is dependable and of adequate quality, and the average annual precipitation is 14 inches or less.
(4) Other factors exist, such as a very rocky surface, or the land is frequently flooded, which clearly place all land within the area outside the purview of prime farmland.
(5) A written notification based on scientific findings and soil surveys that land within the proposed mining area does not meet the applicability requirements in paragraph (a) of this section is submitted to the regulatory authority by a qualified person other than the applicant, and is approved by the regulatory authority.
(e)
Plan for restoration of prime farmland.
The applicant shall submit to the regulatory authority a plan for the mining and restoration of any prime farmland within the proposed permit boundaries. This plan shall be used by the regulatory authority in judging the technological capability of the applicant to restore prime farmlands. The plan shall include—
(1) A description of the original undisturbed soil profile, as determined from a soil survey, showing the depth and thickness of each of the soil horizons that collectively constitute the root zone of the locally adapted crops and are to be removed, stored, and replaced;
(2) The proposed method and type of equipment to be used for removal, storage, and replacement of the soil in accordance with paragraph (g) of this section;
(3) The location of areas to be used for the separate stockpiling of the soil and plans for soil stabilization before redistribution;
(4) If applicable, documentation such as agricultural school studies or other scientific data from comparable areas that supports the use of other suitable material, instead of the A, B or C soil horizon to obtain on the restored area equivalent or higher levels of yield as non-mined prime farmlands in the surrounding area under equivalent levels of management; and
(5) Plans for seeding or cropping the final graded mine land and the conservation practices to control erosion and sedimentation during the first 12 months after regrading is completed. Proper adjustments for seasons must be made so that final graded land is not exposed to erosion during seasons when vegetation or conservation practices cannot be established due to weather conditions; and
(6) Available agricultural school studies, company data, or other scientific data for comparable areas that demonstrate that the applicant using his proposed method of reclamation will achieve, within a reasonable time equivalent or higher levels of yield after mining as existed before mining.
(f)
Consultation with Secretary of Agriculture and issuance of permit.
(1) The regulatory authority may grant a permit which shall incorporate the plan submitted under paragraph (e) of this section, if it finds in writing that the applicant—
(i) Has the technological capability to restore the prime farmland within the proposed permit area, within a reasonable time, to equivalent or higher levels of yield as nonmined prime farmland in the surrounding area under equivalent levels of management; and
(ii) Will achieve compliance with the standards of paragraph (g) of this section.
(2) Before any permit is issued for areas that include prime farmlands, the regulatory authority shall consult with the Secretary of Agriculture. The Secretary of Agriculture will provide a review of the proposed method of soil reconstruction and comment on possible revisions that will result in a more complete and adequate restoration. The Secretary of Agriculture has assigned his responsibilities under this paragraph to the Administrator of the U.S. Soil Conservation Service and the U.S. Soil Conservation Service will carry out the consultation and review through their State Conservationist, located in each State.
(g)
Special requirements.
For all prime farmlands to be mined and reclaimed,
the applicant shall meet the following special requirements:
(1) All soil horizons to be used in the reconstruction of the soil shall be removed before drilling, blasting, or mining to prevent contaminating the soil horizons with undesirable materials. Where removal of soil horizons result in erosion that may cause air and water pollution, the regulatory authority shall specify methods of treatment to control erosion of exposed overburden. The permittee shall—
(i) Remove separately the entire A horizon or other suitable soil materials which will create a final soil having an equal or greater productive capacity than that which existed prior to mining in a manner that prevents mixing or contamination with other material before replacement;
(ii) Remove separately the B horizon of the natural soil or a combination of B horizon and underlying C horizon or other suitable soil material that will create a reconstructed root zone of equal or greater productivity capacity than that which existed prior to mining in a manner that prevents mixing or contamination with other material; and
(iii) Remove separately the underlying C horizons or other strata, or a combination of such horizons or other strata, to be used instead of the B horizon that are of equal or greater thickness and that can be shown to be equal or more favorable for plant growth than the B horizon, and that when replaced will create in the reconstructed soil a final root zone of comparable depth and quality to that which existed in the natural soil.
(2) If stockpiling of soil horizons is allowed by the regulatory authority in lieu of immediate replacement, the A horizon and B horizon must be stored separately from each other. The stockpiles must be placed within the permit area and where they will not be disturbed or exposed to excessive erosion by water or wind before the stockpiled horizons can be redistributed on terrain graded to final contour. Stockpiles in place for more than 30 days must meet the requirements of § 715.16(c).
(3) Scarify the final graded land before the soil horizons are replaced.
(4) Replace the material from the B horizon, or other suitable material specified in paragraph (g)(1)(ii) or (g)(1)(iii) of this section in such a manner as to avoid excessive compaction of overburden and to a thickness comparable to the root zone that existed in the soil before mining.
(5) Replace the A horizon or other suitable soil materials, which will create a final soil having an equal or greater productive capacity than existed prior to mining, as the final surface soil layer to the thickness of the original soil as determined in paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this section in a manner that—
(i) Prevents excess compaction of both the surface layer and underlying material and reduction of permeability to less than 0.06 inch per hour in the upper 20 inches of the reconstructed soil profile; and
(ii) Protects the surface layer from wind and water erosion before it is seeded or planted.
(6) Apply nutrients and soil amendments as needed to establish quick vegetative growth.

[59 FR 43420, Aug. 23, 1994]
§ 717.11
General obligations.
(a)
Compliance.
All underground coal mining and associated reclamation operations conducted on lands where any element of the operations is regulated by a State shall comply with the initial performance standards of this part according to the time schedule specified in § 710.11.
(1) For the purposes of this part,
underground coal mining and associated reclamation operations
mean a combination of
surface operations
and
underground operations. Surface operations
include construction, use, and reclamation of new and existing access and haul roads, aboveground repair areas, storage areas, processing areas, shipping areas, and areas upon which are sited support facilities including hoist and ventilating ducts, and on which materials incident to underground mining operations are placed.
Underground operations
include underground construction, operation, and reclamation of shafts, adits, underground support facilities, underground mining, hauling, storage, and blasting.
(2) For the purpose of this part the term
permittee
means the person permitted to conduct underground mining operations by a State or if no permit is issued in the State, the person operating a mine.
(3) For the purpose of this part,
Disturbed areas
means surface work areas and lands affected by surface operations including, but not limited to, roads, mine entry excavations, above ground (surface) work areas, such as tipples, coal processing facilities and other operating facilities, waste work and spoil disposal areas, and mine waste impoundments or embankments.
(4) Where State environmental protection standards are adopted for a specific State because they are more stringent than the standards of this part, they will be published in part 718 of this chapter.
(b)
Authorizations to operate.
A copy of all current permits, licenses, approved plans or other authorizations to operate the mine shall be available for inspection at or near the mine site.
§ 717.12
Signs and markers.
(a)
Specifications.
All signs required to be posted shall be of a standard design that can be seen and read easily and shall be made of durable material, and shall conform to local ordinances and codes. The signs and other markers shall be maintained during all operations to which they pertain.
(b)
Mine and permit identification signs.
Signs identifying the mine area shall be displayed at all points of access to the permit area from public highways. Signs shall show the name, business address, and telephone number of the permittee and identification numbers of current mining and reclamation permits or other authorizations to operate. Such signs shall not be removed until after release of all bonds.
§ 717.13
[Reserved]
§ 717.14
Backfilling and grading of road cuts, mine entry area cuts, and other surface work areas.
(a) Upon completion of underground mining, surface work areas which are involved in excavation, disposal of materials, or otherwise affected, shall be regraded to approximate original contour. The permittee shall transport, backfill and compact fill material to assure stability or to prevent leaching of toxic pollutants. Barren rock or similar materials excess to the mining operations and which are disposed on the land surface shall be subject to the provision of § 717.15 of this part. Roads and support facility areas existing prior to the effective date of this part and used in support of underground mining operations which are subject to this part shall be regraded to the extent deemed feasible by the regulatory authority based on the availability of
backfill material and resulting stability of the affected lands after reclamation. As a minimum, the permittee shall be required to:
(1) Retain all earth, rock and other mineral nonwaste materials on the solid portion of existing or new benches, except that the regulatory authority may permit placement of such material at the site of the faceup as a means of disposing of excavated spoil when additional working space is needed to facilitate operations. Such placement of material shall be limited to minimize disturbance of land and to the hydrologic balance. Such fills shall be stabilized with vegetation and shall achieve a minimum static safety factor of 1.5. In no case shall the outslope exceed the angle of repose.
(2) Backfill and grade to the most moderate slope possible to eliminate any highwall along roads, mine entry faces or other areas. Slopes shall not exceed the angle of repose or such lesser slopes as required by the regulatory authority to maintain stability.
(b) On approval by the regulatory authority and in order to conserve soil moisture, ensure stability, and control erosion on final graded slopes, cut-and-fill terraces may be allowed if the terraces are appropriate substitutes for construction of lower grades on the reclaimed lands. The terraces shall meet the following requirements:
(1) The width of the individual terrace bench shall not exceed 20 feet unless specifically approved by the regulatory authority as necessary for stability erosion control, or roads.
(2) The vertical distance between terraces shall be as specified by the regulatory authority to prevent excessive erosion and to provide long/term stability.
(3) The slope of the terrace outslope shall not exceed 1
v:
2
h
(50 percent). Outslopes which exceed 1
v:
2
h
(50 percent) may be approved if they have a minimum static safety factor of 1.5 of more and provide adequate control over erosion and closely resemble the surface configuration of the land prior to mining. In no case may highwalls be left as part of terraces.
(4) Culverts and underground rock drains shall be used on the terrace only when approved by the regulatory authority.
(c) All surface operations on steep slopes of 20 degrees or more or on such lesser slopes as the regulatory authority define as a
steep slope
shall be conducted so as not to place any material on the downslope below road cuts, mine working or other benches, other than in conformance with paragraph (a)(1) of this part.
(d)
Regrading or stabilizing rills and gullies.
When rills or gullies deeper than 9 inches form in areas that have been regraded and the topsoil replaced but vegetation has not yet been established, the permittee shall fill, grade, or otherwise stabilize the rills and gullies and reseed or replant the areas according to § 717.20. The regulatory authority shall specify that erosional features of lesser size be stabilized if they result in additional erosion and sedimentation.
(e)
Covering coal and acid-forming, toxic-forming, combustible, and other
waste materials; stabilizing backfilled materials; and using waste material for fill. Any acid-forming, toxic-forming, combustible materials, or any other waste materials as identified by the regulatory authority that are exposed, used, or produced during underground mining and which are deposited on the land surface shall, after placement in accordance with § 717.15 of this part, be covered with a minimum of 4 feet of nontoxic and noncombustible material; or, if necessary, treated to neutralize toxicity, in order to prevent water pollution and sustained combustion, and to minimize adverse effects on plant growth and land uses. Where necessary to protect against upward migration of salts, exposure by erosion, to provide an adequate depth for plant growth, or to otherwise meet local conditions, the regulatory authority shall specify thicker amount of cover using nontoxic material. Acid-forming or toxic-forming material shall not be buried or stored in proximity to a drainage course so as to cause or pose a threat of water pollution or otherwise violate the provisions of § 717.17 of this part.
(f)
Grading along the contour.
All final grading, preparation of earth, rock and other nonwaste materials before replacement of topsoil, and placement of
topsoil in accordance with § 717.20, shall be done along the contour to minimize subsequent erosion and instability. If such grading, preparation or placement along the contour would be hazardous to equipment operators, grading, preparation or placement in a direction other than generally parallel to the contour may be used. In all cases, grading, preparation or placement shall be conducted in a manner which minimizes erosion and provides a surface for replacement of topsoil which will minimize slippage.
§ 717.15
Disposal of excess rock and earth materials on surface areas.
Excess rock and earth materials produced from an underground mine and not disposed in underground workings or used in backfilling and grading operations shall be placed in surface disposal areas in accordance with requirements of § 715.15. Where the volume of such material is small and its chemical and physical characteristics do not pose a threat to either public safety or the environment, the regulatory authority may modify the requirements of § 715.15 in accordance with § 717.14(a)(1).
§ 717.16
[Reserved]
§ 717.17
Protection of the hydrologic system.
The permittee shall plan and conduct underground coal mining and reclamation operations to minimize disturbance of the prevailing hydrologic balance in order to prevent long-term adverse changes in the hydrologic balance that could result from underground coal mining operations, both on and off site. changes in water quality and quantity, in the depth to ground water, and in the location of surface water drainage channels shall be minimized and applicable Federal and State statutes and regulations shall not be violated. The permittee shall conduct operations so as to minimize water pollution and shall, where necessary, use treatment methods to control water pollution. The permittee shall emphasize underground coal mining and reclamation practices that will prevent or minimize water pollution and changes in flows in preference to the use of water treatment facilities prior to discharge to surface waters. Practices to control and minimize pollution include, but are not limited to, diverting water from underground workings or preventing water contact with acid- or toxic-forming materials, and minimizing water contact time with waste materials, maintaining mine barriers to enhance postmining inundation and sealing, establishing disturbed areas through grading, diverting runoff, achieving quick growing stands of temporary vegetation, and lining drainage channels. If treatment is required to eliminate pollution of surface or ground waters, the permittee shall operate and maintain the necessary water treatment facilities as set forth in this section.
(a)
Water quality standards and effluent limitations.
(1) All surface drainage from the disturbed area, including disturbed areas that have been graded, seeded or planted and which remain subject to the requirements of this section, except for drainage from disturbed areas that have met the requirements of § 717.20 shall be passed through a sedimentation pond or a series of sedimentation ponds prior to leaving the permit area. All waters which flow or are removed from underground operations or underground waters which are removed from other areas to facilitate mining and which discharge to surface waters must be passed through appropriate treatment facilities prior to discharge where necessary to meet effluent limitations.
(2) For purposes of this section only, disturbed areas shall include areas of surface operations but shall not include those areas in which only diversion ditches, sedimentation ponds, or roads are installed in accordance with this section and the upstream area is not otherwise disturbed by the permittee. Disturbed areas shall not include those surface areas overlying the underground working unless those areas are also disturbed by surface operations such as fill (disposal) areas, support facilities areas, or other major activities which create a risk of pollution.
(3) The regulatory authority may grant exemptions from this requirement only when the disturbed drainage
area within the total disturbed area is small and if the permittee shows that sedimentation ponds are not necessary to meet effluent limitations of this paragraph and to maintain water quality in downstream receiving waters. Sedimentation ponds required by this paragraph shall be constructed in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section in appropriate locations prior to any mining in the affected drainage area in order to control sedimentation or otherwise treat water in accordance with this paragraph. Discharges from areas disturbed by underground operation and by surface operation and reclamation activities conducted thereon, must meet all applicable Federal and State regulations and, at a minimum, the following numerical effluent limitations:

3
Where the application of neutralization and sedimentation treatment technology results in inability to comply with the manganese limitations set forth, the regulatory authority may allow the pH level in the discharge to exceed to a small extent the upper limit of 9.0 in order that the manganese limitations will be achieved.
4
Within the range 6.0 to 9.0.
(i) Any overflow or other discharge of surface water from the disturbed area within the permit area demonstrated by the permittee to result from a precipitation event larger than the 10-year 24-hour frequency event will not be subject to the effluent limitations of paragraph (a).
(ii) The permittee shall install, operate, and maintain adequate facilities to treat any water discharged from the disturbed area that violates applicable Federal or State regulations or the limitations of paragraph (a). If the pH of waters to be discharged from the disturbed area is normally less than 6.0, an automatic lime feeder or other neutralization process approved by the regulatory authority shall be installed, operated, and maintained. If the regulatory authority finds that small and infrequent treatment requirements to meet applicable standards do not necessitate use of an automatic neutralization process, and the mine normally produces less than 500 tons of coal per day, the regulatory authority can approve the use of a manual system if the permittee agrees to insure that consistent and timely treatment is carried out.
(iii) The effluent limitations for manganese shall be applicable only to acid drainage.
(b)
Surface water monitoring.
(1) The permittee shall submit for approval by the regulatory authority a surface water monitoring program which meets the following requirements:
(i) Provides adequate monitoring of all discharge from the disturbed area and from the underground operations.
(ii) Provides adequate data to describe the likely daily and seasonal variation in discharges from the disturbed area in terms of flow, pH, total iron, total manganese, and total suspended solids and, as requested by the regulatory authority, any other parameter characteristic of the discharge.
(iii) Provides monitoring at appropriate frequencies to measure normal and abnormal variations in concentration.
(iv) Provides an analytical quality control system including standard methods of analysis such as those specified in 40 CFR part 136.
(v) Within sixty (60) days of the end of each sixty (60) day sample collection period, a report of all samples shall be made to the regulatory authority, unless the discharge for which water monitoring reports are required is subject to regulation by a National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit issued in compliance with the Clean Water Act of 1977 (33 U.S.C. 1251-1378), (A) which includes equivalent reporting requirements, and (B) which requires filing of the water monitoring reports within 90 days or less of sample collection.
For such discharges, the reporting requirements of this paragraph may be
satisfied by submitting to the regulatory authority on the same time schedule as required by the NPDES permit or within ninety (90) days following sample collection, whichever is earlier, either (
1
) a copy of the completed reporting form filed to meet the NPDES permit requirements, or (
2
) a letter identifying the State or Federal government official with whom the reporting form was filed to meet the NPDES permit requirements and the date of filing. In all cases in which analytical results of the sample collections indicate a violation of a permit condition or applicable standard has occurred, the operator shall notify the regulatory authority immediately. Where an NPDES permit effluent limitation requirement has been violated, the permittee should forward a copy of the Discharge Monitoring Report, EPA Form 3320-1, concurrently with notification of the violation.
(2) Equipment, structures, or other measures necessary to accurately measure and sample the quality and quantity of surface water discharges from the disturbed area of the permit area shall be properly installed, maintained and operated and shall be removed when no longer required.
(c)
Diversion and conveyance of overland flow away from disturbed areas.
In order to minimize erosion and to prevent or remove water from contacting toxic-producing deposits, overland flow from undisturbed areas may, as required or approved by the regulatory authority, be diverted away from disturbed areas by means of temporary or permanent diversion structures. The following requirements shall be met for such diversions:
(1) Temporary diversion structures shall be constructed to safely pass the peak runoff from a precipitation event with a one year recurrence interval, or a larger event as specified by the regulatory authority. The design criteria must assure adequate protection of the environment and public during the existence of the temporary diversion structure.
(2) Permanent diversion structures are those remaining after mining and reclamation and approved for retention by the regulatory authority and other appropriate State and Federal agencies. To protect fills and property, to prevent water from contacting toxic-producing deposits, and to avoid danger to public health and safety, permanent diversion structures shall be constructed to safely pass the peak runoff from a precipitation event with a 100-year recurrence interval or a larger event as specified by the regulatory authority. Permanent diversion structures shall be constructed with gently sloping banks that are stabilized by vegetation. Asphalt, concrete, or other similar linings shall not be used unless specifically required to prevent seepage or to provide stability and they are approved by the regulatory authority.
(3) Diversions shall be designed, constructed, and maintained in a manner so as to prevent additional contributions of suspended solids to streamflow, or to runoff outside the permit area to the extent possible, using the best technology currently available. In no event shall such contributions be in excess of requirements set by applicable State or Federal law. Appropriate sediment control measures for these diversions shall include, but not be limited to, maintenance of appropriate gradients, channel lining, vegetation, and roughness structures and detention basins.
(d)
Stream channel diversions.
In the event that the regulatory authority permits diversion of streams, the regulations of § 715.17(d) shall apply.

All boreholes that are within the permit area but are outside the surface coal mining area or which extend beneath the coal to be mined and into water-bearing strata shall be plugged permanently in a manner approved by the regulatory authority, unless boreholes have been approved for use in monitoring.
(h)
Ground water systems.
(1) Underground operations shall be conducted to minimize adverse effects on ground water flow and quality, and to minimize offsite effects. The permittee will be responsible for performing monitoring according to paragraph (h)(2) of this section to ensure operations conform to this requirement.
(2) Ground water levels, subsurface flow and storage characteristics, and the quality of ground water shall be monitored in a manner approved by the regulatory authority to determine the effects of underground coal mining operations on the quantity and quality of water in ground water systems at the mine area and in associated offsite areas. When operations are conducted in such a manner that may affect the ground water system, ground water levels and ground water quality shall be periodically monitored using wells which can adequately reflect changes in ground water quantity and quality resulting from such operations. Sufficient water wells must be used by the permittee. The regulatory authority may require drilling and development of additional wells if needed to adequately monitor the ground water system. As specified and approved by the regulatory authority, additional hydrologic tests, such as aquifer tests, must be undertaken by the permittee to demonstrate compliance with paragraph (h)(1) of this section.
(i)
Water rights and replacement.
The permittee shall replace the water supply of an owner of interest in real property who obtains all or part of his supply of water for domestic, agricultural, industrial, or other legitimate use from an underground or surface source where such supply has been affected by contamination, diminution, or interruption proximately resulting from surface coal mine operation by the permittee.
(j)
Hydrologic impact of roads
—(1)
General.
Access and haul roads and associated bridges, culverts, ditches, and road rights-of-way shall be constructed, maintained, and reclaimed so as to the extent possible, using the best technology currently available, prevent additional contributions of suspended solids to streamflow, or to runoff outside the permit area to the extent possible, using the best technology currently available. In no event shall the contributions be in excess of requirements set by applicable State or Federal law. All haul and access roads shall be removed and the land affected shall be regraded and revegetated consistent with the requirements of §§ 717.14 and 717.20, unless retention of a road is approved and assured of necessary maintenance to adequately control erosion.
(2)
Construction.
(i) All roads, insofar as possible, shall be located on ridges or on flatter and more stable slopes to minimize erosion. Stream fords are prohibited unless they are specifically approved by the regulatory authority as temporary routes across dry streams that will not adversely affect sedimentation and that will not be used for coal haulage. Other stream crossings shall be made using bridges, culverts, or other structures designed and constructed to meet the requirements of this paragraph. Roads shall not be located in active stream channels nor shall they be constructed or maintained in a manner that increases erosion or causes significant sedimentation or flooding. However, nothing in this paragraph will be construed to prohibit relocation of stream channels in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section.
(ii) In order to minimize erosion and subsequent disturbances of the hydrologic balance, roads shall be constructed in compliance with the following grade restrictions or other grades determined by the regulatory authority to be necessary to control erosion:
(A) The overall sustained grade shall not exceed 1

10
h
(10 percent).
(B) The maximum grade greater than 10 percent shall not exceed 1
v:
6.5
h
(15 percent) for more than 300 feet.
(C) There shall not be more than 300 feet of grade exceeding 10 percent within each 1,000 feet.
(iii) All access and haul roads shall be adequately drained using structures such as, but not limited to, ditches, water barriers, cross drains, and ditch relief drains. For access and haul roads that are to be maintained for more than 1 year, water-control structures shall be designed with a discharge capacity capable of passing the peak runoff from a 10-year, 24-hour precipitation event. Drainage pipes and culverts shall be constructed to avoid plugging or collapse and erosion at inlets and outlets. Drainage ditches shall be provided at the toe of all cut slopes formed by construction of roads. Trash racks and debris basis shall be installed in the drainage ditches wherever debris from the drainage area could impair the functions of drainage and sediment control structures. Ditch relief and cross drains shall be spaced according to grade. Effluent limitations of paragraph (a) of this section shall not apply to drainage from access and haul roads located outside the disturbed area as defined in this section unless otherwise specified by the regulatory authority.
(iv) Access and haul roads shall be surfaced with durable material. Toxic- or acid-forming substances shall not be used. Vegetation may be cleared only for the essential width necessary for road and associated ditch construction and to serve traffic roads.
(3)
Maintenance.
(i) Access and haul roads shall be routinely maintained by means such as, but not limited to, wetting, scraping, or surfacing.
(ii) Ditches, culverts, drains, trash racks, debris basins, and other structures serving to drain access and haul roads shall not be restricted or blocked in any manner that impedes drainage or adversely affects the intended purpose of the structure.
(4) Access roads constructed for and used only to provide infrequent service to surface facilities, such as ventilators or monitoring devices shall be exempt from the requirements of paragraph (j)(2) of this section provided adequate stabilization to control erosion is achieved through use of alternative measures.
(k)
Hydrologic impacts of other transport facilities.
Railroad loops, spurs, conveyors, or other transport facilities shall be constructed, maintained, and reclaimed to prevent additional contributions of suspended solids to streamflow, or to runoff outside the permit area to the extent possible, using the best technology currently available and to control other diminution or degradation of water quality and quantity. In no event shall contributions be in excess of requirements set by applicable State or Federal law.
(l)
Discharge of waters into underground mines.
Surface and ground
waters shall not be discharged or diverted into underground mine workings.

§ 722.11
Imminent dangers and harms.
(a) If an authorized representative of the Secretary finds conditions or practices, or violations of any requirement of the Act, or any requirement of this chapter applicable during the interim regulatory program, which create an imminent danger to the health or safety of the public, the authorized representative shall immediately order a cessation of surface coal mining and reclamation operations or that portion of the operation relevant to the condition, practice, or violation.
(b) If an authorized representative of the Secretary finds conditions or practices, or violations of any requirement of the Act, or any requirement of this chapter applicable during the interim regulatory program, which are causing, or can reasonably be expected to cause, significant, imminent environmental harm to land, air, or water resources, the authorized representative shall immediately order a cessation of surface coal mining and reclamation operations or that portion of the operation relevant to the condition, practice, or violation.
(c) Surface coal mining and reclamation operations conducted by any person without a valid surface coal mining permit required by this subchapter constitute a condition or practice which causes or can reasonably be expected to cause significant, imminent environmental harm to land, air or water resources, unless such operations are an integral, uninterrupted extension of previously permitted operations, and the person conducting such operations has filed a timely and complete application for a permit to conduct such operations.
(d) An authorized representative of the Secretary shall impose affirmative obligations on an operator which the authorized representative deems necessary to abate the condition, practice, or violation if—
(1) A cessation order is issued under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section; and
(2) The cessation of mining or reclamation activities will not completely abate the imminent danger or harm or eliminate the practices or conditions that contributed to the imminent danger or harm.
(e) When imposing affirmative obligations under this section, the authorized representative of the Secretary shall require abatement of the imminent danger or harm in the most expeditious manner physically possible. The affirmative obligation shall include a time by which abatement shall be accomplished and may include, among other things, the use of existing or additional personnel and equipment.
(f) Reclamation operations not directly the subject of the order or affirmative obligation shall continue during any cessation order.
(g) An authorized representative of the Secretary shall terminate a cessation order issued under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section by written notice when the authorized representative determines that the conditions or practices or violations that contributed to the imminent danger to life or the environment have been eliminated.
[42 FR 62701, Dec. 13, 1977, as amended at 45 FR 67501, Oct. 10, 1980; 47 FR 18558, Apr. 29, 1982]
§ 722.12
Non-imminent dangers or harms.
(a) If an authorized representative of the Secretary finds conditions or practices, or violations of any requirement of the Act, or of any requirement of this chapter applicable during the interim regulatory program, but such violations do not create an imminent danger to the health or safety of the public, or are not causing and cannot reasonably be expected to cause significant, imminent environmental harm to land, air, or water resources, the authorized representative shall issue a notice of violation fixing a reasonable time for abatement.
(b) An authorized representative of the Secretary may extend the time to abate a violation by written notice if the failure to abate within the time set was not caused by the permittee's lack of diligence.
(c) An authorized representative of the Secretary may establish interim steps in an abatement period. If the permittee fails to meet any interim step within the time set, the authorized representative may extend the time set for meeting the interim step, in accordance with this section, or may issue a cessation order pursuant to § 722.13 of this part.
(d) The total time for abatement as originally fixed and subsequently extended shall not exceed 90 days except upon a showing by the permittee that it is not feasible to abate the violation within 90 calendar days due to one or more of the circumstances in § 722.12(e). An extended abatement date pursuant to this section shall not be granted when the permittee's failure to abate within 90 days has been caused by a lack of diligence or intentional delay by the permittee in completing the remedial action required.
(e) Circumstances which may qualify a surface coal mining operation for an abatement period of more than 90 days are:
(1) Where the permittee of an ongoing permitted operation has timely applied for and diligently pursued a permit renewal or other necessary approval of designs or plans but such permit or approval has not been or will not be issued within 90 days after a valid permit expires or is required, for reasons not within the control of the permittee;
(2) Where there is a valid judicial order precluding abatement within 90 days as to which the permittee has diligently pursued all rights of appeal and as to which he or she has no other effective legal remedy;
(3) Where the permittee cannot abate within 90 days due to a labor strike;
(4) Where climatic conditions preclude abatement within 90 days, or where, due to climatic conditions, abatement within 90 days clearly:
(i) Would cause more environmental harm than it would prevent; or
(ii) Requires action that would violate safety standards established by statute or regulation under the Mine Safety and Health Act.
(f) Whenever an abatement time in excess of 90 days is permitted, interim abatement measures shall be imposed to the extent necessary to minimize harm to the public or the environment.
(g) If any of the conditions in paragraphs (e) (1) through (4) exist, the permittee may request the authorized representative to grant an abatement period exceeding 90 days. The authorized representative shall not grant such an
abatement period without the concurrence of the Director or his or her designee and the abatement period granted shall not exceed the shortest possible time necessary to abate the violation. The permittee shall have the burden of establishing by clear and convincing proof that he or she is entitled to an extension under the provisions of § 722.12 (d) and (e). In determining whether or not to grant an abatement period exceeding 90 days the authorized representative may consider any relevant written or oral information from the permittee or any other source. The authorized representative shall promptly and fully document in the file his or her reasons for granting or denying the request. The inspector's immediate supervisor shall review this document before concurring in or disapproving the extended abatement date and shall promptly and fully document the reasons for his or her concurrence or disapproval in the file.
(h) Any determination made under paragraph (g) shall be in writing and shall contain a right of appeal to the Office of Hearings and Appeals in accordance with 43 CFR 4.1281 and the regulations at 43 CFR part 4.
(i) No extension granted under paragraph (b) may exceed 90 days in length. Where the condition or circumstance which prevented abatement within 90 days exists at the expiration of any such extension, the permittee may request a further extension in accordance with the procedures of paragraph (g).

§ 722.13
Failure to abate.
An authorized representative of the Secretary shall order cessation of surface coal mining and reclamation operations, or the portion relevant to the violation, when a notice of violation has been issued under § 722.12 of this part and the permittee fails to abate the violation within the time originally fixed or subsequently extended. In a cessation order issued under this section, the authorized representative shall impose affirmative obligations to abate the violation in the manner provided in § 722.11 of this part. Reclamation operations not directly the subject of the order or affirmative obligation shall continue during any cessation order. A cessation order issued under this section shall be terminated as provided in § 722.11 of this part.
§ 722.14
Service of notices of violation, cessation orders, and orders to show cause.
(a) A notice of violation or cessation order shall be served on the person to whom it is directed or his designated agent promptly after issuance, as follows:
(1) By tendering a copy at the surface coal mining and reclamation operation to the designated agent or to the person to whom it is directed. If no such agent is reasonably available, a copy may be tendered to the individual who, based upon reasonable inquiry by the authorized representative, appears to be in charge of the surface coal mining and reclamation operation referred to in the notice or order. If no such individual can be located at the site, a copy may be tendered to any individual at the site who appears to be an employee or agent of the person to whom the notice or order is issued. Service shall be complete upon tender of the notice or order and shall not be deemed incomplete because of refusal to accept.
(2) As an alternative to paragraph (a)(1) of this section, service may be made by sending a copy of the notice or order by certified mail or by hand to the person to whom it is issued or his or her designated agent, or by any alternative means consistent with the rules governing service of a summons and complaint under rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Service shall be complete upon tender of the notice or order or of the certified mail and shall not be deemed incomplete because of refusal to accept.
(b) A show cause order, or a vacation, modification or termination of a notice or order, may be served on the person to whom it is issued in either manner provided in paragraph (a) of this section.
(c) Designation by any person of an agent for service of notices and orders shall be made in a conspicuous, easy-
to-read manner on the mine identification sign, or on the mine bulletin board posted by the minesite office.
(d) The Office shall furnish copies of notices and orders to the State regulatory authority, if any, after their issuance. The Office may furnish copies to any person having an interest in the surface coal mining and reclamation operation or the permit area, such as the owner of the fee, a corporate officer of the permittee, or the bonding company.

[45 FR 2628, Jan. 11, 1980, as amended at 56 FR 28445, June 20, 1991]
§ 722.15
Informal public hearing.
(a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, a notice of violation or cessation order which requires cessation of mining, expressly or by necessary implication, shall expire within 30 days after it is served unless an informal public hearing has been held within that time. The hearing shall be held at or reasonably close to the minesite so that it may be viewed during the hearing or at any other location acceptable to the Office and the person to whom the notice or order was issued. The Office of Surface Mining office nearest to the minesite shall be deemed to be reasonably close to the minesite unless a closer location is requested and agreed to by the Office. Expiration of a notice or order shall not affect the Office's right to assess civil penalties with respect to the period during which the notice or order was in effect. No hearing will be required where the condition, practice or violation in question has been abated, or the hearing has been waived. For purposes of this section only, mining means (1) extracting coal from the earth or from coal waste piles and transporting it within or from the permit area, and (2) the processing, cleaning, concentrating, preparing or loading of coal where such operations occur at a place other than at a minesite.
(b) A notice of violation or cessation order shall not expire as provided in paragraph (a) of this section if the informal public hearing has been waived or if, with the consent of the person to whom the notice or order was issued, the informal public hearing is held later than 30 days after the notice or order was served. For purposes of this section:
(1) The informal public hearing will be deemed waived if the person to whom the notice or order is issued:
(i) Is informed, by written notice served in the manner provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, that he will be deemed to have waived an informal public hearing unless he requests one within 30 days after service of the notice or order, and
(ii) Fails to request an informal public hearing within that time.
(2) The written notice referred to in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section shall be delivered to such person by an authorized representative or sent by certified mail to such person no later than five days after the notice or order is served on such person.
(3) The person to whom the notice or order is issued shall be deemed to have consented to an extension of the time for holding the informal public hearing if his request is received on or after the 21st day after the service of the notice of order. The extension of time shall be equal to the number of days elapsed after the 21st day.
(c) The Office shall give as much advance notice as is practicable of the time, place, and subject matter of the informal public hearing to:
(1) The person to whom the notice or order was issued;
(2) Any person who filed a report which led to the notice or order; and
(3) The State regulatory authority, if any.
(d) The Office shall also post notice of the hearing at the regional district or field office closest to the minesite, and publish it, where practicable, in a newspaper of general circulation in the area of the mine.
(e) Section 554 of Title 5 of the United States Code, regarding requirements for formal adjudicatory hearings, shall not govern the conduct of these informal public hearings. An informal public hearing shall be conducted by a representative of the Office, who may accept oral or written arguments and any other relevant information from any person attending.
(f) Within five business days after the date of the informal public hearing, the Office shall affirm, modify, or vacate the notice or order in writing and send its decision to:
(1) The person to whom the notice or order was issued;
(2) Any person who filed a report which led to the notice or order; and
(3) The State regulatory authority, if any.
(g) The granting or waiver of an informal public hearing shall not affect the right of any person to formal review under sections 518(b), 521(a)(4), or 525 of the Act.
(h) The person conducting the hearing for the Office shall determine whether or not the minesite should be viewed during the hearing. In making this determination the only consideration shall be whether a view of the minesite will assist the person conducting the hearing in reviewing the appropriateness of the enforcement action or the required remedial action.

§ 723.1
Scope.
This part covers the assessment of civil penalties under section 518 of the Act for violations of a permit condition, any provision of Title V of the Act, or any implementing regulations, except for the assessment of individual civil penalties under section 518(f), which is covered by part 724. This part governs when a civil penalty is assessed and how the amount is determined, and sets forth applicable procedures. This part applies to cessation orders and notices of violation issued under part 722 of this chapter during a Federal inspection.
[53 FR 3674, Feb. 8, 1988]
§ 723.2
Objective.
Civil penalties are assessed under section 518 of the Act and this part to deter violations and to ensure maximum compliance with the terms and purpose of the Act on the part of the coal mining industry.
§ 723.11
How assessments are made.
The Office shall review each notice of violation and cessation order in accordance with the assessment procedures described in §§ 723.12, 723.13, 723.14, 723.15, and 723.16 to determine whether a civil penalty will be assessed, the amount of the penalty, and whether each day of a continuing violation will be deemed a separate violation for purposes of the total penalty assessed.
§ 723.12
When penalty will be assessed.
(a) The Office shall assess a penalty for each cessation order.
(b) The Office shall assess a penalty for each notice of violation, if the violation is assigned 31 points or more under the point system described in § 723.13.
(c) The Office may assess a penalty for each notice of violation assigned 30 points or less under the point system described in § 723.13. In determining whether to assess a penalty, the Office shall consider the factors listed in § 723.13(b).
§ 723.13
Point system for penalties.
(a) The Office shall use the point system described in this section to determine the amount of the penalty and, in the case of notices of violation, whether a mandatory penalty should be assessed as provided in § 723.12(b).
(b) Points shall be assigned as follows:
(1)
History of previous violations.
The Office shall assign up to 30 points based on the history of previous violations. One point shall be assigned for each past violation contained in a notice of violations. Five points shall be assigned for each violation (but not a condition or practice) contained in a cessation order. The history of previous violations for the purpose of assigning points, shall be determined and the points assigned with respect to a particular surface coal mining operation. Points shall be assigned as follows:
(i) A violation shall not be counted if the notice or order is the subject of pending administrative or judicial review or if the time to request such review or to appeal any administrative or judicial decision has not expired, and thereafter it shall be counted for only one year.
(ii) No violation for which the notice or order has been vacated shall be counted; and
(iii) Each violation shall be counted without regard to whether it led to a civil penalty assessment.
(2)
Seriousness.
The Office shall assign up to 30 points based on the seriousness of the violation, as follows:
(i)
Probability of occurrence.
The Office shall assign up to 15 points based on the probability of the occurrence of the event which a violated standard is designed to prevent. Points shall be assessed according to the following schedule:
Probability of Occurrence
Points
None
0
Insignificant
1-4
Unlikely
5-9
Likely
10-14
Occurred
15
(ii)
Extent of potential or actual damage.
The Office shall assign up to 15 points, based on the extent of the potential or actual damage, in terms of area and impact on the public or environment, as follows:
(A) If the damage or impact which the violated standard is designed to prevent would remain within the permit area, the Office shall assign zero to seven points, depending on the duration and extent of the damage or impact.
(B) If the damage or impact which the violated standard is designed to prevent would extend outside the permit area, the Office shall assign eight to fifteen points, depending on the duration and extent of the damage or impact.
(iii)
Alternative.
In the case of a violation of an administrative requirement, such as a requirement to keep records, the Office shall, in lieu of paragraphs (i) and (ii), assign up to 15 points for seriousness, based upon the extent to which enforcement is obstructed by the violation.
(3)
Negligence.
(i) The Office shall assign up to 25 points based on the degree of fault of the person to whom the notice or order was issued in causing or failing to correct the violation, condition, or practice which led to the notice or order, either through act or omission. Points shall be assessed as follows:
(A) A violation which occurs through no negligence shall be assigned no penalty points for negligence;
(B) A violation which is caused by negligence shall be assigned 12 points or less, depending on the degree of negligence;
(C) A violation which occurs through a greater degree of fault than negligence shall be assigned 13 to 25 points, depending on the degree of fault.
(ii) In determining the degree of negligence involved in a violation and the number of points to be assigned, the following definitions apply:
(A)
No negligence
means an inadvertent violation which was unavoidable by the exercise of reasonable care.
(B)
Negligence
means the failure of a permittee to prevent the occurrence of any violation of his or her permit or any requirement of the Act or this chapter due to indifference, lack of
diligence, or lack of reasonable care, or the failure to abate any violation of such permit or the Act due to indifference, lack of diligence, or lack of reasonable care.
(C)
A greater degree of fault than negligence
means reckless, knowing, or intentional conduct.
(iii) In calculating points to be assigned for negligence, the acts of all persons working on the surface coal mining and reclamation site shall be attributed to the person to whom the notice or order was issued, unless than person establishes that they were acts of deliberate sabotage.
(4)
Good faith in attempting to achieve compliance.
(i) The Office shall add points based on the degree of good faith of the person to whom the notice or order was issued in attempting to achieve rapid compliance after notification of the violation. Points shall be assigned as follows:
Degree of Good Faith
Points
Rapid compliance
−1 to −10
Normal compliance
0
(ii) The following definitions shall apply under paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section:
(A)
Rapid compliance
means that the person to whom the notice or order was issued took extraordinary measures to abate the violation in the shortest possible time and that abatement was achieved before the time set for abatement.
(B)
Normal compliance
means the person to whom the notice or order was issued abated the violation within the time given for abatement.
(iii) If the consideration of this criterion is impractical because of the length of the abatement period, the assessment may be made without considering this criterion and may be reassessed after the violation has been abated.
§ 723.14
Determination of amount of penalty.
The Office shall determine the amount of any civil penalty by converting the total number of points assigned under 30 CFR 723.13 to a dollar amount, according to the following schedule:

§ 723.15
Assessment of separate violations for each day.
(a) The Office may assess separately a civil penalty for each day from the date of issuance of the notice of violation or cessation order to the date set for abatement of the violation. In determining whether to make such an assessment, the Office shall consider the factors listed in 30 CFR 723.13 and may consider the extent to which the person to whom the notice or order was issued gained any economic benefit as a result of a failure to comply. For any violation which continues for two or more days and which is assigned more than 70 points under 30 CFR 723.13(b), the Office shall assess a civil penalty for a minimum of two separate days.
(b) In addition to the civil penalty provided for in paragraph (a) of this section, whenever a violation contained in a notice of violation or cessation order has not been abated within the abatement period set in the notice or order or as subsequently extended pursuant to section 521(a) of the Act, 30 U.S.C. 1271(a), a civil penalty of not less than $3,148 will be assessed for each day during which such failure to abate continues, except that:
(1)(i) If suspension of the abatement requirements of the notice or order is ordered in a temporary relief proceeding under section 525(c) of the Act, after a determination that the person to whom the notice or order was issued will suffer irreparable loss or damage from the application of the requirements, the period permitted for abatement shall not end until the date on which the Office of Hearing and Appeals issues a final order with respect to the violation in question; and
(ii) If the person to whom the notice or order was issued initiates review proceedings under section 526 of the Act with respect to the violation, in which the obligations to abate are suspended by the court pursuant to section 526(c) of the Act, the daily assessment of a penalty shall not be made for any period before entry of a final order by the court.
(2) Such penalty for the failure to abate a violation shall not be assessed for more than 30 days for such violation. If the permittee has not abated the violation within the 30-day period, the Office shall take appropriate action pursuant to sections 518(e), 518(f), 521(a)(4) or 521(c) of the Act within 30 days to ensure that abatement occurs or to ensure that there will not be a reoccurrence of the failure to abate.

§ 723.16
Waiver of use of formula to determine civil penalty.
(a) The Director, upon his own initiative or upon written request received within 15 days of issuance of a notice of violation or a cessation order, may waive the use of formula contained in 30 CFR 723.13 to set the civil penalty, if he or she determines that, taking into account exceptional factors present in the particular case, the penalty is demonstrably unjust. However, the Director shall not waive the use of the formula or reduce the proposed assessment on the basis of an argument that a reduction in the proposed penalty could be used to abate violations of the Act, this chapter, any applicable program, or any condition of any permit or exploration approval. The basis for every waiver shall be fully explained and documented in the records of the case.
(b) If the Director waives the use of the formula, he or she shall use the criteria set forth in 30 CFR 723.13(b) to determine the appropriate penalty. When the Director has elected to waive the use of the formula, he or she shall give
a written explanation of the basis for the assessment made to the person to whom the notice or order was issued.

The Office shall consider any information so submitted in determining the facts surrounding the violation and the amount of the penalty.
(b) The Office shall serve a copy of the proposed assessment and of the work sheet showing the computation of the proposed assessment on the person to whom the notice or order was issued, by certified mail, or by any alternative means consistent with the rules governing service of a summons and complaint under Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, within 30 days of the issuance of the notice or order. If a copy of the proposed assessment and work sheet or the certified mail is tendered at the address of that person set forth in the sign required under 30 CFR 715.12(b) or at any address at which that person is in fact located, and he or she refuses to accept delivery or to collect such documents, the requirements of this paragraph shall be deemed to have been complied with upon such tender.
(c) Unless a conference has been requested, the Office shall review and reassess any penalty if necessary to consider facts which were not reasonably available on the date of issuance of the proposed assessment because of the length of the abatement period. The Office shall serve a copy of any such reassessment and of the worksheet showing the computation of the reassessment in the manner provided in paragraph (b) of this section, within 30 days after the date the violation is abated.

(a) The Office shall arrange for a conference to review the proposed assessment or reassessment, upon written request of the person to whom the notice or order was issued, if the request is received within 30 days from the date the proposed assessment or reassessment is received.
(b)(1) The Office shall assign a conference officer to hold the assessment conference. The assessment conference shall not be governed by section 554 of title 5 of the United States Code, regarding requirements for formal adjudicatory hearings. The assessment conference shall be held within 60 days from the date the conference request is received or the end of the abatement period, whichever is later.

(i) Settle the issues, in which case a settlement agreement shall be prepared and signed by the conference officer on behalf of the Office and by the person assessed; or
(ii) Affirm, raise, lower, or vacate the penalty.
(4) An increase or reduction of a proposed civil penalty assessment of more than 25 percent and more than $500 shall not be final and binding on the Secretary, until approved by the Director or his designee.
(c) The conference officer shall promptly serve the person assessed with a notice of his or her action in the manner provided in 30 CFR 723.17(b) and shall include a worksheet if the penalty has been raised or lowered. The reasons for the conference officer's action shall be fully documented in the file.
(d)(1) If a settlement agreement is entered into, the person assessed will be deemed to have waived all rights to further review of the violation or penalty in question, except as otherwise expressly provided for in the settlement agreement. The settlement agreement shall contain a clause to this effect.
(2) If full payment of the amount specified in the settlement agreement is not received by the Office within 30 days after the date of signing, the Office may enforce the agreement or rescind it and proceed according to paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section within 30 days from the date of the rescission.

§ 723.19
Request for hearing.
(a) The person charged with the violation may contest the proposed penalty or the fact of the violation by submitting a petition and an amount equal to the proposed penalty or, if a conference has been held, the reassessed or affirmed penalty to the Office of Hearings and Appeals (to be held in escrow as provided in paragraph (b) of this section) within 30 days from receipt of the proposed assessment or reassessment or 30 days from the date of service of the conference officer's action, whichever is later. The fact of the violation may not be contested, if it has been decided in a review proceeding commenced under section 525 of the Act and 43 CFR part 4.
(b) The Office of Hearings and Appeals shall transfer all funds submitted under paragraph (a) of this section to the Office, which shall hold them in escrow pending completion of the administrative and judicial review process, at which time it shall disburse them as provided in 30 CFR 723.20.

(b) If any party requests judicial review of a final order of the Secretary, the proposed penalty shall continue to be held in escrow until completion of the review.

(b) The Office shall not assess an individual civil penalty in situations resulting from a permit violation by a corporate permittee until a cessation order has been issued by the Office to the corporate permittee for the violation, and the cessation order has remained unabated for 30 days.
§ 724.14
Amount of individual civil penalty.
(a) In determining the amount of an individual civil penalty assessed under § 724.12, the Office shall consider the criteria specified in § 518(a) of the Act, including:
(1) The individual's history of authorizing, ordering or carrying out previous violations, failures or refusals at the particular surface coal mining operation;

(3) The demonstrated good faith of the individual charged in attempting to achieve rapid compliance after notice of the violation, failure or refusal.
(b) The penalty will not exceed $20,988 for each violation. Each day of a continuing violation may be deemed a separate violation and the Office may assess a separate individual civil penalty for each day the violation, failure or refusal continues, from the date of service of the underlying notice of violation, cessation order or other order incorporated in a final decision issued by the Secretary, until abatement or compliance is achieved.

(b)
Final order and opportunity for review.
The notice of proposed individual civil penalty assessment shall become a final order of the Secretary 30 days after service upon the individual unless:

§ 724.18
Payment of penalty.
(a)
No abatement or appeal.
If a notice of proposed individual civil penalty assessment becomes a final order in the absence of a petition for review or abatement agreement, the penalty shall be due upon issuance of the final order.
(b)
Appeal.
If an individual named in a notice of proposed individual civil penalty assessment files a petition for review in accordance with 43 CFR 4.1300

Abatement agreement.
Where the Office and the corporate permittee or individual have agreed in writing on a plan for the abatement of or compliance with the unabated order, an individual named in a notice of proposed individual civil penalty assessment may postpone payment until receiving either a final order from the Office stating that the penalty is due on the date of such final order, or written notice that abatement or compliance is satisfactory and the penalty has been withdrawn.
(d)
Delinquent payment.
Following the expiration of 30 days after the issuance of a final order assessing an individual civil penalty, any delinquent penalty shall be subject to interest at the rate established by the U.S. Department of the Treasury for late charges on late payments to the Federal Government. The Treasury current value of funds rate is published by the Fiscal Service in the notices section of the
Federal Register
and on Treasury's Web site. Interest on unpaid penalties will run from the date payment first was due until the date of payment.

Delinquent penalties are subject to late payment penalties specified in § 870.21(c) of this chapter and processing and handling charges specified in § 870.21(d) of this chapter.

§ 730.11
Inconsistent and more stringent State laws and regulations.
(a) No State law or regulation shall be superseded by any provision of the Act or the regulations of this chapter, except to the extent that the State law or regulation is inconsistent with, or precludes implementation of, requirements of the Act or this chapter. The Director shall publish a notice of proposed action in the
Federal Register
setting forth the text or a summary of any State law or regulation initially determined by him to be inconsistent with the Act or this chapter. The notice shall provide 30 days for public comment. Following the close of the public comment period, the Director shall make a final determination which shall be published in the
Federal Register.
(b) Any State law or regulation which provides for more stringent land use and environmental controls and regulations of coal exploration and surface coal mining and reclamation operations than do the provisions of the Act and this chapter, or which provides for the control and regulation of coal exploration and surface coal mining and reclamation operations for which no provision is contained in the Act or this chapter, shall not be construed to be inconsistent with the Act or this chapter.

(a) Not later than January 3, 1981, for each State in which coal exploration and surface coal mining and reclamation operations are or may be conducted on non-Federal and non-Indian land, either a State program or a Federal program adopted under this subchapter shall be in effect. However, the inability of a State to take any action the purpose of which is to prepare, submit or enforce a State program, or any part thereof, because the action is enjoined by the issuance of an injunction by any court of competent jurisdiction
shall not result in the imposition of a Federal program for regulation of surface coal mining and reclamation operations. Regulation of surface coal mining and reclamation operations covered or to be covered by the State program subject to an injunction shall be conducted by the State pursuant to section 502 of the Act until such time as the injunction terminates or for one year from issuance of the injunction, whichever is shorter, at which time the requirements of sections 503 and 504 shall again be fully applicable. States in which no coal exploration or surface coal mining and reclamation operations are in existence or planned on January 3, 1981, on non-Federal and non-Indian lands but in which such exploration or operations may occur at some later date, shall have a State or Federal program in effect before commencement of any such exploration or operations.
(b) The State shall notify the Director of the issuance of any injunction which prevents or prohibits the State from preparing, submitting or enforcing a State program or portion thereof.

(c) Within 30 days of receipt of notification, in writing, of events or proposed changes that may require a State program amendment, or whenever the Director becomes aware of conditions described in paragraph (e) of this section, the Director shall determine whether a State program amendment is required and notify the State regulatory authority of the decision.
(d) The Director shall promptly notify the State regulatory authority of all changes in the Act and the Secretary's regulations which will require an amendment to the State program.
(e) State program amendments may be required when—
(1) As a result of changes in the Act or regulations of this chapter, the approved State program no longer meets the requirements of the Act or this chapter; or
(2) Conditions or events change the implementation, administration or enforcement of the State program; or
(3) Conditions or events indicate that the approved State program no longer meets the requirements of the Act or this chapter.

§ 733.1
Scope.
This part establishes requirements for the maintenance of State programs and procedures for substituting Federal enforcement of State programs and withdrawing approval of State programs.
§ 733.5
Definitions.
As used in this part, the following terms have the specified meanings:
Action plan
means a detailed plan that the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSMRE) prepares to resolve a State regulatory program issue identified during OSMRE's oversight of a State regulatory program and that includes a schedule that contains specific requirements that a State regulatory authority must achieve in a timely manner.
State regulatory program issue
means an issue OSMRE identifies during oversight of a State or Tribal regulatory program that may result from a State regulatory authority's implementation, administration, enforcement, or maintenance of all or any portion of its State regulatory program that is not consistent with the basis for OSMRE's approval of the State program. This may include, but is not limited to, instances when a State regulatory authority has not adopted and implemented program amendments that are required under § 732.17 and subchapter T of this chapter, and issues related to the requirement in section 510(b) of the Act that a State regulatory authority must not approve a permit or revision to a permit, unless the State regulatory authority finds that the application is accurate and complete and that the application is in compliance with all requirements of the Act and the State regulatory program. State regulatory program issues will be considered as possible violations and will initially proceed, and may be resolved, under part 842 of this chapter.
[89 FR 24734, Apr. 9, 2024]
§ 733.10
Information collection.
The information collection requirement contained in § 733.13(a)(2) has been approved by the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3507 and assigned clearance number 1029-0025. The information required is needed by OSMRE to verify the allegations in a citizen request to evaluate a State program and to determine whether an evaluation should be undertaken.
[85 FR 75189, Nov. 24, 2020]
§ 733.11
General requirements for maintaining State programs.
States with an approved State program shall implement, administer, enforce and maintain it in accordance with the Act, this chapter and the provisions of the approved State program.
§ 733.12
Early identification and corrective action to address State regulatory program issues.
(a) When the Director identifies a State regulatory program issue, he or she should take action to make sure the identified State regulatory program issue is corrected as soon as possible to ensure that it does not become an issue that would give the Director reason to believe that the State regulatory authority is not effectively implementing, administering, enforcing, or maintaining all or a portion of its State regulatory program.
(1) The Director may become aware of State regulatory program issues through oversight of State regulatory programs or as a result of information received from any source, including a citizen complainant.
(2) If the Director concludes that the State regulatory authority is not effectively implementing, administering, enforcing, or maintaining all or a portion of its State regulatory program, the Director may initiate procedures to substitute Federal enforcement of a State regulatory program or withdraw approval of a State regulatory program, in accordance with § 733.13.
(b) For each State regulatory program issue, the Director or their designee, in consultation with the State regulatory authority, will develop and approve an action plan within 60 days of identification of a State regulatory program issue. Within 10 business days of OSMRE's determination that a State regulatory program issue exists, OSMRE and the State regulatory authority may identify interim remedial measures that may abate the existing condition or issue. The requirements of an action plan are as follows:
(1) An action plan will be written with specificity to identify the State regulatory program issue and identify an effective mechanism for timely correction. The State regulatory authority must complete all identified actions contained within an action plan within 365 days from when OSMRE sends the action plan to the relevant State regulatory authority.
(2) An action plan will identify any necessary technical assistance or other assistance that the Director or his or her designee can provide and remedial measures that a State regulatory authority must take immediately upon approval of the action plan.
(3) An OSMRE approved action plan must also include:
(i) An action plan identification number;
(ii) A concise title and description of the State regulatory program issue;
(iii) Specific criteria for establishing when complete resolution of the violation will be achieved;
(iv) Specific and orderly sequence of actions the State regulatory authority must take to remedy the problem;
(v) A detailed schedule for completion of each action in the sequence; and
(vi) A clear explanation that if, upon completion of the action plan, the State regulatory program issue is not corrected, the provisions of § 733.13 may be initiated.
(4) Once all items in paragraphs (b)(1) through (3) of this section are satisfactorily addressed, OSMRE will approve the action plan. If the State regulatory authority does not cooperate with OSMRE in developing the action plan, OSMRE will develop the action plan within the guidelines listed in paragraphs (b)(1) through (3) of this section and require the State regulatory authority to comply with the action plan.
(c) All identified State regulatory program issues, and any associated action plans, must be tracked and reported in the applicable State regulatory authority's Annual Evaluation Report. Each State regulatory authority Annual Evaluation Report will be accessible through OSMRE's website and at the relevant OSMRE office. Within each report, benchmarks identifying progress related to resolution of the State regulatory program issue must be documented.
(d) Nothing in this section prevents a State regulatory authority from taking direct enforcement action in accordance with its State regulatory program or OSMRE from taking additional appropriate oversight enforcement action.
[89 FR 24734, Apr. 9, 2024]
§ 733.13
Procedures for substituting Federal enforcement of State programs or withdrawing approval of State programs.
(a)
Evaluation.
(1) The Director shall evaluate the administration of each state program at least annually.
(2) Any interested person may request the Director to evaluate a State program. The request shall set forth a concise statement of the facts which the person believes establishes the need for evaluation. The Director shall verify the allegations and determine within 60 days whether or not the evaluation shall be made and mail a written decision to the requestor.
(b) If the Director has reason to believe that a State is not effectively implementing, administering, maintaining or enforcing any part of its approved State program, the Director shall promptly notify the State regulatory authority in writing. The Director's notice shall—
(1) Provide sufficient information to allow the State regulatory authority to determine what portions of the program the Director believes are not being effectively implemented, administered, maintained, or enforced;
(2) State the reasons for such belief; and
(3) Specify the time period for the State regulatory authority to accomplish any necessary remedial actions.
(c) The Director shall provide the State regulatory authority an opportunity for an informal conference if the State requests an informal conference within 15 days after the expiration of the time period specified in paragraph (b)(3) of this section. The informal conference may pertain to the facts or the time period for accomplishing remedial actions as specified by the Director's notification.
(d) If an informal conference is not held under paragraph (c) of this section, or if, following such a conference, the Director still has reason to believe that the State is failing to adequately implement, administer, maintain or enforce a part or all of a State program, the Director shall give notice to the State and to the public, specifying the basis for that belief and shall hold a public hearing in the State within 30 days of the expiration of the time period specified in paragraph (b)(3) of this section or as modified at the informal conference held under paragraph (c) of this section.
(e) The State will continue to enforce its approved program unless upon completion of the hearing under paragraph (d) of this section and based upon the review of all available information, including the hearing transcript, written presentations and written comments, the Director finds that the State has failed to implement, administer, maintain or enforce effectively all or part of its approved State program. If the Director finds further that the State has not demonstrated its capability and intent to administer the State program, the Director shall either—
(1) Substitute for the State regulatory authority direct Federal enforcement of all or part of the State program in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section; or
(2) Recommend to the Secretary that he or she withdraw approval of the State program, in whole or in part, in accordance with paragraph (g) of this section. The recommendation shall be accompanied by all relevant information and shall include the reasons for the recommendation.
(f)
Substituted Federal enforcement.
(1) The Director shall give public notice of a finding under paragraph (e) of this section and specify the extent to which the Director is instituting direct Federal enforcement of a State program.
(2) During the period beginning with the public notice and ending when the State satisfies the Director that it will enforce the State program effectively, the Director shall enforce those portions of the State program and any additional regulations that the Office has adopted as necessary to enable the Director to perform his or her duties. To the extent the Director has assumed direct Federal enforcement of the State program, the Director ­shall—
(i) Enforce any permit condition required under the Act;
(ii) Issue any new or revised permit pursuant to any additional regulation that the Director may promulgate at the time of assumed enforcement; and
(iii) Conduct inspections and issue notices, orders and assessments of penalties as may be necessary for compliance with those permit conditions, the Act and the State program in accordance with subchapter L.
(3) In the case of a State permittee who has met his or her obligations under an existing State permit and who did not willfully secure the issuance of that permit through fraud or collusion, the Director shall give the permittee a reasonable time to conform ongoing surface mining and reclamation operations to the requirements of the Act, before suspending or revoking the State permit.
(g)
Withdrawing approval of State program.
(1) Upon recommending withdrawal of approval of a State program
to the Secretary, the Director shall institute direct Federal enforcement in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (f) of this section.
(2) Upon receipt of the Director's recommendation and accompanying information under paragraph (e)(2) of this section the Secretary shall either—
(i) Withdraw approval of the State program in whole or in part if the Secretary finds that failure by the State to administer or enforce part or all of its State program cannot effectively be remedied by substitution of direct Federal enforcement for all or part of the State program, or
(ii) Instruct the Director to continue direct Federal enforcement in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section.
(3) The Secretary shall give public notice of a finding under paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this section, and specify the extent to which approval of a State program is being withdrawn. Not later than the issuance of the notice, the Director shall propose promulgation of, and thereafter promulgate and implement a Federal program for the affected State, in accordance with 30 CFR part 736.

§ 733.14
Factors to be considered in deciding whether to substitute Federal enforcement for State programs or to withdraw approval of State programs.
The record of the State in fulfilling the conditions of the original approval or adjusting to new circumstances, in accordance with requirements of the Act and this chapter, the hearings transcripts, written presentations and comments shall be considered in evaluating the maintenance, administration, or enforcement of a State program for purposes of determining whether to substitute direct Federal enforcement of the State program or to withdraw approval of part or all of the program.

§ 761.1
Scope.
This part establishes the procedures and standards to be followed in determining whether a proposed surface coal mining and reclamation operation can be authorized in light of the prohibitions and limitations in section 522(e) of the Act for those types of operations on certain Federal, public and private lands.
§ 761.3
Authority.
The State regulatory authority or the Secretary is authorized by section 522(e) of the Act (30 U.S.C. 1272(e)) to prohibit or limit surface coal mining operations on or near certain private, Federal, and other public lands, subject to valid existing rights and except for those operations which existed on August 3, 1977.
§ 761.5
Definitions.
For the purposes of this part—
Cemetery
means any area of land where human bodies are interred.
Community or institutional building
means any structure, other than a public building or an occupied dwelling, which is used primarily for meetings, gatherings or functions of local civic organizations or other community groups; functions as an educational, cultural, historic, religious, scientific, correctional, mental-health or physical health care facility; or is used for public services, including, but not limited to, water supply, power generation or sewage treatment.
Occupied dwelling
means any building that is currently being used on a regular or temporary basis for human habitation.
Public building
means any structure that is owned or leased, and principally used by a governmental agency for public business or meetings.
Public park
means an area or portion of an area dedicated or designated by any Federal, State, or local agency primarily for public recreational use, whether or not such use is limited to certain times or days, including any land leased, reserved, or held open to the public because of that use.
Public road
means a road (a) which has been designated as a public road pursuant to the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is located; (b) which is maintained with public funds in a manner similar to other public roads of the same classification within the jurisdiction; (c) for which there is substantial (more than incidental) public use; and (d) which meets road construction standards for other public roads of the same classification in the local jurisdiction.
Publicly-owned park
means a public park that is owned by a Federal, State or local governmental entity.
Significant forest cover
means an existing plant community consisting predominantly of trees and other woody vegetation. The Secretary of Agriculture shall decide on a case-by-case basis whether the forest cover is significant within those national forests west of the 100th meridian.
Significant recreational, timber, economic, or other values incompatible with surface coal mining operations
means those values to be evaluated for their significance which could be damaged by, and are not capable of existing together with, surface coal mining operations because of the undesirable effects mining would have on those values, either on the area included in the permit application or on other affected areas. Those values to be evaluated for their importance include:
(a) Recreation, including hiking, boating, camping, skiing or other related outdoor activities;
(b) Timber manager and silviculture;
(c) Agriculture, aquaculture or production of other natural, processed or manufactured products which enter commerce;
(d) Scenic, historic, archeologic, esthetic, fish, wildlife, plants or cultural interests.
Surface operations and impacts incident to an underground coal mine
means all activities involved in or related to underground coal mining which are either conducted on the surface of the land, produce changes in the land surface or disturb the surface, air or water resources of the area, including all activities listed in section 701(28) of the Act and the definition of surface coal mining operations appearing in § 700.5 of this chapter.
Valid existing rights
means a set of circumstances under which a person may, subject to regulatory authority approval, conduct surface coal mining operations on lands where 30 U.S.C. 1272(e) and § 761.11 would otherwise prohibit such operations. Possession of valid existing rights only confers an exception from the prohibitions of § 761.11 and 30 U.S.C. 1272(e). A person seeking to exercise valid existing rights must comply with all other pertinent requirements of the Act and the applicable regulatory program.
(a)
Property rights demonstration.
Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this definition, a person claiming valid existing rights must demonstrate that a legally binding conveyance, lease, deed, contract, or other document vests that person, or a predecessor in interest, with the right to conduct the type of surface coal mining operations intended. This right must exist at the time that the land came under the protection of § 761.11 or 30 U.S.C. 1272(e). Applicable State statutory or case law will govern interpretation of documents relied upon to establish property rights, unless Federal law provides otherwise. If no applicable State law exists, custom and generally accepted usage at the time and place that the documents came into existence will govern their interpretation.
(b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this definition, a person claiming valid existing rights also must demonstrate compliance with one of the following standards:
(1)
Good faith/all permits standard.
All permits and other authorizations required to conduct surface coal mining operations had been obtained, or a good faith effort to obtain all necessary permits and authorizations had been made, before the land came under the protection of § 761.11 or 30 U.S.C. 1272(e). At a minimum, an application must have been submitted for any permit required under subchapter G of this chapter or its State program counterpart.
(2)
Needed for and adjacent standard.
The land is needed for and immediately adjacent to a surface coal mining operation for which all permits and other authorizations required to conduct surface coal mining operations had been obtained, or a good faith attempt to obtain all permits and authorizations had been made, before the land came under the protection of § 761.11 or 30 U.S.C. 1272(e). To meet this standard, a person must demonstrate that prohibiting expansion of the operation onto that land would unfairly impact the viability of the operation as originally planned before the land came under the protection of § 761.11 or 30 U.S.C. 1272(e). Except for operations in existence before August 3, 1977, or for which a good faith effort to obtain all necessary permits had been made before August 3, 1977, this standard does not apply to lands already under the protection of § 761.11 or 30 U.S.C. 1272(e) when the regulatory authority approved the permit for the original operation or when the good faith effort to obtain all necessary permits for the
original operation was made. In evaluating whether a person meets this standard, the agency making the determination may consider factors such as:
(i) The extent to which coal supply contracts or other legal and business commitments that predate the time that the land came under the protection of § 761.11 or 30 U.S.C. 1272(e) depend upon use of that land for surface coal mining operations.
(ii) The extent to which plans used to obtain financing for the operation before the land came under the protection of § 761.11 or 30 U.S.C. 1272(e) rely upon use of that land for surface coal mining operations.
(iii) The extent to which investments in the operation before the land came under the protection of § 761.11 or 30 U.S.C. 1272(e) rely upon use of that land for surface coal mining operations.
(iv) Whether the land lies within the area identified on the life-of-mine map submitted under § 779.24(c) or § 783.24(c) of this chapter before the land came under the protection of § 761.11.
(c)
Roads.
A person who claims valid existing rights to use or construct a road across the surface of lands protected by § 761.11 or 30 U.S.C. 1272(e) must demonstrate that one or more of the following circumstances exist if the road is included within the definition of “surface coal mining operations” in § 700.5 of this chapter:
(1) The road existed when the land upon which it is located came under the protection of § 761.11 or 30 U.S.C. 1272(e), and the person has a legal right to use the road for surface coal mining operations.
(2) A properly recorded right of way or easement for a road in that location existed when the land came under the protection of § 761.11 or 30 U.S.C. 1272(e), and, under the document creating the right of way or easement, and under subsequent conveyances, the person has a legal right to use or construct a road across the right of way or easement for surface coal mining operations.
(3) A valid permit for use or construction of a road in that location for surface coal mining operations existed when the land came under the protection of § 761.11 or 30 U.S.C. 1272(e).
(4) Valid existing rights exist under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this definition.

§ 761.11
Areas where surface coal mining operations are prohibited or limited.
You may not conduct surface coal mining operations on the following lands unless you either have valid existing rights, as determined under § 761.16, or qualify for the exception for existing operations under § 761.12:
(a) Any lands within the boundaries of:
(1) The National Park System;
(2) The National Wildlife Refuge System;
(3) The National System of Trails;
(4) The National Wilderness Preservation System;
(5) The Wild and Scenic Rivers System, including study rivers designated under section 5(a) of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, 16 U.S.C. 1276(a), or study rivers or study river corridors established in any guidelines issued under that Act; or
(6) National Recreation Areas designated by Act of Congress.

et seq.
This provision does not apply to the Custer National Forest.
(c) Any lands where the operation would adversely affect any publicly owned park or any place in the National Register of Historic Places. This prohibition does not apply if, as provided in § 761.17(d), the regulatory authority and the Federal, State, or local agency with jurisdiction over the park or place jointly approve the operation.
(d) Within 100 feet, measured horizontally, of the outside right-of-way line of any public road. This prohibition does not apply:
(1) Where a mine access or haul road joins a public road, or
(2) When, as provided in § 761.14, the regulatory authority (or the appropriate public road authority designated by the regulatory authority) allows the public road to be relocated or closed, or the area within the protected zone to be affected by the surface coal mining operation, after:
(i) Providing public notice and opportunity for a public hearing; and
(ii) Finding in writing that the interests of the affected public and landowners will be protected.
(e) Within 300 feet, measured horizontally, of any occupied dwelling. This prohibition does not apply when:

(2) The part of the operation to be located closer than 300 feet to the dwelling is an access or haul road that connects with an existing public road on the side of the public road opposite the dwelling.
(f) Within 300 feet, measured horizontally, of any public building, school, church, community or institutional building, or public park.
(g) Within 100 feet, measured horizontally, of a cemetery. This prohibition does not apply if the cemetery is relocated in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations.
[64 FR 70832, Dec. 17, 1999]
§ 761.12
Exception for existing operations.
The prohibitions and limitations of § 761.11 do not apply to:
(a) Surface coal mining operations for which a valid permit, issued under
Subchapter G of this chapter or an approved State regulatory program, exists when the land comes under the protection of § 761.11. This exception applies only to lands within the permit area as it exists when the land comes under the protection of § 761.11.
(b) With respect to operations subject to Subchapter B of this chapter, lands upon which validly authorized surface coal mining operations exist when the land comes under the protection of 30 U.S.C. 1272(e) or § 761.11.
[64 FR 70833, Dec. 17, 1999]
§ 761.13
Procedures for compatibility findings for surface coal mining operations on Federal lands in national forests.
(a) If you intend to rely upon the exception provided in § 761.11(b) to conduct surface coal mining operations on Federal lands within a national forest, you must request that we obtain the Secretarial findings required by § 761.11(b).
(b) You may submit a request to us before preparing and submitting an application for a permit or boundary revision. If you do, you must explain how the proposed operation would not damage the values listed in the definition of “significant recreational, timber, economic, or other values incompatible with surface coal mining operations” in § 761.5. You must include a map and sufficient information about the nature of the proposed operation for the Secretary to make adequately documented findings. We may request that you provide any additional information that we determine is needed to make the required findings.
(c) When a proposed surface coal mining operation or proposed boundary revision for an existing surface coal mining operation includes Federal lands within a national forest, the regulatory authority may not issue the permit or approve the boundary revision before the Secretary makes the findings required by § 761.11(b).
[64 FR 70833, Dec. 17, 1999]
§ 761.14
Procedures for relocating or closing a public road or waiving the prohibition on surface coal mining operations within the buffer zone of a public road.
(a) This section does not apply to:
(1) Lands for which a person has valid existing rights, as determined under § 761.16.
(2) Lands within the scope of the exception for existing operations in § 761.12.
(3) Access or haul roads that join a public road, as described in § 761.11(d)(1).
(b) You must obtain any necessary approvals from the authority with jurisdiction over the road if you propose to:
(1) Relocate a public road;
(2) Close a public road; or
(3) Conduct surface coal mining operations within 100 feet, measured horizontally, of the outside right-of-way line of a public road.
(c) Before approving an action proposed under paragraph (b) of this section, the regulatory authority, or a public road authority that it designates, must determine that the interests of the public and affected landowners will be protected. Before making this determination, the authority must:
(1) Provide a public comment period and opportunity to request a public hearing in the locality of the proposed operation;
(2) If a public hearing is requested, publish appropriate advance notice at least two weeks before the hearing in a newspaper of general circulation in the affected locality; and
(3) Based upon information received from the public, make a written finding as to whether the interests of the public and affected landowners will be protected. If a hearing was held, the authority must make this finding within 30 days after the hearing. If no hearing was held, the authority must make this finding within 30 days after the end of the public comment period.
[64 FR 70833, Dec. 17, 1999]
§ 761.15
Procedures for waiving the prohibition on surface coal mining operations within the buffer zone of an occupied dwelling.
(a) This section does not apply to:
(1) Lands for which a person has valid existing rights, as determined under § 761.16.
(2) Lands within the scope of the exception for existing operations in § 761.12.
(3) Access or haul roads that connect with an existing public road on the side of the public road opposite the dwelling, as provided in § 761.11(e)(2).
(b) If you propose to conduct surface coal mining operations within 300 feet, measured horizontally, of any occupied dwelling, the permit application must include a written waiver by lease, deed, or other conveyance from the owner of the dwelling. The waiver must clarify that the owner and signator had the legal right to deny mining and knowingly waived that right. The waiver will act as consent to surface coal mining operations within a closer distance of the dwelling as specified.
(c) If you obtained a valid waiver before August 3, 1977, from the owner of an occupied dwelling to conduct operations within 300 feet of the dwelling, you need not submit a new waiver.
(d) If you obtain a valid waiver from the owner of an occupied dwelling, that waiver will remain effective against subsequent purchasers who had actual or constructive knowledge of the existing waiver at the time of purchase. A subsequent purchaser will be deemed to have constructive knowledge if the waiver has been properly filed in public property records pursuant to State laws or if surface coal mining operations have entered the 300-foot zone before the date of purchase.

If your request relies upon the good faith/all permits standard in paragraph (b)(1) of the definition of valid existing rights in § 761.5, you must submit the information required under paragraph (b)(1) of this section. You also must submit the following information about permits, licenses, and authorizations for surface coal mining operations on the land to which your request pertains:
(i) Approval and issuance dates and identification numbers for any permits, licenses, and authorizations that you or a predecessor in interest obtained before the land came under the protection of § 761.11 or 30 U.S.C. 1272(e).
(ii) Application dates and identification numbers for any permits, licenses, and authorizations for which you or a predecessor in interest submitted an application before the land came under the protection of § 761.11 or 30 U.S.C. 1272(e).
(iii) An explanation of any other good faith effort that you or a predecessor in interest made to obtain the necessary permits, licenses, and authorizations as of the date that the land came under the protection of § 761.11 or 30 U.S.C. 1272(e).
(3)
Requirements for needed for and adjacent standard.
If your request relies upon the needed for and adjacent standard in paragraph (b)(2) of the definition of valid existing rights in § 761.5, you must submit the information required under paragraph (b)(1) of this section. In addition, you must explain how and why the land is needed for and immediately adjacent to the operation upon which your request is based, including a demonstration that prohibiting expansion of the operation onto that land would unfairly impact the viability of the operation as originally planned before the land came under the protection of § 761.11 or 30 U.S.C. 1272(e).
(4)
Requirements for standards for mine roads.
If your request relies upon one of the standards for roads in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(3) of the definition of valid existing rights in § 761.5, you must submit satisfactory documentation that:
(i) The road existed when the land upon which it is located came under the protection of § 761.11 or 30 U.S.C. 1272(e), and you have a legal right to use the road for surface coal mining operations;
(ii) A properly recorded right of way or easement for a road in that location existed when the land came under the

(iii) A valid permit for use or construction of a road in that location for surface coal mining operations existed when the land came under the protection of § 761.11 or 30 U.S.C. 1272(e).
(c)
Initial review of request.
(1) The agency must conduct an initial review to determine whether your request includes all applicable components of the submission requirements of paragraph (b) of this section. This review pertains only to the completeness of the request, not the legal or technical adequacy of the materials submitted.
(2) If your request does not include all applicable components of the submission requirements of paragraph (b) of this section, the agency must notify you and establish a reasonable time for submission of the missing information.
(3) When your request includes all applicable components of the submission requirements of paragraph (b) of this section, the agency must implement the notice and comment requirements of paragraph (d) of this section.
(4) If you do not provide information that the agency requests under paragraph (c)(2) of this section within the time specified or as subsequently extended, the agency must issue a determination that you have not demonstrated valid existing rights, as provided in paragraph (e)(4) of this section.
(d)
Notice and comment requirements and procedures.
(1) When your request satisfies the completeness requirements of paragraph (c) of this section, the agency must publish a notice in a newspaper of general circulation in the county in which the land is located. This notice must invite comment on the merits of the request. Alternatively, the agency may require that you publish this notice and provide the agency with a copy of the published notice. We will publish a similar notice in the
Federal Register
if your request involves Federal lands within an area listed in § 761.11(a) or (b). Each notice must include:
(i) The location of the land to which the request pertains.
(ii) A description of the type of surface coal mining operations planned.
(iii) A reference to and brief description of the applicable standard(s) under the definition of valid existing rights in § 761.5.
(A) If your request relies upon the good faith/all permits standard or the needed for and adjacent standard in paragraph (b) of the definition of valid existing rights in § 761.5, the notice also must include a description of the property rights that you claim and the basis for your claim.
(B) If your request relies upon the standard in paragraph (c)(1) of the definition of valid existing rights in § 761.5, the notice also must include a description of the basis for your claim that the road existed when the land came under the protection of § 761.11 or 30 U.S.C. 1272(e). In addition, the notice must include a description of the basis for your claim that you have a legal right to use that road for surface coal mining operations.
(C) If your request relies upon the standard in paragraph (c)(2) of the definition of valid existing rights in § 761.5, the notice also must include a description of the basis for your claim that a properly recorded right of way or easement for a road in that location existed when the land came under the protection of § 761.11 or 30 U.S.C. 1272(e). In addition, the notice must include a description of the basis for your claim that, under the document creating the right of way or easement, and under any subsequent conveyances, you have a legal right to use or construct a road across the right of way or easement to conduct surface coal mining operations.
(iv) If your request relies upon one or more of the standards in paragraphs (b), (c)(1), and (c)(2) of the definition of valid existing rights in § 761.5, a statement that the agency will not make a decision on the merits of your request if, by the close of the comment period under this notice or the notice required by paragraph (d)(3) of this section, a person with a legal interest in the land initiates appropriate legal action in
the proper venue to resolve any differences concerning the validity or interpretation of the deed, lease, easement, or other documents that form the basis of your claim.
(v) A description of the procedures that the agency will follow in processing your request.
(vi) The closing date of the comment period, which must be a minimum of 30 days after the publication date of the notice.
(vii) A statement that interested persons may obtain a 30-day extension of the comment period upon request.
(viii) The name and address of the agency office where a copy of the request is available for public inspection and to which comments and requests for extension of the comment period should be sent.
(2) The agency must promptly provide a copy of the notice required under paragraph (d)(1) of this section to:
(i) All reasonably locatable owners of surface and mineral estates in the land included in your request.
(ii) The owner of the feature causing the land to come under the protection of § 761.11, and, when applicable, the agency with primary jurisdiction over the feature with respect to the values causing the land to come under the protection of § 761.11. For example, both the landowner and the State Historic Preservation Officer must be notified if surface coal mining operations would adversely impact any site listed on the National Register of Historic Places. As another example, both the surface owner and the National Park Service must be notified if the request includes non-Federal lands within the authorized boundaries of a unit of the National Park System.
(3) The letter transmitting the notice required under paragraph (d)(2) of this section must provide a 30-day comment period, starting from the date of service of the letter, and specify that another 30 days is available upon request. At its discretion, the agency responsible for the determination of valid existing rights may grant additional time for good cause upon request. The agency need not necessarily consider comments received after the closing date of the comment period.
(e)
How a decision will be made.
(1) The agency responsible for making the determination of valid existing rights must review the materials submitted under paragraph (b) of this section, comments received under paragraph (d) of this section, and any other relevant, reasonably available information to determine whether the record is sufficiently complete and adequate to support a decision on the merits of the request. If not, the agency must notify you in writing, explaining the inadequacy of the record and requesting submittal, within a specified reasonable time, of any additional information that the agency deems necessary to remedy the inadequacy.
(2) Once the record is complete and adequate, the responsible agency must determine whether you have demonstrated valid existing rights. The decision document must explain how you have or have not satisfied all applicable elements of the definition of valid existing rights in § 761.5. It must contain findings of fact and conclusions, and it must specify the reasons for the conclusions.
(3)
Impact of property rights disagreements.
This paragraph applies only when your request relies upon one or more of the standards in paragraphs (b), (c)(1), and (c)(2) of the definition of valid existing rights in § 761.5.
(i) The agency must issue a determination that you have not demonstrated valid existing rights if your property rights claims are the subject of pending litigation in a court or administrative body with jurisdiction over the property rights in question. The agency will make this determination without prejudice, meaning that you may refile the request once the property rights dispute is finally adjudicated. This paragraph applies only to situations in which legal action has been initiated as of the closing date of the comment period under paragraph (d)(1) or (d)(3) of this section.
(ii) If the record indicates disagreement as to the accuracy of your property rights claims, but this disagreement is not the subject of pending litigation in a court or administrative agency of competent jurisdiction, the agency must evaluate the merits of the
information in the record and determine whether you have demonstrated that the requisite property rights exist under paragraph (a), (c)(1), or (c)(2) of the definition of valid existing rights in § 761.5, as appropriate. The agency must then proceed with the decision process under paragraph (e)(2) of this section.
(4) The agency must issue a determination that you have not demonstrated valid existing rights if you do not submit information that the agency requests under paragraph (c)(2) or (e)(1) of this section within the time specified or as subsequently extended. The agency will make this determination without prejudice, meaning that you may refile a revised request at any time.
(5) After making a determination, the agency must:
(i) Provide a copy of the determination, together with an explanation of appeal rights and procedures, to you, to the owner or owners of the land to which the determination applies, to the owner of the feature causing the land to come under the protection of § 761.11, and, when applicable, to the agency with primary jurisdiction over the feature with respect to the values that caused the land to come under the protection of § 761.11.
(ii) Publish notice of the determination in a newspaper of general circulation in the county in which the land is located. Alternatively, the agency may require that you publish this notice and provide a copy of the published notice to the agency. We will publish the determination, together with an explanation of appeal rights and procedures, in the
Federal Register
if your request includes Federal lands within an area listed in § 761.11(a) or (b).
(f)
Administrative and judicial review.
A determination that you have or do not have valid existing rights is subject to administrative and judicial review under §§ 775.11 and 775.13 of this chapter.
(g)
Availability of records.
The agency responsible for processing a request subject to notice and comment under paragraph (d) of this section must make a copy of that request available to the public in the same manner as the agency, when acting as the regulatory authority, must make permit applications available to the public under § 773.6(d) of this chapter. In addition, the agency must make records associated with that request, and any subsequent determination under paragraph (e) of this section, available to the public in accordance with the requirements and procedures of § 840.14 or § 842.16 of this chapter.
[64 FR 70833, Dec. 17, 1999, as amended at 75 FR 60275, Sept. 29, 2010]
§ 761.17
Regulatory authority obligations at time of permit application review.
(a) Upon receipt of an administratively complete application for a permit for a surface coal mining operation, or an administratively complete application for revision of the boundaries of a surface coal mining operation permit, the regulatory authority must review the application to determine whether the proposed surface coal mining operation would be located on any lands protected under § 761.11.
(b) The regulatory authority must reject any portion of the application that would locate surface coal mining operations on land protected under § 761.11 unless:
(1) The site qualifies for the exception for existing operations under § 761.12;
(2) A person has valid existing rights for the land, as determined under § 761.16;
(3) The applicant obtains a waiver or exception from the prohibitions of § 761.11 in accordance with §§ 761.13 through 761.15; or
(4) For lands protected by § 761.11(c), both the regulatory authority and the agency with jurisdiction over the park or place jointly approve the proposed operation in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section.
(c)
Location verification.
If the regulatory authority has difficulty determining whether an application includes land within an area specified in § 761.11(a) or within the specified distance from a structure or feature listed in § 761.11(f) or (g), the regulatory authority must request that the Federal, State, or local governmental agency with jurisdiction over the protected
land, structure, or feature verify the location.
(1) The request for location verification must:
(i) Include relevant portions of the permit application.
(ii) Provide the agency with 30 days after receipt to respond, with a notice that another 30 days is available upon request.
(iii) Specify that the regulatory authority will not necessarily consider a response received after the comment period provided under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section.
(2) If the agency does not respond in a timely manner, the regulatory authority may make the necessary determination based on available information.
(d)
Procedures for joint approval of surface coal mining operations that will adversely affect publicly owned parks or historic places.
(1) If the regulatory authority determines that the proposed surface coal mining operation will adversely affect any publicly owned park or any place included in the National Register of Historic Places, the regulatory authority must request that the Federal, State, or local agency with jurisdiction over the park or place either approve or object to the proposed operation. The request must:
(i) Include a copy of applicable parts of the permit application.
(ii) Provide the agency with 30 days after receipt to respond, with a notice that another 30 days is available upon request.
(iii) State that failure to interpose an objection within the time specified under paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section will constitute approval of the proposed operation.
(2) The regulatory authority may not issue a permit for a proposed operation subject to paragraph (d)(1) of this section unless all affected agencies jointly approve.
(3) Paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of this section do not apply to:
(i) Lands for which a person has valid existing rights, as determined under § 761.16.
(ii) Lands within the scope of the exception for existing operations in § 761.12.
[64 FR 70836, Dec. 17, 1999]
§ 761.200
Interpretative rule related to subsidence due to underground coal mining in areas designated by Act of Congress.
OSM has adopted the following interpretation of rules promulgated in part 761.
(a)
Interpretation of § 761.11—Areas where mining is prohibited or limited.
Subsidence due to underground coal mining is not included in the definition of surface coal mining operations under section 701(28) of the Act and § 700.5 of this chapter and therefore is not prohibited in areas protected under section 522(e) of the Act.
(b) [Reserved]

§ 762.1
Scope.
This part establishes the minimum criteria to be used in determining whether lands should be designated as unsuitable for all or certain types of surface coal mining operations.
§ 762.4
Responsibility.
The regulatory authority or OSM shall use the criteria in this part for the evaluation of each petition for the designation of areas as unsuitable for surface coal mining operations.
§ 762.5
Definitions.
For purposes of this part:
Fragile lands
means areas containing natural, ecologic, scientific, or esthetic resources that could be significantly damaged by surface coal mining operations. Examples of fragile lands include valuable habitats for fish or wildlife, critical habitats for endangered or threatened species of animals or plants, uncommon geologic formations, paleontological sites, National Natural Landmarks, areas where mining may result in flooding, environmental corridors containing a concentration of ecologic and esthetic features, and areas of recreational value due to high environmental quality.
Historic lands
means areas containing historic, cultural, or scientific resources. Examples of historic lands include archeological sites, properties listed on or eligible for listing on a State or National Register of Historic Places, National Historic Landmarks, properties having religious or cultural significance to Native Americans or religious groups, and properties for which historic designation is pending.
Natural hazard lands
means geographic areas in which natural conditions exist which pose or, as a result of surface coal mining operations, may pose a threat to the health, safety or welfare of people, property or the environment, including areas subject to landslides, cave-ins, large or encroaching sand dunes, severe wind or soil erosion, frequent flooding, avalanches and areas of unstable geology.
Renewable resource lands
means geographic areas which contribute significantly to the long-range productivity of water supply or of food or fiber products, such lands to include aquifers and aquifer recharge areas.
Substantial legal and financial commitments in a surface coal mining operation
means significant investments that have been made on the basis of a long-term coal contract in power plants, railroads, coal-handling, preparation, extraction or storage facilities, and other capital-intensive activities. Costs of acquiring the coal in place, or the right to mine it alone without other significant investments, as described above, are not sufficient to constitute substantial legal and financial commitments.
[48 FR 41350, Sept. 14, 1983, as amended at 52 FR 18795, May 19, 1987; 53 FR 26584, July 13, 1988]
§ 762.11
Criteria for designating lands as unsuitable.
(a) Upon petition an area shall be designated as unsuitable for all or certain types of surface coal mining operations, if the regulatory authority determines that reclamation is not technologically and economically feasible under the Act, this chapter or an approved State program.
(b) Upon petition an area may be (but is not required to be) designated as unsuitable for certain types of surface coal mining operations, if the operations will—
(1) Be incompatible with existing State or local land use plans or programs;
(2) Affect fragile or historic lands in which the operations could result in significant damage to important historic, cultural, scientific, or esthetic values or natural systems;
(3) Affect renewable resource lands in which the operations could result in a substantial loss or reduction of long-range productivity of water supply or of food or fiber products; or
(4) Affect natural hazard lands in which the operations could substantially endanger life and property, such lands to include areas subject to frequent flooding and areas of unstable geology.
§ 762.12
Additional criteria.
(a) A State regulatory authority may establish additional or more stringent criteria for determining whether lands within the State should be designated as unsuitable for coal mining operations. Such criteria shall be approved pursuant to subchapter C of this chapter.
(b) The Secretary may establish additional criteria for determining whether Federal lands should be designated as unsuitable for surface mining operations.
(c) Additional criteria will be determined to be more stringent on the
basis of whether they provide for greater protection of the public health, safety and welfare or the environment, such that areas beyond those specified in the criteria of this part would be designated as unsuitable for surface coal mining operations.
§ 762.13
Land exempt from designation as unsuitable for surface coal mining operations.
The requirements of this part do not apply to—
(a) Lands on which surface coal mining operations were being conducted on the date of enactment of the Act;
(b) Lands covered by a permit issued under the Act; or
(c) Lands where substantial legal and financial commitments in surface coal mining operations were in existence prior to January 4, 1977.
§ 762.14
Applicability to lands designated as unsuitable by Congress.
Pursuant to appropriate petitions, lands listed in § 761.11 of this chapter are subject to designation as unsuitable for all or certain types of surface coal mining operations under this part and parts 764 and 769 of this chapter.
[64 FR 70837, Dec. 17, 1999]
§ 762.15
Exploration on land designated as unsuitable for surface coal mining operations.
Designation of any area as unsuitable for all or certain types of surface coal mining operations pursuant to section 522 of the Act and regulations of this subchapter does not prohibit coal exploration operations in the area, if conducted in accordance with the Act, this chapter, any approved State or Federal program, and other applicable requirements. Exploration operations on any lands designated unsuitable for surface coal mining operations must be approved by the regulatory authority under part 772 of this chapter, to ensure that exploration does not interfere with any value for which the area has been designated unsuitable for surface coal mining.

§ 764.1
Scope.
This part establishes minimum procedures and standards to be included in each approved State program for designating non-Federal and non-Indian lands in a State as unsuitable for all or certain types of surface coal mining operations and for terminating designations.
§ 764.10
Information collection.
The information collection requirements contained in §§ 764.21 and 764.25(b) have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3507 and assigned clearance number 1029-0030. The information required in § 764.21 is necessary to allow the regulatory authority to develop a data base and inventory system to evaluate whether reclamation is feasible in areas covered by petitions. The information required in § 764.25(b) is necessary to allow the regulatory authority to determine, when a permit application is filed, whether it includes any areas designated as unsuitable for surface coal mining.
§ 764.11
General process requirements.
Each State shall establish a process enabling objective decisions to be made on which, if any, land areas of the State are unsuitable for all or certain
types of surface coal mining operations. These decisions shall be based on competent, scientifically sound data and other relevant information. This process shall include the requirements listed in this part.
§ 764.13
Petitions.
(a)
Right to petition.
Any person having an interest which is or may be adversely affected has the right to petition the regulatory authority to have an area designated as unsuitable for surface coal mining operations, or to have an existing designation terminated. For the purpose of this Action, a person having an interest which is or may be adversely affected must demonstrate how he or she meets an “injury in fact” test by describing the injury to his or her specific affected interests and demonstrate how he or she is among the injured.
(b)
Designation.
The regulatory authority shall determine what information must be provided by the petitioner to have an area designated as unsuitable for surface coal mining operations.
(1) At a minimum, a complete petition for designation shall include—
(i) The petitioner's name, address, telephone number, and notarized signature;
(ii) Identification of the petitioned areas, including its location and size, and a U.S. Geological Survey topographic map outlining the perimeter of the petitioned area;
(iii) An identification of the petitioner's interest which is or may be adversely affected by surface coal mining operations, including a statement demonstrating how the petitioner satisfies the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section;
(iv) A description of how mining of the area has affected of may adversely affect people, land, air, water, or other resources, including the petitioner's interests; and
(v) Allegations of fact and supporting evidence, covering all lands in the petition area, which tend to establish that the area is unsuitable for all or certain types of surface coal mining operations, pursuant to specific criteria of sections 522(a) (2) and (3) of the Act, assuming that contemporary mining practices required under applicable regulatory programs would be followed if the area were to be mined. Each of the allegations of fact should be specific as to the mining operation, if known, and the portion(s) of the petitioned area and petitioner's interests to which the allegation applies and be supported by evidence that tends to establish the validity of the allegations for the mining operation or portion of the petitioned areas.
(2) The regulatory authority may request that the petitioner provide other supplementary information which is readily available.
(c)
Termination.
The regulatory authority shall determine what information must be provided by the petitioner to terminate designations of lands as unsuitable for surface coal mining operations.
(1) At a minimum, a complete petition for termination shall include—
(i) The petitioner's name, address, telephone number, and notarized signature;
(ii) Identification of the petitioned area, including its location and size and a U.S. Geological Survey topographic map outlining the perimeter of the petitioned area to which the termination petition applies;
(iii) An identification of the petitioner's interest which is or may be adversely affected by the designation that the area is unsuitable for surface coal mining operations including a statement demonstrating how the petitioner satisfies the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section;
(iv) Allegations of facts covering all lands for which the termination is proposed. Each of the allegations of fact shall be specific as to the mining operation, if any, and to portions of the petitioned area and petitioner's interests to which the allegation applies. The allegations shall be supported by evidence, not contained in the record of the designation proceeding, that tends to establish the validity of the allegations for the mining operation or portion of the petitioned area, assuming that contemporary mining practices required under applicable regulatory programs would be followed were the area to be mined. For areas previously
and unsuccessfully proposed for termination, significant new allegations of facts and supporting evidence must be presented in the petition. Allegations and supporting evidence should also be specific to the basis for which the designation was made and tend to establish that the designation should be terminated on the following bases:
(A) Nature or abundance of the protected resource or condition or other basis of the designation if the designation was based on criteria found in § 762.11(b) of this chapter;
(B) Reclamation now being technologically and economically feasible if the designation was based on the criteria found in § 762.11(a) of this chapter; or
(C) Resources or conditions not being affected by surface coal mining operations, or in the case of land use plans, not being incompatible with surface coal mining operations during and after mining, if the designation was based on the criteria found in § 762.11(b) of this chapter;
(2) The State regulatory authority may request that the petitioner provide other supplementary information which is readily available.
§ 764.15
Initial processing, recordkeeping, and notification requirements.
(a)(1) Within 30 days of receipt of a petition, the regulatory authority shall notify the petitioner by certified mail whether the petition is complete under § 764.13 (b) or (c). Complete, for a designation or termination petition, means that the information required under § 764.13 (b) or (c) has been provided.
(2) The regulatory authority shall determine whether any identified coal resources exist in the area covered by the petition, without requiring any showing from the petitioner. If the regulatory authority finds there are not any identified coal resources in that area, it shall return the petition to the petitioner with a statement of the findings.
(3) If the regulatory authority determines that the petition is incomplete, frivolous, or that the petitioner does not meet the requirements of § 764.13(a), it shall return the petition to the petitioner with a written statement of the reasons for the determination and the categories of information needed to make the petition complete. A frivolous petition is one in which the allegations of harm lack serious merit.
(4) When considering a petition for an area which was previously and unsuccessfully proposed for designation, the regulatory authority shall determine if the new petition presents significant new allegations of facts with evidence which tends to establish the allegations. If the petition does not contain such material, the regulatory authority may choose not to consider the petition and may return the petition to the petitioner, with a statement of its findings and a reference to the record of the previous designation proceedings where the facts were considered.
(5) The regulatory authority shall notify the person who submits a petition of any application for a permit received which includes any area covered by the petition.
(6) The regulatory authority may determine not to process any petition received insofar as it pertains to lands for which an administratively complete permit application has been filed and the first newspaper notice has been published. Based on such a determination, the regulatory authority may issue a decision on a complete and accurate permit application and shall inform the petitioner why the regulatory authority cannot consider the part of the petition pertaining to the proposed permit area.
(b)(1) Promptly after a petition is received, the regulatory authority shall notify the general public of the receipt of the petition by a newspaper advertisement placed in the locale of the area covered by the petition, in the newspaper providing broadest circulation in the region of the petitioned area and in any official State register of public notices. The regulatory authority shall make copies of the petition available to the public and shall provide copies of the petition to other interested governmental agencies, intervenors, persons with an ownership interest of record in the property, and other persons known to the regulatory authority to have an interest in the property. Proper notice to persons with
an ownership interest of record in the property shall comply with the requirements of applicable State law.
(2) Promptly after the determination that a petition is complete, the regulatory authority shall request submissions from the general public of relevant information by a newspaper advertisement placed once a week for two consecutive weeks in the locale of the area covered by the petition, in the newspaper providing broadest circulation in the region of the petitioned area, and in any official State register of public notices.
(c) Until three days before the regulatory authority holds a hearing under § 764.17, any person may intervene in the proceeding by filing allegations of facts describing how the designation determination directly affects the intervenor, supporting evidence, a short statement identifying the petition to which the allegations pertain, and the intervenor's name, address and telephone number.
(d) Beginning from the date a petition is filed, the regulatory authority shall compile and maintain a record consisting of all documents relating to the petition filed with or prepared by the regulatory authority. The regulatory authority shall make the record available to the public for inspection free of charge and for copying at reasonable cost during all normal hours at the main office of the regulatory authority. The regulatory authority shall also maintain information at or near the area in which the petitioned land is located and make this information available to the public for inspection free of charge and for copying at reasonable cost during all normal business hours. At a minimum, this information shall include a copy of the petition.
[48 FR 41351, Sept. 14, 1983, as amended at 52 FR 49323, 49324, Dec. 30, 1987]
§ 764.17
Hearing requirements.
(a) Within 10 months after receipt of a complete petition, the regulatory authority shall hold a public hearing in the locality of the area covered by the petition. If all petitioners and intervenors agree, the hearing need not be held. The regulatory authority may subpoena witnesses as necessary. The hearing may be conducted with cross-examination of expert witnesses only. A record of the hearing shall be made and preserved according to State law. No person shall bear the burden of proof or persuasion. All relevant parts of the data base and inventory system and all public comments received during the public comment period shall be included in the record and considered by the regulatory authority in its decision on the petition.
(b)(1) The regulatory authority shall give notice of the date, time, and location of the hearing to:
(i) Local, State, and Federal agencies which may have an interest in the decision on the petition;
(ii) The petitioner and the intervenors; and
(iii) Any person known by the regulatory authority to have a property interest in the petitioned area. Proper notice to persons with an ownership interest of record shall comply with the requirements of applicable State law.
(2) Notice of the hearing shall be sent by certified mail to petitioners and intervenors, and by regular mail to government agencies and property owners involved in the proceeding, and postmarked not less than 30 days before the scheduled date of the hearing.
(c) The regulatory authority shall notify the general public of the date, time, and location of the hearing by placing a newspaper advertisement once a week for 2 consecutive weeks in the locale of the area covered by the petition and once during the week prior to the public hearing. The consecutive weekly advertisement must begin between 4 and 5 weeks before the scheduled date of the public hearing.
(d) The regulatory authority may consolidate in a single hearing the hearings required for each of several petitions which relate to areas in the same locale.
(e) Prior to designating any land areas as unsuitable for surface coal mining operations, the regulatory authority shall prepare a detailed statement, using existing and available information on the potential coal resources of the area, the demand for coal resources, and the impact of such designation on the environment, the economy, and the supply of coal.
(f) In the event that all petitioners and intervenors stipulate agreement prior to the hearing, the petition may be withdrawn from consideration.
§ 764.19
Decision.
(a) In reaching its decision, the regulatory authority shall use—
(1) The information contained in the data base and inventory system;
(2) Information provided by other governmental agencies;
(3) The detailed statement when it is prepared under § 764.17(e); and
(4) Any other relevant information submitted during the comment period.
(b) A final written decision shall be issued by the regulatory authority, including a statement of reasons, within 60 days of completion of the public hearing, or, if no public hearing is held, then within 12 months after receipt of the complete petition. The regulatory authority shall simultaneously send the decision by certified mail to the petitioner and intervenors and by regular mail to all other persons involved in the proceeding.
(c) The decision of the State regulatory authority with respect to a petition, or the failure of the regulatory authority to act within the time limits set forth in this section, shall be subject to judicial review by a court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with State law under section 526(e) of the Act and § 775.13 of this chapter. All relevant portions of the data base, inventory system, and public comments received during the public comment period set by the regulatory authority shall be considered and included in the record of the administrative proceeding.
§ 764.21
Data base and inventory system requirements.
(a) The regulatory authority shall develop a data base and inventory system which will permit evaluation of whether reclamation is feasible in areas covered by petitions.
(b) The regulatory authority shall include in the system information relevant to the criteria in § 762.11 of this chapter, including, but not limited to, information received from the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, the State Historic Preservation Officer, and the agency administering section 127 of the Clean Air Act, as amended (42 U.S.C. 7470
et seq.
).
(c) The regulatory authority shall add to the data base and inventory system information—
(1) On potential coal resources of the State, demand for those resources, the environment, the economy and the supply of coal, sufficient to enable the regulatory authority to prepare the statements required by § 764.17(e); and
(2) That becomes available from petitions, publications, experiments, permit application, mining and reclamation operations, and other sources.
§ 764.23
Public information.
The regulatory authority shall:
(a) Make the information in the data base and inventory system developed under § 764.21 available to the public for inspection free of charge and for copying at reasonable cost, except that specific information relating to location of properties proposed to be nominated to, or listed in, the National Register of Historic Places need not be disclosed if the regulatory authority determines that the disclosure of such information would create a risk of destruction or harm to such properties;
(b) Provide information to the public on the petition procedures necessary to have an area designated as unsuitable for all or certain types of surface coal mining operations or to have designations terminated and describe how the inventory and data base system can be used.
§ 764.25

§ 769.1
Scope.
This part establishes minimum procedures and standards for designating Federal lands as unsuitable for all or certain types of surface coal mining operations and for terminating designations pursuant to petition.
§ 769.10
Information collection.
The information collection requirements in this part do not require approval of the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3507 because there are fewer than 10 respondents annually.
§ 769.11
Who may submit a petition.
Any person having an interest which is or may be adversely affected by surface coal mining operations to be conducted on Federal lands may petition the Secretary to have an area designated as unsuitable for all or certain types of surface coal mining operations, or to have an existing designation terminated. This right does not apply to areas set aside from surface coal mining operations under laws other than the Act. For the purpose of this section, a person having an interest which is or may be adversely affected must demonstrate how he or she meets an “injury in fact” test by describing the injury to his or her specific affected interests and demonstrate how he or she is among the injured.
§ 769.12
Where to submit petitions.
Each petition to have an area of Federal lands designated as unsuitable or to terminate an existing designation shall be submitted to the Director of the OSM Field Office responsible for that area where the Federal lands are located.
§ 769.13
Contents of petitions.
(a)
Designation.
The only information that a petitioner need provide to designate lands is that required under § 764.13(b) of this chapter.
(b)
Termination.
The only information that a petitioner need provide to terminate a designation is that required by § 764.13(c) of this chapter.
§ 769.14
Initial processing, recordkeeping, and notification requirements.
(a)(1) Within 30 days of receipt of a petition, OSMRE shall determine whether the petition is complete and not frivolous. OSMRE may request other supplementary information that is readily available to be provided by the petitioner. Any request for such supplementary information from the petitioner shall not affect OSMRE's determination that the petition is complete for further processing.
(2)
Complete,
(i) for a designation petition, means that (A) all information required under § 764.13(b) of this chapter has been provided and (B) the information submitted by the petitioner contains significant new allegations of fact and supporting evidence not considered in any previous unsuccessful petition of Federal lands review conducted under Section 522(b) of the Act, that tends to establish that the lands are unsuitable for surface coal mining operations; and (ii) for a termination petition, means that all information required under § 764.13(c) has been provided.
(3)
Frivolous,
for a designation or termination petition, means that:
(i) The allegations of harm lack serious merit; or
(ii) Available information shows that no “mineable” coals resources exist in the petitioned area or that the petitioned area is not or could not be subject to related surface coal mining operations and surface impacts incident to an underground coal mine or an adjoining surface mine (mineable coal is coal with development potential as mapped or reported by the Bureau of Land Management under 43 CFR 3420.1-4(e)(1); and privately owned coal under land owned by the United States).
(b) When the Director finds that the petition is incomplete or frivolous, he or she shall reject the petition with a written statement of reasons and advise the petitioner, via certified mail, that the petition may be reconsidered upon resubmittal with deficiencies cured.
(c) When the Director finds that the petition is complete and not frivolous, he or she shall initiate the petition review and so advise the petitioner via certified mail.
(d)(1) Within 2 weeks after accepting the petition for further processing, OSM shall send a copy of the petition to the authorized officer of the land management agency for the officer's recommendation on the petition.
(2) The authorized officer of the appropriate Federal land management agency shall furnish a recommendation on the petition to OSM within 30 days of its receipt, if the area covered by the petition has been included in a completed Federal lands review or within 9 months, if the area has not been included in a Federal lands review.
(e) Promptly after accepting a petition for further processing, OSM shall circulate copies of the petition to, and request submissions of relevant information from, other interested governmental agencies, the petitioner, intervenors, and any person, known to OSM to have an ownership interest in the property.
(f) Where lands administered by the Department of the Interior and other Federal land management agencies are contiguous or intermingled or where the Department's resource management could affect resources on the other's land, the Director of OSM shall refer a copy of the petition to the other Federal land management agency and shall consider the agency's recommendations about designating those lands unsuitable for all or certain types of surface coal mining or terminating such designations.
(g) OSM may determine not to process any petition received insofar as it pertains to lands for which an administratively complete permit application has been filed and the first newspaper notice has been published.

(1) If a State program receives final disapproval under part 732 of this chapter, including judicial review of the disapproval, existing surface coal mining and reclamation operations may continue pursuant to the provisions of subchapter B of this chapter and section 502 of the Act until promulgation of a complete Federal program for the State. During this period, no new permits for surface coal mining and reclamation operations shall be issued by the State. Permits that lapse during this period may continue in full force and effect within the specified permit area until promulgation of a Federal program for the State.
(2) Except for coal preparation plants separately authorized to operate under 30 CFR 785.21(e), a person conducting surface coal mining operations, under a permit issued or amended by the regulatory authority in accordance with the requirements of section 502 of the Act, may conduct such operations beyond the period prescribed in paragraph (a) of this section if—
(i) Not later than 2 months following the effective date of a permanent regulatory program, regardless of litigation contesting that program, an application for a permanent regulatory program permit is filed for any operation to be conducted after the expiration of 8 months from such effective date in accordance with the provisions of the regulatory program;
(ii) The regulatory authority has not yet rendered an initial administrative decision approving or disapproving the permit; and
(iii) The surface coal mining and reclamation operation is conducted in compliance with the requirements of the Act, subchapter B of this chapter, applicable State statutes and regulations, and all terms and conditions of the initial program authorization or permit.
(3) No new initial program permits may be issued after the effective date of a State program unless the application was received prior to such date.
(c)
Continued operations under Federal program permits.
(1) A permit issued by the Director pursuant to a Federal program for a State shall be valid under any superseding State program approved by the Secretary.
(2) The Federal permittee shall have the right to apply to the State regulatory authority for a State permit to supersede the Federal permit.
(3) The State regulatory authority may review a permit issued pursuant to the superseded Federal program to determine that the requirements of the Act and the approved State program are not violated by the Federal permit, and to the extent that the approved State program contains additional requirements not contained in the Federal program for the State, the State regulatory authority shall—
(i) Inform the permittee in writing;
(ii) Provide the permittee an opportunity for a hearing;
(iii) Provide the permittee a reasonable opportunity to resubmit the permit application in whole or in part, as appropriate; and
(iv) Provide the permittee a reasonable time to conform ongoing surface coal mining and reclamation operations to the requirements of the State program.
(d)
Continued operations under State program permits.
(1) A permit issued pursuant to a previously approved or conditionally approved State program shall be valid under a superseding Federal program.
(2) Immediately following promulgation of a Federal program, the Director shall review the permits issued under the previously approved State program to determine that the requirements of the Act, this chapter, and the Federal program are not violated. If the Director determines that a permit was granted contrary to the requirements of this Act, the Director shall—
(i) Inform the permittee in writing;
(ii) Provide the permittee an opportunity for a hearing;
(iii) Provide the permittee a reasonable opportunity to resubmit the permit application in whole or in part, as appropriate; and
(iv) Provide the permittee a reasonable time to conform ongoing surface coal mining and reclamation operations to the requirements of the Federal program, as prescribed in the Federal program for the State.

§ 773.21
Initial review and finding requirements for improvidently issued permits.
(a) If we, the regulatory authority, have reason to believe that we improvidently issued a permit to you, the permittee, we must review the circumstances under which the permit was issued. We will make a preliminary finding that your permit was improvidently issued if, under the permit eligibility criteria of the applicable regulations implementing section 510(c) of the Act in effect at the time of permit issuance, your permit should not have been issued because you or your operator owned or controlled a surface coal mining and reclamation operation with an unabated or uncorrected violation.
(b) We will make a finding under paragraph (a) of this section only if you or your operator—
(1) Continue to own or control the operation with the unabated or uncorrected violation;
(2) The violation remains unabated or uncorrected; and
(3) The violation would cause you to be ineligible under the permit eligibility criteria in our current regulations.
(c) When we make a preliminary finding under paragraph (a) of this section, we must serve you with a written notice of the preliminary finding, which must be based on evidence sufficient to establish a
prima facie
case that your permit was improvidently issued.
(d) Within 30 days of receiving a notice under paragraph (c) of this section, you may challenge the preliminary finding by providing us with evidence as to why the permit was not improvidently issued under the criteria in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.
(e) The provisions of §§ 773.25 through 773.27 of this part apply when a challenge under paragraph (d) of this section concerns a preliminary finding under paragraphs (a) and (b)(1) of this section that you or your operator currently own or control, or owned or controlled, a surface coal mining operation.

receiving notice of a change.
(4) changes in violation status
abatement, correction, or termination of a violation, or a decision from an administrative or judicial tribunal.
(b) If, at any time, we discover that any person owns or controls an operation with an unabated or uncorrected violation, we will determine whether enforcement action is appropriate under part 843, 846 or 847 of this chapter. We must enter the results of each enforcement action, including administrative and judicial decisions, into AVS.
(c) We must serve a preliminary finding of permanent permit ineligibility under section 510(c) of the Act on you, an applicant or operator, if the criteria in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) are met. In making a finding under this paragraph, we will only consider control relationships and violations which would make, or would have made, you ineligible for a permit under §§ 773.12(a) and (b) of this subchapter. We must make a preliminary finding of permanent permit ineligibility if we find that—
(1) You control or have controlled surface coal mining and reclamation operations with a demonstrated pattern of willful violations under section 510(c) of the Act; and
(2) The violations are of such nature and duration with such resulting irreparable damage to the environment as to indicate your intent not to comply

(2) If you request a hearing, we will enter our finding into AVS only if that finding is upheld on administrative appeal.
(f) At any time, we may identify any person who owns or controls an entire surface coal mining operation or any relevant portion or aspect thereof. If we identify such a person, we must issue a written preliminary finding to the person and the applicant or permittee describing the nature and extent of ownership or control. Our written preliminary finding must be based on evidence sufficient to establish a prima facie case of ownership or control.
(g) After we issue a written preliminary finding under paragraph (f) of this section, we will allow you, the person subject to the preliminary finding, 30 days in which to submit any information tending to demonstrate your lack of ownership or control. If, after reviewing any information you submit, we are persuaded that you are not an owner or controller, we will serve you a written notice to that effect. If, after reviewing any information you submit, we still find that you are an owner or controller, or if you do not submit any information within the 30-day period, we will issue a written finding and enter our finding into AVS.
(h) If we identify you as an owner or controller under paragraph (g) of this section, you may challenge the finding using the provisions of §§ 773.25, 773.26, and 773.27 of this subchapter.

Interpretive rules related to General Performance Standards.
The following interpretation of rules promulgated in part 784 of this chapter have been adopted by the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement.
(a)
Interpretation of § 784.15: Reclamation plan: Postmining land uses.
(1) The requirements of § 784.15(a)(2), for approval of an alternative postmining land use, may be met by requesting approval through the permit revision procedures of § 774.13 rather than requesting such approval in the original permit application. The original permit application, however, must demonstrate that the land will be returned to its premining land use capability as required by § 817.133(a). An application for a permit revision of this type, (i) must be submitted in accordance with the filing deadlines of § 774.13, (ii) shall constitute a significant alteration from the mining operations contemplated by the original permit, and (iii) shall be subject to the requirements of 30 CFR parts 773 and 775.
(b) [Reserved]

At 82 FR 54965, Nov. 17, 2017, as required by the Congressional Review Act and Public Law 115-5, the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement removed all amendments to part 785 made effective on Jan. 19, 2017, at 81 FR 93379-93381, Dec. 20, 2016.
§ 785.1
Scope.
This part establishes the minimum requirements for regulatory program provisions for permits for certain categories of surface coal mining and reclamation operations. These requirements are in addition to the general permit requirements contained in this subchapter G. All of the provisions of subchapter G apply to these operations, unless otherwise specifically provided in this part.
§ 785.2
Objective.
The objective of this part is to ensure that permits are issued for certain categories of surface coal mining and reclamation operations only after the regulatory authority receives information that shows that these operations will be conducted according to the applicable requirements of the Act, subchapter K, and applicable regulatory programs.
§ 785.10
Information collection.
In accordance with 44 U.S.C. 3501
et seq.,
the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has approved the information collection requirements of part 785 and assigned it control number 1029-0040. The information is being collected to meet the requirements of sections 507, 508, 510, 515, 701 and 711 of Public Law 95-87, which requires applicants for special types of mining activities to provide descriptions, maps, plans and data of the proposed activity. This information will be used by the regulatory authority in determining if the applicant can meet the applicable performance standards for the special type of mining activity. Persons must respond to obtain a benefit. A Federal agency may not conduct or sponsor, and you are not required to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number.

(2) The requirements of § 816.133 or § 817.133 of this chapter will be met.
(3) The watershed of lands within the proposed permit and adjacent areas will be improved by the operations when compared with the condition of the watershed before mining or with its condition if the approximate original contour were to be restored. The watershed will be deemed improved only if—
(i) The amount of total suspended solids or other pollutants discharged to ground or surface water from the permit area will be reduced, so as to improve the public or private uses or the ecology of such water, or flood hazards within the watershed containing the permit area will be reduced by reduction of the peak flow discharge from precipitation events or thaws;
(ii) The total volume of flow from the proposed permit area, during every season of the year, will not vary in a way that adversely affects the ecology of any surface water or any existing or planned use of surface or ground water; and
(iii) The appropriate State environmental agency approves the plan.
(4) The owner of the surface of the lands within the permit area has knowingly requested, in writing, as part of the application, that a variance be granted. The request shall be made separately from any surface owner consent given for the operations under § 778.15 of this chapter and shall show an understanding that the variance could not be granted without the surface owner's request.
(b) If a variance is granted under this section—
(1) The requirements of § 816.133(d) or § 817.133(d) of this chapter shall be included as a specific condition of the permit; and
(2) The permit shall be specifically marked as containing a variance from approximate original contour.

(d) If the permittee demonstrates to the regulatory authority that the operations have been, and continue to be, conducted in compliance with the terms and conditions of the permit, the requirements of the Act, this chapter, and the regulatory program, the review specified in paragraph (c) of this section need not be held.
(e) The terms and conditions of a permit incorporating a variance under this section may be modified at any time by the regulatory authority, if it
determines that more stringent measures are necessary to ensure that the operations involved are conducted in compliance with the requirements of the Act, this chapter, and the regulatory program.
(f) The regulatory authority may grant variances in accordance with this section only if it has promulgated specific rules to govern the granting of variances in accordance with the provisions of this section and any necessary, more stringent requirements.
[48 FR 39904, Sept. 1, 1983, as amended at 48 FR 44780, Sept. 30, 1983; 56 FR 65635, Dec. 17, 1991; 81 FR 93380, Dec. 20, 2016; 82 FR 54965, Nov. 17, 2017]
§ 785.17
Prime farmland.
(a) This section applies to any person who conducts or intends to conduct surface coal mining and reclamation operations on prime farmlands historically used for cropland. This section does not apply to:
(1) Lands on which surface coal mining and reclamation operations are conducted pursuant to any permit issued prior to August 3, 1977; or
(2) Lands on which surface coal mining and reclamation operations are conducted pursuant to any renewal or revision of a permit issued prior to August 3, 1977; or
(3) Lands included in any existing surface coal mining operations for which a permit was issued for all or any part thereof prior to August 3, 1977, provided that:
(i) Such lands are part of a single continuous surface coal mining operation begun under a permit issued before August 3, 1977; and
(ii) The permittee had a legal right to mine the lands prior to August 3, 1977, through ownership, contract, or lease but not including an option to buy, lease, or contract; and
(iii) The lands contain part of a continuous recoverable coal seam that was being mined in a single continuous mining pit (or multiple pits if the lands are proven to be part of a single continuous surface coal mining operation) begun under a permit issued prior to August 3, 1977.
(4) For purposes of this section:
(i) “Renewal” of a permit shall mean a decision by the regulatory authority to extend the time by which the permittee may complete mining within the boundaries of the original permit, and “revision” of the permit shall mean a decision by the regulatory authority to allow changes in the method of mining operations within the original permit area, or the decision of the regulatory authority to allow incidental boundary changes to the original permit;
(ii) A pit shall be deemed to be a single continuous mining pit even if portions of the pit are crossed by a road, pipeline, railroad, or powerline or similar crossing;
(iii) A single continuous surface coal mining operation is presumed to consist only of a single continuous mining pit under a permit issued prior to August 3, 1977, but may include non-contiguous parcels if the operator can prove by clear and convincing evidence that, prior to August 3, 1977, the non-contiguous parcels were part of a single permitted operation. For the purposes of this paragraph, clear and convincing evidence includes, but is not limited to, contracts, leases, deeds or other properly executed legal documents (not including options) that specifically treat physically separate parcels as one surface coal mining operation.
(b)
Application contents—Reconnaissance inspection.
(1) All permit applications, whether or not prime farmland is present, shall include the results of a reconnaissance inspection of the proposed permit area to indicate whether prime farmland exists. The regulatory authority in consultation with the U.S. Soil Conservation Service shall determine the nature and extent of the required reconnaissance inspection.
(2) If the reconnaissance inspection establishes that no land within the proposed permit area is prime farmland historically used for cropland, the applicant shall submit a statement that no prime farmland is present. The statement shall identify the basis upon which such a conclusion was reached.
(3) If the reconnaissance inspection indicates that land within the proposed permit area may be prime farmland historically used for cropland, the applicant shall determine if a soil survey exists for those lands and whether soil mapping units in the permit area have
been designated as prime farmland. If no soil survey exists, the applicant shall have a soil survey made of the lands within the permit area which the reconnaissance inspection indicates could be prime farmland. Soil surveys of the detail used by the U.S. Soil Conservation Service for operational conservation planning shall be used to identify and locate prime farmland soils.
(i) If the soil survey indicates that no prime farmland soils are present within the proposed permit area, paragraph (b)(2) of this section shall apply.
(ii) If the soil survey indicates that prime farmland soils are present within the proposed permit area, paragraph (c) of this section shall apply.
(c)
Application contents—Prime farmland.
All permit applications for areas in which prime farmland has been identified within the proposed permit area shall include the following:
(1) A soil survey of the permit area according to the standards of the National Cooperative Soil Survey and in accordance with the procedures set forth in U.S. Department of Agriculture Handbooks 436 “Soil Taxonomy” (U.S. Soil Conservation Service, 1975) as amended on March 22, 1982 and October 5, 1982, and 18, “Soil Survey Manual” (U.S. Soil Conservation Service, 1951), as amended on December 18, 1979, May 7, 1980, May 9, 1980, September 11, 1980, June 9, 1981, June 29, 1981, November 16, 1982. The U.S. Soil Conservation Service establishes the standards of the National Cooperative Soil Survey and maintains a National Soils Handbook which gives current acceptable procedures for conducting soil surveys. This National Soils Handbook is available for review at area and State SCS offices.
(i) U.S. Department of Agriculture Handbooks 436 and 18 are incorporated by reference as they exist on the date of adoption of this section. Notices of changes made to these publications will be periodically published by OSM in the
Federal Register.
The handbooks are on file and available for inspection at the OSM Central Office, U.S. Department of the Interior, 1951 Constitution Avenue NW., Washington, DC, at each OSM Technical Center and Field Office, and at the central office of the applicable State regulatory authority, if any. Copies of these documents are also available from the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402, Stock Nos. 001-000-02597-0 and 001-000-00688-6, respectively. In addition, these documents are available for inspection at the national, State, and area offices of the Soil Conservation Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, or at the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). For information on the availability of this material at NARA, call 202-741-6030, or go to:

Incorporation by reference provisions were approved by the Director of the Federal Register on June 29, 1981.
(ii) The soil survey shall include a description of soil mapping units and a representative soil profile as determined by the U.S. Soil Conservation Service, including, but not limited to, soil-horizon depths, pH, and the range of soil densities for each prime farmland soil unit within the permit area. Other representative soil-profile descriptions from the locality, prepared according to the standards of the National Cooperative Soil Survey, may be used if their use is approved by the State Conservationist, U.S. Soil Conservation Service. The regulatory authority may request the operator to provide information on other physical and chemical soil properties as needed to make a determination that the operator has the technological capability to restore the prime farmland within the permit area to the soil-reconstruction standards of part 823 of this chapter.
(2) A plan for soil reconstruction, replacement, and stabilization for the purpose of establishing the technological capability of the mine operator to comply with the requirements of part 823 of this chapter.
(3) Scientific data, such as agricultural-school studies, for areas with comparable soils, climate, and management that demonstrate that the proposed method of reclamation, including the use of soil mixtures or substitutes,
if any, will achieve, within a reasonable time, levels of yield equivalent to, or higher than, those of nonmined prime farmland in the surrounding area.
(4) The productivity prior to mining, including the average yield of food, fiber, forage, or wood products obtained under a high level of management.
(d)
Consultation with Secretary of Agriculture.
(1) The Secretary of Agriculture has responsibilities with respect to prime farmland soils and has assigned the prime farmland responsibilities arising under the Act to the Chief of the U.S. Soil Conservation Service. The U.S. Soil Conservation Service shall carry out consultation and review through the State Conservationist located in each State.
(2) The State Conservationist shall provide to the regulatory authority a list of prime farmland soils, their location, physical and chemical characteristics, crop yields, and associated data necessary to support adequate prime farmland soil descriptions.
(3) The State Conservationist shall assist the regulatory authority in describing the nature and extent of the reconnaissance inspection required in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
(4) Before any permit is issued for areas that include prime farmland, the regulatory authority shall consult with the State Conservationist. The State Conservationist shall provide for the review of, and comment on, the proposed method of soil reconstruction in the plan submitted under paragraph (c) of this section. If the State Conservationist considers those methods to be inadequate, he or she shall suggest revisions to the regulatory authority which result in more complete and adequate reconstruction.
(e)
Issuance of permit.
A permit for the mining and reclamation of prime farmland may be granted by the regulatory authority, if it first finds, in writing, upon the basis of a complete application, that—
(1) The approved proposed postmining land use of these prime farmlands will be cropland;
(2) The permit incorporates as specific conditions the contents of the plan submitted under paragraph (c) of this section, after consideration of any revisions to that plan suggested by the State Conservationist under paragraph (d)(4) of this section;
(3) The applicant has the technological capability to restore the prime farmland, within a reasonable time, to equivalent or higher levels of yield as non-mined prime farmland in the surrounding area under equivalent levels of management; and
(4) The proposed operations will be conducted in compliance with the requirements of 30 CFR part 823 and other environmental protection performance and reclamation standards for mining and reclamation of prime farmland of the regulatory program.
(5) The aggregate total prime farmland acreage shall not be decreased from that which existed prior to mining. Water bodies, if any, to be constructed during mining and reclamation operations must be located within the post-reclamation non-prime farmland portions of the permit area. The creation of any such water bodies must be approved by the regulatory authority and the consent of all affected property owners within the permit area must be obtained.

§ 785.18
Variances for delay in contemporaneous reclamation requirement in combined surface and underground mining activities.
(a)
Scope.
This section shall apply to any person or persons conducting or intending to conduct combined surface and underground mining activities where a variance is requested from the contemporaneous reclamation requirements of § 816.100 of this chapter.
(b)
Application contents for variances.
Any person desiring a variance under this section shall file with the regulatory authority complete applications for both the surface mining activities and underground mining activities which are to be combined. The reclamation and operation plans for these permits shall contain appropriate narratives, maps, and plans, which—
(1) Show why the proposed underground mining activities are necessary
or desirable to assure maximum practical recovery of the coal;
(2) Show how multiple future disturbances of surface lands or waters will be avoided;
(3) Identify the specific surface areas for which a variance is sought and the sections of the Act, this chapter, and the regulatory program from which a variance is being sought;
(4) Show how the activities will comply with § 816.79 of this chapter and other applicable requirements of the regulatory program;
(5) Show why the variance sought is necessary for the implementation of the proposed underground mining activities;
(6) Provide an assessment of the adverse environmental consequences and damages, if any, that will result if the reclamation of surface mining activities is delayed; and
(7) Show how offsite storage of spoil will be conducted to comply with the requirements of the Act, §§ 816.71 through 816.74 of this chapter, and the regulatory program.
(c)
Issuance of permit.
A permit incorporating a variance under this section may be issued by the regulatory authority if it first finds, in writing, upon the basis of a complete application filed in accordance with this section, that—
(1) The applicant has presented, as part of the permit application, specific, feasible plans for the proposed underground mining activities;
(2) The proposed underground mining activities are necessary or desirable to assure maximum practical recovery of the mineral resource and will avoid multiple future disturbances of surface land or waters;
(3) The applicant has satisfactorily demonstrated that the applications for the surface mining activities and underground mining activities conform to the requirements of the regulatory program and that all other permits necessary for the underground mining activities have been issued by the appropriate authority;
(4) The surface area of surface mining activities proposed for the variance has been shown by the applicant to be necessary for implementing the proposed underground mining activities;
(5) No substantial adverse environmental damage, either onsite or offsite, will result from the delay in completion of reclamation otherwise required by section 515(b)(16) of the Act, part 816 of this chapter, and the regulatory program;
(6) The operations will, insofar as a variance is authorized, be conducted in compliance with the requirements of § 816.79 of this chapter and the regulatory program;
(7) Provisions for offsite storage of spoil will comply with the requirements of section 515(b)(22) of the Act, §§ 816.71 through 816.74 of this chapter, and the regulatory program;
(8) Liability under the performance bond required to be filed by the applicant with the regulatory authority pursuant to subchapter J of this chapter and the regulatory program will be for the duration of the underground mining activities and until all requirements of subchapter J and the regulatory program have been complied with; and
(9) The permit for the surface mining activities contains specific conditions—
(i) Delineating the particular surface areas for which a variance is authorized;
(ii) Identifying the applicable provisions of section 515(b) of the Act, part 816 of this chapter, and the regulatory program; and
(iii) Providing a detailed schedule for compliance with the provisions of this section.
(d)
Review of permits containing variances.
Variances granted by permits issued under this section shall be reviewed by the regulatory authority no later than 3 years from the dates of issuance of the permit and any permit renewals.

§ 785.19
Surface coal mining and reclamation operations on areas or adjacent to areas including alluvial valley floors in the arid and semiarid areas west of the 100th meridian.
(a)
Alluvial valley floor determination.
(1) Permit applicants who propose to conduct surface coal mining and reclamation operations within a valley
holding a stream or in a location where the permit area or adjacent area includes any stream, in the arid and semiarid regions of the United States, as an initial step in the permit process, may request the regulatory authority to make an alluvial valley floor determination with respect to that valley floor. The applicant shall demonstrate and the regulatory authority shall determine, based on either available data or field studies submitted by the applicant, or a combination of available data and field studies, the presence or absence of an alluvial valley floor. Studies shall include sufficiently detailed geologic, hydrologic, land use, soils, and vegetation data and analysis to demonstrate the probable existence of an alluvial valley floor in the area. The regulatory authority may require additional data collection and analysis or other supporting documents, maps, and illustrations in order to make the determination.
(2) The regulatory authority shall make a written determination as to the extent of any alluvial valley floors within the area. The regulatory authority shall determine that an alluvial valley floor exists if it finds that—
(i) Unconsolidated streamlaid deposits holding streams are present; and
(ii) There is sufficient water available to support agricultural activities as evidenced by—
(A) The existence of current flood irrigation in the area in question;
(B) The capability of an area to be flood irrigated, based on evaluations of typical regional agricultural practices, historical flood irrigation, streamflow, water quality, soils, and topography; or
(C) Subirrigation of the lands in question derived from the ground-water system of the valley floor.
