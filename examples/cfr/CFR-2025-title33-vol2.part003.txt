(b)
Definitions.
As used in this section, slow speed means the speed at which a vessel proceeds when it is fully off plane, completely settled in the water and not creating excessive wake. Due to the different speeds at which vessels of different sizes and configurations may travel while in compliance with this definition, no specific speed is assigned to slow speed. A vessel is not proceeding at slow speed if it is:
(1) On plane;
(2) In the process of coming up on or coming off plane; or
(3) Creating an excessive wake.
(c)
Regulations.
Vessels less than 50 meters entering and transiting through the regulated navigation area shall proceed at a slow speed. Nothing in this section alleviates vessels or operators from complying with all state and local laws in the area including manatee slow speed zones. Nor should anything in this section be construed as conflicting with the requirement to operate at safe speed under the Inland Navigation Rules, (33 CFR chapter I, subchapter E).
(d)
Enforcement.
The Coast Guard may be assisted in the patrol and enforcement of the Regulated Navigation Area by other Federal, State, and local agencies.
(e)
Contact information.
If you observe violations of the regulations in this section, you may notify the COTP via the Coast Guard Sector Miami Command Center via VHF channel 16, by phone at 305-535-4472, or by email at

(b)
Definitions.
The following definition applies to this section: designated representative, means any commissioned, warrant, and petty officers of the Coast Guard on board Coast Guard, Coast Guard Auxiliary, and local, state, and Federal law enforcement vessels who have been authorized to act on the behalf of the Captain of the Port (COTP).
(c)
Enforcement.
(1) This regulation will be enforced at all times in Section G and the Wilson Cove section of the safety zone described in paragraph (a) of this section. Mariners must obtain permission in accordance with the procedure described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section before entering either of those sections (paragraphs (a)(7) and (8)).
(2) This regulation will be enforced in Sections A through F of the safety zone described in paragraphs (a)(1) through (6) of this section except when the Coast Guard notifies the public that enforcement of the zone in specified sections is temporarily suspended. Mariners need not obtain permission in accordance with the procedure described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section to enter a zone section in which enforcement is temporarily suspended. At all other times, mariners must obtain permission in accordance with the procedure described in paragraph (d)(2) before entering any of those sections.
(3) The COTP will provide notice of suspended enforcement by means appropriate to effect the widest publicity, including broadcast notice to mariners, publication in the local notice to mariners, and posting the schedule of restricted access periods by date, location and duration at
http://www.scisland.org.
(d)
Regulations.
(1) The general regulations governing safety zones found in 33 CFR 165.23 apply to the safety zone described in paragraph (a) of this section.
(2) Mariners requesting permission to transit through any section of the zone may request authorization to do so from the Fleet Area Control and Surveillance Facility (FACSFAC) San Diego by either calling 619-545-4742 or establishing a VHF bridge to bridge radio connection on Channel 16. Immediately upon completing transit, the vessel operator must promptly notify the FACSFAC of safe passage through the safety zone. Failure to expeditiously notify FACSFAC of passage through the safety zone will result in a determination by the Navy that the vessel is still in the safety zone, thereby restricting the use of the area for naval operations. If the Navy determines that facilitating safe transit through the zone negatively impacts range operations, the Navy will cease this practice and enforce the safety zones in these two areas without exception.
(3) All persons and vessels must comply with the instructions of the U.S. Navy, Coast Guard Captain of the Port or the designated representative.
(4) Upon being hailed by U.S. Navy or U.S. Coast Guard patrol personnel by siren, radio, flashing light, or other means, the operator of a vessel must proceed as directed.
(5) The U.S. Coast Guard may be assisted in the patrol and enforcement of the safety zone described in paragraph (a) of this section by the U.S. Navy and local law enforcement agencies.

(a) The following area is a Regulated Navigation Area (RNA): From 48°02.25′ N, 124°42.1′ W northward along the mainland shoreline of Washington State to Cape Flattery and thence eastward along the mainland shoreline of Washington State to 48°22′ N, 124°34′ W; thence due north to 48°24.55′ N, 124°34′ W; thence northwesterly to 48°27.1′ N, 124°41.7′ W; thence due west to 48°27.1′ N, 124°45.5′ W; thence southwesterly to 48°20.55′ N, 124°51.05′ W, thence west south west to 48°18.0′ N 124°59.0′ W, thence due south to 48°02.25′ N, 124°59.0′ W) thence due east back to the shoreline of Washington at 48°02.25′ N, 124°42.1′ W. Datum: NAD 1983.
(b) During a whale hunt, while the international numeral pennant five (5) is flown by a Makah whale hunt vessel, the following area within the RNA is a Moving Exclusion Zone: The column of water from the surface to the seabed with a radius of 500 yards centered on the Makah whale hunt vessel displaying international numeral pennant five (5). This Moving Exclusionary Zone is activated only when surface visibility exceeds one nautical mile, between sunrise and sunset, and the Makah whale hunt vessel displays the international numeral pennant five (5). The Moving Exclusionary Zone is deactivated upon sunset, visibility is reduced to less than one nautical mile, or when the Makah hunt vessel strikes international numeral pennant five (5).
(c) Unless otherwise authorized by the Commander, Thirteenth Coast Guard District or his or her representative, no person or vessel may enter the active Moving Exclusionary Zone except for:
(1) Authorized Makah whale hunt vessel actively engaged in hunting operations under direction of the master of the Makah vessel flying international numeral pennant five (5), and
(2) A single authorized media pool vessel operating in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section.
(d) The international numeral pennant five (5) is only authorized to be displayed from one Makah whale hunt vessel during actual whale hunt operations. No other vessels may display this pennant within the RNA at any time. Whale hunt operations commence when a whale hunt vessel is underway and its master intends to have a whale killed during the voyage. Whale hunt operations cease once this intent is abandoned, a whale is landed, or when the international numeral pennant five (5) is struck.
(e) The Makah Tribe shall make SECURITE broadcasts beginning one half hour before the commencement of a hunt and every half hour thereafter until hunting activities are concluded. This broadcast shall be made on channel 16 VHF-FM and state:
A whale hunt is proceeding today within the Regulated Navigation Area established for Makah whaling activities. The (name of vessel) is a (color and description of vessel) and will be flying international numeral pennant five (5) while engaged in whaling operations. This pennant is yellow and blue in color. Mariners are required by federal regulation to stay 500 yards away from (name of vessel), and are strongly urged to remain even further away from whale hunt activities as an additional safety measure.
(f)(1) Credentialed members of the media interested in entering the Moving Exclusionary Zone may request permission to operate a single media vessel in the Moving Exclusionary Zone by telephoning Coast Guard Public Affairs, as soon as practicable at (206) 220-7237 during normal working hours, and (206) 220-7001 after hours. Coast Guard preauthorization is required prior to entry into the Moving Exclusionary Zone by a single media pool vessel.
(2) The media pool vessel must be a U.S. documented vessel. The media pool vessel must be under command at all times within the Moving Exclusionary zone by a master holding a license or merchant mariner credential issued in the U.S. to carry passenger for hire. All expenses, liabilities and risks associated with operation of the media pool vessel lie with members of the pool and the pool vessel owners and operators.
(3) The master of the media pool vessel shall maneuver to avoid positioning the pool vessel between whales and hunt vessel(s), out of the line of fire, at a prudent distance and location relative to whale hunt operations, and in a manner that avoids hindering the hunt or path of the whale in any way.
(4) Although permitted to maneuver within the Moving Exclusionary Zone, personnel aboard the media pool vessel are still required to follow safety and law enforcement related instructions of Coast Guard personnel.

§ 167.5
Definitions.
(a)
Area to be avoided
means a routing measure comprising an area within defined limits in which either navigation is particularly hazardous or it is exceptionally important to avoid casualties and which should be avoided by all ships or certain classes of ships.
(b)
Traffic separation scheme
(TSS) means a designated routing measure which is aimed at the separation of opposing streams of traffic by appropriate means and by the establishment of traffic lanes.
(c)
Traffic lane
means an area within defined limits in which one-way traffic is established. Natural obstacles, including those forming separation zones, may constitute a boundary.
(d)
Separation zone or line
means a zone or line separating the traffic lanes in which ships are proceeding in opposite or nearly opposite directions; or separating a traffic lane from the adjacent sea area; or separating traffic lanes designated for particular classes of ships proceeding in the same direction.
(e)
Precautionary area
means a routing measure comprising an area within defined limits where ships must navigate with particular caution and within which the direction of traffic flow may be recommended.
(f)
Deep-water route
means an internationally recognized routing measure primarily intended for use by ships that, because of their draft in relation to the available depth of water in the area concerned, require the use of such a route.
(g)
Two-way route
means a route within defined limits inside which two-way traffic is established, aimed at providing safe passage of ships through waters where navigation is difficult or dangerous.

The operator of a vessel in a TSS shall comply with Rule 10 of the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972, as amended.
§ 167.15
Modification of schemes.
(a) A traffic separation scheme or precautionary area described in this part may be permanently amended in accordance with 46 U.S.C. 70003 (92 Stat. 1473), and with international agreements.
(b) A traffic separation scheme or precautionary area in this part may be temporarily adjusted by the Commandant of the Coast Guard in an emergency, or to accommodate operations which would create an undue hazard for vessels using the scheme or which would contravene Rule 10 of the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972. Adjustment may be in the form of a temporary traffic lane shift, a temporary suspension of a section of the scheme, a temporary precautionary area overlaying a lane, or other appropriate measure. Adjustments will only be made where, in the judgment of the Coast Guard, there is no reasonable alternative means of conducting an operation and navigation safety will not be jeopardized by the adjustment. Notice of adjustments will be made in the appropriate Notice to Mariners and in the
Federal Register.
Requests by members of the public for temporary adjustments to traffic separation schemes must be submitted 150 days prior to the time the adjustment is desired. Such Requests, describing the interference that would otherwise occur to a TSS, should be submitted to the District
Commander of the Coast Guard District in which the TSS is located.

§ 168.01
Purpose.
(a) This part prescribes regulations in accordance with section 4116(c) of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA 90) (Pub. L. 101-380), as amended by section 711 of the Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2010 (Pub. L. 111-281). The regulations will reduce the risk of oil spills from laden, single hull and double hull tankers over 5,000 GT by requiring that these tankers be escorted by at least two suitable escort vessels in applicable waters, as defined in § 168.40. The escort vessels will be immediately available to influence the tankers' speed and course in the event of a steering or propulsion equipment failure, thereby reducing the possibility of groundings or collisions.
(b) The regulations in this part establish minimum escort vessel requirements. Nothing in these regulations should be construed as relieving the master of a tanker from the duty to operate the vessel in a safe and prudent manner, taking into account the navigational constraints of the waterways to be traversed, other vessel traffic, and anticipated weather, tide, and sea conditions, which may require reduced speeds, greater assistance from escort vessels, or other operational precautions.

Two identical hull identification numbers are required to be displayed on each boat hull.
(a) The primary hull identification number must be affixed—
(1) On boats with transoms, to the starboard outboard side of the transom within two inches of the top of the transom, gunwale, or hull/deck joint, whichever is lowest.
(2) On boats without transoms or on boats on which it would be impractical to use the transom, to the starboard outboard side of the hull, aft, within one foot of the stern and within two inches of the top of the hull side, gunwale or hull/deck joint, whichever is lowest.
(3) On catamarans and pontoon boats which have readily replaceable hulls, to the aft crossbeam within one foot of the starboard hull attachment.
(4) If the hull identification number would not be visible, because of rails, fittings, or other accessories, the number must be affixed as near as possible to the location specified in paragraph (a) of this section.
(b) The duplicate hull identification number must be affixed in an unexposed location on the interior of the boat or beneath a fitting or item of hardware.
(c) Each hull identification number must be carved, burned, stamped, embossed, molded, bonded, or otherwise permanently affixed to the boat so that alteration, removal, or replacement would be obvious. If the number is on a separate plate, the plate must be fastened in such a manner that its removal would normally cause some scarring of or damage to the surrounding hull area. A hull identification number must not be attached to parts of the boat that are removable.
(d) The characters of each hull identification number must be no less than one-fourth of an inch high.

§ 183.1
Purpose and applicability.
This part prescribes standards and regulations for boats and associated equipment to which 46 U.S.C. Chapter 43 applies and to which certification requirements in Part 181 of this subchapter apply.
[CGD 85-098, 52 FR 19728, May 27, 1987]
§ 183.3
Definitions.
Beam
means the transverse distance between the outer sides of the boat excluding handles, and other similar fittings, attachments, and extensions.
Boat
means any vessel—
(1) Manufactured or used primarily for noncommercial use;
(2) Leased, rented, or chartered to another for the latter's noncommercial use; or
(3) Operated as an uninspected passenger vessel subject to the requirements of 46 CFR chapter I, subchapter C.
Full transom
means a transom with a maximum width which exceeds one-half the maximum beam of the boat.
Length
means the straight line horizontal measurement of the overall length from the foremost part of the boat to the aftermost part of the boat, measured from end to end over the deck excluding sheer, and measured parallel to the centerline. Bow sprits, bumpkins, rudders, outboard motor brackets, handles, and other similar fittings, attachments, and extensions are not included in the measurement.
Monohull boat
means a boat on which the line of intersection of the water surface and the boat at any operating draft forms a single closed curve. For example, a catamaran, trimaran, or a pontoon boat is not a monohull boat.
Motorwell
means any arrangement of bulkheads or structures that prevents water from entering the passenger carrying area of the boat through any cutout area in the transom for mounting an outboard motor.
Motorwell height
means the vertical distance from the lowest point of water ingress along the top of the motorwell to a line representing a longitudinal extension of the centerline of the boat's bottom surface, excluding keels. This distance is measured as a projection on the centerline plane of the boat. See Figure 183.3.
Permanent appurtenances
means equipment that is mounted or fastened, so that it is not removable without the use of tools. Seats, inboard engines, windshields, helm stations, or hardtops are permanent appurtenances. Outboard motors, controls, batteries, and portable fuel tanks are not permanent appurtenances.
Remote steering
means any mechanical assist device which is rigidly attached to the boat and used in steering the vessel, including but not limited to mechanical, hydraulic, or electrical control systems.
Sailboat
means a boat designed or intended to use sails as the primary means of propulsion.
Sheer
means the topmost line in a boat's side. The sheer intersects the vertical centerline plane of the boat at the forward end and intersects the transom (stern) at the aft end. For the purposes of this definition, the topmost
line in a boat's side is the line defined by a series of points of contact with the boat structure, by straight lines at 45 degree angles to the horizontal and contained in a vertical plane normal to the outside edge of the boat as seen from above and which are brought into contact with the outside of the horizontal boat. A boat is horizontal when it is transversely level and when the lowest points at 40 percent and 75 percent of the boat's length behind the most forward point of the boat are level.
Transom
means the surface at the stern of a boat projecting or facing aft. The upper boundary of the transom is the line defined by a series of points of contact, with the boat structure, by straight lines at 45 degree angles to the horizontal and contained in a vertical longitudinal plane and which are brought into contact with the stern of the horizontal boat. A boat is horizontal when it is transversely level and when the lowest points at 40 percent and 75 percent of the boat's length behind the most forward point of the boat are level.
Transom height
means the vertical distance from the lowest point of water ingress along the top of the transom to a line representing a longitudinal extension of the centerline of the boat's bottom surface, excluding keels. This distance is measured as a projection on the centerline plane of the boat. See Figure 183.3.
Vessel
includes every description of watercraft, other than a seaplane on the water, used or capable of being used as a means of transportation on the water.

# Subpart D—Safe Powering
§ 183.51
Applicability.
This subpart applies to monohull boats less than 20 feet in length, except sailboats, canoes, kayaks, and inflatable boats, that are designed or intended to use one or more outboard motors for propulsion.
§ 183.53
Horsepower capacity.
The maximum horsepower capacity marked on a boat must not exceed the horsepower capacity determined by the
computation method discussed in paragraph (a) of this section, or for certain qualifying boats, the performance test method discussed in paragraph (b) of this section.
(a) The maximum horsepower capacity must be computed as follows:
(1) Compute a factor by multiplying the boat length in feet by the maximum transom width in feet excluding handles and other similar fittings, attachments, and extensions. If the boat does not have a full transom, the transom width is the broadest beam in the aftermost quarter length of the boat.
(2) Locate horsepower capacity corresponding to the factor in Table 183.53.
(3) For a boat with a factor over 52.5, if the horsepower capacity calculated in Table 183.53 is not an exact multiple of 5, it may be raised to the next exact multiple of 5.
(4) For flat bottom hard chine boats with a factor of 52 or less, the horsepower capacity must be reduced by one horsepower capacity increment in Table 183.53.

(b) For boats qualifying under this paragraph, the performance test method described in this paragraph may be used to determine the horsepower capacity.
(1)
Qualifying criteria.
(i) Thirteen feet or less in length;
(ii) Remote wheel steering;
(iii) Transom height
(A) Minimum 19 inch transom height; or,
(B) For boats with at least a 19 inch motorwell height, a minimum 15 inch transom height;
(iv) Maximum persons capacity not over two persons;
(2)
Boat preparation.
(i) The boat must be rigged with equipment recommended or provided by the boat and motor manufacturer and tested with the highest horsepower production powerplant for which the boat is to be rated, not to exceed 40 horsepower.
(ii) Standard equipment must be installed in accordance with manufacturers' instructions.
(iii) The lowest ratio (quickest) steering system offered on the boat model being tested must be installed.
(iv) The outboard motor must be fitted with the manufacturer's recommended propeller providing maximum speed.
(v) Standard permanently installed fuel tanks must be no more than one-half full. Boats without permanent tanks must be tested with one full portable tank.
(vi) Portable tanks must be in their designated location or placed as far aft as possible.
(vii) The outboard motor must be placed in the lowest vertical position on the transom or, if mounting instructions are provided with the boat, at the height recommended.
(viii) Boat bottom, motor and propeller must be in new or almost new condition.

# Note:
The use of the following special equipment should be considered because of the potential for exceeding the capabilities of the boat while performing the test:
Racing Type Personal Flotation Device
Helmet.
(3)
Test conditions.
Testing must be conducted on smooth, calm water with the wind speed below 10 knots. The test must be conducted with no load other
than a driver who must weigh no more than 200 pounds. The motor trim angle must be adjusted to provide maximum full throttle speed short of excessive porpoising or propeller ventilation or “cavitation”, so that there is no loss of directional control.
(4)
Quick turn test procedure.
Set throttle at a low maneuvering speed and steer the boat straight ahead. Turn the steering wheel 180° in the direction of least resistance in
1/2
second or less and hold it at that position without changing the throttle or trim settings during or after the wheel change. The boat completes the maneuver successfully if it is capable of completing a 90° turn without the driver losing control of the boat or reducing the throttle setting. Gradually increase the boat's turn entry speed incrementally until the boat does not complete the Quick Turn Test successfully or successfully completes it at maximum throttle.

# Note:
It is recognized that operator skill and familiarity with a particular boat and motor combination will affect the test results. It is permissible to make a number of practice runs through the quick turn test at any throttle setting.
(5)
Test course method.
Set throttle for 30 miles per hour boat speed and run the test course set up in accordance with Figure 183.53, passing outside the designated avoidance marker for 35 to 37.5 miles per hour without contacting any of the course markers. If the boat successfully completes this run of the test course, increase the throttle setting to 35 to 37.5 miles per hour boat speed and run the course passing outside the designated avoidance marker for that speed without contacting any of the course markers. If the boat successfully completes this run of the test course and the motor was not at full throttle, increase the throttle setting to 37.5 to 42.5 miles per hour boat speed and run the course passing outside the designated avoidance marker for that speed without contacting any of the course markers. If the boat successfully completes this run of the test course and the motor was not at full throttle, increase the throttle setting to 42.5 miles per hour or more and run the course passing outside the designated avoidance marker for that speed without contacting any of the course markers. If the boat successfully completes this run of the test course and the motor was not at full throttle, continue to increase the throttle setting and run the test course passing outside the designated avoidance marker for 42.5 miles per hour or more until the boat fails to complete the test successfully or the boat completes the test course maneuvers successfully at full throttle. The boat successfully completes the test course if the driver is able to maneuver it between the designated avoidance markers without striking the markers and without losing control of the boat or reducing the throttle setting. There must be no change in position of any equipment on board and there must be no change of position of personnel in order to influence the test results. There must be no instability evidenced by oscillating motion in the roll or yaw axes exhibited while negotiating the course.

# Note:
It is recognized that operator skill and familiarity with a particular boat and motor combination will affect the test results. It is therefore considered permissible to make a number of practice runs through the test course at any throttle setting.
(6)
Maximum horsepower capacity.
(i) For boats capable of less than 35 miles per hour, the maximum horsepower capacity must be the maximum horsepower with which the boat was able to successfully complete the Quick Turn Test Procedure in § 183.53(b)(4) at full throttle or the maximum horsepower determined under the calculations in § 183.53(a) of this section.
(ii) For boats capable of 35 miles per hour or more, the maximum horsepower capacity must be the maximum horsepower with which the boat was able to successfully complete both the Quick Turn Test Procedure in § 183.53(b)(4) and the Test Course Method in § 183.53(b)(5) at full throttle or the calculations in § 183.53(a) of this section.
(iii) The maximum horsepower capacity determined in accordance with § 183.53(b) must not exceed 40 horsepower.
