§ 180.1011
Viable spores of the microorganism
Bacillus thuringiensis
Berliner; exemption from the requirement of a tolerance.
(a) For the purposes of this section the microbial insecticide for which exemption from the requirement of a tolerance is being established shall have the following specifications:
(1) The microorganism shall be an authentic strain of
Bacillus thuringiensis
Berliner conforming to the morphological and biochemical characteristics of
Bacillus thuringiensis
as described in Bergey's Manual of Determinative Bacteriology, Eighth Edition.
(2) Spore preparations of
Bacillus thuringiensis
Berliner shall be produced by pure culture fermentation procedures with adequate control measures during production to detect any changes from the characteristics of the parent strain or contamination by other microorganisms.
(3) Each lot of spore preparation, prior to the addition of other materials, shall be tested by subcutaneous injection of at least 1 million spores into each of five laboratory test mice weighing 17 grams to 23 grams. Such test shall show no evidence of infection or injury in the test animals when observed for 7 days following injection.
(4) Spore preparations shall be free of the
Bacillus thuringiensis
β-exotoxin when tested with the fly larvae toxicity test (“Microbial Control of Insects and Mites,” R.P.M. Bond et al., p. 280 ff., 1971). This specification can be satisfied either by determining that each master seed lot brought into production is a
Bacillus thuringiensis
strain which does not produce β-exotoxin under standard manufacturing conditions or by periodically determining that β-exotoxin synthesized during spore production is eliminated by the subsequent spore-harvesting procedure.
(b) Exemption from the requirement of a tolerance is established for residues of the microbial insecticide
Bacillus thuringiensis
Berliner, as specified in paragraph (a) of this section, in or on honey and honeycomb and all other raw agricultural commodities when it is applied either to growing crops, or when it is applied after harvest in accordance with good agricultural practices.

§ 180.1016
Ethylene; exemption from the requirement of a tolerance.
Ethylene is exempted from the requirement of a tolerance for residues when:
(a) For all food commodities, it is used as a plant regulator on plants, seeds, or cuttings and on all food commodities after harvest and when applied in accordance with good agricultural practices.
(b) Injected into the soil to cause premature germination of witchweed in bean (lima and string), cabbage, cantaloupe, collard, corn, cotton, cucumber, eggplant, okra, onion, pasture grass, pea (field and sweet), peanut, pepper, potato, sweet potato, sorghum, soybean, squash, tomato, turnip, and watermelon fields as part of the U.S. Department of Agriculture witchweed control program.
