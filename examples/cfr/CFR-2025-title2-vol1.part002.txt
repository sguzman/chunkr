§ 2424.30
What policies and procedures must I follow?
The HUD policies and procedures that you must follow are the policies and procedures specified in each applicable section of the OMB guidance in subparts A through I of 2 CFR part 180, as that section is supplemented by the section in this part with the same section number. The contracts that are covered transactions, for example, are specified by section 220 of the OMB guidance (i.e., 2 CFR 180.220), as supplemented by section 220 in this part (i.e., § 2424.220). For any section of OMB guidance in subparts A through I of 2 CFR 180 that has no corresponding section in this part, HUD policies and procedures are those in the OMB guidance.

# Subpart A—General
§ 2424.137
Who in HUD may grant an exception to let an excluded person participate in a covered transaction?
The Secretary or designee may grant an exception permitting an excluded person to participate in a particular covered transaction. If the Secretary or a designee grants an exception, the exception must be in writing and state the reason(s) for deviating from the governmentwide policy in Executive Order 12549.

# Subpart B—Covered Transactions
§ 2424.220
What contracts and subcontracts, in addition to those listed in 2 CFR 180.220, are covered transactions?
In addition to the contracts covered under 2 CFR 180.220(b) of the OMB guidance, this part applies to any contract, regardless of tier, that is awarded by a contractor, subcontractor, supplier, consultant, or its agent or representative in any transaction, if the contract is to be funded or provided by HUD under a covered nonprocurement transaction and the amount of the contract is expected to equal or exceed $25,000. This extends the coverage of the HUD nonprocurement suspension and debarment requirements to all lower tiers of subcontracts under covered nonprocurement transactions, as permitted under the OMB guidance at 2 CFR 180.220(c) (see optional lower-tier coverage in the figure in the appendix to 2 CFR part 180).

# Subpart C—Responsibilities of Participants Regarding Transactions
§ 2424.300
What must I do before I enter into a covered transaction with another person at the next lower tier (HUD supplement to governmentwide definition at 2 CFR 180.300)?
(a) You, as a participant, are responsible for determining whether you are entering into a covered transaction with an excluded or disqualified person. You may decide the method by which you do so.
(1) You may, but are not required to, check the Excluded Parties List System (EPLS).
(2) You may, but are not required to, collect a certification from that person.
(b) In the case of an employment contract, HUD does not require employers to check the EPLS prior to making salary payments pursuant to that contract.
§ 2424.332
What methods must I use to pass requirements down to participants at lower tiers with whom I intend to do business?
To communicate the requirements to lower-tier participants, you must include a term or condition in the transaction requiring compliance with subpart C of the OMB guidance in 2 CFR part 180, as supplemented by this subpart.

# Subpart D—Responsibilities of Federal Agency Officials Regarding Transactions
§ 2424.437
What method do I use to communicate to a participant the requirements described in the OMB guidance at 2 CFR 180.435?
To communicate to a participant the requirements described in 2 CFR 180.435 of the OMB guidance, you must include a term or condition in the transaction that requires the participant to: comply with subpart C of 2 CFR part 180, as supplemented by subpart C of this part, and include a similar term or condition in lower-tier covered transactions.
Subparts E-F [Reserved]

# Subpart G—Suspension

# Subpart J—Limited Denial of Participation
§ 2424.1100
What is a limited denial of participation?
A limited denial of participation excludes a specific person from participating in a specific program, or programs, within a HUD field office's geographic jurisdiction, for a specific period of time. A limited denial of participation is normally issued by a HUD field office, but may be issued by a Headquarters office. The decision to impose a limited denial of participation is discretionary and based on the best interests of the federal government.
§ 2424.1105
Who may issue a limited denial of participation?
The Secretary designates HUD officials who are authorized to impose a limited denial of participation, affecting any participant and/or their affiliates, except mortgagees approved by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA).
§ 2424.1110
When may a HUD official issue a limited denial of participation?
(a) An authorized HUD official may issue a limited denial of participation against a person, based upon adequate evidence of any of the following causes:
(1) Approval of an applicant for insurance would constitute an unsatisfactory risk;
(2) There are irregularities in a person's past performance in a HUD program;
(3) The person has failed to maintain the prerequisites of eligibility to participate in a HUD program;
(4) The person has failed to honor contractual obligations or to proceed in accordance with contract specifications or HUD regulations;
(5) The person has failed to satisfy, upon completion, the requirements of an assistance agreement or contract;
(6) The person has deficiencies in ongoing construction projects;
(7) The person has falsely certified in connection with any HUD program, whether or not the certification was made directly to HUD;
(8) The person has committed any act or omission that would be cause for debarment under 2 CFR 180.800;
(9) The person has violated any law, regulation, or procedure relating to the application for financial assistance, insurance, or guarantee, or to the performance of obligations incurred pursuant to a grant of financial assistance or pursuant to a conditional or final commitment to insure or guarantee;
(10) The person has made or procured to be made any false statement for the purpose of influencing in any way an action of the Department; or
(11) Imposition of a limited denial of participation by any other HUD office.
(b) Filing of a criminal Indictment or Information shall constitute adequate
evidence for the purpose of limited denial of participation actions. The Indictment or Information need not be based on offenses against HUD.
(c) Imposition of a limited denial of participation by any other HUD office shall constitute adequate evidence for a concurrent limited denial of participation. Where such a concurrent limited denial of participation is imposed, participation may be restricted on the same basis without the need for an additional conference or further hearing.
(d) An affiliate or organizational element may be included in a limited denial of participation solely on the basis of its affiliation, and regardless of its knowledge of or participation in the acts providing cause for the sanction. The burden of proving that a particular affiliate or organizational element is currently responsible and not controlled by the primary sanctioned party (or by an entity that itself is controlled by the primary sanctioned party) is on the affiliate or organizational element.
§ 2424.1115
When does a limited denial of participation take effect?
A limited denial of participation is effective immediately upon issuance of the notice.
§ 2424.1120
How long may a limited denial of participation last?
A limited denial of participation may remain in effect up to 12 months.
§ 2424.1125
How does a limited denial of participation start?
A limited denial of participation is made effective by providing the person, and any specifically named affiliate, with notice:
(a) That the limited denial of participation is being imposed;
(b) Of the cause(s) under § 2424.1110 for the sanction;
(c) Of the potential effect of the sanction, including the length of the sanction and the HUD program(s) and geographic area affected by the sanction;
(d) Of the right to request, in writing, within 30 days of receipt of the notice, a conference under § 2424.1130; and
(e) Of the right to contest the limited denial of participation under § 2424.1130.
§ 2424.1130
How may I contest my limited denial of participation?
(a) Within 30 days after receiving a notice of limited denial of participation, you may request a conference with the official who issued such notice. The conference shall be held within 15 days after the Department's receipt of the request for a conference, unless you waive this time limit. The official or designee who imposed the sanction shall preside. At the conference, you may appear with a representative and may present all relevant information and materials to the official or designee. Within 20 days after the conference, or within 20 days after any agreed-upon extension of time for submission of additional materials, the official or designee shall, in writing, advise you of the decision to terminate, modify, or affirm the limited denial of participation. If all or a portion of the remaining period of exclusion is affirmed, the notice of affirmation shall advise you of the opportunity to contest the notice and to request a hearing before a Departmental Hearing Officer. You have 30 days after receipt of the notice of affirmation to request this hearing. If the official or designee does not issue a decision within the 20-day period, you may contest the sanction before a Departmental Hearing Officer. Again, you have 30 days from the expiration of the 20-day period to request this hearing. If you request a hearing before the Departmental Hearing Officer, you must submit your request to the Debarment Docket Clerk, Department of Housing and Urban Development, 451 Seventh Street, SW., B-133 Portals 200, Washington DC 20410-0500.
(b) You may skip the conference with the official and you may request a hearing before a Departmental Hearing Officer. This must also be done within 30 days after receiving a notice of limited denial of participation. If you opt to have a hearing before a Departmental Hearing Officer, you must submit your request to the Debarment Docket Clerk, Department of Housing and Urban Development, 451 Seventh Street, SW., B-133 Portals 200, Washington DC 20410-0500. The hearing before the Departmental Hearing Officer
is more formal than the conference before the sanctioning official described above. The Departmental Hearing Officer will conduct the hearing in accordance with 24 CFR part 26, subpart A. The Departmental Hearing Officer will issue findings of fact and make a recommended decision. The sanctioning official will then make a final decision, as promptly as possible, after the Departmental Hearing Officer's recommended decision is issued. The sanctioning official may reject the recommended decision or any findings of fact, only after specifically determining that the decision or any of the facts are arbitrary, capricious, or clearly erroneous.
(c) In deciding whether to terminate, modify, or affirm a limited denial of participation, the Departmental official or designee may consider the factors listed at 2 CFR 180.860. The Departmental Hearing Officer may also consider the factors listed at 2 CFR 180.860 in making any recommended decision.
§ 2424.1135
Do Federal agencies coordinate limited denial of participation actions?
Federal agencies do not coordinate limited denial of participation actions. As stated in § 2424.1100, a limited denial of participation is a HUD-specific action and applies only to HUD activities.
§ 2424.1140
What is the scope of a limited denial of participation?
The scope of a limited denial of participation is as follows:
(a) A limited denial of participation generally extends only to participation in the program under which the cause arose. A limited denial of participation may, at the discretion of the authorized official, extend to other programs, initiatives, or functions within the jurisdiction of an Assistant Secretary. The authorized official, however, may determine that where the sanction is based on an indictment or conviction, the sanction shall apply to all programs throughout HUD.
(b) For purposes of this subpart, participation includes receipt of any benefit or financial assistance through grants or contractual arrangements; benefits or assistance in the form of loan guarantees or insurance; and awards of procurement contracts.
(c) The sanction may be imposed for a period not to exceed 12 months, and shall be effective within the geographic jurisdiction of the office imposing it, unless the sanction is imposed by an Assistant Secretary or Deputy Assistant Secretary, in which case the sanction may be imposed on either a nationwide or a more restricted basis.
§ 2424.1145
May HUD impute the conduct of one person to another in a limited denial of participation?
For purposes of determining a limited denial of participation, HUD may impute conduct as follows:
(a)
Conduct imputed from an individual to an organization.
HUD may impute the fraudulent, criminal, or other improper conduct of any officer, director, shareholder, partner, employee, or other individual associated with an organization, to that organization when the improper conduct occurred in connection with the individual's performance of duties for or on behalf of that organization, or with the organization's knowledge, approval, or acquiescence. The organization's acceptance of the benefits derived from the conduct is evidence of knowledge, approval, or acquiescence.
(b)
Conduct imputed from an organization to an individual or between individuals.
HUD may impute the fraudulent, criminal, or other improper conduct of any organization to an individual, or from one individual to another individual, if the individual to whom the improper conduct is imputed participated in, had knowledge of, or had reason to know of the improper conduct.
(c)
Conduct imputed from one organization to another organization.
HUD may impute the fraudulent, criminal, or other improper conduct of one organization to another organization when the improper conduct occurred in connection with a partnership, joint venture, joint application, association, or similar arrangement, or when the organization to whom the improper conduct is imputed has the power to direct, manage, control, or influence the activities of the organization responsible for the improper conduct. Acceptance
of the benefits derived from the conduct is evidence of knowledge, approval, or acquiescence.
§ 2424.1150
What is the effect of a suspension or debarment on a limited denial of participation?
If you have submitted a request for a hearing pursuant to § 2424.1130 of this subpart, and you also receive, pursuant to subpart G or H of this part, a notice of proposed debarment or suspension that is based on the same transaction(s) or the same conduct as the limited denial of participation, as determined by the debarring or suspending official, the following rules shall apply:
(a) During the 30-day period after you receive a notice of proposed debarment or suspension, during which you may elect to contest the debarment under 2 CFR 180.815, or the suspension pursuant to 2 CFR 180.720, all proceedings in the limited denial of participation, including discovery, are automatically stayed.
(b) If you do not contest the proposed debarment pursuant to 2 CFR 180.815, or the suspension pursuant to 2 CFR 180.720, the final imposition of the debarment or suspension shall also constitute a final decision with respect to the limited denial of participation, to the extent that the debarment or suspension is based on the same transaction(s) or conduct as the limited denial of participation.
(c) If you contest the proposed debarment pursuant to 2 CFR 180.815, or the suspension pursuant to 2 CFR 180.720, then:
(1) Those parts of the limited denial of participation and the debarment or suspension based on the same transaction(s) or conduct, as determined by the debarring or suspending official, shall be immediately consolidated before the debarring or suspending official;
(2) Proceedings under the consolidated portions of the limited denial of participation shall be stayed before the hearing officer until the suspending or debarring official makes a determination as to whether the consolidated matters should be referred to a hearing officer. Such a determination must be made within 90 days of the date of the issuance of the suspension or proposed debarment, unless the suspending/debarring official extends the period for good cause.
(i) If the suspending or debarring official determines that there is a genuine dispute as to material facts regarding the consolidated matter, the entire consolidated matter will be referred to the hearing officer hearing the limited denial of participation, for additional proceedings pursuant to 2 CFR 180.750 or 180.845.
(ii) If the suspending or debarring official determines that there is no dispute as to material facts regarding the consolidated matter, jurisdiction of the hearing officer under 2 CFR part 2424, subpart J, to hear those parts of the limited denial of participation based on the same transaction[s] or conduct as the debarment or suspension, as determined by the debarring or suspending official, will be transferred to the debarring or suspending official, and the hearing officer responsible for hearing the limited denial of participation shall transfer the administrative record to the debarring or suspending official.
(3) The suspending or debarring official shall hear the entire consolidated case under the procedures governing suspensions and debarments, and shall issue a final decision as to both the limited denial of participation and the suspension or debarment.
§ 2424.1155
What is the effect of a limited denial of participation on a suspension or a debarment?
The imposition of a limited denial of participation does not affect the right of the Department to suspend or debar any person under this part.
§ 2424.1160
May a limited denial of participation be terminated before the term of the limited denial of participation expires?
If the cause for the limited denial of participation is resolved before the expiration of the 12-month period, the official who imposed the sanction may terminate it.
§ 2424.1165
How is a limited denial of participation reported?
When a limited denial of participation has been made final, or the period
for requesting a conference pursuant to § 2424.1130 has expired without receipt of such a request, the official imposing the limited denial of participation shall notify the Director of the Compliance Division in the Departmental Enforcement Center of the scope of the limited denial of participation.

§ 2500.100
Adoption of 2 CFR Part 200.
Under the Authority cited above, NSF has formally adopted 2 CFR part 200, Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (“the Uniform Guidance”). The Foundation's implementation document, the NSF Proposal
Award Policies
Procedures Guide, may be found at:
http://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=papp
.
NSF's implementation includes the following deviation from the Uniform Guidance:
Award Cash Management System—NSF is continuing collection of award financial information through the implementation of the Award Cash Management Service (ACM$) and the Program Income Worksheet. ACM$ replaced the NSF Federal Financial Report (FFR) and the NSF FastLane Cash Request process with a single web based user interface. ACM$ is used to collect award level detail financial information at the time of each payment request submitted by the awardee institution. The Program Income Worksheet is used to collect program income financial information from awardee institutions on an annual basis. ACM$ and the Program Income Worksheet utilize approved government-wide data elements from the FFR for the collection of financial information as provided for in the Uniform Guidance paragraph 505(c) and prescribed in 2 CFR 200.327. The requirement for Federal agencies to use the FFR data elements for cash management and financial reporting was publically announced in
Federal Register

(b) Respondent in an NSF suspension or debarment action.
(c) NSF debarment or suspension official.
(d) NSF grants officer, agreements officer, or other official authorized to enter into any type of nonprocurement transaction that is a covered transaction.
§ 2520.30
What policies and procedures must I follow?
The NSF policies and procedures that you must follow are the policies and procedures specified in each applicable section of the OMB guidance in subparts A through I of 2 CFR part 180, as that section is supplemented by the section in this part with the same section number. The contracts that are covered transactions, for example, are specified by section 220 of the OMB guidance (i.e., 2 CFR 180.220) as supplemented by section 220 in this part (i.e., § 2520.220). For any section of OMB guidance in subparts A through I of 2 CFR 180 that has no corresponding section in this part, NSF policies and procedures are those in the OMB guidance.

# Subpart A—General
§ 2520.137
Who in NSF may grant an exception to let an excluded person participate in a covered transaction?
The NSF Director and the Deputy Director have the authority to grant an exception to let an excluded person participate in a covered transaction.

# Subpart B—Covered Transactions
§ 2520.220
What contracts and subcontracts, in addition to those listed in 2 CFR 180.220, are covered transactions?
Although the OMB guidance at 2 CFR 180.220(c) allows a Federal agency to do so (also see optional lower tier coverage in the figure in the appendix to 2 CFR part 180), NSF does not extend coverage of nonprocurement suspension and debarment requirements beyond first-tier procurement contracts under a covered nonprocurement transaction.

# Subpart C—Responsibilities of Participants Regarding Transactions
§ 2520.332
What methods must I use to pass requirements down to participants at lower tiers with whom I intend to do business?
You as a participant must include a term or condition in lower-tier transactions requiring lower-tier participants to comply with subpart C of the OMB guidance in 2 CFR part 180, as supplemented by this subpart.

# Subpart D—Responsibilities of Federal Agency Officials Regarding Transactions
§ 2520.437
What method do I use to communicate to a participant the requirements described in the OMB guidance at 2 CFR 180.435?
To communicate to a participant the requirements described in 2 CFR 180.435 of the OMB guidance, you must include a term or condition in the transaction that requires the participant's compliance with subpart C of 2 CFR part 180, as supplemented by subpart C of this part, and requires the participant to include a similar term or condition in lower-tier covered transactions.

§ 2600.100
Adoption of 2 CFR Part 200.
Under the authority listed above, the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), through its National Historical Publications and Records Commission (NHPRC), adopts the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Guidance in 2 CFR part 200, except regarding indirect costs (see § 2600.101).

What does this part do?
This part adopts the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance in subparts A through I of 2 CFR part 180, as supplemented by this part, as the SBA policies and procedures for nonprocurement debarment and suspension.

What contracts and subcontracts, in addition to those listed in 2 CFR 180.220, are covered transactions?
In addition to the contracts covered under 2 CFR 180.22(b) of the OMB guidance, this part applies to any contract, regardless of tier, that is awarded by a contractor, subcontractor, supplier, consultant, or its agent or representative in any transaction, if the contract is to be funded or provided by the SBA under a covered nonprocurement transaction and the amount of the contract is expected to equal or exceed $25,000. This extends the coverage of the SBA nonprocurement suspension and debarment requirements to all lower tiers of subcontracts under covered nonprocurement transactions, as permitted under the OMB guidance at 2 CFR 180.200(c) (see optional lower tier coverage in the figure in the appendix to 2 CFR part 180)

How may I appeal my suspension?
(a) If the SBA suspending official issues a decision under § 180.755 to continue your suspension after you present information in opposition to that suspension under § 180.720, you may ask for review of the suspending official's decision in two ways:
(1) You may ask the suspending official to reconsider the decision for material errors of fact or law that you believe will change the outcome of the matter; or

However, OHA may reverse the suspending official's decision only where OHA finds that the decision is based on a clear error of material fact or law, or where OHA finds that the suspending official's decision was arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion. You may appeal the suspending official's decision without requesting reconsideration, or you may appeal the decision
of the suspending official on reconsideration. The procedures governing OHA appeals are set forth in 13 CFR part 134.

(2) You may request that the SBA Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA) review the debarring official's decision to debar you within 30 days of your receipt of the debarring official's decision under § 180.870 or paragraph (a)(1) of this section. However, OHA may reverse the debarring official's decision only where OHA finds that the decision is based on a clear error of material fact or law, or where OHA finds that the debarring official's decision was arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion. You may appeal the debarring official's decision without requesting reconsideration, or you may appeal the decision of the debarring official on reconsideration. The procedures governing OHA appeals are set forth in 13 CFR part 134.
(b) A request for review under this section must be in writing; state the specific findings you believe to be in error; and include the reasons or legal bases for your position.

§ 2701.1
Adoption of 2 CFR Part 200.
(a) Under the authority listed above, the U.S. Small Business Administration adopts the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Guidance in 2 CFR part 200, except for 2 CFR 200.74, 200.92, and 200.93. Thus, this part gives regulatory effect to the OMB guidance and supplements the guidance as needed for the Administration.

§ 2701.92
Subaward.
SBA will only permit pass-through entities to make awards to subrecipients where expressly authorized by statute.
§ 2701.93
Subrecipient.
SBA will only permit non-Federal entities to receive subawards where expressly authorized by statute.
§ 2701.112
Conflict of Interest.
The following conflict of interest policies apply to all SBA awards of financial assistance:
(a) Where an employee or contractor of a non-Federal entity providing assistance under an SBA award also provides services in exchange for pay in her or his private capacity, that employee or contractor may not accept as a client for her or his private services any individual or firm she or he assists under an SBA award.
(b) No non-Federal entity providing assistance under an SBA award (nor any subrecipient, employee, or contractor of such an entity) may give preferential treatment to any client referred to it by an organization with which it has a financial, business, or other relationship.
(c) Except where otherwise provided for by law, no non-Federal entity may seek or accept an equity stake in any firm it assists under the auspices of an SBA award. Additionally, no principal, officer, employee, or contractor of such an entity (nor any of their Close or Secondary Relatives as those terms are defined by 13 CFR 108.50) may seek or accept an equity stake or paid position in any firm the entity assists under an SBA award.
§ 2701.414
Indirect (F
A) Costs.
(a) When determining whether a deviation from a negotiated indirect cost rate is justified, SBA will consider the following factors:
(1) The degree to which a non-Federal entity has been able to defray its overhead expenses via those indirect costs it has recovered under other, concurrent SBA awards;
(2) The amount of funding that must be devoted to conducting program activities in order for a project to result in meaningful outcomes; and
(3) The amount of project funds that will remain available for conducting program activities after a negotiated rate is applied.
(b) After conducting the analysis required in paragraph (a) above, the head of each SBA grant program office will determine in writing whether there is sufficient justification to deviate from a negotiated indirect cost rate.
(c) Where SBA determines that deviation from a negotiated rate is justified, it will provide a copy of that determination to OMB and will inform potential applicants of the deviation in the corresponding funding announcement.
§ 2701.503
Relation to other audit requirements.
Non-Federal entities that are not subject to the requirements of the Single Audit Act and that are performing projects under SBA awards will be required to submit copies of their audited financial statements for their most recently completed fiscal year. Costs associated with the auditing of a non-Federal entity's financial statements may be included in its negotiations for an indirect cost rate agreement in accordance with 2 CFR 200.425.
§ 2701.513
Responsibilities.
For SBA, the Single Audit Senior Accountable Official is the Deputy Chief Operating Officer. The Single Audit Liaison is the Director, Office of Grants Management.

(2)
Informal resolution.

Statement of issues.
The request for a hearing shall be accompanied by a copy of the final determination, if issued, and shall specifically state those portions of the final determination upon which review is requested.
Those portions of the final determination not specified for review shall be considered resolved and not subject to further review.
(iii)
Failure to request review.
When no timely request for a hearing is made, the final determination shall constitute final action by the Secretary of Labor and shall not be subject to further review.
(2)
Conduct of hearings.
The grantor agency shall establish procedures for the conduct of hearings by the head of the grantor agency, or his/her designee.
(3)
Decision of the head of the grantor agency, or his/her designee.

(3)
Decision of the administrative law judge.

(4)
Filing exceptions to decision.
The decision of the administrative law judge shall constitute final action by the Secretary of Labor, unless, within 21 days after receipt of the decision of the administrative law judge, a party dissatisfied with the decision or any part thereof has filed exceptions with the Secretary, specifically identifying the procedure or finding of fact, law, or policy with which exception is taken. Any exceptions not specifically urged shall be deemed to have been waived. Thereafter, the decision of the administrative law judge shall become the decision of the Secretary, unless the Secretary, within 30 days of such filing, has notified the parties that the case has been accepted for review.
(5)
Review by the Secretary of Labor.
Any case accepted for review by the Secretary shall be decided within 180 days of such acceptance. If not so decided, the decision of the administrative law judge shall become the final decision of the Secretary.

Thus, this part gives regulatory effect to the OMB guidance and supplements the guidance as needed for IMLS.

# Subpart A—Scope, Definitions, and Eligibility
§ 3187.2
Applicable regulations and scope of this part.
(a) Except as set forth in this 2 CFR part 3187, the Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards set forth in 2 CFR part 200 shall apply to awards from funds appropriated to the Institute of Museum and Library Services (the “Institute” or “IMLS”).

(1) Owns or uses tangible objects, either animate or inanimate;
(2) Cares for these objects; and
(3) Exhibits them to the general public on a regular basis.
(i) An institution that exhibits objects to the general public for at least 120 days a year shall be deemed to meet this requirement.
(ii) An institution that exhibits objects by appointment may meet this requirement if it can establish, in light of the facts under all the relevant circumstances, that this method of exhibition does not unreasonably restrict the accessibility of the institution's exhibits to the general public.
(b) The term “museum” in paragraph (a) of this section includes museums that have tangible and digital collections. Museums include, but are not limited to, the following types of institutions, if they otherwise satisfy the provisions of this section:
(1) Aquariums;
(2) Arboretums;
(3) Botanical gardens;
(4) Art museums;
(5) Children's museums;

(13) Specialized museums; and
(14) Zoological parks.
(c) For the purposes of this section, an institution uses a professional staff if it employs at least one staff member, or the fulltime equivalent, whether paid or unpaid primarily engaged in the acquisition, care, or exhibition to the public of objects owned or used by the institution.
(d)(1) Except as set forth in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, an institution exhibits objects to the general public for the purposes of this section if such exhibition is a primary purpose of the institution.
(2) An institution that does not have as a primary purpose the exhibition of objects to the general public but which can demonstrate that it exhibits objects to the general public on a regular basis as a significant, separate, distinct, and continuing portion of its activities, and that it otherwise meets the requirements of this section, may be determined to be a museum under this section. In order to establish its eligibility, such an institution must provide information regarding the following:
(i) The number of staff members devoted to museum functions as described in paragraph (a) of this section.

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1221e-3, 3474, and 2 CFR part 200)
§ 3474.15
Contracting with faith-based organizations and nondiscrimination.
(a) This section establishes responsibilities that grantees and subgrantees have in selecting contractors to provide direct Federal services under a program of the Department. Grantees and subgrantees must ensure compliance by their subgrantees with the provisions of this section and any implementing regulations or guidance.
(b)(1) A faith-based organization is eligible to contract with grantees and subgrantees, including States, on the same basis as any other private organization.
(2)(i) In selecting providers of goods and services, grantees and subgrantees, including States—
(A) May not discriminate for or against a private organization on the basis of the organization's religious character, motives, or affiliation, or lack thereof, or on the basis of conduct that would not be considered grounds to favor or disfavor a similarly situated secular organization; and
(B) Must ensure that the award of contracts is free from political interference, or even the appearance of such interference, and is done on the basis of merit, not on the basis of religion or religious belief, or lack thereof.
(ii) Notices or announcements of award opportunities and notices of
award or contracts must include language substantially similar to that in appendices A and B, respectively, to 34 CFR part 75.
(3) No grant document, agreement, covenant, memorandum of understanding, policy, or regulation that is used by a grantee or subgrantee in administering Federal financial services from the Department may require faith-based organizations to provide assurances or notices if they are not required of non-faith-based organizations. Any restrictions on the use of grant funds must apply equally to faith-based and non-faith-based organizations. All organizations that participate in Department programs or services, including organizations with religious character, motives, or affiliation, must carry out eligible activities in accordance with all program requirements, including those prohibiting the use of direct Federal financial assistance to engage in explicitly religious activities, subject to any accommodations that are granted to organizations on a case-by-case basis in accordance with the Constitution and laws of the United States, including Federal civil rights laws.
(4) No grant document, agreement, covenant, memorandum of understanding, policy, or regulation that is used by a grantee or subgrantee may disqualify faith-based organizations from participating in Department-funded programs or services on the basis of the organization's religious character, motives, or affiliation, or lack thereof, or on the basis of conduct that would not be considered grounds to disqualify a similarly situated secular organization.
(5) Nothing in this section may be construed to preclude the Department from making an accommodation with respect to one or more program requirements on a case-by-case basis in accordance with the Constitution and laws of the United States, including Federal civil rights laws.
(6) Neither a State nor the Department may disqualify an organization from participating in any Department program for which it is otherwise eligible on the basis of the organization's indication that it may request an accommodation with respect to one or more program requirements, unless the organization has made clear that the accommodation is necessary to its participation and the Department has determined that it would deny the accommodation.
(c)(1) The provisions of 34 CFR 75.532 and 76.532 that apply to a faith-based organization that is a grantee or subgrantee also apply to a faith-based organization that contracts with a grantee or subgrantee, including a State.
(2) The requirements referenced under paragraph (c)(1) of this section do not apply to a faith-based organization that provides goods or services to a beneficiary under a program supported only by indirect Federal financial assistance, as defined in 34 CFR 75.52(c)(3) and 76.52(c)(3).
(d)(1) A private organization that provides direct Federal services under a program of the Department and engages in explicitly religious activities, such as worship, religious instruction, or proselytization, must offer those activities separately in time or location from any programs or services funded by the Department through a contract with a grantee or subgrantee, including a State. Attendance or participation in any such explicitly religious activities by beneficiaries of the programs and services supported by the contract must be voluntary.
(2) The limitations on explicitly religious activities under paragraph (d)(1) of this section do not apply to a faith-based organization that provides services to a beneficiary under a program supported only by indirect Federal financial assistance, as defined in 34 CFR 75.52(c)(3) and 76.52(c)(3).
(e)(1) A faith-based organization that contracts with a grantee or subgrantee, including a State, will retain its independence, autonomy, right of expression, religious character, and authority over its governance. A faith-based organization that receives Federal financial assistance from the Department does not lose the protections of law.
(2) A faith-based organization that contracts with a grantee or subgrantee, including a State, may, among other things—
(i) Retain religious terms in its name;
(ii) Continue to carry out its mission, including the definition, development, practice, and expression of its religious beliefs;
(iii) Use its facilities to provide services without concealing, removing, or altering religious art, icons, scriptures, or other symbols from these facilities;
(iv) Select its board members on the basis of their acceptance of or adherence to the religious tenets of the organization; and
(v) Include religious references in its mission statement and other chartering or governing documents.
(f) A private organization that contracts with a grantee or subgrantee, including a State, may not discriminate against a beneficiary or prospective beneficiary in the provision of program goods or services, or in outreach activities related to such goods or services, on the basis of religion or religious belief, a refusal to hold a religious belief, or a refusal to attend or participate in a religious practice. However, an organization that participates in a program funded by indirect Federal financial assistance need not modify its program activities to accommodate a beneficiary who chooses to expend the indirect aid on the organization's program.
(g) A religious organization's exemption from the Federal prohibition on employment discrimination on the basis of religion, in section 702(a) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. 2000e-1(a), is not forfeited when the organization contracts with a grantee or subgrantee.
(h) No grantee or subgrantee receiving funds under any Department program or service shall construe these provisions in such a way as to advantage or disadvantage faith-based organizations affiliated with historic or well-established religions or sects in comparison with other religions or sects.

(ii) Machine-readable code for digital resources;
(iii) Readily accessed legal terms; and

(vii) A grantee or subgrantee that has received an exception from the Secretary under 2 CFR 3474.5 and 2 CFR 200.102 (
e.g.,
where the Secretary has determined that the grantee's dissemination plan would likely achieve meaningful dissemination equivalent to or greater than the dissemination likely to be achieved through compliance with paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, or compliance with paragraph (a) or (b) of this section would impede the grantee's ability to form the required partnerships necessary to carry out the purpose of the grant); and
(viii) Grantees or subgrantees for which compliance with these requirements would conflict with, or materially undermine the ability to protect or enforce, other intellectual property rights or obligations of the grantee or subgrantee, in existence or under development, including those provided under 15 U.S.C. 1051,
et seq.,
18 U.S.C. 1831-1839, and 35 U.S.C. 200,
et seq.

et seq.,
or State law.
(e) The license set out in paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall not extend to any copyrightable work incorporated in the grant deliverable that is owned by a party other than the grantee or subgrantee, unless the grantee or subgrantee has acquired the right to provide such a license in that work.

§ 3485.12
What does this part do?
(a)(1) The Department of Education (the “Department” or “ED”) adopts subparts A through I of the Office of Management and Budget guidance in 2 CFR part 180. Thus, this part gives regulatory effect to the OMB guidance and supplements the guidance as needed for the Department. This part satisfies the requirements in section 3 of Executive Order 12549, “Debarment and Suspension” (3 CFR part 1986 Comp., p. 189), Executive Order 12689, “Debarment and Suspension” (3 CFR part 1989 Comp., p. 235) and 31 U.S.C. 6101 note (Section 2455, Pub. L. 103-355, 108 Stat. 3327).
(2) The table of contents for this part contains only those sections in part 3485 that include supplements to the guidance in part 180 and new sections needed to implement the guidance for the Department's programs. In those sections of the OMB guidance that are supplemented, the section in part 3485 includes both the text of the OMB guidance that is not affected by the change and any additional paragraphs that need to be added to the OMB guidance. For example, § 180.220 of this title contains only paragraphs (a) and (b). The text of § 3485.220, which supplements § 180.220 to extend lower-tier transactions to certain transactions below the primary tier, includes both the text of paragraph (a) and (b) of § 180.220 and the text of added paragraph (c).
(3) In those sections in part 180 that do not have paragraph designations and that the Department supplements, the section in this part implementing the OMB guidance designates the undesignated paragraph from part 180 as paragraph (a) and the first supplemental paragraph as paragraph (b). For example, 2 CFR 180.330 includes an undesignated lead in paragraph and two subparagraphs designated (a) and (b). In § 3485.330, the undesignated paragraph in 2 CFR 180.330 is designated paragraph (a) and the two subparagraphs are designated paragraphs (1) and (2). The added paragraphs are designated paragraph (b) and (c).
(b) The authority for all the provisions in 2 CFR part 180 as adopted in this part is listed as follows.

# Authority:
E.O. 12549 (3 CFR 1986 Comp., p. 189); E.O. 12689 (3 CFR 1989 Comp., p. 235); sec. 2455, Pub. L. 103-355, 108 Stat. 3327 (31 U.S.C. 6101 note); 20 U.S.C. 1082, 1094, 1221e-3, and 3474.

§ 3485.22
Does this part apply to me?
This part applies to you if you are—
(a) A participant or principal in a “covered transaction” (see subpart B of this part and the definition of “nonprocurement transaction” in § 180.970 of this title).
(b) A respondent in a suspension or debarment action of the Department.
(c) An ED deciding official; or
(d) An ED officer authorized to enter into any type of nonprocurement transaction that is a covered transaction.
(Authority: E.O. 12549 (3 CFR 1986 Comp., p. 189); E.O. 12689 (3 CFR 1989 Comp., p. 235); sec. 2455, Pub. L. 103-355, 108 Stat. 3327 (31 U.S.C. 6101 note); 20 U.S.C. 1082, 1094, 1221e-3, and 3474)
§ 3485.32
What policies and procedures must I follow?
The Department's policies and procedures that you must follow are the policies and procedures specified in this part and in Subparts A through I of 2 CFR part 180. The contracts that are covered transactions, for example, are specified in § 3485.220. Section 180.205 of this title does not require supplementation, so it is not included in the table of contents for this part and is not separately stated in this part.
(Authority: E.O. 12549 (3 CFR 1986 Comp., p. 189); E.O. 12689 (3 CFR 1989 Comp., p. 235); sec. 2455, Pub. L. 103-355, 108 Stat. 3327 (31 U.S.C. 6101 note); 20 U.S.C. 1082, 1094, 1221e-3, and 3474)

# Subpart A—General
§ 3485.137
May the Department grant an exception to let an excluded person participate in a covered transaction?
(a) Yes, the Secretary delegates to the ED Deciding Official the authority under this section to grant an exception permitting an excluded person to participate in a particular covered transaction.
(b) If the ED Deciding Official grants an exception, the exception must be in writing and state the reason(s) for deviating from the Governmentwide policy in Executive Order 12549.

# Subpart B—Covered Transactions
§ 3485.220
Are any procurement contracts included as covered transactions?
(a) Covered transactions under this part—
(1) Do not include any procurement contracts awarded directly by a Federal agency; but
(2) Do include some procurement contracts awarded by non-Federal participants in nonprocurement covered transactions.
(b) Specifically, a contract for goods or services is a covered transaction if any of the following applies:
(1) The contract is awarded by a participant in a nonprocurement transaction that is covered under § 180.210 of this title, and the amount of the contract is expected to equal or exceed $25,000.
(2) The contract requires the consent of an official of a Federal agency. In that case, the contract, regardless of the amount, always is a covered transaction, and it does not matter who awarded it. For example, it could be a subcontract awarded by a contractor at a tier below a nonprocurement transaction, as shown in the Appendix to Part 3485—Covered Transactions.
(3) The contract is for Federally-required audit services.
(4) The contract is to perform services as a third party servicer in connection with a title IV, HEA program.
(c) In addition to the contracts covered under 2 CFR 180.220(b) of the OMB guidance, this part applies to any contract, regardless of tier, that is awarded by a contractor, subcontractor, supplier, consultant, or its agent or representative in any transaction, if the contract is to be funded or provided by ED under a covered nonprocurement transaction and the amount of the contract is expected to equal or exceed $25,000. This extends the coverage of the ED nonprocurement suspension and
debarment requirements to all lower tiers of subcontracts under covered nonprocurement transactions, as permitted under the OMB guidance at 2 CFR 180.220(c) (see optional lower tier coverage in the figure in Appendix A to Part 3485—Covered Transactions).

# Subpart C—Responsibilities of Participants Regarding Transactions
§ 3485.310
What must I do if a Federal agency excludes a person with whom I am already doing business in a covered transaction?
(a) You as a participant may continue covered transactions with an excluded person if the transactions were in existence when the agency excluded the person. However, you are not required to continue the transactions, and you may consider termination. You should make a decision about whether to terminate and the type of termination action, if any, only after a thorough review to ensure that the action is proper and appropriate.
(b) You may not renew or extend covered transactions (other than no-cost time extensions) with any excluded person, unless another Federal agency responsible for the transaction grants an exception under § 180.135 of this title or ED grants an exception under § 3485.137.
(c) If you are a title IV, HEA participant, you may not continue a title IV, HEA transaction with an excluded person after the effective date of the exclusion unless permitted by 34 CFR 668.26, 682.702, or 668.94, as applicable.
(Authority: E.O. 12549 (3 CFR 1986 Comp., p. 189); E.O. 12689 (3 CFR 1989 Comp., p. 235); sec. 2455, Pub. L. 103-355, 108 Stat. 3327 (31 U.S.C. 6101 note); 20 U.S.C. 1082, 1094, 1221e-3, and 3474)
§ 3485.315
May I use the services of an excluded person as a principal under a covered transaction?
(a) You as a participant may continue to use the services of an excluded person as a principal under a covered transaction if you were using the services of that person in the transaction before the person was excluded. However, you are not required to continue using that person's services as a principal. You should make a decision about whether to discontinue that person's services only after a thorough review to ensure that the action is proper and appropriate.
(b) You may not begin to use the services of an excluded person as a principal under a covered transaction unless another Federal agency responsible for the transaction grants an exception under § 180.135 of this title or, if ED took the action, an ED deciding official grants an exception under § 3485.137.
(c) If you are a title IV, HEA participant—
(1) You may not renew or extend the term of any contract or agreement for the services of an excluded person as a principal with respect to a title IV, HEA transaction; and
(2) You may not continue to use the services of that excluded person as a principal under this kind of an agreement or arrangement more than 90 days after you learn of the exclusion or after the close of the Federal fiscal year in which the exclusion takes effect, whichever is later.

§ 3485.330
What methods must I use to pass requirements down to participants at lower tiers with whom I intend to do business?
(a) Before entering into a covered transaction with a participant at the next lower tier, you must require that participant to—
(1) Comply with this subpart as a condition of participation in the transaction. You must do so using the method specified in paragraph (b) of this section; and
(2) Pass the requirement to comply with this subpart to each person with whom the participant enters into a covered transaction at the next lower tier.
(b) To communicate the requirements in this part to a participant, you must include a term or condition in the transaction that requires the participant's compliance with part 180, subpart C, of this title, as adopted at § 3485.12, and requires the participant to include a similar term or condition in lower-tier covered transactions.
(c) The failure of a participant to include a requirement to comply with Subpart C of 2 CFR part 180 in the agreement with a lower tier participant does not affect the lower tier participant's responsibilities under this part.
(Authority: E.O. 12549 (3 CFR 1986 Comp., p. 189); E.O. 12689 (3 CFR 1989 Comp., p. 235); sec. 2455, Pub. L. 103-355, 108 Stat. 3327 (31 U.S.C. 6101 note); 20 U.S.C. 1082, 1094, 1221e-3, and 3474)

# Subpart D—Responsibilities of the Department's Officials Regarding Transactions
§ 3485.415
What must I do if a Federal agency excludes the participant or a principal after I enter into a covered transaction?
(a) You as a Federal agency official may continue covered transactions with an excluded person, or under which an excluded person is a principal, if the transactions were in existence when the person was excluded. You are not required to continue the transactions, however, and you may consider termination. You should make a decision about whether to terminate and the type of termination action, if any, only after a thorough review to ensure that the action is proper.
(b) You may not renew or extend covered transactions (other than no-cost time extensions) with any excluded person, or under which an excluded person is a principal, unless you obtain an exception under § 3485.137.
(c)
Title IV, HEA transactions.
If you are a title IV, HEA participant—
(1) You may not renew or extend the term of any contract or agreement for the services of an excluded person as a principal with respect to a title IV, HEA transaction; and
(2) You may not continue to use the services of that excluded person as a principal under this kind of an agreement or arrangement more than 90 days after you learn of the exclusion or after the close of the Federal fiscal year in which the exclusion takes effect, whichever is later.

§ 3485.437
What method do I use to communicate to a participant the requirements described in § 180.435 of this title?
To communicate the requirements in this part to a participant, you must include a term or condition in the transaction that requires the participant's compliance with part 180, subpart C, of this title, as adopted at § 3485.12 and requires the participant to include a similar term or condition in lower-tier covered transactions.

# Subpart F—General Principles Relating to Suspension and Debarment Actions
§ 3485.611
What procedures do we use for a suspension or debarment action involving a title IV, HEA transaction?
(a) If we suspend a title IV, HEA participant under Executive Order 12549, we use the following procedures to ensure that the suspension prevents participation in title IV, HEA transactions:
(1) The notification procedures in § 180.715 of this title.
(2) Instead of the procedures in §§ 180.720 through 180.760 of this title, the procedures in 34 CFR part 668, subpart G, or 34 CFR part 682, subpart D or G, as applicable.
(3) In addition to the findings and conclusions required by 34 CFR part 668, subpart G, or 34 CFR part 682, subpart D or G, the suspending official, and, on appeal, the Secretary determines whether there is sufficient cause
for suspension as explained in § 180.700 of this title.
(b) If we debar a title IV, HEA participant under E.O. 12549, we use the following procedures to ensure that the debarment also precludes participation in title IV, HEA transactions:
(1) The notification procedures in §§ 180.805 and 180.870 of this title.
(2) Instead of the procedures in §§ 180.810 through 180.885 of this title, the procedures in 34 CFR part 668, subpart G, or 34 CFR part 682, subpart D or G, as applicable.
(3) On appeal from a decision debarring a title IV, HEA participant, we issue a final decision after we receive any written materials from the parties.
(4) In addition to the findings and conclusions required by 34 CFR part 668, subpart G, or 34 CFR part 682, subpart D or G, the debarring official, and, on appeal, the Secretary determines whether there is sufficient cause for debarment as explained in § 180.800 of this title.
(Authority: E.O. 12549 (3 CFR 1986 Comp., p. 189); E.O. 12689 (3 CFR 1989 Comp., p. 235); sec. 2455, Pub. L. 103-355, 108 Stat. 3327 (31 U.S.C. 6101 note); 20 U.S.C. 1082, 1094, 1221e-3, and 3474)
§ 3485.612
When does an exclusion by another agency affect the ability of the excluded person to participate in a title IV, HEA transaction?
(a) If a title IV, HEA participant is debarred by another agency under E.O. 12549, using procedures described in paragraph (d) of this section, that party is not eligible to enter into title IV, HEA transactions for the duration of the debarment.
(b)(1) If a title IV, HEA participant is suspended by another agency under E.O. 12549 or under a proposed debarment under the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) (48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.4), using procedures described in paragraph (d) of this section, that party is not eligible to enter into title IV, HEA transactions for the duration of the suspension.
(2)(i) The suspension of title IV, HEA eligibility as a result of suspension by another agency lasts for at least 60 days.
(ii) If the excluded party does not object to the suspension, the 60-day period begins on the 35th day after that agency issues the notice of suspension.
(iii) If the excluded party objects to the suspension, the 60-day period begins on the date of the decision of the suspending official.
(3) The suspension of title IV, HEA eligibility does not end on the 60th day if—
(i) The excluded party agrees to an extension; or
(ii) Before the 60th day we begin a limitation or termination proceeding against the excluded party under 34 CFR part 668, subpart G, or part 682, subpart D or G.
(c)(1) If a title IV, HEA participant is debarred or suspended by another Federal agency—
(i) We notify the participant whether the debarment or suspension prohibits participation in title IV, HEA transactions; and
(ii) If participation is prohibited, we state the effective date and duration of the prohibition.
(2) If a debarment or suspension by another agency prohibits participation in title IV, HEA transactions, that prohibition takes effect 20 days after we mail notice of our action.
(3) If the Department or another Federal agency suspends a title IV, HEA participant, we determine whether grounds exist for an emergency action against the participant under 34 CFR part 668, subpart G, or part 682, subpart D or G, as applicable.
(4) We use the procedures in § 3485.611 to exclude a title IV, HEA participant excluded by another Federal agency using procedures that did not meet the standards in paragraph (d) of this section.
(d) If a title IV, HEA participant is excluded by another agency, we debar, terminate, or suspend the participant—as provided under this part, 34 CFR part 668, or 34 CFR part 682, as applicable—if that agency followed procedures that gave the excluded party—
(1) Notice of the proposed action;
(2) An opportunity to submit and have considered evidence and argument to oppose the proposed action;
(3) An opportunity to present its objection at a hearing—
(i) At which the agency has the burden of persuasion by a preponderance
of the evidence that there is cause for the exclusion; and
(ii) Conducted by an impartial person who does not also exercise prosecutorial or investigative responsibilities with respect to the exclusion action;
(4) An opportunity to present witness testimony, unless the hearing official finds that there is no genuine dispute about a material fact;
(5) An opportunity to have agency witnesses with personal knowledge of material facts in genuine dispute testify about those facts, if the hearing official determines their testimony to be needed, in light of other available evidence and witnesses; and
(6) A written decision stating findings of fact and conclusions of law on which the decision is rendered.

# Subpart G—Suspension
§ 3485.711
When does a suspension affect title IV, HEA transactions?
(a) A suspension under § 3485.611(a) takes effect immediately if the Secretary takes an emergency action under 34 CFR part 668, subpart G, or 34 CFR part 682, subpart D or G, at the same time the Secretary issues the suspension.

§ 3513.10
What does this part do?
This part adopts the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance in subparts A through I of 2 CFR part 180, as supplemented by this part, as the Export Import Bank of the United States (Ex-Im Bank) policies and procedures for nonprocurement debarment and suspension. It thereby gives regulatory effect for Ex-Im Bank to the OMB guidance as supplemented by this part. This part satisfies the requirements in section 3 of Executive Order 12549, “Debarment and Suspension” (3 CFR 1986 Comp., p. 189), Executive Order 12689, “Debarment and Suspension” (3 CFR 1989 Comp., p. 235) and 31 U.S.C. 6101 note (Section 2455, Pub. L. 103-355, 108 Stat. 3327).
§ 3513.20
Does this part apply to me?
This part and, through this part, pertinent portions of the OMB guidance in subparts A through I of 2 CFR part 180 (see table at 2 CFR 180.100(b)) apply to you if you are a—
(a) Participant or principal in a “covered transaction” (see subpart B of 2 CFR part 180 and the definition of “nonprocurement transaction” at 2 CFR 180.970, as supplemented by subpart B of this part).
(b) Respondent in an Ex-Im Bank suspension or debarment action.
(c) Ex-Im Bank debarment or suspension official;
(d) Ex-Im Bank grants officer, agreements officer, or other official authorized to enter into any type of nonprocurement transaction that is a covered transaction;
§ 3513.30
What policies and procedures must I follow?
Ex-Im Bank policies and procedures that you must follow are the policies and procedures specified in each applicable section of the OMB guidance in subparts A through I of 2 CFR part 180, as that section is supplemented by the section in this part with the same section number. The contracts that are covered transactions, for example, are specified by section 220 of the OMB guidance (i.e., 2 CFR 180.220) as supplemented by section 220 in this pat (i.e., § 3513.220). For any section of OMB guidance in subparts A through I of 2 CFR 180 that has no corresponding section in this part, Ex-Im Bank policies and procedures are those in the OMB guidance.

# Subpart A—General
§ 3513.137
Who in Ex-Im Bank may grant an exception to let an excluded person participate in a covered transaction?
(a) The Ex-Im Bank agency head or designee may grant an exception permitting an excluded person to participate in a particular covered transacting. If the Ex-Im Bank agency head or designee grants an exception,
the exception must be in writing and state the reason(s) for deviating from the government wide policy in Executive Order 12549.
(b) An exception granted by one agency for an excluded person does not extend to the covered transactions of another agency.

# Subpart B—Covered Transactions
§ 3513.220
What contracts and subcontracts, in addition to those listed in 2 CFR 180.220, are covered transactions?
Although the OMB guidance at 2 CFR 180.220(c) allows a Federal agency to do so (also see optional lower tier coverage in the figure in the appendix to 2 CFR part 180), Ex-Im Bank does not extend coverage of nonprocurement suspension and debarment requirements beyond first-tier procurement under a covered nonprocurement transaction.

# Subpart C—Responsibilities of Participants Regarding Transactions
§ 3513.332
What methods must I use to pass requirements down to participants at lower tiers with whom I intend to do business?
To communicate the requirements, you must include a term or condition in the transaction requiring the participants' compliance with subpart C of this part and requiring them to include a similar term or condition in lower-tiered covered transactions.

# Subpart D—Responsibilities of Federal Agency Officials Regarding Transactions
§ 3513.437
What method do I use to communicate to a participant the requirements described in the OMB guidance at 2 CFR 180.435?
To communicate to a participant the requirements described in 2 CFR 180.435 of the OMB guidance, you must include a term or condition in the transaction that requires the participant's compliance with subpart C of 2 CFR part 180, as supplemented by subpart C of this part, and requires the participant to include a similar term or condition in lower-tier covered transactions.

§ 3700.10
What does this part do?
This part adopts the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance in subparts A through I of 2 CFR part 180, as supplemented by this part, as the Peace Corps policies and procedures for nonprocurement debarment and suspension. It thereby gives regulatory effect for the Peace Corps to the OMB guidance as supplemented by this part. This part satisfies the requirements in section 3 of Executive Order 12549, “Debarment and Suspension” (3 CFR 1986 Comp., p. 189), Executive Order 12689, “Debarment and Suspension” (3 CFR 1989 Comp., p. 235) and 31 U.S.C. 6101 note (Section 2455, Pub. L. 103-355, 108 Stat. 3327).
§ 3700.20
Does this part apply to me?
This part and, through this part, pertinent portions of the OMB guidance in subparts A through I of 2 CFR part (see table at 2 CFR 180.100(b)) apply to you if you are a—
(a) Participant or principal in a “covered transaction” (see subpart B of 2 CFR part 180 and the definition of “nonprocurement transaction” at 2 CFR 180.970);
(b) Respondent in a Peace Corps suspension or debarment action;
(c) Peace Corps debarment or suspension official; or
(d) Peace Corps grants officer, agreements officer, or other official authorized to enter into any type of nonprocurement transaction that is a covered transaction.
§ 3700.30
What policies and procedures must I follow?
The Peace Corps policies and procedures that you must follow are the policies and procedures specified in each applicable section of the OMB guidance in subparts A through I of 2 CFR part 180, as that section is supplemented by the section in this part with the same section number. The contracts that are covered transactions, for example, are specified by section 220 of the OMB guidance (i.e., 2 CFR 180.220) as supplemented by section 220 in this part (i.e., § 3700.220). For any section of OMB guidance in subparts A through I of 2 CFR 180 that has no corresponding section in this part, Peace Corps policies and procedures are those in the OMB guidance.
§ 3700.137
Who in the Peace Corps may grant an exception to let an excluded person participate in a covered transaction?
The Director of the Peace Corps has the authority to grant an exception to let an excluded person participate in a covered transaction, as provided in the OMB guidance at 2 CFR 180.135.
§ 3700.220
What contracts and subcontracts, in addition to those listed in 2 CFR 180.220, are covered transactions?
Although the OMB guidance at 2 CFR 180.220(c) allows a Federal agency to do so (also see optional lower tier coverage in the figure in the appendix to 2 CFR part 180), Peace Corps does not extend coverage of nonprocurement suspension and debarment requirements beyond first-tier procurement contracts under a covered nonprocurement transaction.
§ 3700.332
What methods must I use to pass requirements down to participants at lower tiers with whom I intend to do business?
You as a participant must include a term or condition in lower-tier transactions requiring lower-tier participants to comply with subpart C of the OMB guidance in 2 CFR part 180.
§ 3700.437
What method do I use to communicate to a participant the requirements described in the OMB guidance at 2 CFR 180.435?
To communicate to a participant the requirements described in 2 CFR 180.435 of the OMB guidance, you as an agency official must include a term or condition in the transaction that requires the participant's compliance with subpart C of 2 CFR part 180, and requires the participant to include a similar term or condition in lower-tier covered transactions.

(b) Respondent in a Commission suspension or debarment action;
(c) Commission debarment or suspension official; or
(d) Commission grants officer, agreements officer, or other official authorized to enter into any type of nonprocurement transaction that is a covered transaction.
§ 5800.30
What policies and procedures must I follow?
The Commission policies and procedures that you must follow are the policies and procedures specified in each applicable section of the OMB guidance in Subparts A through I of 2 CFR part 180, as that section is supplemented by the section in this part with the same section number. The contracts that are covered transactions, for example, are specified by section 220 of the OMB guidance (
i.e.,
2 CFR 180.220) as supplemented by section 220 in this part (i.e., § ______.220). For any section of OMB guidance in Subparts A through I of 2 CFR 180 that has no corresponding section in this part, Commission policies and procedures are those in the OMB guidance.

# Subpart A—General
§ 5800.137
Who at the Commission may grant an exception to let an excluded person participate in a covered transaction?
The Commission's Contracting Officer has the authority to grant an exception to let an excluded person participate in a covered transaction, as provided in the OMB guidance at 2 CFR 180.135.

# Subpart B—Covered Transactions
§ 5800.220
What contracts and subcontracts, in addition to those listed in 2 CFR 180.220, are covered transactions?
Pursuant to 2 CFR 180.220(c), the Commission extends coverage of nonprocurement suspension and debarment requirements beyond first-tier procurement contracts to include any subcontract to be funded by the Commission, the value of which is expected to equal to or exceed $25,000 or 30 percent of the value of first-tier transaction, whichever is lesser.

# Subpart C—Responsibilities of Participants Regarding Transactions
§ 5800.332
What methods must I use to pass requirements down to participants at lower tiers with whom I intend to do business?
If a lower-tier transaction is covered pursuant to § 5800.220, you as a participant must include a term or condition in lower-tier transactions requiring lower-tier participants to comply with Subpart C of the OMB guidance in 2 CFR part 180.

# Subpart D—Responsibilities of Federal Agency Officials Regarding Transactions
§ 5800.437
What method do I use to communicate to a participant the requirements described in the OMB guidance at 2 CFR 180.435?
To communicate to a participant the requirements described in 2 CFR 180.435 of the OMB guidance, you as an agency official must include a term or condition in the transaction that requires the participant's compliance with subpart C of 2 CFR part 180, and requires the participant to include a similar term or condition in lower-tier covered transactions.
§ 5800.765
May I ask the suspending official to reconsider a decision to suspend me?
Yes. Within 30 days of receiving a final notice of suspension, you may make a written request for the suspending official to reconsider your suspension.
§ 5800.875
May I ask the debarring official to reconsider a decision to debar me?
Yes. Within 30 days of receiving a final notice of debarment, you may make a written request for the debarring official to reconsider your debarment pursuant to § 5800.880. The disposition of your request for reconsideration; or the result of your appeal; shall be considered a final agency action.
§ 5800.880
What factors may influence the debarring official during reconsideration?
The debarring official may reduce or terminate your debarment based on:
(a) Newly discovered material evidence;
(b) A reversal of the conviction or civil judgment upon which your debarment was based;
(c) A bona fide change in ownership or management;
(d) Elimination of other causes for which the debarment was imposed; or
(e) Other reasons the debarring official finds appropriate.
§ 5800.890
How may I appeal my debarment?
(a) If the Commission debarring official issues a decision under 2 CFR 180.870 to debar you after you present information in opposition to a proposed debarment under § 180.815, you may ask for review of the debarring official's decision in two ways:
(1) You may ask the debarring official under § 875 to reconsider the decision for material errors of fact or law that you believe will change the outcome of the matter; or
(2) You may request a review by the EAC's debarment appeals body (DAP), which is composed of the Executive Director, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Operating Officer. The DAP will review your appeal and make a determination on whether to sustain or reverse the decision of the debarring official. The DAP will then make a recommendation to the EAC Commissioners who will vote by circulation on whether to accept or reject the recommendation of the DAP. A request to review the debarring official's decision to debar you must be made within 30 days of your receipt of the debarring official's decision under § 180.870 or paragraph (a)(1) of this section. However, the DAP may recommend to the EAC Commissioners that the debarring official's decision be reversed, based on a majority vote of the DAP, only where the DAP finds that the decision is based on a clear error of material fact or law, or where DAP finds that the debarring official's decision was arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion. You may appeal the debarring official's decision without requesting reconsideration, or you may appeal the decision of the debarring official on reconsideration.
(b) A request for review under this section must be in writing; prominently state on the envelope or other cover and at the top of the first page “Debarment Appeal;” state the specific findings you believe to be in error; and include the reasons or legal bases for your position. The appeal request should be delivered or addressed to the U.S. Election Assistance Commission, 1201 New York Avenue, NW., Suite 300, Washington, DC 20005.
(c) After the circulation vote of the EAC Commissioners has been certified, either the Commission debarring official or the DAP must notify you of their decision under this section, in writing, using the notice procedures set forth at §§ 180.615 and 180.975.
(d) [Reserved]
(e) Nothing in this part prohibits the EAC from delegating the appeal review process to another Federal agency through a memorandum of understanding or interagency agreement.
