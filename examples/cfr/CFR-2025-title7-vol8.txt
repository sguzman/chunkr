# Explanation
The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.
Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:
Title 1 through Title 16
as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27
as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41
as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50
as of October 1
The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.

# LEGAL STATUS
The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

# HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS
The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, January 1, 2025), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

# EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES
Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.

# OMB CONTROL NUMBERS
The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request.
Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.

# PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE
Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.

# “[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY
The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not dropped in error.

# INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE
What is incorporation by reference?
Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.
What is a proper incorporation by reference?
The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:
(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.
(b) The matter incorporated is adequately summarized in the preamble of the final rule and is available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.
(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?
If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or email fr.inspection@nara.gov.

# CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES
A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR
Index and Finding Aids.
This volume contains the Parallel Table of Authorities and Rules. A list of CFR titles, chapters, subchapters, and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in this volume.
An index to the text of “Title 3—The President” is carried within that volume.
The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. This index is based on a consolidation of the “Contents” entries in the daily Federal Register.
A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

# REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL
There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing in the Code of Federal Regulations.

That, if the change in time or place of hearing is made less than 5 days prior to the date previously fixed for the hearing, the judge, either in addition to or in lieu of causing the notice of the change to be given, shall announce, or cause to be announced, the change at the time and place previously fixed for the hearing.
(b)
Appearances
—(1)
Right to appear.
At the hearing, any interested person shall be given an opportunity to appear, either in person or through his authorized counsel or representative, and to be heard with respect to matters relevant and material to the proceeding, provided that such interested person complies with any alternative procedures included in the hearing notice pursuant to§ 900.4. Any interested person who desires to be heard in person at any hearing under these rules shall, before proceeding to testify, state his name, address, and occupation. If any such person is appearing through a counsel or representative, such person or such counsel or representative shall, before proceeding to testify or otherwise to participate in the hearing, state for the record the authority to act as such counsel or representative, and the names and addresses and occupations of such person and such counsel or representative. Any such person or such counsel or representative shall give such other information respecting his appearance as the judge may request.
(2)
Debarment of counsel or representative.
Wherever, while a proceeding is pending before him, the judge finds that a person, acting as counsel or representative for any person participating in the proceeding, is guilty of unethical or unprofessional conduct, the judge may order that such person
be precluded from further acting as counsel or representative in such proceeding. An appeal to the Secretary may be taken from any such order, but the proceeding shall not be delayed or suspended pending disposition of the appeal:
Provided,
That the judge may suspend the proceeding for a reasonable time for the purpose of enabling the client to obtain other counsel or other representative. In case the judge has ordered that a person be precluded from further acting as counsel or representative in the proceeding, the presiding officer, within a reasonable time thereafter shall submit to the Secretary a report of the facts and circumstances surrounding such order and shall recommend what action the Secretary should take respecting the appearance of such person as counsel or representative in other proceedings before the Secretary. Thereafter the Secretary may, after notice and an opportunity for hearing, issue such order, respecting the appearance of such person as counsel or representative in proceedings before the Secretary, as the Secretary finds to be appropriate.
(3)
Failure to appear.
If any interested person fails to appear at the hearing, he shall be deemed to have waived the right to be heard in the proceeding.
(c)
Order of procedure.
(1) The judge shall, at the opening of the hearing prior to the taking of testimony, have noted as part of the record the notice of hearing as filed with the Office of the Federal Register and the affidavit or certificate of the giving of notice or the determination provided for in § 900.4(c).
(2) Evidence shall then be received with respect to the matters specified in the notice of the hearing in such order as the judge shall announce.
(d)
Evidence
—(1)
In general.
The hearing shall be publicly conducted, and the testimony given at the hearing shall be reported verbatim.
(i) Every witness shall, before proceeding to testify, be sworn or make affirmation. Cross-examination shall be permitted to the extent required for a full and true disclosure of the facts.
(ii) When necessary, in order to prevent undue prolongation of the hearing, the judge may limit the number of times any witness may testify to the same matter or the amount of corroborative or cumulative evidence.
(iii) The judge shall, insofar as practicable, exclude evidence which is immaterial, irrelevant, or unduly repetitious, or which is not of the sort upon which responsible persons are accustomed to rely.
(2)
Objections.
If a party objects to the admission or rejection of any evidence or to any other ruling of the judge during the hearing, he shall state briefly the grounds of such objection, whereupon an automatic exception will follow if the objection is overruled by the judge. The transcript shall not include argument or debate thereon except as ordered by the judge. The ruling of the judge on any objection shall be a part of the transcript. Only objections made before the judge may subsequently be relied upon in the proceeding.
(3)
Proof and authentication of official records or documents.
An official record or document, when admissible for any purpose, shall be admissible as evidence without the production of the person who made or prepared the same. Such record or document shall, in the discretion of the judge, be evidenced by an official publication thereof or by a copy attested by the person having legal custody thereof and accompanied by a certificate that such person has the custody.
(4)
Exhibits.
All written statements, charts, tabulations, or similar data offered in evidence at the hearing shall, after identification by the proponent and upon satisfactory showing of the authenticity, relevancy, and materiality of the contents thereof, be numbered as exhibits and received in evidence and made a part of the record. Such exhibits shall be submitted in quadruplicate and in documentary form. In case the required number of copies is not made available, the judge shall exercise his discretion as to whether said exhibits shall, when practicable, be read in evidence or whether additional copies shall be required to be submitted within a time to be specified by the judge. If the testimony of a witness refers to a statute, or to a report or document (including the record of any previous hearing) the judge,
after inquiry relating to the identification of such statute, report, or document, shall determine whether the same shall be produced at the hearing and physically be made a part of the evidence as an exhibit, or whether it shall be incorporated into the evidence by reference. If relevant and material matter offered in evidence is embraced in a report or document (including the record of any previous hearing) containing immaterial or irrelevant matter, such immaterial or irrelevant matter shall be excluded and shall be segregated insofar as practicable, subject to the direction of the presiding officer.
(5)
Official notice.
Official notice may be taken of such matters as are judicially noticed by the courts of the United States and of any other matter of technical, scientific or commercial fact of established character:
Provided,
That interested persons shall be given adequate notice, at the hearing or subsequent thereto, of matters so noticed and shall be given adequate opportunity to show that such facts are inaccurate or are erroneously noticed.
(6)
Offer of proof.
Whenever evidence is excluded from the record, the party offering such evidence may make an offer of proof, which shall be included in the transcript. The offer of proof shall consist of a brief statement describing the evidence to be offered. If the evidence consists of a brief oral statement or of an exhibit, it shall be inserted into the transcript in toto. In such event, it shall be considered a part of the transcript if the Secretary decides that the judge's ruling in excluding the evidence was erroneous. The judge shall not allow the insertion of such evidence in toto if the taking of such evidence will consume a considerable length of time at the hearing. In the latter event, if the Secretary decides that the judge erred in excluding the evidence, and that such error was substantial, the hearing shall be reopened to permit the taking of such evidence.

(b)
Briefs, proposed findings and conclusions.
The judge shall announce at the hearing a reasonable period of time within which interested persons may file with the hearing clerk proposed findings and conclusions, and written arguments or briefs, based upon the evidence received at the hearing, citing, where practicable, the page or pages of the transcript of the testimony where such evidence appears. Factual material other than that adduced at the hearing or subject to official notice shall not be alluded to therein, and, in any case, shall not be considered in the formulation of the marketing agreement or marketing order. If the person filing a brief desires the Secretary to consider any objection made by such person to a ruling of the judge, as provided in § 900.8(d), he shall include in the brief a concise statement concerning each such objection, referring where practicable, to the pertinent pages of the transcript.
§ 900.10
Certification of the transcript.
The judge shall notify the hearing clerk of the close of a hearing as soon as possible thereafter and of the time for filing written arguments, briefs, proposed findings and proposed conclusions, and shall furnish the hearing clerk with such other information as may be necessary. As soon as possible after the hearing, the judge shall transmit to the hearing clerk an original and three copies of the transcript of the testimony and the original and all copies of the exhibits not already on file in the office of the hearing clerk. He shall attach to the original transcript of testimony his certificate stating that, to the best of his knowledge and belief, the transcript is a true transcript of the testimony given at the hearing except in such particulars as he shall specify; and that the exhibits
transmitted are all the exhibits as introduced at the hearing with such exceptions as he shall specify. A copy of such certificate shall be attached to each of the copies of the transcript of testimony. In accordance with such certificate the hearing clerk shall note upon the official record copy, and cause to be noted on other copies, of the transcript each correction detailed therein by adding or crossing out (but without obscuring the text as originally transcribed) at the appropriate place any words necessary to make the same conform to the correct meaning, as certified by the judge. The hearing clerk shall obtain and file certifications to the effect that such corrections have been effected in copies other than the official record copy.

Thereafter said transcript and exhibits shall be made available by the hearing clerk for examination during official hours of business after prior request and reasonable notice to the hearing clerk.
(b) Transcripts of hearings shall be made available to any person at actual cost of duplication.

(b)
Appearances
—(1)
Representation.
In any proceeding under the act, the parties may appear in person or by counsel or other representative. The Department, if represented by counsel, shall be represented by an attorney assigned by the General Counsel of the Department, and such attorney shall present or supervise the presentation of the position of the Department.
(2)
Debarment of counsel or representative.
Whenever, while a proceeding is pending before him, the judge finds that a person acting as counsel or representative for any party to the proceeding is guilty of unethical or unprofessional conduct, the judge may order that such person be precluded from further acting as counsel or representative in such proceeding. An appeal to the Secretary may be taken from any such order, but the proceeding shall not be delayed or suspended pending disposition of the appeal:
Provided,
That the judge may suspend the proceeding for a reasonable time for the purpose of enabling the client to obtain other counsel or representative. In case the judge has issued an order precluding a person from further acting as counsel or representative in the proceeding, the judge, within a reasonable time thereafter, shall submit to the Secretary a report of the facts and circumstances surrounding the issuance of the order and shall recommend what action the Secretary should take respecting the appearance of such person as counsel or representative in other proceedings before the Secretary. Thereafter, the Secretary may, after notice and an opportunity for hearing, issue such order respecting the appearance of such person as counsel or representative in proceedings before the Secretary as the Secretary finds to be appropriate.
(3)
Failure to appear.
If the petitioner, after being duly notified, fails to appear at the hearing, he shall be deemed to have authorized the dismissal of the proceeding, without further procedure, and with or without prejudice as the judge may determine. In the event that the petitioner appears at the hearing and no representative of the Department appears, the judge shall proceed ex parte to hear the evidence of the petitioner.
Provided,
That failure on the part of such representative of the Department to appear at a hearing shall
not be deemed to be waiver of the Department's right to file suggested findings of fact, conclusions and order; to be served with a copy of the judge's initial decision and to appeal to the Secretary with respect thereto.
(c)
Order of proceeding.
Except as may be determined otherwise by the judge, the petitioner shall proceed first at the hearing.
(d)
Evidence
—(1)
In general.
The hearing shall be publicly conducted, and the testimony given at the hearing shall be reported verbatim.
(i) The testimony of witnesses at a hearing shall be upon oath or affirmation and subject to cross-examination.
(ii) Any witness may, in the discretion of the judge, be examined separately and apart from all other witnesses except those who may be parties to the proceeding.
(iii) The judge shall exclude, insofar as practicable, evidence which is immaterial, irrelevant, or unduly repetitious, or which is not of the sort upon which responsible persons are accustomed to rely.
(2)
Objections.
If a party objects to the admission or rejection of any evidence or to the limitation of the scope of any examination or cross-examination, or any other ruling of the judge, he shall state briefly the grounds of such objection, whereupon an automatic exception will follow which may be pursued in an appeal pursuant to § 900.65 by the party adversely affected by the judge's ruling.
(3)
Depositions.
The deposition of any witness shall be admitted, in the manner hereinafter provided in and subject to the provisions of § 900.61.
(4)
Affidavits.
Except as is otherwise provided in this subpart, affidavits may be admitted only if the evidence is otherwise admissible and the parties agree (which may be determined by their failure to make timely objections) that affidavits may be used.
(5)
Proof and authentication of official records or documents.
An official record or document, when admissible for any purpose, shall be admissible in evidence without the production of the person who made or prepared the same. Such record or document shall, in the discretion of the judge, be evidenced by an official publication thereof or by a copy attested by the person having legal custody thereof and accompanied by a certificate that such person has the custody.
(6)
Exhibits.
All written statements, charts, tabulations, or similar data offered in evidence at the hearing shall, after identification by the proponent and upon a satisfactory showing of the admissibility of the contents thereof, be numbered as exhibits and received in evidence and made a part of the record. Except where the judge finds that the furnishing of copies is impracticable, a copy of each exhibit, in addition to the original, shall be filed with the judge for the use of each other party to the proceeding. The judge shall advise the parties as to the exact number of copies which will be required to be filed and shall make and have noted on the record the proper distribution of the copies. If the testimony of a witness refers to a statute, or to a report, document, or transcript, the judge, after inquiry relating to the identification of such statute, report, document, or transcript, shall determine whether the same shall be produced at the hearing and physically be made a part of the evidence as an exhibit, or whether it shall be incorporated into the evidence by reference. If relevant and material matter offered in evidence is embraced in a report, document, or transcript containing immaterial or irrelevant matter, such immaterial or irrelevant matter shall be excluded and shall be segregated insofar as practicable, subject to the direction of the judge.
(7)
Official notice.
Official notice will be taken of such matters as are judicially noticed by the courts of the United States and of any other matter of technical, scientific, or commercial fact of established character:
Provided,
That the parties shall be given adequate notice, at the hearing or by reference in the judge's report or the tentative order or otherwise, of matters so noticed, and (except where official notice is taken, for the first time in the proceeding, in the final order) shall be given adequate opportunity to show that such facts are erroneously noticed.
(8)
Offer of proof.
Whenever evidence is excluded from the record, the party
offering such evidence may make an offer of proof, which shall be included in the transcript. The offer of proof shall consist of a brief statement describing the evidence to be offered. If the evidence consists of a brief oral statement or of an exhibit, it shall be inserted into the transcript in toto. In such event, it shall be considered a part of the transcript if the Secretary decides that the judge's ruling in excluding the evidence was erroneous. The judge shall not allow the insertion of such evidence in toto if the taking of such evidence will consume a considerable length of time at the hearing. In the latter event, if on appeal the Secretary decides that the judge erred in excluding the evidence, and that such error was substantial, the hearing shall be reopened to permit the taking of such evidence.
(e)
Transcript.
Transcripts of hearings shall be made available to any person at actual cost of duplication.
[25 FR 5907, June 28, 1960, as amended at 38 FR 29798, Oct. 29, 1973; 67 FR 10829, Mar. 11, 2002]
§ 900.61
Depositions.
(a)
Procedure in lieu of deposition.
Before any party may have testimony taken by deposition, said party shall, if practicable, submit to the other party an affidavit which shall set forth the facts to which the witness would testify, if the deposition should be taken. If, after examination of such affidavit, the other party agrees, or (within 10 days after submission of the affidavit) fails to object, that the affidavit may be used in lieu of the deposition, the judge shall admit the affidavit in evidence and shall not order the deposition to be taken.
(b)
Application for taking deposition.
Upon the application of a party to the proceeding, the judge may, at any time after the filing of the moving paper, order, under the facsimile signature of the Secretary, the taking of testimony by deposition. The application shall be in writing and shall be filed with the hearing clerk and shall set forth: (1) The name and address of the proposed deponent; (2) the name and address of the person (referred to hereinafter in this section as the
judge
), qualified under the rules in this part to take depositions, before whom the proposed examination is to be made; (3) the proposed time and place of the examination, which shall be at least 15 days after the date of the mailing of the application; and (4) the reasons why such deposition should be taken.
(c)
Judge's order for taking deposition.
If, after the examination of the application, the judge is of the opinion that the deposition should be taken, he shall order its taking. The order shall be filed with the hearing clerk and shall be served upon the parties and shall state: (1) The time and place of the examination (which shall not be less than 10 days after the filing of the order); (2) the name of the judge before whom the examination is to be made; (3) the name of the deponent. The judge and the time and place need not be the same as those suggested in the application.
(d)
Qualifications of judge.
The deposition shall be taken before the judge, or before a judge authorized by the law of the United States or by the law of the place of the examination to administer oaths, or before a judge authorized by the Secretary to administer oaths.
(e)
Procedure on examination.
(1) The deponent shall be examined under oath or affirmation and shall be subject to cross-examination. The testimony of the deponent shall be recorded by the judge or by some person under his direction and in his presence. In lieu of oral examination, parties may transmit written interrogatories to the judge prior to the examination and the judge shall propound such interrogatories to the deponent.
(2) The applicant must arrange for the examination of the witness either by oral examination or by written interrogatories. If it is found by the judge, upon the protest of a party to the proceeding, that such party has his residence and his place of business more than 100 miles from the place of the examination and that it would constitute an undue hardship upon such party to be represented at the examination, the applicant will be required to conduct the examination by means of interrogatories. When the examination is conducted by means of interrogatories, copies of the interrogatories shall be served upon the other parties
to the proceeding at least five days prior to the date set for the examination, and the other parties shall be afforded an opportunity to file with the judge cross-interrogatories at any time prior to the time of the examination.
(f)
Certification by judge.
The judge shall certify on the deposition that the deponent was duly sworn by him and that the deposition is a true record of the deponent's testimony. He shall then securely seal the deposition, together with two copies thereof, in an envelope and mail the same by registered mail to the hearing clerk.
(g)
Use of depositions.
A deposition ordered and taken in accord with the provisions of this section may be used in a proceeding under the act if the judge finds that the evidence is otherwise admissible and (1) that the witness is dead; or (2) that the witness is at a distance greater than 100 miles from the place of hearing, unless it appears that the absence of the witness was procured by the party offering the deposition; or (3) that the witness is unable to attend or testify because of age, sickness, infirmity, or imprisonment; or (4) that the party offering the deposition has endeavored to procure the attendance of the witness by subpena but has been unable to do so; or (5) that such exceptional circumstances exist as to make it desirable, in the interests of justice, to allow the deposition to be used. If a deposition has been taken, and the party upon whose application it was taken refuses to offer it in evidence, the other party may offer the deposition, or any part thereof, in evidence.
§ 900.62
Subpenas.
(a)
Issuance of subpenas.
The attendance of witnesses and the production of documentary evidence from any place in the United States on behalf of any party to the proceeding may, by subpena, be required at any designated place of hearing. Subpenas may be issued by the Secretary or by the judge, under the facsimile signature of the Secretary, upon a reasonable showing by the applicant of the grounds, necessity, and reasonable scope thereof.
(b)
Application for subpena duces tecum.
Subpenas for the production of documentary evidence, unless issued by the judge upon his own motion, shall be issued only upon a certified written application. Such application shall specify, as exactly as possible, the documents desired and shall show their competency, relevancy, and materiality and the necessity for their production.
(c)
Service of subpenas.
Subpenas may be served (1) by a United States Marshal or his deputy, or (2) by any other person who is not less than 18 years of age, or (3) by registering and mailing a copy of the subpena addressed to the person to be served at his or its last known residence or principal place of business or residence. Proof of service may be made by the return of service on the subpena by the United States Marshal or his deputy; or, if served by an individual other than a United States Marshal or his deputy, by an affidavit of such person stating that he personally served a copy of the subpena upon the person named therein; or, if service was by registered mail, by an affidavit made by the person mailing the subpena that it was mailed as provided in this paragraph and by the signed return post office receipt:
Provided,
That, if the subpena is issued on behalf of the Department, the return receipt without an affidavit of mailing shall be sufficient proof of service. In making personal service, the person making service shall leave a copy of the subpena with the person subpenaed; the original, bearing or accompanied by the required proof of service, shall be returned to the official who issued the same.
[25 FR 5907, June 28, 1960, as amended 67 FR 10829, Mar. 11, 2002]
§ 900.63
Fees and mileage.
Witnesses who are subpenaed and who appear in such proceeding, including witnesses whose depositions are taken, shall be paid the same fees and mileage that are paid witnesses in the courts of the United States, and persons taking depositions shall be entitled to the same fees as are paid for like services in the courts of the United States, to be paid by the party at whose request the deposition is taken.

§ 900.201
Investigation and disposition of alleged violations.
Whenever the Administrator has reason to believe that any handler has violated, or is violating, the provisions of any marketing order, he may institute such investigation and, after due notice to such handler, conduct such hearing in order to determine the facts as, in his opinion, are warranted. If, in the opinion of the Administrator and the General Counsel, the facts developed as a result of such investigation or hearing warrant such action, the General Counsel shall refer the matter to the Attorney General for appropriate action.
§ 900.202
Restrictions applicable to Committee personnel.
Members and employees of Federal marketing order boards and committees are immune from prosecution under the United States antitrust laws only insofar as their conduct in administering the respective marketing order is authorized by the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, 7 U.S.C. 601-674, or the provisions of the respective order. Under the antitrust laws, Committee members and employees may not engage in any unauthorized agreement or concerted action that unreasonably restrains United States domestic or foreign commerce. For example, Committee members and employees have no authority to participate, either directly or indirectly, whether on an informal or formal, written or oral basis, in any bilateral or international undertaking or agreement with any competing foreign producer or seller or with any foreign government, agency, or instrumentality acting on behalf of competing foreign producers or sellers to raise, fix, stabilize, or set a floor for commodity prices, or limit the quantity or quality of commodity imported into or exported from the United States. Participation in any such unauthorized agreement or joint undertaking could result in prosecution under the antitrust laws by the United States Department of Justice and/or suit by injured private persons seeking treble damages, and could also result in expulsion of members from the Committee or termination of employment with the Committee.

§ 900.302
Associations eligible to vote.
(a) Any association of producers, not previously determined to be a cooperative association may file an application for a determination as to whether it is a cooperative association and thus eligible to vote in a referendum. Such application shall be filed with the Administrator at least 60 days prior to the holding of the referendum:
Provided, however,
That the Administrator may permit the filing of an application in less than 60 days when, in the opinion of the Administrator, such filing would not delay the conduct of the referendum.
(b) Within a time fixed by the referendum agent, but not later than 5 days prior to the final date for balloting, each cooperative association electing to vote shall, upon the request of the referendum agent, furnish to him a certified list showing the name and address of each producer for whom it claims the right to vote and the plant at which such person's milk was received during the representative period.

§ 900.305
Duties of referendum agent.
The referendum agent shall also:
(a) For purposes of mailing, prepare a record of producers which will disclose the name of each such person, his address, the name of the handler who received the producer's milk during the representative period, and the name of the cooperative association, if any, which claims the right to vote for the producer. Such record may be compiled from readily available sources, including the following:
(1) Records of the Department;
(2) Producer records supplied by handlers;
(3) Health authority records;
(4) Certifications signed by dairy farmers who claim to be producers;
(5) Any other reliable sources of information which may be available to the referendum agent.
(b) Apply, as a guide, the following criteria in preparing a record of producers:
(1) When the order requires approval by an appropriate health authority before a person meets the definition of producer, only those persons having such approval and who otherwise meet the definition may be regarded as producers. When the definition of producer requires the shipment of milk to a handler or a plant as well as health authority approval, only those persons having such approval and whose milk was received by a handler or at a plant may be regarded as producers.
(2) When the order requires shipment to a handler or to a plant, without regard to health authority approval, a person may not be regarded as a producer, except as provided in paragraph (b)(6) of this section, unless his name appears on the handler's producer records.
(3) In the case of a producer that is other than an individual, the business unit shall be regarded as the producer.
(4) No person may be included in the record more than once although he may operate more than one farm, hold more than one health authority approval, or appear on more than one handler's producer records.
(5) In the event the health authority records are not available, are inaccurate, or are incomplete, the appearance of the producer's name on a handler's records as an approved producer shall be prima facie evidence of health authority approval.
(6) In the event any handler refuses or fails to make his records available to the referendum agent, a certification signed by the producer shall be regarded by the referendum agent as prima facie evidence that such person is eligible to vote.
(c) Verify the information supplied by each cooperative association which wishes to vote on behalf of producers, as follows:
(1) Examine the records of the cooperative association for the purpose of ascertaining whether each producer claimed by the cooperative association is a member of, stockholder in, or under contract with the cooperative association.
(2) Identify the persons ascertained to be members of, stockholders in, or under contract with a cooperative association which wishes to vote on behalf of its producers with the names of producers which appear on the record compiled pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section.
(3) In determining whether a cooperative association may vote on behalf of a producer the following criteria shall be used:
(i) The cooperative association may vote for each producer who is a member of, stockholder in, or under contract with such cooperative association on the date of the order directing that the referendum be conducted.
(ii) The cooperative association may cast only one ballot for all such producers.
(iii) Whenever more than one cooperative association claims the right to vote for a producer only the cooperative association which furnished evidence satisfactory to the referendum agent that such association was in fact marketing the milk of the producer on the date of the referendum order may vote for such producer.

(a) The referendum agent shall at least 5 days prior to the final date for balloting:

on behalf of its producers and to each of all other known producers, a notice of the referendum which will include instructions for completing the ballot, a statement as to the time within which the ballot must be mailed to, and received by, the referendum agent, a copy of the final decision, and a ballot containing a description of the terms and conditions of the order.
(2) Give public notice of the referendum:
(i) By furnishing press releases and other information to available media of public information (including but not limited to press, radio, and television facilities) serving the area, announcing the time within which ballots must be completed and mailed to and received by the referendum agent, eligibility requirements, where additional information may be procured, and other pertinent information; and

There shall be no voting except within the time specified by the referendum agent as stated in the notice of the referendum.

Tabulation of ballots.
(a)
General.
The referendum agent shall verify the information supplied with each ballot. If he ascertains that the person who cast the ballot was eligible to do so, that the ballot is complete and was mailed and received within the prescribed time, the ballot shall be eligible to be counted. If the referendum agent ascertains that the person who cast the ballot was not eligible to do so, or if the producer who cast the ballot was a member of, stockholder in, or under contract with a cooperative association which cast a valid ballot, or if the ballot is not completed or cast in accordance with instructions, or if the ballot was not mailed to or received by the referendum agent within the prescribed time, the ballot shall be marked “disqualified” with a notation on the ballot as to the reason for the disqualification. The total number of ballots cast, including the disqualified ballots, shall be ascertained. The number of eligible ballots cast approving and the number of eligible ballots cast disapproving the issuance of the order shall also be ascertained. The ballots marked “disqualified” shall not be considered as approving or disapproving the issuance of the order, and the persons who cast such ballots shall not be regarded as participating in the referendum.
(b)
Individual-handler pool provisions.
Whenever separate approval of the pooling provisions of the order is required by section 608c(5)(B)(i) of the act, any ballot which approves the issuance of the order and disapproves the pooling provisions, or approves the pooling provisions and disapproves the issuance of the order, shall be disqualified; and the referendum agent shall mark the ballot accordingly.
(c)
Record of results of the referendum.
The referendum agent shall notify the Administrator of the number of eligible ballots cast, the count of the votes, the number of disqualified ballots and the number of producers who were eligible to cast ballots. The referendum agent shall seal the ballots, including those marked “disqualified”, the list of eligible voters and tabulation of ballots, and shall transmit to the Administrator a complete detailed report of all action taken in connection with the referendum together with all the ballots cast and all other information furnished to or compiled by the referendum agent.
(d)
Announcement of the results of the referendum.
Announcement of the results of the referendum will be made only at the direction of the Secretary. The referendum agent, or others who assist in the referendum, shall not disclose the results of the referendum or the total number of ballots cast.
§ 900.309
Confidential information.
The ballots cast, the identity of any person who voted, or the manner in which any person voted and all information furnished to, compiled by, or in the possession of the referendum agent, shall be regarded as confidential.
§ 900.310
Supplementary instructions.
The Administrator is authorized to issue instructions and to prescribe forms and ballots, not inconsistent
with the provisions of this subpart, to govern the conduct of referenda by referendum agents.
§ 900.311
Submittals or requests.
Interested persons may secure information or make submittals or requests to the Administrator with respect to the provisions contained in this subpart.

# Subpart M—Assessment of Exemptions
§ 900.700
Exemption from assessments.
(a) This section specifies criteria for identifying persons eligible to obtain an exemption from the portion of the assessment used to fund marketing promotion activities under a marketing order and the procedures for applying for such an exemption under 7 CFR parts 905, 906, 915, 922, 923, 925, 927, 929, 930, 932, 948, 955, 956, 958, 959, 966, 981, 982, 984, 985, 987, 989, 993, and such other parts (included in 7 CFR parts 905 through 998) covering marketing orders for fruits, vegetables, and specialty crops as may be established or amended to include market promotion. For the purposes of this section, the term “assessment period” means fiscal period, fiscal year, crop year, or marketing year as defined under these parts; the term “marketing promotion” means marketing research and development projects or marketing promotion, including paid advertising designed to assist, improve, or promote the marketing, distribution, or consumption of the applicable commodity.
(b) A handler who operates under an approved National Organic Program (7 CFR part 205) (NOP) organic handling system plan and is subject to assessments under a part or parts specified in paragraph (a) of this section may be exempt from the portion of the assessment applicable to marketing promotion, including paid advertising, provided that:
(1) Only agricultural commodities certified as “organic” or “100 percent organic” (as defined in the NOP) are eligible for exemption;
(2) The exemption shall apply to all certified “organic” or “100 percent organic” (as defined in the NOP) products of a handler regardless of whether the agricultural commodity subject to the exemption is handled by a person that also handles conventional or nonorganic agricultural products of the same agricultural commodity as that for which the exemption is claimed;
(3) The handler maintains a valid certificate of organic operation as issued under the Organic Foods Production Act of 1990 (7 U.S.C. 6501-6522)(OFPA) and the NOP regulations issued under OFPA (7 CFR part 205);
(4) Any handler so exempted shall continue to be obligated to pay assessments under such part or parts specified that are associated with any agricultural products that do not qualify for an exemption under this section; and
(5) For exempted products, any handler so exempted shall be obligated to pay the portion of the assessment associated with the other authorized activities under such part or parts other than marketing promotion, including paid advertising.
(c)
Assessment exemption application.
(1) To be exempt from paying assessments for these purposes under a part or parts listed in paragraph (a) of this section, the handler shall submit an application to the board or committee established under the applicable part or parts prior to or during the assessment period. This application, Form SC-649, “Certified Organic Handler Application for Exemption from Market Promotion Assessments Paid Under Federal Marketing Orders,” shall include:
(i) The date, applicable committee or board, and Federal marketing order number;
(ii) The applicant's full name, company name, address, telephone and fax numbers, and email address;
(iii) Certification that the applicant maintains a valid certificate of organic operation under the OFPA and the NOP;
(iv) Certification that the applicant handles or markets organic products eligible to be labeled “organic” or “100 percent organic” under the NOP;
(v) Certification that the applicant is otherwise subject to assessments under the Federal marketing order program for which the exemption is requested;
(vi) The number of organic certified producers for whom they handle or market product (including the applicant);
(vii) A requirement that the applicant attach a copy of their certificate of organic operation and all applicable producer certificates of organic operation issued by a USDA-accredited certifying agent under the OFPA and the NOP;
(viii) Certification, as evidenced by signature and date, that all information provided by the applicant is true; and
(ix) Such other information as the committee or board may require, with the approval of the Secretary.
(2) The handler shall file the application with the committee or board, prior to or during the applicable assessment period, and annually thereafter, as long as the handler continues to be eligible for the exemption. If the person complies with the requirements of this section and is eligible for an assessment exemption, the committee or board will approve the exemption request and provide written notification of such to the applicant within 30 days. If the application is disapproved, the committee or board will provide written notification of the reason(s) for such disapproval within the same timeframe.
(3) The exemption will apply at the beginning of the next assessable period following notification of approval of the assessment exemption, in writing, by the committee or board.
(d)
Assessment exemption calculation.
(1) The applicable assessment rate for any handler approved for an exemption shall be computed by dividing the committee's or board's estimated non-marketing promotion expenditures by the committee's or board's estimated total expenditures approved by the Secretary and applying that percentage to the assessment rate applicable to all persons for the assessment period. The modified assessment rate shall then be applied to the quantity of certified “organic” or “100 percent organic” products handled under an approved organic assessment exemption as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. Products handled not subject to an approved organic assessment exemption shall be assessed at the assessment rate applicable to all persons for the assessment period. The committee's or board's estimated non-marketing promotion expenditures shall exclude the direct costs of marketing promotion and the portion of committee's or board's administrative and overhead costs (
e.g.,
salaries, supplies, printing, equipment, rent, contractual expenses, and other applicable costs) to support and administer the marketing promotion activities.
(2) If a committee or board does not plan to conduct any market promotion activities in a fiscal year, the committee or board may submit a certification to that effect to the Secretary, and as long as no assessments for such fiscal year are used for marketing promotion projects, or the administration of projects are funded by a previous fiscal period's assessments, the committee or board may assess all handlers, regardless of their organic status, the full assessment rate applicable to the assessment period.
(3) For each assessment period, the Secretary shall review the portion of the assessment rate applicable to marketing promotion for persons eligible for an exemption and, if appropriate, approve the assessment rate.
(4) When the requirements of this section for exemption no longer apply to a handler, the handler shall inform the committee or board within 30 days and pay the full assessment on all remaining assessable product for all committee or board assessments from the date the handler no longer is eligible to the end of the assessment period.
(5) Within 30 days following the applicable assessment period, the committee or board shall re-compute the applicable assessment rate for handlers exempt under this section based on the actual expenditures incurred during the applicable assessment period. The Secretary shall review, and if appropriate, approve any change in the portion of the assessment rate for market promotion applicable to exempt handlers, and authorize adjustments for any overpayments or collection of underpayments.

Assessments.
(a) Each handler who first handles fruit shall pay to committee, upon demand, such handler's pro rata share of the expenses which the Secretary finds will be incurred by the committee for the maintenance and functioning, during each fiscal period, of the committee established under this subpart. Each such handler's share of such expenses shall be that proportion thereof which the total quantity of fruit shipped by such handler as the first handler thereof during the applicable fiscal period is of the total quantity of fruit so shipped by all handlers during the same fiscal period. The Secretary shall fix the rate of assessment per standard packed carton of fruit to be paid by each such handler. The payment of assessments for the maintenance and functioning of the committee may be required under this part throughout the period it is in effect irrespective of whether particular provisions thereof are suspended or become inoperative.

Provided,
That funds already in the reserve do not exceed approximately two fiscal periods' expenses. Such reserve funds may be used (1) to cover any expenses authorized by this part and (2) to cover necessary expenses of liquidation in the event of termination of this part. If any such excess is not retained in a reserve, each handler entitled to a proportionate refund shall be credited with such refund against the operations of the following fiscal period unless he demands payment of the sum due him, in which case such sum shall be paid to him. Upon termination of this part, any funds not required to defray the necessary expenses of liquidation shall be disposed of in such manner as the Secretary may determine to be appropriate:
Provided,
That to the extent practical, such funds shall be returned pro rata to the persons from whom such funds were collected.

§ 905.50
Marketing policy.
(a) Before making any recommendations pursuant to § 905.51 for any variety of fruit, the committee shall, with respect to the regulations permitted by § 905.52, submit to the Secretary a detailed report setting forth an advisable marketing policy for such variety for the then current shipping season. Such report shall set forth the proportion of the remainder of the total crop of such variety of fruit (determined by the committee to be available for shipment during the remainder of the shipping season of such variety) deemed advisable by the committee to be shipped during such season.
(b) In determining each such marketing policy and advisable proportion, the committee shall give due consideration to the following factors relating to citrus fruit produced in Florida and in other States:
(1) The available crop of each variety of citrus fruit in Florida, and in other States, including the grades and sizes thereof, which grades and sizes in Florida shall be determined by the committee pursuant to § 905.31;

change in grades and sizes thereof as the respective seasons advance. In the event it is deemed advisable to alter such marketing policy or advisable proportion as the shipping season progresses, in view of changed demand and supply conditions with respect to fruit, the said committee shall submit to the Secretary a report thereon.
(d) The committee shall transmit a copy of each marketing policy report or revision thereof to the Secretary and to each producer and handler who files a request therefor.

§ 905.52
Issuance of regulations.
(a) Whenever the Secretary shall find from the recommendations and reports of the committee, or from other available information, that to limit the shipment of any variety would tend to effectuate the declared policy of the act, he shall so limit the shipment of such variety during a specified period or periods. Such regulations may:
(1) Limit the shipments of any grade or size, or both, of any variety, in any manner as may be prescribed, and any such limitation may provide that shipments of any variety grown in Regulation Area II shall be limited to grades and sizes different from the grade and size limitations applicable to shipments of the same varieties grown in Regulation Area I:
Provided,
That whenever any such grade or size limitation restricts the shipment of a portion of a specified grade or size of a variety the quantity of such grade or size that may be shipped by a handler during a particular week shall be established as a percentage of the total shipments of such variety by such handler in such prior period established by the committee with the approval of the Secretary, in which he shipped such variety.
(2) Limit the shipment of any variety by establishing and maintaining, only in terms of grades or sizes, or both, minimum standards of quality and maturity;
(3) Limit the shipment of the total quantity of any variety by prohibiting the shipment thereof: Provided, that no such prohibition shall apply to exports or be effective during any fiscal period with respect to any variety other than for one period not exceeding five days during the week in which Thanksgiving Day occurs, and for not more than two periods not exceeding a total of 14 days during the period December 20 to January 20, both dates inclusive.
(4) Establish, prescribe, and fix the size, capacity, weight, dimensions, marking (including labels and stamps), or pack of the container or containers which may be used in the packaging, transportation, sale, shipment, or other handling of fruit.
(5) Provide requirements that may be different for the handling of fruit within the production area, the handling of fruit for export, or for the handling of fruit between the production area and
any point outside thereof within the United States.
(6) Any regulations or requirements pertaining to intrastate shipments shall not be implemented unless Florida statutes and regulations regulating such shipments are not in effect.
(b) Prior to the beginning of any such regulations, the Secretary shall notify the committee of the regulation issued by him, and the committee shall notify all handlers by mailing a copy thereof to each handler who has filed his address with said committee for this purpose.
(c) Whenever the Secretary finds from the recommendations and reports of the committee, or from other available information, that a regulation should be modified, suspended, or terminated with respect to any or all shipments of fruit in order to effectuate the declared policy of the act, he shall so modify, suspend, or terminate such regulation. If the Secretary finds that a regulation obstructs or does not tend to effectuate the declared policy of the act, he shall suspend or terminate such regulation. On the same basis, and in like manner, the Secretary may terminate any such modification or suspension.
(d) Whenever any variety is regulated pursuant to paragraph (a)(3) of this section, no such regulation shall be deemed to limit the right of any person to sell, contract to sell, or export such variety but no handler shall otherwise ship any fruit of such variety which was prepared for market during the effective period of such regulation.

(a) Whenever the handling of a variety of a type of fruit is regulated pursuant to § 905.52, each handler who handles any variety of such type of fruit shall, prior to the handling of any lot of such variety, cause such lot to be inspected by the Federal-State Inspection Service and certified by it as meeting all applicable requirements of such regulation:
Provided,
That such inspection and certification shall not be required if the particular lot of fruit previously had been so inspected and certified unless such prior inspection was not performed within such time limitations as may be prescribed pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section. Each handler shall promptly submit, or cause to be submitted, to the committee a copy of each certificate of inspection issued to him covering varieties so handled.
(b) With respect to any variety regulated pursuant to § 905.52(a)(4), the committee may prescribe, with the approval of the Secretary, such requirements with respect to time of inspection as it may deem necessary to insure satisfactory condition of the fruit at time of export.

§ 905.107
Registered handler certification.
Each handler who handles citrus grown in the production area must be certified as a registered handler by the Committee in order to ship such regulated citrus outside of the regulated area. A handler who is certified as a registered handler is a handler who has adequate facilities to meet the requirements for preparing citrus for market, obtains inspection on citrus handled, agrees to handle citrus in compliance with the Order's grade, size and container requirements, pays applicable assessments on a timely basis, submits reports required by the Committee, and agrees to comply with other regulatory requirements on the handling of citrus grown in the production area.
(a)
Eligibility.
Based on the criteria specified in this section, the Committee shall determine eligibility for certification as a registered handler. The Committee or its authorized agent shall inspect a handler's facilities to determine if the facilities are adequate for preparing citrus for market. To be adequate for such purposes, the facilities must be permanent, nonportable buildings located in the production area with equipment that is nonportable for the proper washing, grading, sizing and packing of citrus grown in the production area.
(b)
Application for certification.
Application for certification shall be executed by the handler by August 1st of fiscal period and filed with the Committee on a form, prescribed by and available at the principal office of the Committee, containing the following information:
(1) Business name,
(2) Address of handling facilities (including telephone, email and facsimile number),
(3) Mailing address (if different from handling facility address),
(4) Number of years in the citrus business in Florida,
(5) Type of business entity, and
(6) Names of senior officers, partners, or principal owners with financial interest in the business.
(c)
Determination of certification.
If the Committee determines from available information that an applicant meets the criteria specified in this section, the applicant shall be certified as a registered handler and informed by written notice from the Committee. Certification is effective for a fiscal period unless the Committee determines, based on criteria herein, that cancellation is warranted. If certification is denied, the handler shall be informed by the Committee in writing, stating the reasons for denial.
(d)
Cancellation of certification.
A registered handler's certification shall be cancelled by the Committee, with the approval of the Secretary, if the handler fails to pay assessments within 90 days of the invoice date, fails to provide reports to the Committee, or no longer has adequate facilities as described in this section. Cancellation of a handler's certification shall be made in writing to the handler and shall specify the reason(s) for and effective date of the cancellation. Cancellation
shall be for a minimum two-week period if a handler is found to be shipping without proper inspection. The Committee shall recertify the handler's registration at such time as the handler corrects the deficiencies which resulted in the cancellation and the Committee or its agent verifies compliance. The Committee shall notify the handler in writing of its recertification.
(e)
Inspection certification.
During any period in which the handling of citrus is regulated pursuant to this part, no handler shall obtain an inspection certifying that the handler's citrus meets the requirements of the Order unless the handler has been certified as a registered handler by the Committee. Any person who is not certified as a registered handler may receive inspection from the Federal-State Inspection Service, however, the inspection certificate shall state “Fails to meet the requirements of Marketing Order No. 905 because the handler is not a registered handler.”
(f)
Contrary shipping.
The Committee may cancel or deny a handler's registration if the handler has shipped citrus contrary to the provisions of this part. The cancellation or denial of a handler's registration shall be effective for a minimum of two weeks and not exceed the applicable shipping season as determined by the Committee.
(g)
Appeals.
Any handler who has been denied a handler's registration or who has had a handler's registration cancelled, may appeal to the Secretary, supported by any arguments and evidence the handler may wish to offer as to why the application for certification or recertification should have been approved. The appeal shall be in writing and received at the Specialty Crops Program office in Washington, DC, within 90 days of the date of notification of denial or cancellation.

§ 905.153
Procedure for determining handlers' permitted quantities of red seedless grapefruit when a portion of sizes 48 and 56 of such variety is restricted.
(a) For the purposes of this section, the prior period specified in § 905.52 is hereby established as an average week within the immediately preceding three seasons. Each handler's average week shall be computed by adding the total volume of red seedless grapefruit handled in the immediately preceding three seasons and dividing the total by 99. The average week for handlers with less than three previous seasons of shipments shall be calculated by adding the total volume of shipments for the seasons they did ship red seedless
grapefruit, divide by the number of seasons, divide further by 33. If crop conditions limit shipments from any or all of the immediately preceding three season(s), the committee may use a prior season or seasons for the purposes of calculating an average week. New handlers with no record of shipments could ship size 48 and 56 red seedless grapefruit as a percentage of total shipments equal to the percentage applied to other handlers' average week; once such handlers have recorded shipments, their average week shall be calculated as an average of total shipments for the weeks they have shipped red seedless grapefruit during the current season. When used in the regulation of red seedless grapefruit, the term season means the weeks beginning the third Monday in September and ending the first Sunday in the following May. The term
regulation period
means the 22-week period beginning the third Monday in September of the current season.
(b) When a size limitation restricts the shipment of a portion of sizes 48 and 56 red seedless grapefruit during a particular week as provided in § 905.52, the committee shall compute the quantity of sizes 48 and 56 red seedless grapefruit that may be shipped by each handler by multiplying the handler's calculated average week shipments of such grapefruit by the percentage established by regulation for red seedless grapefruit for that week. Such set percentage may vary from week to week but shall not be less than 25 percent in any week.
(c) The committee shall notify each handler of the quantity of size 48 and 56 red seedless grapefruit such handler may handle during a particular week.
(d) During any regulation week for which the Secretary has fixed the percentage of sizes 48 and 56 red seedless grapefruit, any person who has received an allotment may handle, in addition to their total allotment available, an amount of size 48 and 56 red seedless grapefruit up to 10 percent greater than their allotment. The quantity of the overshipment shall be deducted from the handler's allotment for the following week. Overshipments will not be allowed during the last week of regulation. If the handler fails to use his or her entire allotment, the undershipment is not carried forward to the following week. Each handler shipping size 48 and/or 56 red seedless grapefruit during the regulation period shall complete and submit to the committee, no later than 2 p.m. of the business day following the shipment, a report of red seedless grapefruit shipments by day for each regulation week.
(e) Any handler may transfer or loan any or all of their shipping allotment (excluding the overshipment allowance) of size 48 and 56 red seedless grapefruit to any other handler. Each handler party to such transfer or loan shall no later than noon on the Wednesday following the regulation week notify the committee so the proper adjustment of records may be made. In each case, the committee shall confirm in writing all such transactions, prior to the following week, to the handlers involved. The committee may act on behalf of handlers wanting to arrange allotment loans or participate in the transfer of allotments.
(f) New handlers with no record of shipments planning to ship red seedless grapefruit covered by any percentage size regulation shall register with the committee prior to the regulation period so their allotments can be properly calculated. Each new handler shall provide on a form furnished by the Committee the Florida citrus fruit dealer's license number, their Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, Division of Fruit and Vegetables, packinghouse registration number, and the physical location of the packinghouse where the red seedless grapefruit is to be prepared for market. The committee shall notify any new handlers of their allotments prior to the regulation period.

Budget.
At the beginning of each fiscal period and as may be necessary thereafter, the committee shall prepare an estimated budget of income and expenditures necessary for the administration of this part.

(b) Assessments shall be levied upon handlers at rates established by the Secretary. Such rates may be established upon the basis of the committee's recommendations and other available information. Such rates may be applied to specified containers used in the production area.
(c) The rate of assessment may be increased at any time by the Secretary if he finds such increase is necessary in order that the money collected shall be adequate to cover the committee's expenses during a given fiscal period. Such increase shall be applicable to all fruit handled during such fiscal period.
(d) The payment of assessments for the maintenance and functioning of the committee may be required under this part throughout the period it is in effect irrespective of whether particular provisions of this part are suspended or become inoperative.

(2) The committee, with the approval of the Secretary may carry over such excess into subsequent fiscal periods as a reserve:
Provided,
That funds already in the reserve do not equal approximately 1 fiscal period's expenses. Such reserve funds may be used for any expenses authorized pursuant to § 906.32 and for necessary expenses of liquidation in the event of termination of this part. Upon such termination, any funds not required to defray the necessary expenses of liquidation shall be disposed of in such manner as the Secretary may determine to be appropriate. To the extent practical, such funds shall be returned pro rata to the persons from whom such funds were collected.
(b) All funds received by the committee pursuant to the provisions of this part shall be used solely for the purpose specified in this part and shall be accounted for in the manner provided in this part.

# Expenses and Assessments
§ 915.40
Expenses.
The committee is authorized to incur such expenses as the Secretary finds are reasonable and likely to be incurred to enable the committee to exercise its powers and perform its duties in accordance with the provisions of this part during each fiscal year. The funds to cover such expenses shall be acquired by the levying of assessments as provided for in § 915.41.
[19 FR 3439, June 11, 1954. Redesignated at 26 FR 12751, Dec. 30, 1961, as amended at 35 FR 16627, Oct. 27, 1970]
§ 915.41
Assessments.
(a) Each person who first handles avocados shall, with respect to the avocados so handled by him, pay to the committee upon demand such person's pro rata share of the expenses which the Secretary finds are reasonable and likely to be incurred by the committee during each fiscal year. Each such person's share of such expenses shall be equal to the ratio between the total quantity of avocados handled by him as the first handler thereof during the applicable fiscal year, and the total quantity of avocados so handled by all persons during the same fiscal year. The payment of assessments for the maintenance and functioning of the committee may be required under this part throughout the period it is in effect irrespective of whether particular provisions thereof are suspended or become inoperative. If a handler does not pay his assessment within the time prescribed by the committee, the unpaid assessment may be subject to an interest charge at rates prescribed by the committee with the approval of the Secretary.
(b) The Secretary shall fix the rate of assessment per 55-pounds of fruit or equivalent in any container or in bulk, to be paid by each such handler. At any time during or after a fiscal year, the Secretary may increase the rate of assessment, in order to secure sufficient funds to cover any later finding by the Secretary relative to the expense which may be incurred. Such increase shall be applied to all fruit handled during the applicable fiscal year. In order to provide funds for the administration of the provisions of this part, the committee may accept the payment of assessments in advance, or borrow money on an emergency short-term basis. The authority of the committee to borrow money is subject to approval of the Secretary and may be used only to meet financial obligations as the obligations occur or to allow the committee to adjust its reserve funds to meet such obligations.

Accounting.
(a) If, at the end of a fiscal year, the assessments collected are in excess of expenses incurred, such excess shall be accounted for as follows:
(1) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, each person entitled to a proportionate refund of the excess assessment shall be credited with such refund against the operation of the following fiscal year unless such person demands repayment thereof, in which event it shall be paid to him:
Provided,
That any sum paid by a person in excess of his pro rata share of the expenses during any fiscal year may be applied by the committee at the end of such fiscal year to any outstanding obligations due the committee from such person.
(2) The Secretary, upon recommendation of the committee, may determine that it is appropriate for the maintenance and functioning of the committee that the funds remaining at the end of a fiscal year which are in excess of the expenses necessary for committee operations during such year may be carried over into following years as a reserve. Such reserve may be established at an amount not to exceed approximately 3 fiscal years' operational expenses. Funds in the reserve may be used to cover the necessary expenses of liquidation, in the event of termination of this part, and to cover the expenses incurred for the maintenance and functioning of the committee during any fiscal year when there is crop failure, or during any period of suspension of any or all of the provisions of this part. Such reserve may also be used by the committee to finance its operations during any fiscal year prior to the time that assessment income is sufficient to cover such expenses and to cover deficits incurred during any fiscal year when income is less than expenses. Upon termination of this part, any funds not required to defray the necessary expenses of liquidation shall be disposed of in such manner as the Secretary may determine to be appropriate:
Provided,
That to the extent practical, such funds shall be returned pro rata to the persons from whom such funds were collected.
(b) All funds received by the committee pursuant to the provisions of this part shall be used solely for the purposes specified in this part, and shall be accounted for in the manner provided in this part. The Secretary may, at any time, require the committee and its members to account for all receipts and disbursements.

# Expenses and Assessments
§ 920.40
Expenses.
The committee is authorized to incur such expenses as the Secretary finds are reasonable and likely to be incurred by the committee for its maintenance and functioning and to enable it to exercise its powers and perform its duties in accordance with the provisions of this part. The funds to cover such expenses shall be acquired in the manner prescribed in § 920.41.
§ 920.41
Assessments.
(a) As his or her pro rata share of the expenses which the Secretary finds are reasonable and likely to be incurred by the committee during a fiscal period, each person who first handles kiwifruit during such period shall pay to the committee, upon demand, assessments on all kiwifruit so handled. The payment of assessments for the maintenance and functioning of the committee may be required under this part throughout the period it is in effect, irrespective of whether particular provisions thereof are suspended or become inoperative. If a handler does not pay any assessment within the time prescribed by the committee, the assessment may be subject to an interest or late payment charge, or both, as may be established by the Secretary upon recommendation of the committee.
(b) The Secretary shall fix the rate of assessment to be paid by each such person during a fiscal period in an amount designed to secure sufficient funds to cover the expenses which may be incurred during such period and to accumulate and maintain a reserve fund equal to approximately one fiscal period's expenses. At any time during or after the fiscal period, the Secretary may increase the rate of assessment in order to secure sufficient funds to cover any later finding by the Secretary relative to the expenses which may be incurred:
Provided,
That any assessment, excluding any amount collected pursuant to § 920.55(c), must be limited to a maximum assessment rate of three and one-half cents per flat, or the equivalent thereof. The Secretary may increase this maximum rate in each succeeding year after the initial year of order operation by the Consumer Price Index (cost of living) for California as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Such increase shall be applied to all kiwifruit handled during the applicable fiscal period. In order to provide funds for the administration of the provisions of this part during the first part of a fiscal period before sufficient operating income is available from assessments on the current year's shipments, the committee may accept the payment of assessments in advance, and may also borrow money for such purposes.

§ 920.42
Accounting.
(a) If, at the end of a fiscal period, the assessments collected are in excess of expenses incurred, such excess shall be accounted for in accordance with one of the following:
(1) If such excess is not retained in a reserve, as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, it shall be refunded proportionately to the persons from whom it was collected:
Provided,
That any sum paid by a person in excess of his or
her pro rata share of the expenses during any fiscal period may be applied by the committee at the end of such fiscal period to any outstanding obligations due the committee from such person.
(2) The committee, with the approval of the Secretary, may carry over such excess into subsequent fiscal periods as a reserve:
Provided,
That funds already in the reserve do not equal approximately one fiscal period's expenses. Such reserve funds may be used: (i) To defray expenses, during any fiscal period, prior to the time assessment income is insufficient to cover such expenses; (ii) to cover deficits incurred during any fiscal year when assessment income is less than expenses; (iii) to defray expenses incurred during any period when any or all provisions of this part are suspended or are inoperative; and, (iv) to cover necessary expenses of liquidation in the event of termination of this part. Upon such termination, any funds not required to defray the necessary expenses of liquidation shall be disposed of in such manner as the Secretary may determine to be appropriate:
Provided,
That to the extent practical, such funds shall be returned pro rata to the persons from whom such funds were collected.
(b) All funds received by the committee pursuant to the provisions of this part shall be used solely for the purpose specified in this part and shall be accounted for in the manner provided in this part. The Secretary may at any time require the committee and its members to account for all receipts and disbursements.
(c) Upon the removal or expiration of the term of office of any member of the committee, such member shall account for all receipts and disbursements and deliver all property and funds in his or her possession to the committee, and shall execute such assignments and other instruments as may be necessary or appropriate to vest in the committee full title to all of the property, funds, and claims vested in such member pursuant to this part.
§ 920.45
Contributions.
The committee may accept voluntary contributions, but these shall only be used to pay expenses incurred pursuant to § 920.47 and § 920.48. Furthermore, such contributions shall be free from any encumbrances by the donor, and the committee shall retain complete control of their use.

# Expenses and Assessments
§ 923.40
Expenses.
The committee is authorized to incur such expenses as the Secretary finds
are reasonable and likely to be incurred by the committee to enable it to exercise its powers and perform its duties in accordance with the provisions of this part during each fiscal period. The funds to cover such expenses shall be acquired by the levying of assessments as prescribed in § 923.41.
§ 923.41
Assessments.
(a) Each person who first handles cherries shall, with respect to the cherries so handled by him, pay to the committee upon demand such person's pro rata share of the expenses which the Secretary finds will be incurred by the committee during each fiscal period. Each such person's share of such expenses shall be equal to the ratio between the total quantity of cherries handled by him as the first handler thereof during the applicable fiscal period and the total quantity of cherries so handled by all persons during the same fiscal period. The payment of assessments for the maintenance and functioning of the committee may be required under this part throughout the period it is in effect irrespective of whether particular provisions thereof are suspended or become inoperative.
(b) The Secretary shall fix the rate of assessment to be paid by each such person. At any time during or after the fiscal period, the Secretary may increase the rate of assessment in order to secure sufficient funds to cover any later finding by the Secretary relative to the expenses which may be incurred. Such increase shall be applied to all cherries handled during the applicable fiscal period. In order to provide funds for the administration of the provisions of this part during the first part of a fiscal period before sufficient operating income is available from assessments on the current year's shipments, the committee may accept the payment of assessments in advance, and may also borrow money for such purpose.
(c) If a handler does not pay any assessment within the time prescribed by the committee, the assessment may be subject to an interest or late payment charge, or both, as may be established by USDA as recommended by the committee.
[22 FR 3835, June 1, 1957. Redesignated at 26 FR 12751, Dec. 30, 1961, as amended at 66 FR 58356, Nov. 21, 2001.]
§ 923.42
Accounting.
(a) If, at the end of a fiscal period, the assessments collected are in excess of expenses incurred, such excess shall be accounted for as follows:

# Expenses and Assessments
§ 925.40
Expenses.
The committee is authorized to incur such expenses as the Secretary finds are reasonable and likely to be incurred by the committee for its maintenance and functioning and to enable it to exercise its powers and perform its duties in accordance with the provisions of this part. The funds to cover such expenses shall be acquired in the manner prescribed in § 925.41.
§ 925.41
Assessments.
(a) Each person who first handles grapes shall pay to the committee, upon demand, such handler's pro rata share of the expenses which the Secretary finds are reasonable and likely to be incurred by the committee during a fiscal period. The payment of assessments for the maintenance and functioning of the committee may be required under this part throughout the period it is in effect irrespective of whether particular provisions thereof are suspended or become inoperative.
(b) The Secretary shall fix the rate of assessment to be paid by each such person during a fiscal period in an amount designed to secure sufficient funds to cover the expenses which may be incurred during such period and to accumulate and maintain a reserve fund equal to approximately one fiscal period's expenses. At any time during or after a fiscal period, the Secretary may increase the rate of assessment in order to secure sufficient funds to cover any later findings by the Secretary relative to the expenses which may be incurred. Such increase shall be applied to all grapes handled during the applicable fiscal period. In order to provide funds for the administration of the provisions of this part during the first part of a fiscal period before sufficient operating income is available from assessments in the current period's shipments, the committee may accept the payment of assessments in advance, and may also borrow money for such purpose.
(c) Any assessment not paid by a handler within a period of time prescribed by the committee may be subject to an interest or late payment charge, or both. The period of time, rate of interest, and late payment charge shall be recommended by the committee and approved by the Secretary. Subsequent to such approval, all assessments not paid within the prescribed time shall be subject to the interest or late payment charge, or both.
§ 925.42
Accounting.
(a) If, at the end of a fiscal period, the assessments collected are in excess of expenses incurred, such excess shall be accounted for in accordance with one of the following:
(1) If such excess is not retained in a reserve, as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, it shall be refunded proportionately to the persons from whom it was collected:
Provided,
That any sum paid by a person in excess of that person's pro rata share of the expenses during any fiscal period may be applied by the committee at the end of such
fiscal period to any outstanding obligations due the committee from such person.
(2) The committee, with the approval of the Secretary, may carry over such excess into subsequent fiscal periods as a reserve:
Provided,
That funds in the reserve shall not exceed approximately one fiscal period's expenses. Such reserve funds may be used: (i) To defray expenses, during any fiscal period, prior to the time the assessment income is sufficient to cover such expenses; (ii) to cover deficits incurred during any fiscal period when assessment income is less than expenses; (iii) to defray expenses incurred during any period when any or all provisions of this part are suspended or are inoperative; or (iv) to cover necessary expenses of liquidation in the event of termination of this part. Upon such termination, any funds not required to defray the necessary expenses of liquidation shall be disposed of in such manner as the Secretary may determine to be appropriate:
Provided,
That to the extent practicable such funds shall be returned pro rata to the persons from whom such funds were collected.
(b) All funds received by the committee under this part shall be used solely for the purpose specified in this part and shall be accounted for in the manner provided in this part. The Secretary may at any time require the committee and its members to account for all receipts and disbursements.
(c) Upon the removal or expiration of the term of office of any member of the committee, such member shall account for all receipts and disbursements and deliver all property and funds in such member's possession to the committee, and shall execute such assignments and other instruments as may be necessary or appropriate to vest in the committee full title to all of the property, funds, and claims vested in such member pursuant to this part.

Modification, suspension, or termination of regulations.
(a) In the event the committee at any time finds that, by reason of changed conditions, any regulations issued pursuant to § 925.52 should be modified, suspended, or terminated, it shall so recommend to the Secretary.
(b) Whenever the Secretary finds from the recommendations and information submitted by the committee or from other available information that a regulation should be modified, suspended, or terminated with respect to any or all shipments of grapes in order to effectuate the declared policy of the act, the Secretary shall modify, suspend, or terminate such regulation. If the Secretary finds that a regulation obstructs or does not tend to effectuate the declared policy of the act, the Secretary shall suspend or terminate such regulation. On the same basis and in like manner the Secretary may terminate any such modification or suspension.

# Expenses and Assessments
§ 927.40
Expenses.
The Fresh Pear Committee and the Processed Pear Committee are authorized, each independently, to incur such expenses as the Secretary finds may be necessary to carry out their functions under this subpart. The funds to cover such expenses shall be acquired by the levying of assessments as provided in § 927.41.
§ 927.41
Assessments.
(a) Assessments will be levied only upon handlers who first handle pears. Each handler shall pay assessments on all pears handled by such handler as the pro rata share of the expenses which the Secretary finds are reasonable and likely to be incurred by the Fresh Pear Committee or the Processed Pear Committee during a fiscal period. The payment of assessments for the maintenance and functioning of the Fresh Pear Committee or the Processed Pear Committee may be required under this part throughout the period such assessments are payable irrespective of whether particular provisions thereof are suspended or become inoperative.
(b)(1) Based upon a recommendation of the Fresh Pear Committee or other available data, the Secretary shall fix three base rates of assessment for pears that handlers shall pay on pears handled for the fresh market during each fiscal period. Such base rates shall include one rate of assessment for any or all varieties or subvarieties of pears classified as summer/fall; one rate of assessment for any or all varieties or subvarieties of pears, classified as winter; and one rate of assessment for any or all varieties or subvarieties of pears classified as other. Upon recommendation of the Fresh Pear Committee or other available data, the Secretary may also fix supplemental rates of assessment on individual varieties or subvarieties categorized within the assessment classifications in this paragraph (b)(1) to secure sufficient funds to provide for projects authorized under § 927.47. At any time during the
fiscal period when it is determined on the basis of a Fresh Pear Committee recommendation or other information that different rates are necessary for fresh pears or for any varieties or subvarieties, the Secretary may modify those rates of assessment and such new rate shall apply to any or all varieties or subvarieties that are shipped during the fiscal period for fresh market.
(2) Based upon a recommendation of the Processed Pear Committee or other available data, the Secretary shall fix three base rates of assessment for pears that handlers shall pay on pears handled for processing during each fiscal period. Such base rates shall include one rate of assessment for any or all varieties or subvarieties of pears classified as summer/fall; one rate of assessment for any or all varieties or subvarieties of pears, classified as winter; and one rate of assessment for any or all varieties or subvarieties of pears classified as other. Upon recommendation of the Processed Pear Committee or other available data, the Secretary may also fix supplemental rates of assessment on individual varieties or subvarieties categorized within the assessment classifications defined in paragraph (b)(1) of this section to secure sufficient funds to provide for projects authorized under § 927.47. At any time during the fiscal period when it is determined on the basis of a Processed Pear Committee recommendation or other information that different rates are necessary for pears for processing or for any varieties or subvarieties, the Secretary may modify those rates of assessment and such new rate shall apply to any or all varieties or subvarieties of pears that are shipped during the fiscal period for processing.
(c) Based on the recommendation of the Fresh Pear Committee, the Processed Pear Committee or other available data, the Secretary may establish additional base rates of assessments, or change or modify the base rate classifications defined in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.
(d) The Fresh Pear Committee or the Processed Pear Committee may impose a late payment charge on any handler who fails to pay any assessment within the time prescribed. In the event the handler thereafter fails to pay the amount outstanding, including the late payment charge, within the prescribed time, the Fresh Pear Committee or the Processed Pear Committee may impose an additional charge in the form of interest on such outstanding amount. The Fresh Pear Committee or the Processed Pear Committee, with the approval of the Secretary, shall prescribe the amount of such late payment charge and rate of interest.
(e) In order to provide funds to carry out the functions of the Fresh Pear Committee or the Processed Pear Committee prior to commencement of shipments in any season, handlers may make advance payments of assessments, which advance payments shall be credited to such handlers and the assessments of such handlers shall be adjusted so that such assessments are based upon the quantity of each variety or subvariety of pears handled by such handlers during such season.

Provided,
That funds already in the reserve do not exceed approximately one fiscal period's expenses. Such reserve may be used to cover any expense authorized under this part and to cover necessary expenses of liquidation in the event of termination of this part. Any such excess not retained in a reserve or applied to any outstanding obligation of the person from whom it was collected shall be refunded proportionately to the persons from whom it was collected. Upon termination of this part, any funds not required to defray the necessary expenses of liquidation shall be disposed of in such manner as the Secretary may determine to be appropriate:
Provided,
That to the extent practical, such funds shall be returned pro rata to the persons from whom such funds were collected.
(b) All funds received pursuant to the provisions of this part shall be used solely for the purpose specified in this part and shall be accounted for in the manner provided in this part. The Secretary may at any time require the Fresh Pear Committee or the Processed Pear Committee and its members to account for all receipts and disbursements.

(1) Limit the total quantity of any grade, size, quality, or combinations thereof, of any variety or subvariety of
pears grown in any district and may prescribe different requirements applicable to shipments to different export markets;

If the Secretary finds, from the recommendations and information submitted by the Fresh Pear Committee, or from other available information, that a regulation obstructs or does not tend to effectuate the declared policy of the act, he or she shall suspend or terminate such regulation. On the same basis and in like manner, the Secretary may terminate any such modification or suspension.

Establishment and membership.
(a) There is hereby established a Cherry Industry Administrative Board, the membership of which shall be calculated in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section. The number of Board members may vary, depending upon the production levels of the districts. All but one of these members shall be qualified growers and handlers selected pursuant to this part, each of whom shall have an alternate having the same qualifications as the member for whom the person is an alternate. One member of the Board shall be a public member who, along with his or her alternate, shall be elected by the Board from the general public.
(b) District representation on the Board shall be based upon the previous three-year average production in the district and shall be established as follows:
(1) Up to and including 10 million pounds shall have 1 member;
(2) Greater than 10 and up to and including 40 million pounds shall have 2 members;
(3) Greater than 40 and up to and including 80 million pounds shall have 3 members; and
(4) Greater than 80 million pounds shall have 4 members; and
(5) Allocation of the seats in each district shall be as follows but subject to the provisions of paragraphs (d), (e) and (f) of this section:

(e) Board members from districts with one seat may be either grower or handler members and will be nominated and elected as outlined in § 930.23.
(f) If the 3-year average production of a district changes so that a different number of seats should be allocated to the district, then the Board will be reestablished by the Secretary, and such seats will be filled according to the applicable provisions of this part. Each district's 3-year average production shall be recalculated annually as soon as possible after each season's final production figures are known.

(b)
Nomination.
(1) In order for the name of a grower nominee to appear on an election ballot, the nominee's name must be submitted with a petition form, to be supplied by the Secretary or the Board, which, except in District 8, contains at least five signatures of growers, other than the nominee, from the nominee's district who are eligible to vote in the referendum. Grower petition forms in District 8 must be signed by only two growers, other than the nominee, from the nominee's district.
(2) In order for the name of a handler nominee to appear on an election ballot, the nominee's name must be submitted with a petition form, to be supplied by the Secretary or the Board, which contains the signature of one or more handler(s), other than the nominee, from the nominee's district who is or are eligible to vote in the election and that handle(s) a combined total of no less than five percent (5%) of the average production, as that term is used § 930.20, handled in the district.
Provided,
that this requirement shall not apply if its application would result in a sales constituency conflict as provided in § 930.20(g). The requirement that the petition form be signed by a handler other than the nominee shall not apply in any district where fewer than two handlers are eligible to vote.
(3) Only growers, including duly authorized officers or employees of growers, who are eligible to serve as grower members of the Board shall participate in the nomination of grower members and alternate grower members of the Board. No grower shall participate in the submission of nominees in more than one district during any fiscal period. If a grower produces cherries in more than one district, that grower may select in which district he or she wishes to participate in the nominations and election process and shall notify the Secretary or the Board of such selection. A grower may not participate in the nomination process in one district and the election process in a second district in the same election cycle.
(4) Only handlers, including duly authorized officers or employees of handlers, who are eligible to serve as handler members of the Board shall participate in the nomination of handler members and alternate handler members of the Board. No handler shall participate in the selection of nominees in more than one district during any fiscal period.

A handler may not participate in the nominations process in one district and the elections process in a second district in the same election cycle. If a person is a grower and a grower-handler only because some or all of his or her cherries were custom packed, but he or she does not own or lease and operate a processing facility, such person may vote only as a grower.
(5) In districts entitled to only one Board member, both growers and handlers may be nominated for the district's Board seat. Grower and handler nominations must follow the petition procedures outlined in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section.

(2) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(4) of this section, only growers, including duly authorized officers or employees of growers, who are eligible to serve as grower members of the Board shall participate in the election of grower members and alternate grower members of the Board. No grower shall participate in the election of Board members in more than one district during any fiscal period. If a grower produces cherries in more than one district, the grower must vote in the same district in which he or she chose to participate in the nominations process under paragraph (b)(3) of this section.

(3)(i) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(4) of this section, only handlers, including duly authorized officers or employees of handlers, who are eligible to serve as handler members of the Board shall participate in the election of handler members and alternate handler members of the Board. No handler shall participate in the election of Board members in more than one district during any fiscal period. If a handler does handle cherries in more than one district, he or she must vote in the same district in which the handler elected to participate in the nominations process under paragraph (b)(4) of this section. However, if a handler did not participate in the nominations process, that handler may select in which district he or she chooses to vote and shall notify the Secretary or the Board of such selection. If a person is a grower and a grower-handler only because some or all of his or her cherries were custom packed, but he or she does not own or lease and operate a processing facility, such person may vote only as a grower.
(ii) To be seated as a handler representative in any district, the successful candidate must receive the support of handler(s) that handled a combined total of no less than five percent (5%), of the average production, as that term is used in § 930.20, handled in the district;
Provided,
that this paragraph shall not apply if its application would result in a sales constituency conflict as provided in § 930.20(g).

(d) The members of the Board appointed by the Secretary pursuant to § 930.24 shall, at the first meeting and whenever necessary thereafter, by at least a two-thirds vote of the entire Board, select individuals to serve as the public member and alternate public member of the Board from the list of nominees received from growers and handlers pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section or from other persons nominated by the Board.

(d) The Secretary, after consideration of the recommendation of the Board, shall fix the rate of assessment to be paid by each handler during the fiscal period in an amount designed to secure sufficient funds to cover the expenses which may be approved and incurred during such period or subsequent period as provided in paragraph (c) of this section. At any time during or after the fiscal period, the Secretary may increase the rate of assessment in order to secure sufficient funds to cover any later finding by the Secretary relative to the expenses which may be incurred. Such increase shall be applied to all cherries handled during the applicable fiscal period. In order to provide funds for the administration of the provisions of this part during the first part of a fiscal period before sufficient operating income is available from assessments, the Board may accept the payment of assessments in advance, and may borrow money for such purposes.
(e) Assessments not paid within a time prescribed by the Board may be
made subject to interest or late payment charges, or both. The period of time, rate of interest, and late payment charge will be as recommended by the Board and approved by the Secretary:
Provided,
That when interest or late payment charges are in effect, they shall be applied to all assessments not paid within the prescribed period of time.
(f) Assessments shall be calculated on the basis of pounds of cherries handled. The established assessment rate may be uniform, or may vary dependent on the product the cherries are used to manufacture. In recommending annual assessment rates, the Board shall consider:
(1) The differences in the number of pounds of cherries utilized for various cherry products; and
(2) The relative market values of such cherry products.
(g) The Board, with the approval of the Secretary, may establish rules and regulations necessary and incidental to the administration of this section.
[61 FR 49942, Sept. 24, 1996, as amended at 67 FR 51714, Aug. 8, 2002]
§ 930.42
Accounting.
(a) If, at the end of a fiscal period, the assessments collected are in excess of expenses incurred, the Board, with the approval of the Secretary, may carry over all or any portion of such excess into subsequent fiscal periods as a reserve. Such reserve funds may be used to cover any expenses authorized by this part, and to cover necessary expenses of liquidation in the event of termination of this part. If any such excess is not retained in a reserve, it shall be refunded proportionately to the handlers from whom the excess was collected. Without an additional reserve level approved by the Secretary, the amount held in reserve may not exceed approximately one year's operational expenses. Upon termination of this part, any funds not required to defray the necessary expenses of liquidation shall be disposed of in such a manner as the Secretary may determine to be appropriate:
Provided,
That to the extent practicable, such funds shall be returned pro rata to the persons from whom such funds were collected.
(b) All funds received by the Board pursuant to the provisions of this part shall be used solely for the purpose specified in this part and shall be accounted for in the manner provided in this part. The Secretary may at any time require the Board and its members to account for all receipts and disbursements.

# Quality Control
§ 930.44
Quality control.
(a)
Quality standards.
The Board may establish, with the approval of the Secretary, such minimum quality and inspection requirements applicable to cherries as will contribute to orderly marketing or be in the public interest. If such requirements are adopted, no handler shall process cherries into manufactured products or sell manufactured products in the current of commerce unless such cherries and/or such cherries used in the manufacture of products meet the applicable requirements as evidenced by certification acceptable to the Board. The Board, with the approval of the Secretary, may establish rules and regulations necessary and incidental to the administration of this section.
(b)
Inspection and certification.
Whenever the handling of any cherries requires inspection pursuant to this part, each handler who handles cherries shall cause such cherries to be inspected by the appropriate division of USDA, and certified by it as meeting the applicable requirements of such regulation:
Provided,
That inspection and certification shall be required for cherries which previously have been so inspected and certified only if such cherries have been regraded, resorted, repackaged, or in any other way further prepared for market. Promptly after inspection and certification, each such handler shall submit, or cause to be submitted, to the Board a copy of the certificate of inspection issued with respect to such cherries.

# Research, Market Development and Promotion
§ 930.48
Research, market development and promotion.
The Board, with the approval of the Secretary, may establish or provide for
the establishment of production and processing research, market research and development, and/or promotional activities, including paid advertising, designed to assist, improve or promote the efficient production and processing, marketing, distribution, and consumption of cherries subject to this part. The expense of such projects shall be paid from funds collected pursuant to this part and the income from such funds.

# Regulations
§ 930.50
Marketing policy.
(a)
Optimum supply.
On or about July 1 of each crop year, the Board shall hold a meeting to review sales data, inventory data, current crop forecasts and market conditions in order to establish an optimum supply level for the crop year. The optimum supply volume shall be calculated as 100 percent of the average sales of the prior three years reduced by average sales that represent dispositions of exempt cherries and restricted percentage cherries qualifying for diversion credit for the same three years, unless the Board determines that it is necessary to recommend otherwise with respect to sales of exempt and restricted percentage cherries, to which shall be added a desirable carry-out inventory not to exceed 20 million pounds or such other amount as the Board, with the approval of the Secretary, may establish. This optimum supply volume shall be announced by the Board in accordance with paragraph (h) of this section.
(b)
Preliminary percentages.
On or about July 1 of each crop year, the Board shall establish a preliminary free market tonnage percentage which shall be calculated as follows: from the optimum supply computed in paragraph (a) of this section, the Board shall deduct the carry-in inventory to determine the tonnage requirements (adjusted to a raw fruit equivalent) for the current crop year which will be subtracted from the current year USDA crop forecast or by an average of such other crop estimates the Board votes to use. If the resulting number is positive, this would represent the estimated overproduction which would be the restricted tonnage. This restricted tonnage would then be divided by the sum of the crop forecast(s) for the regulated districts to obtain a preliminary restricted percentage, rounded to the nearest whole number, for the regulated districts. If subtracting the current crop year requirement, computed in the first sentence from the current crop forecast, results in a negative number, the Board shall establish a preliminary free market tonnage percentage of 100 percent with a preliminary restricted percentage of zero. The Board shall announce these preliminary percentages in accordance with paragraph (h) of this section.
(c)
Interim percentages.
Between July 1 and September 15 of each crop year, the Board may modify the preliminary free market tonnage and restricted percentages to adjust to the actual pack occurring in the industry. The Board shall announce any interim percentages in accordance with paragraph (h) of this section.
(d)
Final percentages.
No later than September 15 of each crop year, the Board shall review the most current information available including, but not limited to, processed production and grower diversions of cherries during the current crop year. The Board shall make such adjustments as are necessary between free and restricted tonnage to achieve the optimum supply and recommend such final free market tonnage and restricted percentages to the Secretary and announce them in accordance with paragraph (h) of this section. The difference between any final free market tonnage percentage designated by the Secretary and 100 percent shall be the final restricted percentage. With its recommendation, the Board shall report on its consideration of the factors in paragraph (e) of this section.
(e)
Factors.
When computing preliminary and interim percentages, or determining final percentages for recommendation to the Secretary, the Board shall give consideration to the following factors:
(1) The estimated total production of cherries;
(2) The estimated size of the crop to be handled;
(3) The expected general quality of such cherry production;
(4) The expected carryover as of July 1 of canned and frozen cherries and other cherry products;
(5) The expected demand conditions for cherries in different market segments;
(6) Supplies of competing commodities;
(7) An analysis of economic factors having a bearing on the marketing of cherries;
(8) The estimated tonnage held by handlers in primary or secondary inventory reserves;
(9) Any estimated release of primary or secondary inventory reserve cherries during the crop year; and
(10) The quantity of grower-diverted cherries during the crop year.
(f)
Modification.
In the event the Board subsequently deems it advisable to modify its marketing policy, because of national emergency, crop failure, or other major change in economic conditions, it shall hold a meeting for that purpose, and file a report thereof with the Secretary within 5 days (exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays) after the holding of such meeting, which report shall show the Board's recommended modification and the basis therefor.
(g)
Additional tonnage to sell as free tonnage.
In addition, the Board, in years when restricted percentages are established, shall make available tonnage equivalent to an additional 10 percent, if available, of the average sales of the prior 3 years, as defined in paragraph (a) of this section, for market expansion.
(h)
Publicity.
The Board shall promptly give reasonable publicity to growers and handlers of each meeting to consider a marketing policy or any modification thereof, and each such meeting shall be open to them and to the public. Similar publicity shall be given to growers and handlers of each marketing policy report or modification thereof, filed with the Secretary and of the Secretary's action thereon. Copies of all marketing policy reports shall be maintained in the office of the Board, where they shall be made available for examination. The Board shall notify handlers, and give reasonable publicity to growers, of its computation of the optimum supply, preliminary percentages, and interim percentages and shall notify handlers of the Secretary's action on final percentages by registered or certified mail.
(i)
Restricted percentages.
Restricted percentage requirements established under paragraphs (b), (c), or (d) of this section may be fulfilled by handlers by either establishing an inventory reserve in accordance with § 930.55 or § 930.57 or by diversion of product in accordance with § 930.59. In years where required, the Board shall establish a maximum percentage of the restricted quantity which may be established as a primary inventory reserve such that the total primary inventory reserve does not exceed 50-million pounds;
Provided,
That such 50-million-pound quantity may be changed upon recommendation of the Board and approval of the Secretary. Any such change shall be recommended by the Board on or before September 30 of any crop year to become effective for the following crop year, and the quantity may be changed no more than one time per crop year. Handlers will be permitted to divert (at plant or with grower diversion certificates) as much of the restricted percentage requirement as they deem appropriate, but may not establish a primary inventory reserve in excess of the percentage established by the Board for restricted cherries. In the event handlers wish to establish inventory reserve in excess of this amount, they may do so, in which case it will be classified as a secondary inventory reserve and will be regulated accordingly.
(j)
Inventory Reserve Release.
In years when inventory reserve cherries are available and when the expected availability of cherries from the current crop plus expected carryin inventory does not fulfill the optimum supply, the Board shall release not later than November 1st of the current crop year such volume from the inventory reserve as will satisfy the optimum supply.
(k) The Board, with the approval of the Secretary, may establish rules and
regulations necessary and incidental to the administration of this section.
[61 FR 49942, Sept. 24, 1996, as amended at 66 FR 35896, July 10, 2001; 67 FR 51714, Aug. 8, 2002; 75 FR 33677, June 15, 2010; 77 FR 33306, June 6, 2012]
§ 930.51
Issuance of volume regulations.
(a) Whenever the Secretary finds, from the recommendation and supporting information supplied by the Board, that to designate final free market tonnage and restricted percentages for any cherries acquired by handlers during the crop year will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act, the Secretary shall designate such percentages. Such regulation designating such percentage shall fix the free market tonnage and restricted percentages, totaling 100 percent, which shall be applied in accordance with this section, §§ 930.55, 930.57 and 930.59 to cherries grown in regulated districts, as determined under § 930.52, and handled during such fiscal period.
(b) The Board shall be informed immediately of any such regulation issued by the Secretary, and the Board shall promptly give notice thereof to handlers.
(c) That portion of a handler's cherries that are restricted percentage cherries is the product of the restricted percentage imposed under paragraph (a) of this section multiplied by the tonnage of cherries, originating in a regulated district, handled, including those diverted according to § 930.59, by that handler in that fiscal year.
(d) The Board, with the approval of the Secretary, shall develop rules and regulations which shall provide guidelines for handlers in complying with any restricted tonnage requirements, including, but not limited to, a grace period of at least 30 days to segregate and appropriately document any tonnage they wish to place in the inventory reserve and to assemble any applicable diversion certificates.
[61 FR 49942, Sept. 24, 1996, as amended at 67 FR 51714, Aug. 8, 2002]
§ 930.52
Establishment of districts subject to volume regulations.
(a) The districts in which handlers shall be subject to any volume regulations implemented in accordance with this part shall be those districts in which the average annual production of cherries over the prior 3 years has exceeded 6 million pounds. Handlers shall become subject to volume regulation implemented in accordance with this part in the crop year that follows any 3-year period in which the 6-million pound average production requirement is exceeded in that district.
(b) Handlers in districts which are not subject to volume regulation would only be so regulated to the extent that they handled cherries which were grown in a district subject to regulation as specified in paragraph (a) of this section. In such a case, the handler must place in inventory reserve pursuant to § 930.55 or § 930.57 or divert pursuant to § 930.59 the required restricted percentage of the crop originating in the regulated district.
(c) Handlers in districts not meeting the production requirement described in paragraph (a) of this section in a given year would not be subject to volume regulation in the next crop year.
(d) Any district producing a crop which is less than 50 percent of the average annual processed production in that district in the previous five years would be exempt from any volume regulation if, in that year, a restricted percentage is established.
(e) The Board, with the approval of the Secretary, may establish rules and regulations necessary and incidental to the administration of this section.
[61 FR 49942, Sept. 24, 1996, as amended at 67 FR 51714, Aug. 8, 2002]
§ 930.53
Modification, suspension, or termination of regulations.
(a) In the event the Board at any time finds that, by reason of changed conditions, any regulations issued pursuant to § 930.44 or § 930.51 should be modified, suspended, or terminated, it shall so recommend to the Secretary.
(b) Whenever the Secretary finds, from the recommendations and information submitted by the Board or from other available information, that a regulation issued pursuant to § 930.44 or § 930.51 should be modified, suspended or terminated with respect to any or all shipments of cherries in order to effectuate the declared policy of the Act,
the Secretary shall modify, suspend, or terminate such regulation.
§ 930.54
Prohibition on the use or disposition of inventory reserve cherries.
Cherries that are placed in inventory reserve pursuant to the requirements of § 930.50, § 930.51, § 930.55, or § 930.57 shall not be used or disposed of by any handler or any other person except as provided in § 930.50 or in paragraphs (a), (b), or (c) of this section.
(a) If the Board determines that the total available supplies for use in commercial outlets are less than the amount needed to meet the demand in such outlets, the Board may recommend to the Secretary that a portion or all of the primary and/or secondary inventory reserve cherries be released for such use.
(b) The Board may recommend to the Secretary that a portion or all of the primary and/or secondary inventory reserve cherries be released for sale in certain designated markets. Such designated markets may be defined in terms of the use or form of the cherries.
(c) Cherries in the primary and/or secondary inventory reserve may be used at any time for uses exempt from regulation under § 930.62.
(d) Should the volume of cherries held in the primary inventory reserves and, subsequently, the secondary inventory reserves reach a minimum amount, which level will be established by the Secretary upon recommendation from the Board, the products held in the respective reserves shall be released from the reserves and made available to the handlers as free tonnage.

# Editorial Note:
At 66 FR 232, Jan. 3, 2001, in § 930.54 paragraph (a), the word “normal” was suspended indefinitely.
§ 930.55
Primary inventory reserves.
(a) Whenever the Secretary has fixed the free market tonnage and restricted percentages for any fiscal period, as provided for in § 930.51(a), each handler in a regulated district shall place in his or her primary inventory reserve for such period, at such time, and in such manner, as the Board may prescribe, or otherwise divert, according to § 930.59, a portion of the cherries acquired during such period.
(b) The form of the cherries, frozen, canned in any form, dried, or concentrated juice, placed in the primary inventory reserve is at the option of the handler. The product(s) placed by the handler in the primary inventory reserve must have been produced in either the current or the preceding two crop years. Except as may be limited by § 930.50(i) or as may be permitted pursuant to §§ 930.59 and 930.62, such inventory reserve portion shall be equal to the sum of the products obtained by multiplying the weight or volume of the cherries in each lot of cherries acquired during the fiscal period by the then effective restricted percentage fixed by the Secretary;
Provided,
That in converting cherries in each lot to the form chosen by the handler, the inventory reserve obligations shall be adjusted in accordance with uniform rules adopted by the Board in terms of raw fruit equivalent.
(c) Inventory reserve cherries shall meet such standards of grade, quality, or condition as the Board, with the approval of the Secretary, may establish. All such cherries shall be inspected by USDA. A certificate of such inspection shall be issued which shall show, among other things, the name and address of the handler, the number and type of containers in the lot, the grade of the product, the location where the lot is stored, identification marks (can codes or lot stamp), and a certification that the cherries meet the prescribed standards. Promptly after inspection and certification, each such handler shall submit, or cause to be submitted, to the Board, at the place designated by the Board, a copy of the certificate of inspection issued with respect to such cherries.
(d) Handlers shall be compensated for inspection costs incurred on cherries placed in the primary inventory reserve. All reporting of cherries placed in, rotated in and out, or released from an inventory reserve shall be in accordance with rules and procedures established by the Board, with the approval of the Secretary. The Board could, with the approval of the Secretary, also
limit the number of inspections of reserve cherries being rotated into inventory reserves for which the Board would be financially liable.
(e) Except as provided in § 930.54, handlers may not sell inventory reserve cherries prior to their official release by the Board. Handlers may rotate cherries in their inventory reserves with prior notification to the Board. All cherries rotated into the inventory reserve must meet the applicable inspection requirements.
[61 FR 49942, Sept. 24, 1996, as amended at 75 FR 33678, June 15, 2010]
§ 930.56
Off-premise inventory reserve.
Any handler may, upon notification to the Board, arrange to hold inventory reserve, of his or her own production or which was purchased, on the premises of another handler or in an approved commercial storage facility in the same manner as though the inventory reserve were on the handler's own premises.
§ 930.57
Secondary inventory reserve.
(a) In the event the inventory reserve established under § 930.55 of this part is at its maximum volume, and the Board has announced, in accordance with § 930.50, that volume regulation will be necessary to maintain an orderly supply of quality cherries for the market, handlers in a regulated district may elect to place in a secondary inventory reserve all or a portion of the cherries the volume regulation would otherwise require them to divert in accordance with § 930.59.
(b) Should any handler in a regulated district exercise his or her right to establish a secondary inventory reserve under paragraph (a) of this section, all costs of maintaining that reserve, as well as inspection costs, will be the responsibility of the individual handler.
(c) The secondary inventory reserve shall be established in accordance with §§ 930.55 (b) and (c) and such other rules and regulations which the Board, with the approval of the Secretary, may establish.
(d) The Board shall retain control over the release of any cherries from the secondary inventory reserve. No cherries may be released from the secondary reserve until all cherries in any primary inventory reserve established under § 930.55 have been released. Any release of the secondary inventory reserve shall be in accordance with the annual marketing policy and with § 930.54.
§ 930.58
Grower diversion privilege.
(a)
In general.
Any grower may voluntarily elect to divert, in accordance with the provisions of this section, all or a portion of the cherries which otherwise, upon delivery to a handler, would become restricted percentage cherries. Upon such diversion and compliance with the provisions of this section, the Board shall issue to the diverting grower a grower diversion certificate which such grower may deliver to a handler. Any grower diversions completed in accordance with this section, but which are undertaken in districts subsequently exempted by the Board from volume regulation under § 930.52(d), shall qualify for diversion credit.
(b)
Eligible diversion.
Grower diversion certificates shall be issued to growers only if the cherries are diverted in accordance with the following terms and conditions or such other terms and conditions that the Board, with the approval of the Secretary, may establish. Diversion may take such of the following forms which the Board, with the approval of the Secretary, may designate: uses exempt under § 930.62; nonhuman food uses; or other uses, including diversion by leaving such cherries unharvested.
(c)
Application/mapping.
The Board, with the approval of the Secretary, shall develop rules and regulations providing for the diversion of cherries by growers. Such regulations may include, among other things:
(1) The form and content of applications and agreements relating to the diversion, including provisions for supervision and compensation; and
(2) Provisions for mapping areas in which cherries will be left unharvested.
(d)
Diversion certificate.
If the Board approves the application it shall so notify the applicant and conduct such supervision of the applicant's diversion of cherries as may be necessary to assure that the cherries have been diverted.
After the diversion has been accomplished, the Board shall issue to the diverting grower a diversion certificate stating the weight of cherries diverted. Where diversion is carried out by leaving the cherries unharvested, the Board shall estimate the weight of cherries diverted on the basis of such uniform rule prescribed in rules and regulations as the Board, with the approval of the Secretary, may recommend to implement this section.
[61 FR 49942, Sept. 24, 1996, as amended at 67 FR 51715, Aug. 8, 2002; 77 FR 33306, June 6, 2012]
§ 930.59
Handler diversion privilege.
(a)
In general.
Handlers handling cherries harvested in a regulated district may fulfill any restricted percentage requirement in full or in part by acquiring diversion certificates or by voluntarily diverting cherries or cherry products in a program approved by the Board, rather than placing cherries in an inventory reserve. Upon voluntary diversion and compliance with the provisions of this section, the Board shall issue to the diverting handler a handler diversion certificate which shall satisfy any restricted percentage or diversion requirement to the extent of the Board or Department inspected weight of the cherries diverted.
(b)
Eligible diversion.
Handler diversion certificates shall be issued to handlers only if the cherries are diverted in accordance with the following terms and conditions or such other terms and conditions that the Board, with the approval of the Secretary, may establish. Such diversion may take place in any form which the Board, with the approval of the Secretary, may designate. Tart cherry juice and juice concentrate may receive diversion credit but only if diverted in forms approved under the terms of this section. Such forms may include, but are not limited to:
(1) Contribution to a Board-approved food bank or other approved charitable organization;
(2) Use for new product and new market development;
(3) Export to designated destinations; or
(4) Other uses or disposition, including destruction of the cherries at the handler's facilities.
(c)
Notification.
The handler electing to divert cherries through means authorized under this section shall first notify the Board of such election. Such notification shall describe in detail the manner in which the handler proposes to divert cherries including, if the diversion is to be by means of destruction of the cherries, a detailed description of the means of destruction and ultimate disposition of the cherries. It shall also contain an agreement that the proposed diversion is to be carried out under the supervision of the Board and that the cost of such supervision is to be paid by the handler. Uniform fees for such supervision may be established by the Board, pursuant to rules and regulations approved by the Secretary.
(d)
Diversion certificate.
The Board shall conduct such supervision of the handler's diversion of cherries under paragraph (c) of this section as may be necessary to assure that the cherries are diverted as authorized. After the diversion has been completed, the Board shall issue to the diverting handler a handler diversion certificate indicating the weight of cherries which may be used to offset any restricted percentage requirement.
(e)
Transfer of certificates.
Within such restrictions as may be prescribed in rules and regulations, including but not limited to procedures for transfer of diversion credit and limitations on the type of certification eligible for transfer, a handler who acquires diversion certificates representing diverted cherries during any crop year may transfer such certificates to another handler or handlers. The Board must be notified in writing whenever such transfers take place during a crop year.
(f) The Board, with the approval of the Secretary, may establish rules and regulations necessary and incidental to the administration of this section.
[67 FR 51715, Aug. 8, 2002]
§ 930.60
Equity holders.
(a)
Inventory reserve ownership.
The inventory reserve shall be the sole responsibility of the handlers who place products into the inventory reserve. A
handler's equity in the primary inventory reserve may be transferred to another person upon notification to the Board.
(b)
Agreements with growers.
Individual handlers are encouraged to have written agreements with growers who deliver their cherries to the handler as to how any restricted percentage cherries delivered to the handler will be handled and what share, if any, the grower will have in the eventual sale of any inventory reserve cherries.
(c)
Rulemaking authority.
The Board, with the approval of the Secretary, may adopt rules and regulations necessary and incidental to the administration of this section.
§ 930.61
Handler compensation.
Each handler handling cherries from a regulated district that is subject to volume regulations shall be compensated by the Board for inspection relating to the primary inventory reserve as the Board may deem to be appropriate. The Board, with the approval of the Secretary, may establish such rules and regulations as are necessary and incidental to the administration of this section.
§ 930.62
Exempt uses.
(a) The Board, with the approval of the Secretary, may exempt from the provisions of § 930.41, § 930.44, § 940.51, § 930.53, or § 930.55 through § 930.57 cherries for designated uses. Such uses may include, but are not limited to:
(1) New product and new market development;
(2) Export to designated destinations;
(3) Experimental purposes; or
(4) For any other use designated by the Board, including cherries processed into products for markets for which less than 5 percent of the preceding 5-year average production of cherries were utilized.
(b) The Board, with the approval of the Secretary, shall prescribe such rules, regulations, and safeguards as it may deem necessary to ensure that cherries handled under the provisions of this section are handled only as authorized.
(c) Diversion certificates shall not be issued for cherries which are used for exempt purposes;
Provided,
that growers engaging in such activities under the authority of § 930.58 shall be issued diversion certificates for such activities.
[67 FR 51715, Aug. 8, 2002]
§ 930.63
Deferment of restricted obligation.
(a)
Bonding.
The Board, with the approval of the Secretary, may require handlers to secure bonds on deferred inventory reserve tonnage. Handlers may, in order to comply with the requirements of §§ 930.50 and 930.51 and regulations issued thereunder, secure bonds on restricted percentage cherries to temporarily defer the date that inventory reserve cherries must be held to any date requested by the handler. This date shall be not later than 60 days prior to the end of that crop year. Such deferment shall be conditioned upon the voluntary execution and delivery by the handler to the Board of a written undertaking within thirty (30) days after the Secretary announces the final restricted percentage under § 930.51. Such written undertaking shall be secured by a bond or bonds with a surety or sureties acceptable to the Board that on or prior to the acceptable deferred date the handler will have fully satisfied the restricted percentage amount required by § 930.51.
(b)
Rulemaking authority.
The Board, with the approval of the Secretary, may adopt rules and regulations necessary and incidental to the administration of this section.

# Reports and Records
§ 930.70
Reports.
(a)
Weekly production, monthly sales, and inventory data.
Each handler shall, upon request of the Board, file promptly with the Board, reports showing weekly production data; monthly sales and inventory data; and such other information, including the volume of any cherries placed in or released from a primary or secondary inventory reserve or diverted, as the Board shall specify with respect to any cherries handled by the handler. Such information may be provided to the Board members in summary or aggregated form only without any reference to the individual sources of the information.
(b)
Other reports.
Upon the request of the Board, with the approval of the Secretary, each handler shall furnish to the Board such other information with respect to the cherries acquired, handled, stored and disposed of by such handler as may be necessary to enable the Board to exercise its powers and perform its duties under this part.
(c)
Protection of proprietary information.
Under no circumstances shall any information or reports be made available to the Board members, or to any person designated by the Board or by the Secretary, which will reveal the proprietary information of an individual handler.
§ 930.71
Records.
Each handler shall maintain such records of all cherries acquired, handled, stored or sold, or otherwise disposed of as will substantiate the required reports and as may be prescribed by the Board. All such records shall be maintained for not less than two years after the termination of the fiscal year in which the transactions occurred or for such lesser period as the Board may direct with the approval of the Secretary.
§ 930.72
Verification of reports and records.
For the purpose of assuring compliance and checking and verifying the reports filed by handlers, the Secretary and the Board, through its duly authorized agents, shall have access to any premises where applicable records are maintained, where cherries are received, stored, or handled, and, at any time during reasonable business hours, shall be permitted to inspect such handlers premises and any and all records of such handlers with respect to matters within the purview of this part.
§ 930.73
Confidential information.
All reports and records furnished or submitted by handlers to the Board and its authorized agents which include data or information constituting a trade secret or disclosing trade position, financial condition, or business operations of the particular handler from whom received, shall be received by and at all times kept in the custody and under the control of one or more employees of the Board or its agent, who shall disclose such information to no person other than the Secretary.

# Miscellaneous Provisions
§ 930.80
Compliance.
Except as provided in this part, no person may handle cherries, the handling of which has been prohibited by the Secretary under this part, and no person shall handle cherries except in conformity with the provisions of this part and the regulations issued hereunder. No person may handle any cherries for which a diversion certificate has been issued other than as provided in §§ 930.58(b) and 930.59(b).
§ 930.81

§ 930.100
Grower diversion certificates.
(a) In accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, the Board may, for the 1997 crop year, issue diversion certificates to growers, in districts subject to volume regulation (Northwest Michigan, Central Michigan, New York, and Utah) who have voluntarily elected to divert in the orchard all or a portion of their 1997 tart cherry production which otherwise, upon delivery to handlers, would become restricted percentage cherries. Growers may offer the diversion certificate to handlers in lieu of delivering cherries.
(b)
Terms and conditions.
To be eligible to receive diversion credit, growers voluntarily choosing to divert cherries must meet the following terms and conditions:
(1) In order to receive a certificate, a grower must demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the Board, that rows or trees which were selected for diversion were not harvested. Trees six years old or younger do not qualify for diversion.
(2) The grower must furnish the Board with a total harvested production amount so the Board can calculate the amount of grower diversion tonnage to be placed on the diversion certificate. The Board will confirm the grower's production amount with information provided by handlers (to which the grower delivers cherries) on Board Form Number Two.
(3) The grower must agree to allow a Board compliance officer to visit the grower's orchard to confirm that diversion has actually taken place.
(c)
Calculation of diversion amounts.
The weight of cherries diverted and left unharvested shall be calculated by the Board after growers furnish the Board with the necessary information concerning their production. After verification of the volume of cherries diverted, the Board shall calculate the amounts of grower diversion tonnage to be placed on the diversion certificates and issue such certificates to growers. Such amounts shall be determined as follows:
(1) For whole block diversion, the weight of a harvested sample of 5 percent of each diverted block, provided by the grower, will be used to calculate the total volume of diverted cherries to be credited on the diversion certificate. For example, a grower farms 1,000 acres and elects to whole block divert a 200-acre block. If 5 percent of the harvested trees in the block diverted yield 80,000 pounds of cherries, the grower would receive a diversion certificate for 1,600,000 pounds (80,000 pounds divided by 5 percent (.05) yields 1,600,000 pounds). The rest of the block would remain unharvested.
(2) For random row diversion, such estimated volume would be calculated by applying the percentage of the grower's production diverted to the actual average volume per acre of cherries produced and harvested. For example, a grower farms 1,000 acres and elects to divert 20 percent of the harvestable acreage (200 acres). The grower harvests the remaining 800 acres and obtains 6,400,000 pounds of cherries, which represents a yield per acre of 8,000 pounds. Such grower would receive a diversion certificate for 1,600,000 pounds of cherries (8,000 lbs multiplied by the 20 percent of the
total acreage diverted; in this instance, 200 acres).

§ 930.107
Fiscal period.
Pursuant to § 930.7, fiscal period shall mean the period beginning October 1 and ending September 30 of each year.
[73 FR 75929, Dec. 15, 2008]
§ 930.120
Board membership.
When the production level from a district falls below the thresholds stated in § 930.20(b)(5), members of the specific district will make a recommendation to the Board as to who should be removed from the Board and the Board shall submit a recommendation to the Secretary for approval. If the recommendation is not made by the Board within a reasonable time, the Secretary may select the member and alternate to be removed.
[71 FR 16985, Apr. 5, 2006]

# Subpart B—Administrative Requirements
§ 930.133
Compensation rate.
A compensation rate of $250 per meeting shall be paid to the public member and to the alternate public member when attending Board meetings. Such compensation is a per meeting rate. For example, if a Board meeting is convened and lasts one or two days or only four hours, the public member and/or alternate public member attending the meeting would receive $250 each.
[63 FR 33528, June 19, 1998]
§ 930.141
Delinquent assessments.
(a) Pursuant to § 930.41, the Board shall impose an interest charge on any handler whose assessment payment has not been received by October 1 of each crop year. The interest rate shall be a rate of one percent per month and shall be applied to the unpaid assessment balance not paid by the October 1 due date. In addition to the interest charge, the Board shall impose a late payment charge on any handler whose assessment payment has not been received within 90 days from the due date of October 1. The late payment charge shall be 10 percent of the unpaid balance.
(b) [Reserved]

§ 930.150
Primary inventory reserve.
Beginning July 1, 2012, the primary inventory reserve may not exceed 100 million pounds.
[77 FR 40253, July 9, 2012]
§ 930.151
Desirable carry-out inventory.
Beginning with the crop year starting July 1, 2016, for the purposes of determining an optimum supply volume, the Board may recommend a desirable carry-out inventory not to exceed 100 million pounds.
[85 FR 40872, July 8, 2020]
§ 930.154
Release of inventory reserve cherries.
(a) As provided in § 930.54, the Board may recommend a release of a portion or all of the primary and/or secondary reserve cherries. The total available reserves will be determined at the beginning of the crop year. The primary reserve as defined in §§ 930.55 and 930.150 must be depleted before the secondary reserve can be released. If a release is recommended, the recommended volume shall be apportioned to handlers on the basis of each handler's proportion of the total volume handled in the preceding three crop years.
(b) If a handler has less volume in reserve than is apportioned, the excess volume shall be reapportioned to those who still have volume in reserve until the total release is complete.
[81 FR 63679, Sept. 16, 2016]
§ 930.158
Grower diversion and grower diversion certificates.
(a)
Grower diversion certificates.
The Board may issue diversion certificates to growers in districts subject to volume regulation who have voluntarily elected to divert in the orchard all or a portion of their tart cherry production
which otherwise, upon delivery to handlers, would become restricted percentage cherries. Growers may offer the diversion certificate to handlers in lieu of delivering cherries. Handlers may redeem diversion certificates with the Board through June 30 of each crop year. After June 30 of the crop year that crop year's grower diversion certificates are no longer valid. Cherries that have reached a harvestable, marketable condition will be eligible for diversion. Diversion will not be granted to growers whose fruit was destroyed before it set and/or matured on the tree, or whose fruit is unmarketable. If marketable fruit were to be damaged or destroyed by acts of nature such as storms or hail diversion credit could be granted. To be considered marketable for the purposes of this section, sampled fruit may not exceed a 5 percent tolerance for insects or a 7 percent tolerance for rot.
(b)
Application and mapping for diversion.
Any grower desiring to divert cherries using methods other than in-orchard tank shall submit a map of the orchard or orchards to be diverted, along with a completed Grower Diversion Application, to the Board by April 15 of each crop year. The application includes a statement which must be signed by the grower which states that the grower agrees to comply with the regulations established for a tart cherry diversion program. Each map shall contain the grower's name and number assigned by the Board, the grower's address, block name or number when appropriate, location of orchard or orchards and other information which may be necessary to accomplish the desired diversion. On or before July 1, the grower should inform the Board of such grower's intention to divert in-orchard and what type of diversion will be used. The four types of diversion are random row diversion, whole block diversion, partial block diversion and in-orchard tank diversion. A grower who informs the Board about the type of diversion he or she wishes to use by July 1 can elect to use any diversion method or combination of diversion methods. Only random row or in-orchard tank diversion methods may be used if the Board is not so informed by July 1. Trees that are four years or younger do not qualify for diversion. Annual resubmissions of either the map or application will no longer be required. Growers will only submit a new application and map if they are participating in the grower diversion program for the first time. Growers will need only to submit a new orchard map if he/she adds a new block of trees to the orchard or changes the orchard layout differently from the map previously submitted to the Board.
(1)
Random row diversion.
Using the orchard map furnished by the grower, the Board will randomly select rows of trees within the orchard to be diverted. The amount of cherries to be diverted will be based on the preliminary restricted percentage amount established pursuant to § 930.50. A grower may elect a different percentage amount; however, the grower needs to inform the Board as soon as possible after the preliminary percentages are announced of this other amount, but in no event shall this be less than seven days in advance of harvest. The designated rows indicated by the map must not be harvested. After completing harvest of the remaining rows in the orchard, the grower must notify the Board and/or the Board's compliance officer. A compliance officer will then be allowed to observe the grower's orchard to assure that the selected rows have not been harvested. The grower must inform the Board of the total production of the orchard to calculate the tonnage that was diverted.
(2)
Whole block diversion.
Based on maps supplied by the grower, a sampling procedure will be used to determine the amount of cherries in the orchard to be diverted. A block is defined as rows that run in the same direction, are similar in age, and have definable boundaries. The Board will require a number of tree sites to be sampled depending on the size of the block. A tree site is a planted tree or an area where a tree was planted and may have been uprooted or died. If a block has 5 rows or less, or 200 or less tree sites, 3 rows would be randomly chosen to be sampled, if a block has 6 to 15 rows, or 201-400 tree sites, 4 rows would be randomly chosen to be sampled, and if a block has 16 or more rows and greater
than 400 tree sites, 5 rows would be randomly chosen to be sampled. The Board's compliance officer will apply the sampling procedure (based on the number of rows or the number of tree sites) which results in the fewest number of tree sites required to be sampled. From each of the rows to be sampled, ten contiguous tree sites will be sampled. Only trees more than five years old will be harvested for the sample. For example, if it is determined that five rows are to be sampled, 10 contiguous tree sites in each of the five rows will be subject to harvest. Trees within the 10 sites which are more than five years old will be harvested. The harvested tonnage will be converted to a volume that represents the entire block of cherries. If, for example, a total of 4,600 pounds is harvested from the sample tree sites and this total is divided by 50 tree sites a yield of 92 pounds per tree site is obtained. To find the total yield for the block, the 92 pounds per tree site yield is multiplied by the 880 tree sites that were mapped in the block and that equals 80,960 pounds for that block. The compliance officer would be allowed access to the block to oversee the sampling process and to confirm that the block has been diverted.
(3)
Partial block diversion.
Partial block diversion will also be accomplished using maps supplied by the grower. Sampling will be done as in whole block diversion except that only partial blocks would be selected and sampled. Growers may divert up to five partial blocks, or 50 percent of a grower's total number of blocks per year. Such block(s) must be mapped and will be sampled as described under whole block diversion. Rows used in partial block diversion must be contiguous.
(4)
In-orchard tank diversion.
Growers wishing to in-orchard tank divert must pick the cherries to be diverted and place them in harvesting tanks. A compliance officer would then probe the tanks for volume measurement and observe the destruction of the cherries on the grower's premises. Growers wishing to take advantage of this option must have at least 10 tanks ready for diversion. The compliance officer has up to five days to come to the grower's premises to observe the diversion after being contacted.
(c)
Compliance.
Growers who voluntarily participate in the grower diversion program must sign and file with the Board a Grower Diversion Application. By signing the application, a grower agrees to the terms and conditions of the grower diversion program as contained in these regulations. To be eligible to receive diversion credit, growers voluntarily choosing to divert cherries must meet the following terms and conditions:
(1) In order to receive a certificate, a grower must demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the Board, that rows or trees which were selected for diversion were not harvested. Trees four years old or younger do not qualify for diversion.
(2) The grower must furnish the Board with a total harvested production amount so the Board can calculate the amount of grower diversion tonnage to be placed on the diversion certificate. The Board will confirm the grower's production amount with information provided by handlers (to which the grower delivers cherries) on Board form Number Two.
(3)(i) The grower must agree to allow a Board compliance officer to visit the grower's orchard to confirm that diversion has actually taken place. If the terms and conditions for whole block, partial block or in-orchard tank diversion are not completed, the Board shall not issue the grower a diversion certificate.
(ii) If a grower who chooses random row diversion harvests rows that were designated not to be harvested, the grower should inform the Board immediately of the error. The grower will then be required to divert twice the amount (rows or trees) incorrectly harvested to correct the mistake. The grower will still receive a diversion certificate equal to the original requested amount. However, in instances where a grower is at the end of harvesting the orchard and fails to divert a complete block or specified rows, the Board shall multiply by two the difference between the original diversion amount and the actual diverted amount. The Board shall subtract that amount from the diversion application
amount. Thus, the grower would receive a grower diversion certificate equal to a portion of the originally requested amount. If the grower does not inform the Board of such errors, the grower will not receive a diversion certificate.

§ 930.159
Handler diversion.
(a)
Methods of diversion.
Handlers may divert cherries by redeeming grower diversion certificates, by destroying cherries at handlers' facilities (at-plant), by diverting cherry products accidentally or voluntarily destroyed, by donating cherries or cherry products to charitable organizations or by using cherries or cherry products for exempt purposes under § 930.162, including export to countries other than Canada, and Mexico. Once diversion has taken place, handlers will receive diversion certificates stating the weight of cherries diverted. Diversion credit may be used to fulfill any restricted percentage requirement in full or in part. Any information of a confidential and/or proprietary nature included in this application would be held in confidence pursuant to § 930.73 of the order.
(b)
Board notification and handler plan.
Any handler intending to divert cherries or cherry products pursuant to § 930.59 of the order (except through exempt uses under § 930.62 of the order) must notify the Board of such intent and provide a plan by October 1 which shows how the handler intends to meet the restricted percentage obligation, except that, for the 1997-98 season only, the deadline is February 5, 1998. The Board may extend this date in individual cases pursuant to a written request showing good cause why the plan cannot be provided by the due date. A handler will have one year to fulfill such plan. The details of the plan shall include, but not be limited to, the name and address of the handler, the total product processed at-plant, product diverted at-plant, in-orchard diversion certificates to be redeemed, anticipated donations to charitable outlets, disposition to exempt outlets or uses and detailed plans for how and where such disposition will be made, and inventory reserve amount. It shall also contain an agreement that the proposed diversion is to be carried out under the supervision of the Board and that the cost of such supervision is to be paid by the handler. Supervision of diversion by means other than destruction of the cherries at a handler's facility will be subject to supervision as found necessary by the Board. USDA inspectors or Board employees will supervise diversion of cherry products at the current hourly rate under USDA's inspection fee schedule (7 CFR 52.42). Any cherries not diverted in accordance with the handler's plan will be placed into the secondary inventory reserve or the primary inventory reserve if a secondary inventory reserve has not been established.
(c)
At-plant diversion.
Diversion by disposal at-plant may take place prior to placing the cherries into the processing line, or after processing, but before a finished product is manufactured. Such diversion will take place under the supervision of USDA Inspection Service or Board employee inspectors. USDA inspectors or Board employees or Board agents will supervise diversion of cherry products at-plant at the current hourly rate under USDA's inspection fee schedule (7 CFR 52.42).
(d)
Diversion of finished products.
Handlers may be granted diversion credit for finished tart cherry products that are accidentally destroyed or voluntarily destroyed by the handler. To receive diversion credit under this option the cherry products must be owned by the handler at the time of accidental or voluntary destruction, be a marketable product at the time of processing, be included in the handler's end of the year handler plan, and have been assigned a Raw Product Equivalent (RPE) by the handler to determine the volume of cherries. In addition, the accidental or voluntary destruction and disposition of the product must be verified by either a USDA inspector or Board agent or employee who witnesses the disposition of the accidentally or voluntarily destroyed product. Products will be considered as accidentally
destroyed if they sustain damage which renders them unacceptable in normal market channels. Products which are voluntarily destroyed must have deteriorated in condition to such an extent that they are not acceptable for use in normal market channels.
(e)
Contributions to approved charitable organizations.
When diverting by donating cherries or cherry products to charitable organizations, handlers should follow the requirements specified herein. For contributions to qualify for diversion credit, the contributed product should be marked clearly “NOT FOR RESALE”. The receiving organization must be approved by the Board as a qualified recipient of contributions of tart cherry products. Such organizations must be tax-exempt, must not sell the donated products and must be noncompetitive with other tart cherry industry sales outlets. Once products are donated to an organization, the Board must receive satisfactory documentation of the transaction. Handlers should provide the Board with information on how the product was used and the volume of product used.
(f)
Grower diversion certificates.
To satisfy restricted percentage obligations by redeeming grower diversion certificates handlers must present to the Board grower diversion certificates obtained from growers who have diverted cherries by non-harvest, and who have been issued diversion certificates by the Board in accordance with the applicable rules and regulations governing the issuance of grower diversion certificates. For this crop year July 1, 1997, through June 30, 1998, grower diversion certificates will be valid until February 5, 1998.

§ 930.162
Exemptions.
(a)
General.
Tart cherries which are used for the purpose of new product development, for new market development and market expansion, for the development of export markets, for experimental purposes, for export to countries other than Canada, and Mexico, or which are donated to charitable organizations may be granted an exemption by the Board and will be exempt from §§ 930.41, 930.44, 930.51, 930.53, and §§ 930.55 through 930.57, subject to the following terms and conditions. Any information received of a confidential and/or proprietary nature included in this application will be protected from disclosure pursuant to § 930.73 of the order.
(b)
Definitions.
The terms in paragraph (a) of this section shall have the following meaning:
(1)
New product development.
This term includes the development of new tart cherry products or of foods or other products in which tart cherries or tart cherry products are incorporated which are not presently being produced on a commercial basis. New product development can also include the production or processing of a tart cherry product using a technique not presently being utilized commercially in the tart cherry industry; an end product of the processing of raw tart cherries done by the industry at pack time either for resale or for re-manufacturing which has not been manufactured previously by the industry; or a processed, value-added item that includes tart cherry products as an ingredient which has never been marketed to consumers either by a handler within the industry or by a food manufacturer. In addition, the maximum duration of any credit activity is five years from the date of the first shipment.
(2)
New market development and market expansion.
This includes the development of markets for tart cherry products which are not commercially established markets and which are not competitive with commercial outlets presently utilized by the tart cherry industry (including the development of new export markets):
Provided,
That these markets are a geographic area into which tart cherries or products derived from them have not been previously sold. The term “market expansion”, includes activities that incrementally expand the sale of either tart cherries or the products in which tart cherries are an ingredient, such as, but not limited to: Expansions of the geographic areas into which tart cherries or tart cherry products are marketed; product
line extensions; significant improvements to or revisions of existing products; packaging innovations; segmentation of markets along geographic, demographic, or other definable characteristics; and product repositionings. In addition, shipments of tart cherries or tart cherry products in new market development and market expansion outlets are eligible for handler diversion credit for a period of five years from the handler's date of the first shipment into such outlets.
(3)
Development of export markets.
The sale of cherries or cherry products, including the development of sales for new or different tart cherry products or the expansion of sales for existing tart cherry products, to countries other than Canada, and Mexico.
(4)
Experimental purposes.
The use of cherries or cherry products in preliminary and/or developmental activities intended to result in new products, new applications and/or new markets for tart cherry products. Any exemption for experimental work shall be limited in scope, duration and volume based on information supplied by the applicant at the time a request for exemption is made. In no case shall an individual exemption for experimental purposes last longer than five years or exceed 100,000 pounds raw product equivalent of tart cherries.
(c)
Obtaining approval for exempt uses.
In order to receive exemptions for cherries or cherry products utilized for exempt purposes, handlers must apply to the Board for a new exemption or for renewal of an existing exemption by November 1 for the next succeeding year, except for the 1997 year only, handlers may apply through February 5, 1998. A handler shall have one crop year to dispose of cherries or cherry products to exempt outlets approved by the Board, unless granted a renewal. Handlers applying to the Board for a new exemption or for renewal of an existing exemption are subject to the following conditions:
(1) When applying to the Board for an exemption for new product development, handlers must detail the nature of their new product, how it differs from current, existing products and the anticipated short- and long-term sales volume for the exemption. It will be the Board staff's responsibility to analyze and investigate any request and upon completion of that analysis authorize or deny the exemption.
(2) When applying to the Board for an exemption for new market development, handlers must detail the nature of their new market, how it differs from current, existing markets and the anticipated short- and long-term sales volume for the exemption. It will be the Board staff's responsibility to analyze and investigate any request and upon completion of that analysis authorize or deny the exemption.
(3) When applying to the Board for an exemption for the use of domestic tart cherry products in markets not currently served by the domestic industry, handlers may provide a verifiable statement from the buyer of its intent to use domestic tart cherry products to the Board staff for review in lieu of review by the subcommittee as detailed in paragraph (d) of this section. A verifiable statement is defined as a written statement from the buyer that it will use domestic tart cherries in products or markets not currently supplied by domestic sources, which will be reviewed and documented by Board staff.
(4) When applying to the Board for an exemption for the development of export markets for tart cherries or cherry products (including juice and juice concentrate) in countries other than Canada and Mexico, including the expansion of sales in existing export markets, handlers must detail the nature of their product, specify whether such product differs from current products being sold in export markets, and estimate the anticipated short- and long-term sales volumes for the requested exemption.
(5) When applying to the Board for an exemption for experimental purposes, handlers must indicate the preliminary and/or developmental experimental activity. Such experimental purposes should be intended to result in new products, new applications and/or new markets for existing tart cherry products. Any exemption for experimental work shall be limited in scope, duration and volume which the proposing party shall specify at the time a request for exemption is made. In no case
shall an exemption for experimental purposes last longer than five years or exceed 100,000 pounds raw product equivalent per handler of tart cherries during the duration of the experiment.
(6) To be eligible for new product, new market development and market expansion diversion exemptions, a handler must demonstrate involvement in the activity for which the exemptions are sought. The requesting handler must either be or have been involved in development of the product, the market, or market expansion activities for which the exemptions are sought or have had financial involvement in the activities. This involvement must be demonstrated and established to the satisfaction of the Board by the handler requesting the exemptions.
(d)
Review of applications.
A Board appointed subcommittee shall review applications for exemption or renewal of exemption and either approve or deny the exemption. The subcommittee shall consist of up to five total members, each having no handler affiliation but knowledge of the tart cherry industry, one of whom shall be the public member or the alternate public member if available to serve.

§ 930.163
Deferment of restricted obligation.
A handler may obtain a surety bond on restricted percentage cherries to be posted to temporarily defer the date that inventory reserves must be held. The surety bond must be posted at two times the market value of the quantity
of cherries for which the holding obligation is being deferred. The Board can temporarily defer the date inventory reserve cherries must be held to any date requested by the handler. However, this date shall not be later than 60 days prior to the end of the crop year. The deferment shall be conditioned on the execution and delivery by the handler to the Board of a written undertaking within 30 days after the Secretary announces the final restricted percentage under § 930.51. The written undertaking (required to be secured by a bond or bonds with a surety or sureties acceptable to the Board) must guarantee that on or prior to the deferment date requested by the handler the handler will have fully satisfied the restricted percentage obligation. On or prior to the deferment date requested by the handler, the handler will have to fully satisfy the restricted percentage obligation. In the event, a handler has posted the surety bond, reached the deferment date deadline and does not have cherries in the inventory reserve to cover his/her inventory reserve obligation, the bond will be forfeited to the Board. The Board will then buy cherries to fulfill that handler's obligation.

# Expenses and Assessments
§ 932.38
Expenses.
The committee is authorized to incur such expenses as the Secretary finds are reasonable and likely to be incurred by the committee for its maintenance and functioning and to enable it to exercise its powers and perform its duties in accordance with the provisions of this part. The funds to cover such expenses shall be acquired in the manner prescribed in § 932.39.
§ 932.39
Assessments.
(a) As each handler's pro rata share of the expenses which the Secretary finds are reasonable and likely to be incurred by the committee during a fiscal year, each handler who first handles olives during the current crop year shall pay to the committee, upon demand, assessments less any amounts which may be credited pursuant to § 932.45, on all olives to be used in the production of packaged olives, including olives to be used in canned ripe olives of the “tree-ripened” type or green olives when such are regulated as packaged olives pursuant to § 932.52. The payment of assessments for maintenance and functioning of the committee may be required under this part throughout the period it is in effect irrespective of whether particular provisions thereof are suspended or become inoperative.
(b) The Secretary shall fix the rate of assessment to be paid by each such handler during a fiscal year in an amount designed to secure sufficient funds to cover the expenses which may be incurred during such period. At any time during or after the fiscal year, the
Secretary may increase the rate of assessment in order to secure sufficient funds to cover any later finding by the Secretary relative to the expenses which may be incurred. Such increase shall be applied to all olives handled during the applicable crop year. In order to provide funds for the administration of the provisions of this part during the first part of a fiscal year before sufficient operation income is available from assessments, the committee may accept the payment of assessments in advance, and may also borrow money for such purpose.
(c) Any assessment not paid by a handler within a period of time prescribed by the committee may be subject to an interest or late payment charge, or both. The period of time, rate of interest and late payment charge shall be as recommended by the committee and approved by the Secretary. Subsequent to such approval, all assessments not paid within the prescribed period of time shall be subject to an interest or late payment charge or both.
[47 FR 32908, July 30, 1982, as amended at 47 FR 51093, Nov. 12, 1982; 88 FR 82232, Nov. 24, 2023]
§ 932.40
Accounting.
(a) If, at the end of a fiscal year, the assessments collected are in excess of expenses incurred, such excess shall be accounted for in accordance with one of the following:
(1) If such excess is not retained in a reserve as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the committee shall refund or credit to handler accounts the aforesaid excess. Each handler's share of such excess funds shall be the amount of assessments such handler has paid in excess of such handler's pro rata share of the actual net expenses of the committee for such fiscal year. Excess funds may be used temporarily by the committee to defray expenses of the subsequent fiscal year:
Provided,
That each handler's share of such excess shall be made available to the handler by the committee within five months after the end of the fiscal year.
(2) The committee, with the approval of the Secretary, may carry over such excess into subsequent fiscal years as a reserve:
Provided,
That funds already in the reserve do not exceed approximately one fiscal year's expenses. Such reserve funds may be used for any expenses authorized pursuant to § 932.38 and for necessary expenses of liquidation in the event of termination of this part. Upon such termination, any funds not required to defray the necessary expenses of liquidation shall be disposed of in such manner as the Secretary may determine to be appropriate:
Provided,
That to the extent practicable, such funds shall be returned pro rata to the persons from whom such funds were collected.
(b) All funds received by the committee pursuant to the provisions of this part shall be used solely for the purpose specified in this part and shall be accounted for in the manner provided in this part. The Secretary may at any time require the committee and its members to account for all receipts and disbursements.
(c) Upon the removal or expiration of the term of office of any member of the committee, such member shall account for all receipts and disbursements and deliver all property and funds in his possession to the committee, and shall execute such assignments and other instruments as may be necessary or appropriate to vest in the committee full title to all of the property, funds, and claims vested in such member pursuant to this part.

Provided,
That with respect to the 1982-83 crop year the committee shall hold a meeting for such purpose as soon as practicable. The committee shall prepare and submit to the Secretary promptly after each such meeting, a report setting forth its recommended marketing policy for the ensuing crop year. In the event it becomes advisable to modify such policy, because of changed supply, demand, or other conditions, the committee shall formulate a new policy and shall submit a report thereon to the Secretary. In developing the marketing policy, the committee shall give consideration to the handler carryover, production, probable quality and composition of olive sizes in the crop, trade demand, probable imports,
whether producer prices are likely to exceed parity, the probable assessable tonnage and such other factors as may have a bearing on the marketing of olives or the administration of this part. Notice of the committee's marketing policy, and of any modifications thereof, shall be given promptly by reasonable publicity to producers and handlers.

(a)
Exempt use.
Each person who imports or receives any of the commodities listed in paragraphs (a)(1) through (5) of this section shall file (electronically or paper) an “Importer's Exempt Commodity Form” (SC-6) with the Market Development Division, Specialty Crops Program, AMS, USDA. A “person who imports” may include a customs broker, acting as an importer's representative (hereinafter referred to as “importer”). A copy of the completed form (electronic or paper) shall be provided to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection. If a paper form is used, a copy of the form shall accompany the lot to the exempt outlet specified on the form. Any lot of any commodity offered for inspection and, all or a portion thereof, subsequently imported as exempt under this provision shall also be reported on an SC-6 form. Such form (electronic or paper) shall be provided to the Market Development Division in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section. The applicable commodities are:
(1) Avocados, grapefruit, kiwifruit, olives, oranges, prune variety plums (fresh prunes) and table grapes for consumption by charitable institutions or distribution by relief agencies;

(3) Olives for processing into oil;
(4) Grapefruit for animal feed; or

(b)
Certification of exempt use.
(1) Each importer of an exempt commodity as specified in paragraph (a) of this section shall certify on the SC-6 form (electronic or paper) as to the intended exempt outlet (
e.g.,
processing, charity, livestock feed). If certification is made using a paper SC-6 form, the importer shall provide a handwritten signature on the form.
(2) Each receiver of an exempt commodity as specified in paragraph (a) of this section shall also receive a copy of the associated SC-6 form (electronic or paper) filed by the importer. Within two days of receipt of the exempt lot, the receiver shall certify on the form (electronic or paper) that such lot has been received and will be utilized in the exempt outlet as certified by the importer. If certification is made using a paper SC-6 form, the receiver shall provide a handwritten signature on the form.
(c)
Disposition.
It is the responsibility of the importer to notify the Market Development Division of any lot of exempt commodity rejected by a receiver, shipped to an alternative exempt receiver, exported, or otherwise destroyed. In such cases, a second SC-6 form must be filed by the importer, providing sufficient information to determine ultimate disposition of the exempt lot, and such disposition shall be so certified by the final receiver.
(d)
Filing.
All SC-6 forms and other correspondence regarding entry of exempt commodities must be submitted electronically, by mail, or by fax to the Market Development Division, Specialty Crops Program, AMS, USDA, 1400 Independence Avenue SW, STOP 0237, Washington, DC 20250-0237; telephone (202) 720-2491; email

§ 945.40

Handlers shall share such expenses upon the basis of a fiscal period. Each handler's share of such expense shall be proportionate to the ratio between the total quantity of potatoes handled by him as the first handler thereof during a fiscal period and the total quantity of potatoes handled by all handlers as first handlers thereof during the same period.
§ 945.41
Budget.
At the beginning of each fiscal period, and as may be necessary thereafter, the committee shall prepare an estimated budget of income and expenditures necessary for the administration of this part. The committee may recommend a rate of assessment calculated to provide adequate funds to defray its proposed expenses as authorized in § 945.40. The committee shall present such budget promptly to the Secretary with an accompanying report showing the basis for its calculations.
§ 945.42
Assessments.
(a) The funds to cover the committee's expenses pursuant to § 945.40 shall be acquired by the levying of assessments upon handlers as provided in this subpart. Each handler who ships potatoes as the first handler thereof shall pay assessments to the committee upon demand, which assessments shall be in payment of such handler's pro rata share of such expenses.
(b) Assessments shall be levied upon handlers at a rate per hundredweight of potatoes or equivalent established by the Secretary. Such rate may be established upon the basis of the committee's budget recommendations, and other available information.
(c) At any time during or subsequent to a given fiscal period, the committee may recommend the approval of an amended budget and an increase in the rate of assessment. Upon the basis of such recommendation, or other available information, the Secretary may approve an amended budget and increase the rate of assessment. Such increase shall be applicable to all potatoes assessable under this part and handled by the first handler thereof during such fiscal period.
(d) The committee may impose a late payment charge or an interest charge, or both, on any handler who fails to pay, on or before the due date established by the Secretary, the total assessment for which such handler is liable. Such due date and the late payment fee and interest rate shall be recommended by the committee and approved by the Secretary.
(e) In order to provide funds to carry out its function, after the effective date of this subpart the committee may accept advance assessments from handlers. Advance assessments received from a handler shall be credited toward assessments levied against that handler during that fiscal period. In the case of an extreme emergency, the committee may also borrow money on a short-term basis to provide funds for the administration of this part. Any such borrowed money shall only be used to meet the committee's current financial obligations, and the committee shall repay all borrowed money by the end of the next fiscal period from assessment income.
[23 FR 5709, July 30, 1958. Redesignated at 26 FR 12751, Dec. 30, 1961, as amended at 60 FR 29727, June 5, 1995; 88 FR 82234, Nov. 24, 2023]

Accounting.

(b) The Secretary may at any time require the committee, its members and alternates, employees, agents, and
all other persons to account for all receipts and disbursements, funds, property, and records for which they are responsible. Whenever any person ceases to be a member or alternate of the committee, he shall account for all receipts, disbursements, funds, and property (including but not limited to books and other records) pertaining to the committee's activities for which he is responsible, and deliver all such property and funds in his hands to such successor, agency, or person as may be designated by the Secretary, and shall execute such assignments and other instruments as may be necessary or appropriate to vest in such successor, agency, or designated person, the right to all of such property and funds and all claims vested in such person.
(c) The committee may make recommendations to the Secretary for one or more of the members thereof, or any other person or persons to act as trustee or trustees for holding records, funds, or any other committee property during periods of suspension of this part, or during any period or periods when regulations are not in effect and, if the Secretary determines such action appropriate, he may direct that such person or persons shall act as trustee or trustees for the committee.
§ 945.44
Excess funds.
(a) The funds remaining at the end of a fiscal period which are in excess of the expenses necessary for committee operations during such period may be carried over, with the approval of the Secretary, into following periods as a reserve. Such reserve shall be established at an amount not to exceed approximately one fiscal period's budgeted expenses. Funds in such reserve shall be available for use by the committee for expenses authorized under § 945.40.
(b) Funds in excess of those placed in the operating reserve shall be credited proportionately against a handler's operations of the following fiscal period, except that if the handler demands payment, such proportionate refund shall be paid to such handler.
(c) Upon termination of this part, any funds not required to defray the necessary expenses of liquidation shall be disposed of in such manner as the Secretary may determine to be appropriate. To the extent practical, such funds shall be returned pro rata to the persons from whom such funds were collected.
[23 FR 5709, July 30, 1958. Redesignated at 26 FR 12751, Dec. 30, 1961, as amended at 53 FR 3189, Feb. 4, 1988]

(a) During any period in which regulations are in effect pursuant to § 945.42, § 945.52, or § 945.53, or any combination thereof, no handler shall handle potatoes unless such potatoes are inspected by an authorized representative of the Federal-State Inspection Service, and are covered by a valid inspection certificate, except when relieved from such requirements pursuant to recommendations by the committee and approved by the Secretary.
(b) Regrading, resorting, or repacking any lot of potatoes shall invalidate any prior inspection certificates covering such potatoes insofar as the requirements of this section are concerned. During any period in which shipments of potatoes are regulated, as aforesaid, no handler shall handle potatoes after they have been regraded, resorted, repacked, or in any way further prepared for market, unless such potatoes are inspected and covered by a valid inspection certificate as required in paragraph (a) of this section.
(c) Insofar as the requirements of this section are concerned, the length of time for which an inspection certificate shall be valid may be established by the committee with the approval of the Secretary; and such length of time may be different for shipments for different purposes.

other instruments necessary or appropriate to vest in such person full title and right to all of the funds, property, and claims vested in the committee or the trustees pursuant thereto.

# Certificates of Privilege
§ 945.120
General.
Whenever shipments of potatoes for special purposes pursuant to § 945.53 are relieved in whole or in part from grade and size regulations issued under § 945.52 the committee shall require information and evidence as to the manner, methods, and timing of such shipments as safeguards against the entry of any such potatoes into trade channels other than those for which intended. Such information and evidence shall include the requirements set forth below with respect to Certificates of Privilege.
§ 945.121
Qualification.
Before handling potatoes for special purposes which do not meet regulations issued pursuant to § 945.52 a handler must qualify with the committee to handle shipments for special purposes. To qualify he must (a) apply for and receive a Certificate of Privilege indicating his intent to so handle potatoes; (b) agree to comply with reporting and other requirements set forth in §§ 945.121 to 945.125, inclusive, with respect to such shipments; and (c) receive approval of the committee, or its duly authorized agents, to so handle potatoes. Such approval will be based upon evidence furnished in his application for a Certificate of Privilege, and other information available to the committee.
§ 945.122
Application.
(a) Application for a Certificate of Privilege shall be made on forms furnished by the committee. Each application may contain, but need not be limited to, the name and address of the handler; the quantity by grade, size, quality and variety of the potatoes to be shipped; the mode of transportation; the consignee; the destination; the purpose for which the potatoes are to be used; a certification to the United States Department of Agriculture and to the committee as to the truthfulness of the information shown thereon; and any other appropriate information or documents deemed necessary by the committee or its duly authorized agents for the purpose stated in § 945.120.

§ 945.123
Approval.
The committee or its duly authorized agents shall give prompt consideration to each application for a Certificate of Privilege. Approval of an application, based upon a determination as to whether the information contained therein and other information available to the committee supports approval, shall be evidenced by the issuance of a Certificate of Privilege to the applicant. Each certificate shall cover a specified period, and specified qualities and quantities of potatoes to be sold or transported to the designated consignee for the purposes declared.
§ 945.124
Reports.
Each handler of potatoes shipping under Certificates of Privilege shall supply the committee with reports as requested by the committee or its duly authorized agents showing the name and address of the shipper; the car or truck identification; the loading point; destination; consignee; the inspection certificate number when inspection is required; and any other information deemed necessary by the committee.
§ 945.125
Disqualification.
The committee from time to time may conduct surveys of handling of potatoes for special purposes requiring Certificates of Privilege to determine whether handlers are complying with the requirements and regulations applicable to such certificates. Whenever the committee finds that a handler or consignee is failing to comply with requirements and regulations applicable to handling of potatoes in special outlets, and requiring such certificates, a Certificate or Certificates of Privilege issued such handler may be rescinded and further certificates denied. Such disqualification shall apply to, and not exceed, a reasonable period of time as determined by the committee but in no event shall it extend beyond the end of the succeeding fiscal period. Any handler who has a certificate rescinded or denied may appeal to the committee in writing for reconsideration of his disqualification.

Provided,
That a valid inspection certificate, numbered notesheet, or shipping clearance report is not required to accompany positive lot identified potatoes.

The destination zip codes shall be included on the inspection certificates. The destination zip codes and the quantity shall be provided by the handler to the Committee on lots which are positive lot identified, either orally or in writing. Whenever potatoes are diverted to a different destination, the handler shall notify the Committee of the new destination zip code and quantity orally or in writing as soon as practicable.

Definitions.
The terms
U.S. Extra No. 1, U.S. No. 1, U.S. No. 2, Size B, fairly clean, moderately skinned,

slightly skinned
shall have the same meaning as when used in the United States Standards for Potatoes (7 CFR 51.1540-51.1566), including the tolerances set forth therein. The term
prepeeling
means the commercial preparation in a prepeeling plant of clean, sound, fresh potatoes by washing, peeling, or otherwise removing the outer skin, trimming, sorting, and properly treating to prevent discoloration preparatory to sale in one or more of the styles of peeled potatoes described in § 52.2422 of the United States Standards for Peeled Potatoes (7 CFR 52.2421-52.2433). The term
other processing
has the same meaning as the term appearing in the act and includes, but is not restricted to, potatoes for dehydration, chips, shoestrings, starch, and flour. It includes only that preparation of potatoes for market which involves the application of heat or cold to such an extent that the natural form or stability of the commodity undergoes a substantial change. The act of peeling, cooling, slicing, dicing, or applying material to prevent oxidation does not constitute “other processing.” The terms
Idaho Utility
grade and
Oregon Utility
grade shall have the same meaning as when used in the standards for potatoes for the respective State. Other terms used in this section shall have the same meaning as when used in Marketing Agreement No. 98 and Order No. 945, both as amended.
