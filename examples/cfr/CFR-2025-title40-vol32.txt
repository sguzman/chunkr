refers to title 40, part 425, section 01.

# Explanation
The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.
Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:
Title 1 through Title 16
as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27
as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41
as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50
as of October 1
The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.

# LEGAL STATUS
The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

# HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS
The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, July 1, 2025), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

# EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES
Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.

# OMB CONTROL NUMBERS
The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request.
Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.

# PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE
Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.

# “[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY
The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not dropped in error.

# INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE
What is incorporation by reference?
Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.
What is a proper incorporation by reference?
The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:
(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.
(b) The matter incorporated is adequately summarized in the preamble of the final rule and is available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.
(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?
If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or email fr.inspection@nara.gov.

# CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES
A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR
Index and Finding Aids.
This volume contains the Parallel Table of Authorities and Rules. A list of CFR titles, chapters, subchapters, and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in this volume.
An index to the text of “Title 3—The President” is carried within that volume.
The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. This index is based on a consolidation of the “Contents” entries in the daily Federal Register.
A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

# REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL
There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing in the Code of Federal Regulations.

# General Provisions
§ 425.01
Applicability.
This part applies to any leather tanning and finishing facility which discharges or may discharge process wastewater pollutants to the waters of the United States, or which introduces or may introduce process wastewater pollutants into a publicly owned treatment works.
§ 425.02
General definitions.
In addition to the definitions set forth in 40 CFR part 401, the following definitions apply to this part:
(a) “Sulfide” shall mean total sulfide as measured by the potassium ferricyanide titration method described in appendix A or the modified Monier-Williams method described in appendix B.
(b) “Hide” means any animal pelt or skin as received by a tannery as raw material to be processed.
(c) “Retan-wet finish” means the final processing steps performed on a tanned hide including, but not limited to, the following wet processes: retan, bleach, color, and fatliquor.
(d) “Hair pulp” means the removal of hair by chemical dissolution.
(e) “Hair save” means the physical or mechanical removal of hair which has not been chemically dissolved, and either selling the hair as a by-product or disposing of it as a solid waste.
(f) “Chrome tan” means the process of converting hide into leather using a form of chromium.
(g) “Vegetable tan” means the process of converting hides into leather using chemicals either derived from vegetable matter or synthesized to produce effects similar to those chemicals.
(h) “Raw material” means the hides received by the tannery except for facilities covered by subpart D and subpart I where “raw material” means the hide or split in the condition in which it is first placed into a wet process.
(i) “Monthly average” means the arithmetic average of eight (8) individual data points from effluent sampling and analysis during any calendar month.
(j) “Interference” means the discharge of sulfides in quantities which can result in human health hazards and/or risks to human life, and an inhibition or disruption of POTW as defined in 40 CFR 403.3(i).
[47 FR 52870, Nov. 23, 1982, as amended at 53 FR 9181, Mar. 21, 1988]
§ 425.03
Sulfide analytical methods and applicability.
(a) The potassium ferricyanide titration method described in appendix A to part 425 shall be used whenever practicable for the determination of sulfide in wastewaters discharged by plants operating in all subcategories except the hair save or pulp, non-chrome tan, retan-wet finish subcategory (subpart C,
see
§ 425.30). In all other cases, the modified Monier-Williams method as described in appendix B to part 425 shall be used as an alternative to the potassium ferricyanide titration method for the determination of sulfide in wastewaters discharged by plants operating in all subcategories except subpart C.
(b) The modified Monier-Williams method as described in appendix B to part 425 shall be used for the determination of sulfide in wastewaters discharged by plants operating in the hair save or pulp, non-chrome tan, retan-wet finish subcategory (subpart C,
see
§ 425.30).
[53 FR 9181, Mar. 21, 1988]
§ 425.04
Applicability of sulfide pretreatment standards.
(a) A POTW receiving wastewater from a facility subject to this part may require more stringent pretreatment standards for sulfide than those established by this part without EPA approval.
(b) The pretreatment standards for sulfide established by this part will not apply if the POTW receiving wastewater from a facility subject to this part certifies in writing with explanation of relevant factors considered, in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section, that the discharge of sulfide from the facility does not interfere with the operation of the POTW. In making this determination, the POTW shall consider all relevant factors including but not limited to the following:
(1) The presence and characteristics, of other industrial wastewaters which can increase or decrease sulfide concentrations, pH, or both.
(2) The characteristics of the sewer/interceptor collection system which either minimize or enhance opportunities for release of hydrogen sulfide gas.
(3) The characteristics of the receiving POTWs headworks, preliminary and primary treatment systems, and sludge holding and dewatering facilities which either minimize or enhance opportunities for release of hydrogen sulfide gas.
(4) The occurrence of any prior sulfide related interference as defined in § 425.02(j).
(c)(1) On October 13, 1983, a POTW which intends to certify that the sulfide pretreatment standard should not apply must publish, in a local newspaper with the largest circulation, a notice that presents the findings supporting this determination consistent with paragraph (a) of this section. Allowance for public hearing of these findings also must be provided. The POTW shall identify all existing facilities to which the sulfide pretreatment standard otherwise established by this part would not apply.
(2) On January 11, 1984, a POTW which intends to certify that the sulfide pretreatment standard should not apply must file a written certification with the Regional Water Management Division Director, Environmental Protection Agency, in the appropriate Regional Office. This certification shall include the findings supporting this determination and the results of public comments, and public hearing(s) if held.
(3) On February 10, 1984, EPA shall acknowledge to the POTW receipt of any certification submitted under paragraphs (c) (1) and (2) of this section, and shall indicate to the POTW the adequacy of the submission based upon a review of the factors set forth in paragraph (b) of this section.
(4) Within 30 days of the date of receipt of adequate submissions under paragraphs (c) (1), (2), and (3) of this section, EPA shall publish a notice in the
Federal Register
identifying those facilities to which the sulfide pretreatment standards of this part shall not apply.

# Appendix A to Part 425—Potassium Ferricyanide Titration Method

# Source
The potassium ferricyanide titration method is based on method SLM 4/2 described in “Official Method of Analysis,” Society of Leather Trades' Chemists, Fourth Revised Edition, Redbourn, Herts., England, 1965.

# Outline of Method
The buffered sulfide solution is titrated with standard potassium ferricyanide solution in the presence of a ferrous dimethylglyoxime ammonia complex. The sulfide is oxidized to sulfur. Sulfite interferes and must be precipitated with barium chloride. Thiosulfate is not titrated under the conditions of the determination (Charlot, “Ann. chim, anal,”, 1945, 27, 153; Booth; “J. Soc. Leather Trades' Chemists,” 1956, 40, 238).

# Apparatus
Burrette, 10 ml.

# Reagents
1. Preparation of 0.02N potassium ferricyanide; Weigh to the nearest tenth of a gram
6.6 g. of analytical reagent grade potassium ferricyanide and dissolve in 1 liter distilled water. Store in an amber bottle in the dark. Prepare fresh each week.
2. Standardization of ferricyanide solution: Transfer 50 ml. of solution to a 250 ml. Erlenmeyer flask. Add several crystals of potassium iodide (about 1 g.), mix gently to dissolve, add 1 ml. of 6N hydrochloric acid, stopper the flask, and swirl gently. Let stand for two minutes, add 10 ml. of a 30 percent zinc sulfate solution, and titrate the mixture containing the gelatinous precipitate with standardized sodium thiosulfate or phenylarsine oxide titrant in the range of 0.025-0.050N Add 1 ml. of starch indicator solution after the color has faded to a pale yellow, and continue the titration to the disappearance of the blue color. Calculate the normality of the ferricyanide solution using the equation:
ER25SE06.000
3. Preparation of 6M ammonium chloride buffer, pH 9.3: Dissolve 200 g. ammonium chloride in approximately 500 ml. distilled water, add 200 ml. 14M reagent grade ammonium hydroxide and make up to 1 liter with distilled water. The buffer should be prepared in a hood. Store in a tightly stoppered container.
4. Preparation of 0.05M barium chloride solution: Dissolve 12-13 g. barium chloride dihydrate in 1 liter of distilled water.
5. Preparation of ferrous dimethylglyoxime indicator solution: Mix 10 ml. 0.6 percent ferrous sulfate, 50 ml. 1 percent dimethylglyoxime in ethanol, and 0.5 ml. concentrated sulfuric acid.
6. Preparation of stock sulfide standard, 1000 ppm: Dissolve 2.4 g. reagent grade sodium sulfide in 1 liter of distilled water. Store in a tightly stoppered container. Diluted working standards must be prepared fresh daily and their concentrations determined by EPA test procedure 376.1 (see 40 CFR 136.3, Table IB, parameter 66 (49 FR 43234, October 26, 1984, with correction notice at 50 FR 690, January 4, 1985)) immediately prior to use.
7. Preparation of 10N NaOH: Dissolve 400 g. of analytical reagent grade NaOH in 1 liter distilled water.

# Sample Preservation and Storage
Samples are to be field filtered (gravity or pressure) with coarse filter paper (Whatman 4 or equivalent) immediately after collection. Filtered samples must be preserved by adjustment to pH
12 with 10N NaOH. Sample containers must be covered tightly and stored at 4 °C until analysis. Samples must be analyzed within 48 hours of collection. If these procedures cannot be achieved, it is the laboratory's responsibility to institute quality control procedures that will provide documentation of sample integrity.

# Procedure
1. Transfer 100 ml. of sample to be analyzed, or a suitable portion containing not more than 15 mg. sulfide supplemented to 100 ml. with distilled water, to a 250 ml. Erlenmeyer flask.
2. Adjust the sample to pH 8.5-9.5 with 6N HC1.
3. Add 20 ml. of 6M ammonium chloride buffer (pH 9.3), 1 ml. of ferrous dimethylglyoxime indicator, and 25 ml. of 0.05M barium chloride. Mix gently, stopper, and let stand for 10 minutes.
4. After 10 minutes titrate with standardized potassium ferricyanide to disappearance of pink color. The endpoint is reached when there is no reappearance of the pink color after 30 seconds.

# Calculation and Reporting of Results.
ER25SE06.007
where A = volume in ml. of potassium ferricyanide solution used,
and B = normality of potassium ferricyanide solution.
2. Report results to two significant figures.

# Quality Control
1. Each laboratory that uses this method is required to operate a formal quality control program. The minimum requirements of this program consist of an initial demonstration of laboratory capability and the analysis of replicate and spiked samples as a continuing check on performance. The laboratory is required to maintain performance records to define the quality of data that is generated. Ongoing performance checks must be compared with established performance criteria to determine if the results of analyses are within precision and accuracy limits expected of the method.
2. Before performing any analyses, the analyst must demonstrate the ability to generate acceptable precision and accuracy with this method by performing the following operations.
(a) Perform four replicate analyses of a 20 mg./l. sulfide standard prepared in distilled water (see paragraph 6 under “Reagents” above).
(b)(1) Calculate clean water precision and accuracy in accordance with standard statistical procedures. Clean water acceptance limits are presented in paragraph 2(b)(2) below. These criteria must be met or exceeded before sample analyses can be initiated. A clean water standard must be analyzed with each sample set and the established criteria met for the analysis to be considered under control.
(2) Clean water precision and accuracy acceptance limits: For distilled water samples containing from 5 mg./l. to 50 mg./l. sulfide, the mean concentration from four replicate analyses must be within the range of 50 to 110 percent of the true value.
3. The Method Detection Limits (MDL) should be determined periodically by each participating laboratory in accordance with the procedures specified in “Methods for Chemical Analysis of Municipal and Industrial Wastewater,” EPA-660/4-82-057, July 1982, EMSL, Cincinnati, OH 45268. For the convenience of the user, these procedures are contained in appendix C to part 425.
4. A minimum of one spiked and one duplicate sample must be performed for each analytical event, or five percent spikes and five percent duplicates when the number of samples per event exceeds twenty. Spike levels are to be at the MDL (see paragraph 3 above for MDL samples) and at x where x is the concentration found if in excess of the MDL. Spike recovery must be 40 to 120 percent for the analysis of a particular matrix type to be considered valid. If a sample or matrix type provides performance outside these acceptance limits, the analyses must be repeated using the modified Monier-Williams procedures described in appendix B to this part.
5. Report results in mg./liter. When duplicate and spiked samples are analyzed, report all data with the sample results.

# Appendix B to Part 425—Modified Monier-Williams Method

# Outline of Method
Hydrogen sulfide is liberated from an acidified sample by distillation and purging with nitrogen gas (N
2
). Sulfur dioxide interference is removed by scrubbing the nitrogen gas stream in a pH 7 buffer solution. The sulfide gas is collected by passage through an alkaline hydrogen peroxide scrubbing solution in which it is oxidized to sulfate. Sulfate concentration in the scrubbing solution is determined by either EPA gravimetric test procedure 375.3 or EPA turbidimetric test procedure 375.4 (see 40 CFR 136.3, Table IB, parameter 65 (49 FR 43234, October 26, 1984, and correction notice at 50 FR 690, January 4, 1985)).

8. Preparation of stock sulfide standard, 1000 ppm.: Dissolve 2.4 g. reagent grade sodium sulfide in 1 liter of distilled water. Store in a tightly stoppered container. Diluted working standards must be prepared fresh daily and their concentrations determined by EPA test procedure 376.1 immediately prior to use (see 40 CFR 136.3, Table IB, parameter 66 (49 FR 43234, October 26, 1984, and correction notice at 50 FR 690, January 4, 1985)).

# Sample Preservation and Storage
Preserve unfiltered wastewater samples immediately after collection by adjustment to pH
9 with 6N NaOH and addition of 2 ml. of 2N zinc acetate per liter. This amount of zinc acetate is adequate to preserve 64 mg./l. sulfide under ideal conditions. Sample containers must be covered tightly and stored at 4 °C until analysis. Samples must be analyzed within seven days of collection. If these procedures cannot be achieved, it is the laboratory's responsibility to institute quality control procedures that will provide documentation of sample integrity.

# Procedure (See Figure 1 for apparatus layout.)
1. Place 50 ml. of 0.05M pH 7.0 potassium phosphate buffer in Trap No. 1.
2. Place 50 ml. of alkaline 3 percent hydrogen peroxide in Trap No. 2.
3. Sample introduction and N
2
prepurge: Gently mix sample to be analyzed to resuspend settled material, taking care not to aerate the sample. Transfer 400 ml. of sample, or a suitable portion containing not more than 20 mg. sulfide diluted to 400 ml. with distilled water, to the distillation flask. Adjust the N
2
flow so that the impingers are frothing vigorously, but not overflowing. Vaccum may be applied at the outlet of Trap No. 2 to assist in smooth purging. The N
2
inlet tube of the distillation flask must be submerged deeply in the sample to ensure efficient agitation. Purge the sample for 30 minutes without applying heat. Test the apparatus for leaks during the prepurge cycle (Snoop or soap water solution).
4. Volatilization of H
2
S: Interrupt the N
2
flow (and vacuum) and introduce 100 ml. of 6N HCl to the sample using the separatory funnel. Immediately resume the gas flow (and vacuum). Apply maximum heat with the heating mantle until the sample begins to boil, then reduce heat and maintain gentle boiling and N
2
flow for 30 minutes. Terminate the distillation cycle by turning off the heating mantle and maintaining N
2
flow through the system for 5 to 10 minutes. Then turn off the N
2
flow (and release vacuum) and
cautiously
vent the system by placing 50 to 100 ml. of distilled water in the separatory funnel and opening the stopcock carefully. When the bubbling stops and the system is equalized to atmospheric pressure, remove the separatory funnel. Extreme care must be exercised in terminating the distillation cycle to avoid flash-over, draw-back, or violent steam release.
5. Analysis: Analyze the contents of Trap No. 2 for sulfate according to either EPA gravimetric test procedure 375.3 or EPA turbidimetric test procedure 375.4 (see 40 CFR 136.3, Table IB, parameter 65 (49 FR 43234, October 26, 1984, and correction notice at 50 FR 690, January 4, 1985)). Use the result to calculate mg./l. of sulfide in wastewater sample.

# Quality Control
1. Each laboratory that uses this method is required to operate a formal quality control program. The minimum requirements of this program consist of an initial demonstration of laboratory capability and the analysis of replicate and spiked samples as a continuing check on performance. The laboratory is required to maintain performance records to define the quality of data that is generated. Ongoing performance checks must be compared with established performance criteria to determine if the results of analyses are within precision and accuracy limits expected of the method.
2. Before performing any analyses, the analyst must demonstrate the ability to generate acceptable accuracy and precision by performing the following operations.
(a) Perform four replicate analyses of a 20 mg./l. sulfide standard prepared in distilled water (see paragraph 8 under “Reagents” above).
(b)(1) Calculate clean water precision and accuracy in accordance with standard statistical procedures. Clean water acceptance limits are presented in paragraph 2(b)(2) below. These criteria must be met or exceeded before sample analyses can be initiated. A clean water standard must be analyzed with each sample set and the established criteria met for the analyses to be considered under control.
(2) Clean water precision and accuracy acceptance limits: For distilled water samples containing from 5 mg./l. to 50 mg./l. sulfide, the mean concentration from four replicate analyses must be within the range of 72 to 114 percent of the true value.
3. The Method Detection Limit (MDL) should be determined periodically by each participating laboratory in accordance with the procedures specified in “Methods for Chemical Analysis of Municipal and Industrial Wastewater,” EPA-600/4-82-057, July 1982, EMSL, Cincinnati, OH 45268. For the convenience of the user, these procedures are contained in appendix C to part 425.
4. A minimum of one spiked and one duplicate sample must be run for each analytical event, or five percent spikes and five percent duplicates when the number of samples per event exceeds twenty. Spike levels are to be at the MDL (see paragraph 3 above for MDL samples) and at x when x is the concentration found if in excess of the MDL. Spike recovery must be 60 to 120 percent for the analysis of a particular matrix type to be considered valid.
5. Report all results in mg./liter. When duplicate and spiked samples are analyzed, report all data with the sample results.

# Appendix C to Part 425—Definition and Procedure for the Determination of the Method Detection Limit
1
The
method detection limit (MDL) is defined at the minimum concentration of a substance that can be identified, measured and reported with 99 percent confidence that the analyte concentration is greater than zero and determined from analysis of a sample in a given matrix containing analyte.

Source: “Methods for Chemical Analysis of Municipal and Industrial Wastewater,” EPA-600/4-82-057, July 1982, EMSL, Cincinnati, OH 45268

# Scope and Application
This procedure is designed for applicability to a wide variety of sample types ranging from reagent (blank) water containing analyte to wastewater containing analyte. The MDL for an analytical procedure may vary as a function of sample type. The procedure requires a complete, specific and well defined analytical method. It is essential that all sample processing steps of the analytical method be included in the determination of the method detection limit.
The MDL obtained by this procedure is used to judge the significance of a single measurement of a future sample.
The MDL procedure was designed for applicability to a broad variety of physical and chemical methods. To accomplish this, the procedure was made device- or instrument-independent.

# Procedure
1. Make an estimate of the detection limit using one of the following:
(a) The concentration value that corresponds to an instrument signal/noise ratio in the range of 2.5 to 5. If the criteria for qualitative identification of the analyte is based upon pattern recognition techniques, the least abundant signal necessary to achieve identification must be considered in making the estimate.
(b) The concentration value that corresponds to three times the standard deviation of replicate instrumental measurements for the analyte in reagent water.
(c) The concentration value that corresponds to the region of the standard curve where there is a significant change in sensitivity at low analyte concentrations,
i.e.
, a break in the slope of the standard curve.
(d) The concentration value that corresponds to known instrumental limitations.
It is recognized that the experience of the analyst is important to this process. However, the analyst must include the above considerations in the estimate of the detection limit.
2. Prepare reagent (blank) water that is as free of analyte as possible. Reagent or interference free water is defined as a water sample in which analyte and interferent concentrations are not detected at the method detection limit of each analyte of interest. Interferences are defined as systematic errors in the measured analytical signal of an established procedure caused by the presence of interfering species (interferent). The interferent concentration is presupposed to be normally distributed in representative samples of a given matrix.
3. (a) If the MDL is to be determined in reagent water (blank), prepare a laboratory
standard (analyte in reagent water) at a concentration which is at least equal to or in the same concentration range as the estimated MDL. (Recommended between 1 and 5 times the estimated MDL.) Proceed to Step 4.
(b) If the MDL is to be determined in another sample matrix, analyze the sample. If the measured level of the analyte is in the recommended range of one to five times the estimated MDL, proceed to Step 4.
If the measured concentration of analyte is less than the estimated MDL, add a known amount of analyte to bring the concentration of analyte to between one and five times the MDL. In the case where an interference is coanalyzed with the analyte:
If the measured level of analyte is greater than five times the estimated MDL, there are two options:
(1) Obtain another sample of lower level of analyte in same matrix if possible.
(2) The sample may be used as is for determining the MDL if the analyte level does not exceed 10 times the MDL of the analyte in reagent water. The variance of the analytical method changes as the analyte concentration increases from the MDL, hence the MDL determined under these circumstances may not truly reflect method variance at lower analyte concentrations.
4. (a) Take a minimum of seven aliquots of the sample to be used to calculate the MDL and process each through the entire anlaytical method. Make all computations according to the defined method with final results in the method reporting units. If blank measurements are required to calculate the measured level of analyte, obtain separate blank measurements for each sample aliquot anlayzed. The average blank measurement is subtracted from the respective sample measurements.
(b) It may be economically and technically desirable to evaluate the estimated MDL before proceeding with 4a. This will: (1) Prevent repeating this entire procedure when the costs of analyses are high and (2) insure that the procedure is being conducted at the correct concentration. It is quite possible that an incorrect MDL can be calculated from data obtained at many times the real MDL even though the background concentration of analyte is less than five times the calculated MDL. To insure that the estimate of the MDL is a good estimate, it is necessary to determine that a lower concentration of analyte will not result in a significantly lower MDL. Take two aliquots of the sample to be used to calculate the MDL and process each through the entire method, including blank measurements as described above in 4a. Evaluate these data:
(1) If these measurements indicate the sample is in the desirable range for determining the MDL, take five additional aliquots and proceed. Use all seven measurements to calculate the MDL.
(2) If these measurements indicate the sample is not in the correct range, reestimate the MDL, obtain new sample as in 3 and repeat either 4a or 4b.
5. Calculate the variance (S
2
) and standard deviation (S) of the replicate measurements, as follows:
112a.eps
where: the x
i
, i = 1 to n are the analytical results in the final method reporting units obtained from the n sample aliquots and
112b.eps
refers to the sum of the X values from i = 1 to n.
6. (a) Compute the MDL as follows:
MDL = t(
n−1,1−a = .99
) (S)
where:
MDL = the method detection
t
(n-1, 1-a = .99) = the students' t value appropriate for a 99 percent confidence level and a standard deviation estimate with n-1 degrees of freedom. See Table.
S = standard deviation of the replicate analyses.
(b) The 95 percent confidence limits for the MDL derived in 6a are computed according to the following equations derived from percentiles of the chi square over degrees of freedom distribution (X2/df) and calculated as follows:
MDL
LCL
= 0.69 MDL
MDL
UCL
= 1.92 MDL where MDL
LCL
and MDL
UCL
are the lower and upper 95 percent confidence limits respectively based on seven aliquots.
7. Optional iterative procedure to verify the reasonableness of the estimated MDL and calculated MDL of subsequent MDL determinations.
(a) If this is the initial attempt to compute MDL based on the estimated MDL in Step 1, take the MDL as calculated in Step 6, spike in the matrix at the calculated MDL and proceed through the procedure starting with Step 4.
(b) If the current MDL determination is an iteration of the MDL procedure for which the spiking level does not permit qualitative identification, report the MDL as that concentration between the current spike level
and the previous spike level which allows qualitative identification.
(c) If the current MDL determination is an iteration of the MDL procedure and the spiking level allows qualitative identification, use S
2
from the current MDL calculation and S
2
from the previous MDL calculation to compute the F ratio.
114a.eps
then compute the pooled standard deviation by the following equation:
114b.eps
114c.eps
respike at the last calculated MDL and process the samples through the procedure starting with Step 4.
(d) Use the S
pooled
as calculated in 7b to compute the final MDL according to the following equation:
MDL = 2.681 (S
pooled
)
where 2.681 is equal to
t
(12, 1 −a = .99)
(e) The 95 percent confidence limits for MDL derived in 7c are computed according to the following equations derived from percentiles of the chi squared over degrees of freedom distribution.
MDL
LCL
= 0.72 MDL
MDL
UCL
= 1.65 MDL
where LCL and UCL are the lower and upper 95 percent confidence limits respectively based on 14 aliquots.

# Reporting
The analytical method used must be specifically identified by number or title and the MDL for each analyte expressed in the appropriate method reporting units. If the analytical method permits options which affect the method detection limit, these conditions must be specified with the MDL value. The sample matrix used to determine the MDL must also be identified with the MDL value. Report the mean analyte level with the MDL. If a laboratory standard or a sample that contained a known amount analyte was used for this determination, report the mean recovery, and indicate if the MDL determination was iterated.
If the level of the analyte in the sample matrix exceeds 10 times the MDL of the analyte in reagent water, do not report a value for the MDL.

§ 429.10
Applicability.
This part applies to any timber products processing operation, and any plant producing insulation board with wood as the major raw material, which discharges or may discharge process wastewater pollutants to the waters of the United States, or which introduces or may introduce process wastewater pollutants into a publicly owned treatment works.
§ 429.11
General definitions.
In addition to the definitions set forth in 40 CFR part 401, the following definitions apply to this part:
(a) The term “hydraulic barking” means a wood processing operation that removes bark from wood by the use of water under a pressure of 6.8 atm (100 psia) or greater.
(b) The terms “cubic feet” or “cubic meters” of production in subpart A means the cubic feet or cubic meters of logs from which bark is removed.
(c) The term “process wastewater” specifically excludes non-contact cooling water, material storage yard runoff (either raw material or processed wood storage), boiler blowdown, and wastewater from washout of thermal oxidizers or catalytic oxidizers, wastewater from biofilters, or wastewater from wet electrostatic precipitators used upstream of thermal oxidizers or catalytic oxidizers installed by facilities covered by subparts B, C, D or M to comply with the national emissions standards for hazardous air pollutants (NESHAP) for plywood and composite
wood products (PCWP) facilities (40 CFR part 63, subpart DDDD). For the dry process hardboard, veneer, finishing, particleboard, and sawmills and planing mills subcategories, fire control water is excluded from the definition.
(d) The term “gross production of fiberboard products” means the air dry weight of hardboard or insulation board following formation of the mat and prior to trimming and finishing operations.
(e) The term “hardboard” means a panel manufactured from interfelted ligno-cellulosic fibers consolidated under heat and pressure to a density of 0.5 g/cu cm (31 lb/cu ft) or greater.
(f) The term “insulation board” means a panel manufactured from interfelted ligno-cellulosic fibers consolidated to a density of less than 0.5 g/cu cm (less than 31 lb/cu ft).
(g) The term “smooth-one-side (S1S) hardboard” means hardboard which is produced by the wet-matting, wet-pressing process.
(h) The term “smooth-two-sides (S2S) hardboard” means hardboard which is produced by the wet-matting, dry-pressing process.
(i) The term “debris” means woody material such as bark, twigs, branches, heartwood or sapwood that will not pass through a 2.54 cm (1.0 in) diameter round opening and is present in the discharge from a wet storage facility.
(j) For the subcategories for which numerical limitations are given, the daily maximum limitation is a value that should not be exceeded by any one effluent measurement. The 30-day limitation is a value that should not be exceeded by the average of daily measurements taken during any 30-day period.

General definitions.
In addition to the definitions set forth in 40 CFR part 401 and 40 CFR 403.3, the following definitions apply to this part:
(a)
Adsorbable organic halides (AOX).
A bulk parameter that measures the total mass of chlorinated organic matter in water and wastewater. The approved method of analysis for AOX is Method 1650, which is available in Appendix A of this part, and online at
http://water.epa.gov/scitech/methods/cwa/index.cfm.
(b)
Annual average.
The mean concentration, mass loading or production-normalized mass loading of a pollutant over a period of 365 consecutive days (or such other period of time determined by the permitting authority to be sufficiently long to encompass expected variability of the concentration, mass loading, or production-normalized mass loading at the relevant point of measurement).
(c)
Bleach plant.
All process equipment used for bleaching beginning with the first application of bleaching agents (e.g., chlorine, chlorine dioxide, ozone, sodium or calcium hypochlorite, or peroxide), each subsequent extraction stage, and each subsequent stage where bleaching agents are applied to the pulp. For mills in subpart E of this part producing specialty grades of pulp, the bleach plant includes process equipment used for the hydrolysis or extraction stages prior to the first application of bleaching agents. Process equipment used for oxygen delignification prior to the application of bleaching agents is not part of the bleach plant.
(d)
Bleach plant effluent.
The total discharge of process wastewaters from the bleach plant from each physical bleach line operated at the mill, comprising separate acid and alkaline filtrates or the combination thereof.
(e)
Chemical oxygen demand (COD).
A bulk parameter that measures the oxygen-consuming capacity of organic and inorganic matter present in water or wastewater. It is expressed as the amount of oxygen consumed from a chemical oxidant in a specific test.
(f)
Elemental chlorine-free (ECF).
Any process for bleaching pulps in the absence of elemental chlorine and hypochlorite that uses exclusively chlorine dioxide as the only chlorine-containing bleaching agent.
(g)
End of the pipe.
The point at which final mill effluent is discharged to waters of the United States or introduced to a POTW.
(h)
Fiber line.
A series of operations employed to convert wood or other fibrous raw material into pulp. If the final product is bleached pulp, the fiber line encompasses pulping, de-knotting, brownstock washing, pulp screening, centrifugal cleaning, and multiple bleaching and washing stages.

(j)
New source.
(1) Notwithstanding the criteria codified at 40 CFR 122.29(b)(1), a source subject to subpart B or E of this part is a “new source” if it meets the definition of “new source” at 40 CFR 122.2 and:
(i) It is constructed at a site at which no other source is located; or
(ii) It totally replaces the process or production equipment that causes the discharge of pollutants at an existing source, including the total replacement of a fiber line that causes the discharge of pollutants at an existing source, except as provided in paragraph (j)(2) of this section; or
(iii) Its processes are substantially independent of an existing source at the same site. In determining whether these processes are substantially independent, the Director shall consider such factors as the extent to which the new facility is integrated with the existing plant; and the extent to which the new facility is engaged in the same general type of activity as the existing source.
(2) The following are examples of changes made by mills subject to subparts B or E of this part that alone do not cause an existing mill to become a “new source”:
(i) Upgrades of existing pulping operations;
(ii) Upgrades or replacement of pulp screening and washing operations;
(iii) Installation of extended cooking and/or oxygen delignification systems or other post-digester, pre-bleaching delignification systems;
(iv) Bleach plant modifications including changes in methods or amounts of chemical applications, new chemical applications, installation of new bleaching towers to facilitate replacement of sodium or calcium hypochlorite, and installation of new pulp washing systems; or
(v) Total replacement of process or production equipment that causes the discharge of pollutants at an existing source (including a replacement fiber line), but only if such replacement is performed for the purpose of achieving limitations that have been included in the discharger's NPDES permit pursuant to § 430.24(b).
(k)
Non-continuous discharger.
(1) Except as provided in paragraph (k)(2) of this section, a non-continuous discharger is a mill which is prohibited by the NPDES authority from discharging pollutants during specific periods of time for reasons other than treatment plant upset control, such periods being at least 24 hours in duration. A mill shall not be deemed a non-continuous discharger unless its permit, in addition to setting forth the prohibition described above, requires compliance with the effluent limitations established for non-continuous dischargers and also requires compliance with maximum day and average of 30 consecutive days effluent limitations. Such maximum day and average of 30 consecutive days effluent limitations for non-continuous dischargers shall be established by the NPDES authority in the form of concentrations which reflect wastewater treatment levels that are representative of the application of the best practicable control technology currently available, the best conventional pollutant control technology, or new source performance standards in lieu of the maximum day and average of 30 consecutive days effluent limitations for conventional pollutants set forth in each subpart.
(2) A mill is a non-continuous discharger for the purposes of determining applicable effluent limitations under subpart B or E of this part (other than conventional limits for existing sources) if, for reasons other than treatment plant upset control (e.g., protecting receiving water quality), the mill is prohibited by the NPDES authority from discharging pollutants during specific periods of time or if it is required to release its discharge on a variable flow or pollutant loading rate basis.
(l)
POTW.
Publicly owned treatment works as defined at 40 CFR 403.3(o).
(m)
Process wastewater.
For subparts B and E only, process wastewater is any water that, during manufacturing or processing, comes into direct contact with or results from the production or use of any raw material, intermediate product, finished product, byproduct, or waste product. For purposes of subparts B and E of this part, process wastewater includes boiler blowdown; wastewaters from water treatment and other utility operations; blowdowns from high rate (e.g., greater than 98 percent) recycled non-contact cooling water systems to the extent they are mixed and co-treated with other process wastewaters; wastewater, including leachates, from landfills owned by pulp and paper mills subject to subpart B or E of this part if the wastewater is commingled with wastewater from the mill's manufacturing or processing facility; and storm waters from the immediate process areas to the extent they are mixed and co-treated with other process wastewaters. For purposes of this part, contaminated groundwaters from on-site or off-site groundwater remediation projects are not process wastewater.
(n)
Production.
(1) For all limitations and standards specified in this part except those pertaining to AOX and chloroform: Production shall be defined as the annual off-the-machine production (including off-the-machine coating where applicable) divided by the number of operating days during that year. Paper and paperboard production shall be measured at the off-the-machine moisture content, except for subpart C of this part (as it pertains to pulp and paperboard production at unbleached kraft mills including linerboard or bag paper and other mixed products, and to pulp and paperboard production using the unbleached kraft neutral sulfite semi-chemical (cross recovery) process), and subparts F and J of this part (as they pertain to paperboard production from wastepaper from noncorrugating medium furnish or from corrugating medium furnish) where paper and paperboard production shall be measured in air-dry-tons (10% moisture content). Market pulp shall be measured in air-dry tons (10% moisture). Production shall be determined for each mill based upon past production practices, present trends, or committed growth.
(2) For AOX and chloroform limitations and standards specified in subparts B and E of this part: Production shall be defined as the annual unbleached pulp production entering the first stage of the bleach plant divided by the number of operating days during that year. Unbleached pulp production shall be measured in air-dried-metric-tons (10% moisture) of brownstock pulp entering the bleach plant at the stage during which chlorine or chlorine-containing compounds are first applied to the pulp. In the case of bleach plants that use totally chlorine free bleaching processes, unbleached pulp production shall be measured in air-dried-metric tons (10% moisture) of brownstock pulp entering the first stage of the bleach plant from which wastewater is discharged. Production shall be determined for each mill based upon past production practices, present trends, or committed growth.
(o)
TCDD.
2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin.
(p)
TCDF.
2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzofuran.

§ 430.03
Best management practices (BMPs) for spent pulping liquor, soap, and turpentine management, spill prevention, and control.
(a)
Applicability.
This section applies to direct and indirect discharging pulp, paper, and paperboard mills with pulp production in subparts B (Bleached Papergrade Kraft and Soda) and E (Papergrade Sulfite).
(b)
Specialized definitions
—(1)
Action Level:
A daily pollutant loading that when exceeded triggers investigative or corrective action. Mills determine action levels by a statistical analysis of six months of daily measurements collected at the mill. For example, the lower action level may be the 75th percentile of the running seven-day averages (that value exceeded by 25 percent of the running seven-day averages) and the upper action level may be the 90th percentile of the running seven-day averages (that value exceeded by 10 percent of the running seven-day averages).
(2)
Equipment Items in Spent Pulping Liquor, Soap, and Turpentine Service:
Any process vessel, storage tank, pumping system, evaporator, heat exchanger, recovery furnace or boiler, pipeline, valve, fitting, or other device that contains, processes, transports, or comes into contact with spent pulping liquor, soap, or turpentine. Sometimes referred to as “equipment items.”
(3)
Immediate Process Area:
The location at the mill where pulping, screening, knotting, pulp washing, pulping liquor concentration, pulping liquor processing, and chemical recovery facilities are located, generally the battery limits of the aforementioned processes. “Immediate process area” includes spent pulping liquor storage and spill control tanks located at the mill, whether or not they are located in the immediate process area.
(4)
Intentional Diversion:
The planned removal of spent pulping liquor, soap, or turpentine from equipment items in spent pulping liquor, soap, or turpentine service by the mill for any purpose including, but not limited to, maintenance, grade changes, or process shutdowns.
(5)
Mill:
The owner or operator of a direct or indirect discharging pulp, paper, or paperboard manufacturing facility subject to this section.
(6)
Senior Technical Manager:
The person designated by the mill manager to review the BMP Plan. The senior technical manager shall be the chief engineer at the mill, the manager of pulping and chemical recovery operations, or other such responsible person designated by the mill manager who has knowledge of and responsibility for pulping and chemical recovery operations.
(7)
Soap:
The product of reaction between the alkali in kraft pulping liquor and fatty acid portions of the wood, which precipitate out when water is evaporated from the spent pulping liquor.
(8)
Spent Pulping Liquor:
For kraft and soda mills “spent pulping liquor” means black liquor that is used, generated, stored, or processed at any point in the pulping and chemical recovery processes. For sulfite mills “spent pulping liquor” means any intermediate, final, or used chemical solution that is used, generated, stored, or processed at any point in the sulfite pulping and chemical recovery processes (e.g., ammonium-, calcium-, magnesium-, or sodium-based sulfite liquors).
(9)
Turpentine:
A mixture of terpenes, principally pinene, obtained by the steam distillation of pine gum recovered from the condensation of digester relief gases from the cooking of softwoods by the kraft pulping process. Sometimes referred to as sulfate turpentine.
(c)
Requirement to implement Best Management Practices.
Each mill subject to this section must implement the Best Management Practices (BMPs) specified in paragraphs (c)(1) through (10) of this section. The primary objective of the BMPs is to prevent leaks and spills of spent pulping liquors, soap, and turpentine. The secondary objective is to contain, collect, and recover at the immediate process area, or otherwise control, those leaks, spills, and intentional diversions of spent pulping liquor,
soap, and turpentine that do occur. BMPs must be developed according to best engineering practices and must be implemented in a manner that takes into account the specific circumstances at each mill. The BMPs are as follows:
(1) The mill must return spilled or diverted spent pulping liquors, soap, and turpentine to the process to the maximum extent practicable as determined by the mill, recover such materials outside the process, or discharge spilled or diverted material at a rate that does not disrupt the receiving wastewater treatment system.
(2) The mill must establish a program to identify and repair leaking equipment items. This program must include:
(i) Regular visual inspections (e.g., once per day) of process areas with equipment items in spent pulping liquor, soap, and turpentine service;
(ii) Immediate repairs of leaking equipment items, when possible. Leaking equipment items that cannot be repaired during normal operations must be identified, temporary means for mitigating the leaks must be provided, and the leaking equipment items repaired during the next maintenance outage;
(iii) Identification of conditions under which production will be curtailed or halted to repair leaking equipment items or to prevent pulping liquor, soap, and turpentine leaks and spills; and
(iv) A means for tracking repairs over time to identify those equipment items where upgrade or replacement may be warranted based on frequency and severity of leaks, spills, or failures.
(3) The mill must operate continuous, automatic monitoring systems that the mill determines are necessary to detect and control leaks, spills, and intentional diversions of spent pulping liquor, soap, and turpentine. These monitoring systems should be integrated with the mill process control system and may include, e.g., high level monitors and alarms on storage tanks; process area conductivity (or pH) monitors and alarms; and process area sewer, process wastewater, and wastewater treatment plant conductivity (or pH) monitors and alarms.
(4) The mill must establish a program of initial and refresher training of operators, maintenance personnel, and other technical and supervisory personnel who have responsibility for operating, maintaining, or supervising the operation and maintenance of equipment items in spent pulping liquor, soap, and turpentine service. The refresher training must be conducted at least annually and the training program must be documented.
(5) The mill must prepare a brief report that evaluates each spill of spent pulping liquor, soap, or turpentine that is not contained at the immediate process area and any intentional diversion of spent pulping liquor, soap, or turpentine that is not contained at the immediate process area. The report must describe the equipment items involved, the circumstances leading to the incident, the effectiveness of the corrective actions taken to contain and recover the spill or intentional diversion, and plans to develop changes to equipment and operating and maintenance practices as necessary to prevent recurrence. Discussion of the reports must be included as part of the annual refresher training.
(6) The mill must establish a program to review any planned modifications to the pulping and chemical recovery facilities and any construction activities in the pulping and chemical recovery areas before these activities commence. The purpose of such review is to prevent leaks and spills of spent pulping liquor, soap, and turpentine during the planned modifications, and to ensure that construction and supervisory personnel are aware of possible liquor diversions and of the requirement to prevent leaks and spills of spent pulping liquors, soap, and turpentine during construction.
(7) The mill must install and maintain secondary containment (
i.e.
, containment constructed of materials impervious to pulping liquors) for spent pulping liquor bulk storage tanks equivalent to the volume of the largest tank plus sufficient freeboard for precipitation. An annual tank integrity testing program, if coupled with other containment or diversion structures,
may be substituted for secondary containment for spent pulping liquor bulk storage tanks.
(8) The mill must install and maintain secondary containment for turpentine bulk storage tanks.
(9) The mill must install and maintain curbing, diking or other means of isolating soap and turpentine processing and loading areas from the wastewater treatment facilities.
(10) The mill must conduct wastewater monitoring to detect leaks and spills, to track the effectiveness of the BMPs, and to detect trends in spent pulping liquor losses. Such monitoring must be performed in accordance with paragraph (i) of this section.
(d)
Requirement to develop a BMP Plan.
(1) Each mill subject to this section must prepare and implement a BMP Plan. The BMP Plan must be based on a detailed engineering review as described in paragraphs (d)(2) and (3) of this section. The BMP Plan must specify the procedures and the practices required for each mill to meet the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section, the construction the mill determines is necessary to meet those requirements including a schedule for such construction, and the monitoring program (including the statistically derived action levels) that will be used to meet the requirements of paragraph (i) of this section. The BMP Plan also must specify the period of time that the mill determines the action levels established under paragraph (h) of this section may be exceeded without triggering the responses specified in paragraph (i) of this section.
(2) Each mill subject to this section must conduct a detailed engineering review of the pulping and chemical recovery operations—including but not limited to process equipment, storage tanks, pipelines and pumping systems, loading and unloading facilities, and other appurtenant pulping and chemical recovery equipment items in spent pulping liquor, soap, and turpentine service—for the purpose of determining the magnitude and routing of potential leaks, spills, and intentional diversions of spent pulping liquors, soap, and turpentine during the following periods of operation:
(i) Process start-ups and shut downs;
(ii) Maintenance;
(iii) Production grade changes;
(iv) Storm or other weather events;
(v) Power failures; and
(vi) Normal operations.
(3) As part of the engineering review, the mill must determine whether existing spent pulping liquor containment facilities are of adequate capacity for collection and storage of anticipated intentional liquor diversions with sufficient contingency for collection and containment of spills. The engineering review must also consider:
(i) The need for continuous, automatic monitoring systems to detect and control leaks and spills of spent pulping liquor, soap, and turpentine;
(ii) The need for process wastewater diversion facilities to protect end-of-pipe wastewater treatment facilities from adverse effects of spills and diversions of spent pulping liquors, soap, and turpentine;
(iii) The potential for contamination of storm water from the immediate process areas; and
(iv) The extent to which segregation and/or collection and treatment of contaminated storm water from the immediate process areas is appropriate.
(e)
Amendment of BMP Plan.
(1) Each mill subject to this section must amend its BMP Plan whenever there is a change in mill design, construction, operation, or maintenance that materially affects the potential for leaks or spills of spent pulping liquor, turpentine, or soap from the immediate process areas.
(2) Each mill subject to this section must complete a review and evaluation of the BMP Plan five years after the first BMP Plan is prepared and, except as provided in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, once every five years thereafter. As a result of this review and evaluation, the mill must amend the BMP Plan within three months of the review if the mill determines that any new or modified management practices and engineered controls are necessary to reduce significantly the likelihood of spent pulping liquor, soap, and turpentine leaks, spills, or intentional diversions from the immediate process areas, including a schedule for implementation of such practices and controls.
(f)
Review and certification of BMP Plan.
The BMP Plan, and any amendments thereto, must be reviewed by the senior technical manager at the mill and approved and signed by the mill manager. Any person signing the BMP Plan or its amendments must certify to the permitting or pretreatment control authority under penalty of law that the BMP Plan (or its amendments) has been prepared in accordance with good engineering practices and in accordance with this regulation. The mill is not required to obtain approval from the permitting or pretreatment control authority of the BMP Plan or any amendments thereto.
(g)
Record keeping requirements.
(1) Each mill subject to this section must maintain on its premises a complete copy of the current BMP Plan and the records specified in paragraph (g)(2) of this section and must make such BMP Plan and records available to the permitting or pretreatment control authority and the Regional Administrator or his or her designee for review upon request.
(2) The mill must maintain the following records for 3 years from the date they are created:
(i) Records tracking the repairs performed in accordance with the repair program described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section;
(ii) Records of initial and refresher training conducted in accordance with paragraph (c)(4) of this section;
(iii) Reports prepared in accordance with paragraph (c)(5) of this section; and
(iv) Records of monitoring required by paragraphs (c)(10) and (i) of this section.
(h)
Establishment of wastewater treatment system influent action levels.
(1) Each mill subject to this section must conduct a monitoring program, described in paragraph (h)(2) of this section, for the purpose of defining wastewater treatment system influent characteristics (or action levels), described in paragraph (h)(3) of this section, that will trigger requirements to initiate investigations on BMP effectiveness and to take corrective action.
(2) Each mill subject to this section must employ the following procedures in order to develop the action levels required by paragraph (h) of this section:
(i)
Monitoring parameters.
The mill must collect 24-hour composite samples and analyze the samples for a measure of organic content (e.g., Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) or Total Organic Carbon (TOC)). Alternatively, the mill may use a measure related to spent pulping liquor losses measured continuously and averaged over 24 hours (e.g., specific conductivity or color).
(ii)
Monitoring locations.
For direct dischargers, monitoring must be conducted at the point influent enters the wastewater treatment system. For indirect dischargers monitoring must be conducted at the point of discharge to the POTW. For the purposes of this requirement, the mill may select alternate monitoring point(s) in order to isolate possible sources of spent pulping liquor, soap, or turpentine from other possible sources of organic wastewaters that are tributary to the wastewater treatment facilities (e.g., bleach plants, paper machines and secondary fiber operations).
(3) By the date prescribed in paragraph (j)(1)(iii) of this section, each existing discharger subject to this section must complete an initial six-month monitoring program using the procedures specified in paragraph (h)(2) of this section and must establish initial action levels based on the results of that program. A wastewater treatment influent action level is a statistically determined pollutant loading determined by a statistical analysis of six months of daily measurements. The action levels must consist of a lower action level, which if exceeded will trigger the investigation requirements described in paragraph (i) of this section, and an upper action level, which if exceeded will trigger the corrective action requirements described in paragraph (i) of this section.
(4) By the date prescribed in paragraph (j)(1)(vi) of this section, each existing discharger must complete a second six-month monitoring program using the procedures specified in paragraph (h)(2) of this section and must establish revised action levels based on the results of that program. The initial
action levels shall remain in effect until replaced by revised action levels.
(5) By the date prescribed in paragraph (j)(2) of this section, each new source subject to this section must complete a six-month monitoring program using the procedures specified in paragraph (h)(2) of this section and must develop a lower action level and an upper action level based on the results of that program.
(6) Action levels developed under this paragraph must be revised using six months of monitoring data after any change in mill design, construction, operation, or maintenance that materially affects the potential for leaks or spills of spent pulping liquor, soap, or turpentine from the immediate process areas.
(i)
Monitoring, corrective action, and reporting requirements.
(1) Each mill subject to this section must conduct daily monitoring of the influent to the wastewater treatment system in accordance with the procedures described in paragraph (h)(2) of this section for the purpose of detecting leaks and spills, tracking the effectiveness of the BMPs, and detecting trends in spent pulping liquor losses.
(2) Whenever monitoring results exceed the lower action level for the period of time specified in the BMP Plan, the mill must conduct an investigation to determine the cause of such exceedance. Whenever monitoring results exceed the upper action level for the period of time specified in the BMP Plan, the mill must complete corrective action to bring the wastewater treatment system influent mass loading below the lower action level as soon as practicable.
(3) Although exceedances of the action levels will not constitute violations of an NPDES permit or pretreatment standard, failure to take the actions required by paragraph (i)(2) of this section as soon as practicable will be a permit or pretreatment standard violation.
(4) Each mill subject to this section must report to the NPDES permitting or pretreatment control authority the results of the daily monitoring conducted pursuant to paragraph (i)(1) of this section. Such reports must include a summary of the monitoring results, the number and dates of exceedances of the applicable action levels, and brief descriptions of any corrective actions taken to respond to such exceedances. Submission of such reports shall be at the frequency established by the NPDES permitting or pretreatment control authority, but in no case less than once per year.
(j)
Compliance deadlines
—(1)
Existing direct and indirect dischargers.
Except as provided in paragraph (j)(2) of this section for new sources, indirect discharging mills subject to this section must meet the deadlines set forth below. Except as provided in paragraph (j)(2) of this section for new sources, NPDES permits must require direct discharging mills subject to this section to meet the deadlines set forth below. If a deadline set forth below has passed at the time the NPDES permit containing the BMP requirement is issued, the NPDES permit must require immediate compliance with such BMP requirement(s).
(i) Prepare BMP Plans and certify to the permitting or pretreatment authority that the BMP Plan has been prepared in accordance with this regulation not later than April 15, 1999;
(ii) Implement all BMPs specified in paragraph (c) of this section that do not require the construction of containment or diversion structures or the installation of monitoring and alarm systems not later than April 15, 1999.

# Subpart B—Bleached Papergrade Kraft and Soda Subcategory
§ 430.20
Applicability; description of the bleached papergrade kraft and soda subcategory.
The provisions of this subpart apply to discharges resulting from: The production of market pulp at bleached kraft mills; the integrated production of paperboard, coarse paper, and tissue paper at bleached kraft mills; the integrated production of pulp and fine papers at bleached kraft mills; and the integrated production of pulp and paper at soda mills.
§ 430.21
Specialized definitions.
(a) The general definitions, abbreviations, and methods of analysis set forth in 40 CFR part 401 and § 430.01 of this part apply to this subpart.
(b)
Baseline BAT limitations or NSPS
means the BAT limitations specified in § 430.24(a) (1) or (2), as applicable, and the NSPS specified in § 430.25(b) (1) or (2), as applicable, that apply to any direct discharger that is not “enrolled” in the “Voluntary Advanced Technology Incentives Program.”
(c)
Enroll
means to notify the permitting authority that a mill intends to participate in the “Voluntary Advanced Technology Incentives Program.” A mill can enroll by indicating its intention to participate in the program either as part of its application for a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit, or through separate correspondence to the permitting authority as long as the mill signs the correspondence in accordance with 40 CFR 122.22.
(d)
Existing effluent quality
means the level at which the pollutants identified in § 430.24(a)(1) are present in the effluent of a mill “enrolled” in the “Voluntary Advanced Technology Incentives Program.”
(e)
Kappa number
is a measure of the lignin content in unbleached pulp, determined after pulping and prior to bleaching.
(f)
Voluntary Advanced Technology Incentives Program
is the program established under § 430.24(b) (for existing direct dischargers) and § 430.25(c) (for new direct dischargers) whereby participating mills agree to accept enforceable effluent limitations and conditions in their NPDES permits that are more stringent than the “baseline BAT limitations or NSPS” that would otherwise apply, in exchange for regulatory- and enforcement-related rewards and incentives.
§ 430.22
Effluent limitations representing the degree of effluent reduction attainable by the application of the best practicable control technology currently available (BPT).
(a) Except as provided in 40 CFR 125.30 through 125.32, any existing point source subject to this subpart must achieve the following effluent limitations representing the degree of effluent reduction attainable by the application of the best practicable control technology currently available (BPT):

For AOX, the permitting authority must determine existing effluent quality for each fiber line enrolled in the Voluntary Advanced Technology Incentives Program at the end of the pipe based on loadings attributable to that fiber line. For the remaining pollutants, with the exception of COD, the permitting authority must determine existing effluent quality for each fiber line enrolled in the Voluntary Advanced Technology Incentives Program at the point where the wastewater containing those pollutants leaves the bleach plant. These limitations must be recalculated each time the NPDES permit of a discharger enrolled in the Voluntary Advanced Technology Incentives Program is reissued, up to:
(i) April 15, 2004 for all pollutants in paragraph (a)(1) of this section except AOX; and
(ii) The date specified in paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section for achieving the applicable AOX limitation specified in paragraph (b)(4)(i).
(2) Best Professional Judgment Milestones: Narrative or numeric limitations and/or special permit conditions, as appropriate, established by the permitting authority on the basis of his or her best professional judgment that reflect reasonable interim milestones toward achievement of the effluent limitations specified in paragraphs (b)(3) and (b)(4) of this section, as applicable, after consideration of the Milestones Plan submitted by the discharger in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.
(3) Six-year Milestones: By April 15, 2004 all dischargers enrolled in the Voluntary Advanced Technology Incentives Program must achieve the following:
(i) The effluent limitations specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, except that, with respect to AOX, dischargers subject to Tier I effluent limitations specified in paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section must achieve the AOX limitation specified in that paragraph; or

(B) A discharger enrolled in Tier II of the Voluntary Advanced Technology Incentives Program must achieve the Tier II limitations in paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section by April 15, 2009.
(C) A discharger enrolled in Tier III of the Voluntary Advanced Technology Incentives Program must achieve the Tier III limitations in paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section by April 15, 2014.
(c) All dischargers enrolled or intending to enroll in the Voluntary Advanced Technology Incentives Program must submit to the NPDES permitting authority a Milestones Plan covering all fiber lines enrolled or intended to be enrolled in that program at their mill by October 5, 1999 or the date the discharger applies for an NPDES permit containing limitations and conditions based on paragraph (b) of this section, whichever is later. Mills may claim all or part of the Milestones Plan as confidential business information (CBI) in accordance with 40 CFR part 2 and 40 CFR 122.7. If a mill claims all or part of the plan as CBI, the mill must prepare and submit to the NPDES permitting authority a summary of the plan for public release. The Milestones Plan must include the following information:
(1) A description of each anticipated new technology component or process modification that the discharger intends to implement in order to achieve the limitations in paragraphs (b)(3) and (b)(4) of this section;
(2) A master schedule showing the sequence of implementing the new technology components or process modifications and identifying critical path relationships within the sequence;
(3) A schedule for each individual new technology component or process modification that includes:
(i) The anticipated initiation and completion dates of construction, installation and operational “shakedown” period associated with the technology components or process modifications and, when applicable, the anticipated dates of initiation and completion of associated research, process development, and mill trials;
(ii) The anticipated dates that the discharger expects the technologies and process modifications selected to achieve the limitations specified in paragraphs (b)(3) and (b)(4) of this section to be operational on a full-scale basis; and
(iii) The anticipated magnitude of reductions in effluent quantity and the anticipated improvements in effluent quality associated with each technology and process modification implemented as measured at the bleach plant (for bleach plant, pulping area and evaporator condensates flow and BAT parameters other than Adsorbable Organic Halides (AOX)) and at the end of the pipe (for AOX), and the dates the discharger expects those reductions and improvements to be achieved;
(4) Contingency plans in the event that any technology or process specified in the Milestones Plan need to be adjusted or alternative approaches developed to ensure that the limitations specified in paragraphs (b)(3)and (b)(4) of this section are met; and
(5) A signature by the responsible corporate officer as defined in 40 CFR 122.22.
(d) The following additional effluent limitations apply to all dischargers subject to this section in accordance with the previous subcategorization scheme unless the discharger certifies to the permitting authority that it is not using these compounds as biocides. Also, for non-continuous dischargers, concentration limitations (mg/l) shall apply. Concentration limitations will only apply to non-continuous dischargers:

# Appendix A to Part 430—Methods 1650 and 1653

# Method 1650—Adsorbable Organic Halides by Adsorption and Coulometric Titration

# 1.0 Scope and Application
1.1 This method is for determination of adsorbable organic halides (AOX) associated with the Clean Water Act; the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act; the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act; and other organic halides amenable to combustion and coulometric titration. The method is designed to meet the survey and monitoring requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
1.2 The method is applicable to the determination of AOX in water and wastewater. This method is a combination of several existing methods for organic halide measurements (References 1 through 7).
1.3 The method can be used to measure organically-bound halides (chlorine, bromine, iodine) present in dissolved or suspended form. Results are reported as organic chloride (Cl
−
). The detection limit of the method is usually dependent on interferences rather than instrumental limitations. A method detection limit (MDL; Reference 8) of 6.6 µg/L, and a minimum level (ML; Section 18) of 20 µg/L, can be achieved with no interferences present.
1.4 This method is for use by or under the supervision of analysts experienced in the use of a combustion/micro-coulometer. Each laboratory that uses this method must demonstrate the ability to generate acceptable results using the procedures described in Section 9.2.
1.5 Any modification of the method beyond those expressly permitted (Section 9.1.2) is subject to application and approval
of an alternate test procedure under 40 CFR 136.4 and 136.5.

# 2.0 Summary of Method
2.1 Sample preservation: Residual chlorine that may be present is removed by the addition of sodium thiosulfate. Samples are adjusted to a pH
2 and maintained at 0 to 4 °C until analysis.
2.2 Sample analysis: Organic halide in water is determined by adsorption onto granular activated carbon (GAC), washing the adsorbed sample and GAC to remove inorganic halide, combustion of the sample and GAC to form the hydrogen halide, and titration of the hydrogen halide with a micro-coulometer, as shown in Figure 1.
2.3 Micro-coulometer.
2.3.1 This detector operates by maintaining a constant silver-ion concentration in a titration cell. An electric potential is applied to a solid silver electrode to produce silver ions in the cell. As hydrogen halide produced from the combustion of organic halide enters the cell, it is partitioned into an acetic acid electrolyte where it precipitates as silver halide. The current produced is integrated over the combustion period. The electric charge is proportional to the number of moles of halogen captured in the cell (Reference 6).
2.3.2 The mass concentration of organic halides is reported as an equivalent concentration of organically bound chloride (Cl
−
).

# 3.0 Definitions
3.1 Adsorbable organic halides is defined as the analyte measured by this method. The nature of the organo-halides and the presence of semi-extractable material will influence the amount measured and interpretation of results.
3.2 Definitions for terms used in this method are given in the glossary at the end of the method (Section 18).

# 4.0 Interferences
4.1 Solvents, reagents, glassware, and other sample processing hardware may yield elevated readings from the micro-coulometer. All materials used in the analysis shall be demonstrated to be free from interferences under the conditions of analysis by running method blanks initially and with each sample batch (samples started through the adsorption process in a given eight-hour shift, to a maximum of 20 samples). Specific selection of reagents and purification of solvents may be required.
4.2 Glassware is cleaned by detergent washing in hot water, rinsing with tap water and distilled water, capping with aluminum foil, and baking at 450 °C for at least one hour. For some glassware, immersion in a chromate cleaning solution prior to detergent washing may be required. If blanks from glassware without cleaning or with fewer cleaning steps show no detectable organic halide, the cleaning steps that do not eliminate organic halide may be omitted.
4.3 Most often, contamination results from methylene chloride vapors in laboratories that perform organic extractions. Heating, ventilating, and air conditioning systems that are shared between the extraction laboratory and the laboratory in which organic halide measurements are performed transfer the methylene chloride vapors to the air in the organic halide laboratory. Exposure of the activated carbon used in the analysis results in contamination. Separate air handling systems, charcoal filters, and glove boxes can be used to minimize this exposure.
4.4 Activated carbon.
4.4.1 The purity of each lot of activated carbon must be verified before each use by measuring the adsorption capacity and the background level of halogen (Section 9.5). The stock of activated carbon should be stored in its granular form in a glass container that is capped tightly. Protect carbon at all times from sources of halogen vapors.
4.4.2 Inorganic substances such as chloride, chlorite, bromide, and iodide will adsorb on activated carbon to an extent dependent on their original concentration in the aqueous solution and the volume of sample adsorbed. Treating the activated carbon with a solution of nitrate causes competitive desorption of inorganic halide species. However, if the inorganic halide concentration is greater than 2,000 times the organic halide concentration, artificially high results may be obtained.
4.4.3 Halogenated organic compounds that are weakly adsorbed on activated carbon are only partially recovered from the sample. These include certain alcohols and acids such as chloroethanol and chloroacetic acid that can be removed from activated carbon by the nitrate wash.
4.5 Polyethylene gloves should be worn when handling equipment surfaces in contact with the sample to prevent transfer of contaminants that may be present on the hands.

# 5.0 Safety
5.1 The toxicity or carcinogenicity of each reagent used in this method has not been precisely determined; however, each chemical substance should be treated as a potential health hazard. Exposure to these substances should be reduced to the lowest possible level. The laboratory is responsible for maintaining a current awareness file of OSHA regulations regarding the safe handling of the chemicals specified in this method. A reference file of material safety data sheets (MSDSs) should be made available to all personnel involved in the chemical analysis. Additional information on laboratory
safety can be found in References 9 through 11.
5.2 This method employs strong acids. Appropriate clothing, gloves, and eye protection should be worn when handling these substances.
5.3 Field samples may contain high concentrations of toxic volatile compounds. Sample containers should be opened in a hood and handled with gloves that will prevent exposure.

# 6.0 Equipment and Supplies

G. Hold boat in pyrolysis zone for six minutes.
H. Return gas flow rates to initial values; retract boat into hatch to cool and to allow remaining HX to be swept into detector (approximately two minutes).
I. Stop integration at 10 minutes after sequence start.

# Note:
If the signal from the detector does not return to baseline, it may be necessary to extend the pyrolysis time. The sequence above may need to be optimized for each instrument.
6.5.1.5 Absorber: Containing sulfuric acid to dry the gas stream after combustion to prevent backflush of electrolyte is highly recommended.
6.5.2 Micro-coulometer system: Capable of detecting the equivalent of 0.2 µg of Cl

in a 1-L volumetric flask and dilute to the mark with reagent water.
7.12 Trichlorophenol solutions.

# Note:
The calibration solutions in this section employ 100-mL volumes. For determinations requiring a larger or smaller volume, increase or decrease the size of the volumetric flasks commensurately. For example, if a 1-L sample is to be analyzed, use 1000-mL flasks (Sections 7.12.3.1 and 7.12.4) and 10 times the volume of reagent water (Sections 7.12.3.1 and 7.12.4). The volume of stock solution added to the calibration solutions and precision and recovery (PAR) test solution remain as specified (Sections 7.12.3.2 and 7.12.4) so that the same amount of chloride is delivered to the coulometric cell regardless of the volume of the calibration and PAR solutions.

−
per 100 mL of solution (20, 50, 100, 300, and 800 µg/L).
7.12.3.3 Some instruments may have a calibration range that does not extend to 800 µg/L (80 µg of Cl
−
). For those instruments, a narrower dynamic range may be used. However, if the concentration of halide in a sample exceeds that range, the sample must be diluted to bring the concentration within the range calibrated.

−
): Partially fill a 100-mL volumetric flask, add 10 µL of the stock solution (Section 7.12.2), and dilute to the mark with reagent water.
7.13 Acetic acid solution: Containing 30 to 70% acetic acid in deionized water, per the instrument manufacturer's instructions.

# 8.0 Sample Collection, Preservation, and Storage
8.1 Sample preservation.
8.1.1 Residual chlorine: If the sample is known or suspected to contain free chlorine, the chlorine must be reduced to eliminate positive interference that may result from continued chlorination reactions. A knowledge of the process from which the sample is collected may be of value in determining whether dechlorination is necessary. Immediately after sampling, test for residual chlorine using the following method or an alternative EPA method (Reference 12):
8.1.1.1 Dissolve a few crystals of potassium iodide in the sample and add three to five drops of a 1% starch solution. A blue color indicates the presence of residual chlorine.
8.1.1.2 If residual chlorine is found, add 1 mL of sodium thiosulfate solution (Section 7.11) for each 2.5 ppm of free chlorine or until the blue color disappears. Do not add an excess of sodium thiosulfate. Excess sodium thiosulfate may cause decomposition of a small fraction of the OX.
8.1.2 Acidification: Adjust the pH of aqueous samples to
2 with nitric acid. Acidification inhibits biological activity and stabilizes chemical degradation, including possible dehalogenation reactions that may occur at high pH. Acidification is necessary to facilitate thorough adsorption.
8.1.3 Refrigeration: Maintain samples at a temperature of 0 to 4 °C from time of collection until analysis.
8.2 Collect the amount of sample necessary for analysis (Section 11) and all QC tests (Section 9) in an amber glass bottle of the appropriate size (Section 6.1.1).
8.3 Analyze samples no less than three days nor more than six months after collection.

# 9.0 Quality Control
9.1 Each laboratory that uses this method is required to operate a formal quality assurance program. The minimum requirements of this program consist of an initial demonstration of laboratory capability, an ongoing analysis of standards and blanks as tests of continued performance, and analysis of matrix spike and matrix spike duplicate (MS/MSD) samples to assess accuracy and precision. Laboratory performance is compared to established performance criteria to determine if the results of analyses meet the performance characteristics of the method.
9.1.1 The laboratory shall make an initial demonstration of the ability to produce acceptable results with this method. This ability is demonstrated as described in Section 9.2.
9.1.2 The laboratory is permitted to modify this method to improve separations or lower the costs of measurements, provided that all performance specifications are met. Each time a modification is made to the method, the laboratory is required to repeat the procedures in Sections 9.2.2 and 10 to demonstrate continued method performance. If the detection limit of the method will be affected by the modification, the laboratory should demonstrate that the MDL (40 CFR
136, appendix B) is less than or equal to the MDL in this method or one-third the regulatory compliance level, whichever is higher.
9.1.3 The laboratory shall spike 10% of the samples with known concentrations of 2,4,6-trichlorophenol to monitor method performance and matrix interferences (interferences caused by the sample matrix). This test is described in Section 9.3. When results of these spikes indicate atypical method performance for samples, the samples are diluted to bring method performance within acceptable limits.
9.1.4 Analyses of blanks are required to demonstrate freedom from contamination. The procedures and criteria for analysis of blanks are described in Section 9.4.
9.1.5 The laboratory shall, on an ongoing basis, demonstrate through the analysis of the precision and recovery (PAR) standard that the analysis system is in control. These procedures are described in Section 9.10.
9.1.6 The laboratory shall perform quality control tests on the granular activated carbon. These procedures are described in Section 9.5.
9.1.7 Samples are analyzed in duplicate to demonstrate precision. These procedures are described in Section 9.6.
9.2 Initial demonstration of laboratory capability.
9.2.1 Method Detection Limit (MDL): To establish the ability to detect AOX, the laboratory should determine the MDL per the procedure in 40 CFR 136, appendix B using the apparatus, reagents, and standards that will be used in the practice of this method. An MDL less than or equal to the MDL in Section 1.3 should be achieved prior to the practice of this method.
9.2.2 Initial precision and recovery (IPR): To establish the ability to generate acceptable precision and recovery, the laboratory shall perform the following operations:
9.2.2.1 Analyze four aliquots of the PAR standard (Section 7.12.4) and a method blank according to the procedures in Sections 9.4 and 11.
9.2.2.2 Using the blank-subtracted results of the set of four analyses, compute the average percent recovery (X) and the standard deviation of the percent recovery (s) for the results.
9.2.2.3 The average percent recovery shall be in the range of 81 to 114 µg/L and the standard deviation shall be less than 8 µg/L. If X and s meet these acceptance criteria, system performance is acceptable and analysis of blanks and samples may begin. If, however, s exceeds the precision limit or X falls outside the range for recovery, system performance is unacceptable. In this case, correct the problem and repeat the test.
9.3 Matrix spikes: The laboratory shall spike a minimum of 10% of samples from a given matrix type (e.g., C-stage filtrate, produced water, treated effluent) in duplicate (MS/MSD). If only one sample from a given matrix type is analyzed, an additional two aliquots of that sample shall be spiked.
9.3.1 The concentration of the analytes spiked into the MS/MSD shall be determined as follows:
9.3.1.1 If, as in compliance monitoring, the concentration of OX is being checked against a regulatory concentration limit, the spiking level shall be at that limit or at one to five times higher than the background concentration determined in Section 9.3.2, whichever concentration is higher.
9.3.1.2 If the concentration of OX is not being checked against a regulatory limit, the spike shall be at the concentration of the precision and recovery standard (PAR; Section 7.12.4) or at one to five times higher than the background concentration determined in Section 9.3.2, whichever concentration is higher.
9.3.2 Analyze one sample out of each batch of 10 samples from each site to determine the background concentration of AOX. If necessary, prepare a solution of 2,4,6-trichlorophenol appropriate to produce a level in the sample one to five times the background concentration. Spike two additional sample aliquots with spiking solution and analyze them to determine the concentration after spiking.
9.3.2.1 Compute the percent recovery of each analyte in each aliquot:
ER15ap98.018
9.3.2.2 Compute the relative percent difference (RPD) between the two results (not between the two recoveries) as described in Section 12.4.
9.3.2.3 If the RPD is less than 20%, and the recoveries for the MS and MSD are within the range of 78 to 116%, the results are acceptable.
9.3.2.4 If the RPD is greater than 20%, analyze two aliquots of the precision and recovery standard (PAR).
9.3.2.4.1 If the RPD for the two aliquots of the PAR is greater than 20%, the analytical system is out of control. In this case, repair the problem and repeat the analysis of the sample batch, including the MS/MSD.
9.3.2.4.2 If, however, the RPD for the two aliquots of the PAR is less than 20%, dilute the sample chosen for the MS/MSD by a factor of 2-10 (to remain within the working range of the analytical system) and repeat the MS/MSD test. If the RPD is still greater than 20%, the result may not be reported for regulatory compliance purposes. In this case, choose another sample for the MS/MSD and repeat analysis of the sample batch.
9.3.2.5 If the percent recovery for both the MS and MSD are less than 78% or greater
than 116%, analyze the precision and recovery (PAR) standard.
9.3.2.5.1 If the recovery of the PAR is outside the 78 to 116% range, the analytical system is out of control. In this case, repair the problem and repeat the analysis of the sample batch, including the MS/MSD.
9.3.2.5.2 If the recovery of the PAR is within the range of 78 to 116%, dilute the sample, MS, and MSD by a factor of 2-10 (to remain within the working range of the analytical system) and re-analyze. If the results of the dilute analyses remain outside of the acceptable range, these results may not be reported for regulatory compliance purposes. In this case, choose another sample for the MS/MSD and repeat the analysis of the sample batch.
9.4 Blanks.
9.4.1 Reagent water blanks: Analyzed to demonstrate freedom from contamination.
9.4.1.1 Analyze a reagent water blank with each batch of samples. The blank must be analyzed immediately preceding calibration verification to allow for blank subtraction and to demonstrate freedom from contamination and memory effects, and must include all details of the procedure to be followed when analyzing samples.
9.4.1.2 Prepare the reagent water blank using a volume of reagent water equivalent to the volume used for sample preparation (Section 11.1). If using the micro-column procedure, adsorb the method blank using two columns, as described in Section 11. Combust the GAC from each column separately, as described in Section 11.
9.4.1.3 If the result from the blank from the batch method or the sum of the results from two columns is more than 20 µg/L, analysis of samples is halted until the source of contamination is eliminated and a blank shows no evidence of contamination at this level.
9.4.2 Nitrate-washed GAC blanks: Analyzed daily to demonstrate that the GAC is free from contamination.
9.4.2.1 Nitrate-washed GAC blank for the batch procedure: Analyze a batch nitrate-washed GAC blank by adding a scoop of dry GAC to the assembled filter apparatus containing the polycarbonate membrane and washing the GAC with the nitrate wash solution (Section 7.10) using the procedure in Section 11.2.6.
9.4.2.2 Nitrate-washed GAC blank for the column procedure: Analyze a column nitrate-washed GAC blank by assembling two carbon columns in series and washing the columns with the nitrate wash solution (Section 7.10) using the procedure in Section 11.3.4.2. Analyze the GAC in each column separately. The results of the second analysis must be within ±0.2 µg Cl
−
of the first. A difference greater than 0.2 µg Cl
−
indicates a lack of homogeneity in the GAC that could introduce unacceptable variability. If the difference exceeds this amount, the GAC should be replaced.
9.4.3 The result for the reagent water blank (Section 9.4.1) shall not exceed the result for the nitrate wash blank (Section 9.4.2.1 or 9.4.2.2) by more than 0.5 µg Cl
−
.
9.5 Granular activated carbon (GAC) batch testing: Each lot number or batch of activated carbon received from a supplier is tested once before use to ensure adequate quality. Use only GAC that meets the test criteria below.
9.5.1 Contamination test: Analyze a scoop of GAC. Reject carbon if the amount of OX exceeds 1 µg (25 µg Cl
−
/g).
9.5.2 Inorganic chloride adsorption test: Attempt to adsorb NaCl from 100 mL of a solution containing 100 mg/L in reagent water. Wash with nitrate solution and analyze. The amount of halide should be less than 1 µg Cl
−
larger than the blank. A larger amount indicates significant uptake of inorganic chloride by the carbon. Reject carbon if the 1 µg level is exceeded.
9.6 Samples that are being used for regulatory compliance purposes shall be analyzed in duplicate.
9.6.1 The procedure for preparing duplicate sample aliquots is described in Section 11.5.
9.6.2 Calculate the RPD by following the same procedure described in Section 12.4.
9.6.3 If the RPD is greater than 20%, the analyses must be repeated.
9.6.4 If the RPD remains greater than 20%, the result may not be reported for regulatory compliance purposes.
9.7 The specifications in this method can be met if the apparatus used is calibrated properly and maintained in a calibrated state. The standards used for calibration (Section 10), calibration verification (Section 9.9), and for initial (Section 9.2.2) and ongoing (Section 9.10) precision and recovery should be identical, so that the most precise results will be obtained.
9.8 Depending on specific program requirements, field duplicates may be collected to determine the precision of the sampling technique.
9.9 At the beginning and end of each eight-hour shift during which analyses are performed, system performance and calibration are verified. Verification of system performance and calibration may be performed more frequently, if desired.
9.9.1 If performance and calibration are verified at the beginning and end of each shift (or more frequently), samples analyzed during that period are considered valid.
9.9.2 If performance and calibration are not verified at both the beginning and end of a shift (or more frequently), samples analyzed during that period must be reanalyzed.
9.9.3 If calibration is verified at the beginning of a shift, recalibration using the five standards described in Section 10.6 is not
necessary; otherwise, the instrument must be recalibrated prior to analyzing samples (Section 10).
9.9.4 Cell maintenance and other changes to the analytical system that can affect system performance may not be performed during the eight-hour (or shorter) shift.
9.10 Calibration verification and ongoing precision and recovery: Calibration and system performance are verified by the analysis of the 100 µg/L PAR standard.
9.10.1 Analyze a blank (Section 9.4) and analyze the PAR standard (Section 7.12.4) immediately thereafter at the beginning and end of each shift. Compute the concentration of organic halide in the blank and in the PAR standard using the procedures in Section 12. The blank shall be less than 2 µg Cl
−
(20 µg/L equivalent).
9.10.2 Subtract the result for the blank from the result of the PAR standard using the procedures in Section 12, and compute the percent recovery of the blank-subtracted PAR standard. The percent recovery shall be in the range of 78 to 116%.
9.10.3 If the recovery is within this range, the analytical process is in control and analysis of blanks and samples may proceed. If, however, the recovery is not within the acceptable range, the analytical process is not in control. In this event, correct the problem and repeat the ongoing precision and recovery test (Section 9.10), or recalibrate (Sections 10.5 through 10.6).
9.10.4 If the recovery is not within the acceptable range for the PAR standard analyzed at the end of the eight-hour shift, correct the problem, repeat the ongoing precision and recovery test (Section 9.10), or recalibrate (Sections 10.5 through 10.6), and reanalyze the sample batch that was analyzed during the eight-hour shift.
9.10.5 If the recovery is within the acceptable range at the end of the shift, and samples are to be analyzed during the next eight-hour shift, the end of shift verification may be used as the beginning of shift verification for the subsequent shift, provided the next eight-hour shift begins as the first shift ends.
9.11 It is suggested but not required that the laboratory develop a statement of data quality for AOX and develop QC charts to form a graphic demonstration of method performance. Add results that pass the specification in Section 9.10.2 to initial and previous ongoing data. Develop a statement of data quality by calculating the average percent recovery (R) and the standard deviation of percent recovery (s
r
). Express the accuracy as a recovery interval from R − 2s
r
to R = 2s
r
. For example, if R = 95% and s
r
= 5%, the accuracy is 85 to 105%.

# 10.0 Calibration and Standardization
10.1 Assemble the OX system and establish the operating conditions necessary for analysis. Differences between various makes and models of instruments will require different operating procedures. Laboratories should follow the operating instructions provided by the manufacturer of their particular instrument. Sensitivity, instrument detection limit, precision, linear range, and interference effects must be investigated and established for each particular instrument. Calibration is performed when the instrument is first set up and when calibration cannot be verified (Section 9.9).
10.2 Cell performance test: Inject 100 µL of the sodium chloride solution (10 µg Cl
−
; Section 7.4) directly into the titration cell electrolyte. Adjust the instrument to produce a reading of 10 µg Cl
−
.
10.3 Combustion system test: This test can be used to assure that the combustion/micro-coulometer systems are performing properly without introduction of carbon. This test should be used during initial instrument setup and when instrument performance indicates a problem with the combustion system.
10.3.1 Designate a quartz boat for use with the ammonium chloride (NH
4
Cl) solution only.
10.3.2 Inject 100 µL of the NH
4
Cl solution (Section 7.5) into this boat and proceed with the analysis.
10.3.3 The result shall be between 9.5 and 10.5 µg Cl
−
. If the recovery is not between these limits, the combustion or micro-coulometer systems are not performing properly. Check the temperature of the combustion system, verify that there are no leaks in the combustion system, confirm that the cell is performing properly (Section 10.2), and then repeat the test.
10.4 Trichlorophenol combustion test: This test can be used to assure that the combustion/micro-coulometer systems are performing properly when carbon is introduced. It should be used during instrument setup and when it is necessary to isolate the adsorption and combustion steps.
10.4.1 Inject 10 µL of the 1 mg/mL trichlorophenol stock solution (Section 7.12.2) onto one level scoop of GAC in a quartz boat.
10.4.2 Immediately proceed with the analysis to prevent loss of trichlorophenol and to prevent contamination of the carbon.
10.4.3 The result shall be between 9.0 and 11.0 µg Cl
−
. If the recovery is not between these limits, the combustion/micro-coulometer system shall be adjusted and the test repeated until the result falls within these limits.
10.5 Background level of Cl
−
: Determine the average background level of Cl
−
for the entire analytical system as follows:
10.5.1 Using the procedure in Section 11 (batch or column) that will be used for the analysis of samples, determine the background level of Cl
−
in each of three portions of reagent water. The volume of reagent
water used shall be the same as the volume used for analysis of samples.
10.5.2 Calculate the average (mean) concentration of Cl
−
and the standard deviation of the concentration.
10.5.3 The sum of the average concentration plus two times the standard deviation of the concentration shall be less than 20 µg/L. If not, the water or carbon shall be replaced, or the adsorption system moved to an area free of organic halide vapors, and the test (Section 10.5) shall be repeated. Only after this test is passed may calibration proceed.
10.6 Calibration by external standard: A calibration line encompassing the calibration range is developed using solutions of 2,4,6-trichlorophenol.
10.6.1 Analyze each of the five calibration solutions (Section 7.12.3) using the procedure in Section 11 (batch or column) that will be used for the analysis of samples, and the same procedure that was used for determination of the system background (Section 10.5). Analyze these solutions beginning with the lowest concentration and proceeding to the highest. Record the response of the micro-coulometer to each calibration solution.
10.6.2 Prepare a method blank as described in Section 9.4. Subtract the value of the blank from each of the five calibration results, as described in Section 12.
10.6.3 Calibration factor (ratio of response to concentration) Using the blank subtracted results, compute the calibration factor at each calibration point, and compute the average calibration factor and the relative standard deviation (coefficient of variation; Cv) of the calibration factor over the calibration range.
10.6.4 Linearity: The Cv of the calibration factor shall be less than 20%; otherwise, the calibration shall be repeated after adjustment of the combustion/micro-coulometer system and/or preparation of fresh calibration standards.
10.6.5 Using the average calibration factor, compute the percent recovery at each calibration point. The recovery at each calibration point shall be within the range of 80 to 111%. If any point is not within this range, a fresh calibration standard shall be prepared for that point, this standard shall be analyzed, and the calibration factor (Section 10.6.3) and calibration linearity (Section 10.6.4) shall be computed using the new calibration point. All points used in the calibration must meet the 80 to 111% recovery specification.

# 11.0 Procedure
11.1 Sample dilution: Many samples will contain high concentrations of halide. If analyzed without dilution, the micro-coulometer can be overloaded, resulting in frequent cell cleaning and downtime. The following guidance is provided to assist in estimating dilution levels.
11.1.1 Paper and pulp mills that employ chlorine bleaching: Samples from pulp mills that use a chlorine bleaching process may overload the micro-coulometer. To prevent system overload, the maximum volume suggested for paper industry samples that employ halide in the bleaching process is 100 mL. An adsorption volume as small as 25 mL may be used, provided the concentration of AOX in the sample can be measured reliably, as defined by the requirements in Section 9.11. To minimize volumetric error, an adsorption volume less than 25 mL may not be used. If AOX cannot be measured reliably in a 100-mL sample volume, a sample volume to a maximum of 1000 mL must be used. The sample and adsorption volumes are suggested for paper industry samples employing chlorine compounds in the bleaching process:

* Assumes dilution to final volume of 100 mL. All sample aliquots (replicates, diluted samples) must be analyzed using the same fixed final volume (sample volume plus reagent water, as needed).
11.1.2 Sample dilution procedure.
11.1.2.1 Partially fill a precleaned volumetric flask with pH
2 reagent water, allowing for the volume of sample to be added.
11.1.2.2 Mix sample thoroughly by tumbling or shaking vigorously.
11.1.2.3 Immediately withdraw the required sample aliquot using a pipet or micro-syringe.

# Note:
Because it will be necessary to rinse the pipet or micro-syringe (Section 11.1.2.5), it may be necessary to pre-calibrate the
pipet or micro-syringe to assure that the exact volume desired will be delivered.
11.1.2.4 Dispense or inject the aliquot into the volumetric flask.
11.1.2.5 Rinse the pipet or syringe with small portions of reagent water and add to the flask.
11.1.2.6 Dilute to the mark with pH
2 reagent water.
11.1.3 All samples to be reported for regulatory compliance monitoring purposes must be analyzed in duplicate, as described in Section 11.5.
11.1.4 Pulp and Paper in-process samples: The concentration of organic halide in in-process samples has been shown to be 20 to 30% greater using the micro-column adsorption technique than using the batch adsorption technique. For this reason, the micro-column technique shall be used for monitoring in-process samples. Examples of in-process samples include: combined bleach plant effluent, C-stage filtrate, and E-stage filtrate.
11.2 Batch adsorption and filtration.
11.2.1 Place the appropriate volume of sample (diluted if necessary), preserved as described in Section 8, into an Erlenmeyer flask.
11.2.2 Add 5 mL of nitrate stock solution to the sample aliquot.
11.2.3 Add one level scoop of activated carbon that has passed the quality control tests in Section 9.
11.2.4 Shake the suspension for at least one hour in a mechanical shaker.
11.2.5 Filter the suspension through a polycarbonate membrane filter. Filter by suction until the liquid level reaches the top of the carbon.
11.2.6 Wash the inside surface of the filter funnel with 25 mL (±5 mL) of nitrate wash solution in several portions. After the level of the final wash reaches the top of the GAC, filter by suction until the cake is barely dry. The time required for drying should be minimized to prevent exposure of the GAC to halogen vapors in the air, but should be sufficient to permit drying of the cake so that excess water is not introduced into the combustion apparatus. A drying time of approximately 10 seconds under vacuum has been shown to be effective for this operation.
11.2.7 Carefully remove the top of the filter holder, making sure that no carbon is lost. This operation is most successfully performed by removing the clamp, tilting the top of the filter holder (the funnel portion) to one side, and lifting upward.
11.2.8 Using a squeeze bottle or micro-syringe, rapidly rinse the carbon from the inside of the filter holder onto the filter cake using small portions of wash solution. Allow the cake to dry under vacuum for no more than 10 seconds after the final rinse. Immediately turn the vacuum off.
11.2.9 Using tweezers, carefully fold the polycarbonate filter in half, then in fourths, making sure that no carbon is lost.
11.3 Column adsorption.
11.3.1 Column preparation: Prepare a sufficient number of columns for one day's operation as follows:
11.3.1.1 In a glove box or area free from halide vapors, place a plug of Cerafelt into the end of a clean glass column.
11.3.1.2 Fill the glass column with one level scoop (approximately 40 mg) of granular activated carbon that has passed the quality control tests in Section 9.
11.3.1.3 Insert a Cerafelt plug into the open end of the column to hold the carbon in place.
11.3.1.4 Store the columns in a glass jar with PTFE lined screw-cap to prevent infiltration of halide vapors from the air.
11.3.2 Column setup.
11.3.2.1 Install two columns in series in the adsorption module.
11.3.2.2 If the sample is known or expected to contain particulates that could prevent free flow of sample through the micro-columns, a Cerafelt plug is placed in the tubing ahead of the columns. If a measurement of the OX content of the particulates is desired, the Cerafelt plug can be washed with nitrate solution, placed in a combustion boat, and processed as a separate sample.
11.3.3 Adjusting sample flow rate: Because the flow rate used to load the sample onto the columns can affect the ability of the GAC to adsorb organic halides, the flow rate of the method blank is measured, and the gas pressure used to process samples is adjusted accordingly. The flow rate of the blank, which is composed of acidified reagent water and contains no particulate matter, should be greater than the flow rate of any sample containing even small amounts of particulate matter.
11.3.3.1 Fill the sample reservoir with the volume of reagent water chosen for the analysis (Section 9.4.1.2) that has been preserved and acidified as described in Section 8. Cap the reservoir.
11.3.3.2 Adjust the gas pressure per the manufacturer's instructions. Record the time required for the entire volume of reagent water to pass through both columns. The flow rate must not exceed 3 mL/min over the duration of the time required to adsorb the volume. If this flow rate is exceeded, adjust gas pressure, prepare another blank, and repeat the adsorption.
11.3.3.3 Once the flow rate for the blank has been established, the same adsorption conditions must be applied to all subsequent samples during that eight-hour shift, or until another method blank is processed, whichever comes first. To aid in overcoming breakthrough problems, a lower gas pressure (and, therefore, flow rate) may be used for
processing of samples, if desired. If the sample adsorption unit is disassembled or cleaned, the flow rate must be checked before processing additional samples.
11.3.3.4 Elute the pair of columns with 2 mL of nitrate wash solution. The flow rate of nitrate wash solution must not exceed 3 mL/min.
11.3.3.5 Separate the columns and mark for subsequent analysis.
11.3.4 The adsorption of sample volumes is performed in a similar fashion. Fill the sample reservoir with the sample volume chosen for the analysis (Section 11.1), that has been preserved as described in Section 8. All analyses must be performed with this volume (sample volume plus reagent water, as needed) in order to maintain a flow rate no greater than that determined for the blank (see Section 11.3.3).
11.3.4.1 Use the same gas pressure for sample adsorption as is used for the blank.
11.3.4.2 Elute the columns with 2 mL of the nitrate wash solution.
11.3.4.3 Separate the columns and mark for subsequent analysis.
11.3.5 If it is desirable to make measurements at levels lower than can be achieved with the sample volume chosen, or if the instrument response of an undiluted sample is less than three times the instrument response of the blank (Section 12.6.3), a larger sample volume must be used.
11.4 Combustion and titration.
11.4.1 Polycarbonate filter and GAC from batch adsorption.
11.4.1.1 Place the folded polycarbonate filter containing the GAC in a quartz combustion boat, close the airlock, and proceed with the automated sequence.
11.4.1.2 Record the signal from the micro-coulometer for a minimum integration time of 10 minutes and determine the concentration of Cl
−
from calibration data, per Section 12.
11.4.2 Columns from column adsorption.
11.4.2.1 Using the push rod, push the carbon and the Cerafelt plug(s) from the first column into a combustion boat. Proceed with the automated sequence.
11.4.2.2 Record the signal from the micro-coulometer for a minimum integration time of 10 minutes and determine the concentration of Cl
−
for the first column from calibration data, per Section 12.
11.4.2.3 Repeat the automated sequence with the second column.
11.4.2.4 Determine the extent of breakthrough of organic halides from the first column to the second column, as described in Section 12.
11.4.3 The two columns that are used for the method blank must be combusted separately, as is done for samples. 11.5 Duplicate sample analysis: All samples to be reported for regulatory compliance purposes must be analyzed in duplicate. This requirement applies to both the batch and column adsorption procedures. In addition, if it is necessary to dilute the sample for the purposes of reducing breakthrough or maintaining the concentration within the calibration range, a more or less dilute sample must be analyzed. The adsorption volumes used for analysis of undiluted samples, diluted samples, and all replicates must be the same as the volume used for QC tests and calibration (Sections 9 and 10).
11.5.1 Using results from analysis of one sample volume (Section 11.4) and the procedure in Section 11.1.2, determine if the dilution used was within the calibration range of the instrument and/or if breakthrough exceeded the specification in Section 12.3.1. If the breakthrough criterion was exceeded or the sample was not within the calibration range, adjust the dilution volume as needed. If the breakthrough criterion was not exceeded and the sample dilution was within the calibration range, a second volume at the same dilution level may be used.
11.5.2 Adsorb the sample using the same technique (batch or column) used for the first sample volume. Combust the GAC from the second volume as described in Section 11.4, and calculate the results as described in Section 12. Compare the results of the two analyses as described in Section 12.4.
11.5.3 Duplicate analyses are not required for method blanks, as different dilution levels are not possible.
11.5.4 Duplicate analyses of the PAR standard used for calibration verification (Section 9.10) are not required.

# 12.0 Data Analysis and Calculations
12.1 Batch Adsorption Method: Calculate the blank-subtracted concentration of adsorbable organic halide detected in each sample (in micrograms of chloride per liter) using the following equation:
ER15ap98.019
Where:
C=µg Cl

This calculation is performed for each of the two dilution levels analyzed for each sample.
12.2 Column Adsorption Method: Calculate the blank-subtracted concentration of adsorbable organic halide detected in each sample (in micrograms of chloride per liter) using the following equation:

V = volume of sample in liters
12.3 Percent breakthrough: For each sample analyzed by the column method, calculate the percent breakthrough of halide from the first column to the second column, using the following equation:
ER15ap98.021
12.3.1 For samples to be reported for regulatory compliance purposes, the percent breakthrough must be less than or equal to 25% for both of the two analyses performed on each sample (see Section 11.5).
12.3.2 If the breakthrough exceeds 25%, dilute the affected sample further, maintaining the amount of halide at least three times higher than the level of blank, and reanalyze the sample. Ensure that the sample is also analyzed at a second level of dilution that is at least a factor of 2 different (and still higher than three times the blank).
12.4 Relative percent difference (RPD): Calculate the relative percent difference between the results of the two analyses of each sample, using the following equation:
ER15ap98.022
12.5 High concentrations of AOX: If the amount of halide from either analysis exceeds the calibration range, dilute the sample and reanalyze, maintaining at least a factor of 2 difference in the dilution levels of the two portions of the sample used.
12.6 Low concentrations of AOX: The blank-subtracted final result from the batch procedure or the sum of the blank-subtracted results from the two carbon columns should be significantly above the level of the blank.
12.6.1 If the instrument response for a sample exceeds the instrument response for the blank by a factor of at least 3, the result is acceptable.
12.6.2 If the instrument response for a sample is less than three times the instrument response for the blank, and the sample has been diluted, analyze a less dilute aliquot of sample.
12.6.3 If the instrument response of an undiluted sample containing AOX above the minimum level is less than three times the instrument response for the blank, the result is suspect and may not be used for regulatory compliance purposes. In this case, find the cause of contamination, correct the problem, and reanalyze the sample under the corrected conditions.

# Method 1653—Chlorinated Phenolics in Wastewater by In Situ Acetylation and GCMS

# 1.0 Scope and Application
1.1 This method is for determination of chlorinated phenolics (chlorinated phenols, guaiacols, catechols, vanillins, syringaldehydes) and other compounds associated with the Clean Water Act; the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act; and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act; and that are amenable to in situ acetylation, extraction, and analysis by capillary column gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GCMS). This method is based on existing methods for determination of chlorophenolics in pulp and paper industry wastewaters (References 1 and 2).
1.2 The chemical compounds listed in Table 1 may be determined in waters and, specifically, in in-process streams and
wastewaters associated with the pulp and paper industry. The method is designed to meet the survey and monitoring requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
1.3 The detection limit of this method is usually dependent on the level of interferences rather than instrumental limitations. The method detection limits (MDLs) in Table 2 typify the minimum quantity that can be detected with no interferences present.
1.4 The GCMS portions of this method are for use only by persons experienced with GCMS or under the close supervision of such qualified persons. Laboratories unfamiliar with analyses of environmental samples by GCMS should run the performance tests in Reference 3 before beginning.
1.5 Any modification of the method beyond those expressly permitted is subject to the application and approval of alternative test procedures under 40 CFR parts 136.4 and 136.5.

# 2.0 Summary of Method
2.1 A 1000-mL aliquot of water is spiked with stable isotopically labeled analogs of the compounds of interest and an internal standard. The solution is adjusted to neutral pH, potassium carbonate buffer is added, and the pH is raised to 9-11.5. The chlorophenolics are converted in situ to acetates by the addition of acetic anhydride. After acetylation, the solution is extracted with hexane. The hexane is concentrated to a final volume of 0.5 mL, an instrument internal standard is added, and an aliquot of the concentrated extract is injected into the gas chromatograph (GC). The compounds are separated by GC and detected by a mass spectrometer (MS). The labeled compounds and internal standard serve to correct the variability of the analytical technique.
2.2 Identification of a pollutant (qualitative analysis) is performed by comparing the relative retention time and mass spectrum to that of an authentic standard. A compound is identified when its relative retention time and mass spectrum agree.
2.3 Quantitative analysis is performed in one of two ways by GCMS using extracted ion-current profile (EICP) areas: (1) For those compounds listed in Table 1 for which standards and labeled analogs are available, the GCMS system is calibrated and the compound concentration is determined using an isotope dilution technique; (2) for those compounds listed in Table 1 for which authentic standards but no labeled compounds are available, the GCMS system is calibrated and the compound concentration is determined using an internal standard technique.
2.4 Quality is assured through reproducible calibration and testing of the extraction and GCMS systems.

# 3.0 Definitions
3.1 Chlorinated phenolics are the chlorinated phenols, guaiacols, catechols, vanillins, syringaldehydes and other compounds amenable to in situ acetylation, extraction, and determination by GCMS using this method.
3.2 Definitions for other terms used in this method are given in the glossary at the end of the method (Section 20.0).

# 4.0 Interferences
4.1 Solvents, reagents, glassware, and other sample processing hardware may yield artifacts and/or elevated baselines, causing misinterpretation of chromatograms and spectra. All materials used in the analysis shall be demonstrated to be free from interferences under the conditions of analysis by running method blanks initially and with each sample batch (samples started through the extraction process on a given eight-hour shift, to a maximum of 20). Specific selection of reagents and purification of solvents by distillation in all-glass systems may be required. Glassware and, where possible, reagents are cleaned by using solvent rinse and baking at 450 °C for a minimum of one hour.
4.2 Interferences co-extracted from samples will vary considerably from source to source, depending on the diversity of the site being sampled. Industry experience suggests that high levels of non-chlorinated phenols may cause poor recovery of the compounds of interest, particularly in samples collected in the vicinity of a source of creosote, such as a wood-preserving plant (Reference 1).
4.3 The internal standard, 3,4,5-trichlorophenol, has been reported to be an anaerobic degradation product of 2,3,4,5-tetrachlorophenol and/or pentachlorophenol (Reference 1). When an interference with this or another compound occurs, labeled pentachlorophenol or another labeled compound may be used as an alternative internal standard; otherwise, the internal standards and reference compounds must be used as specified in this method.
4.4 Blank contamination by pentachlorophenol has been reported (Reference 1) to be traceable to potassium carbonate; it has also been reported that this contamination may be removed by baking overnight at 400 to 500 °C.
4.5 Catechols are susceptible to degradation by active sites on injection port liners and columns, and are subject to oxidation to the corresponding chloro-o-benzoquinones (Reference 2). A small amount of ascorbic acid may be added to samples to prevent auto-oxidation (Reference 2; also see Section 11.1.6). For pulp and paper industry samples, ascorbic acid may be added to treated effluent samples only.

# 5.0 Safety
5.1 The toxicity or carcinogenicity of each compound or reagent used in this method has not been precisely determined; however, each chemical compound should be treated as a potential health hazard. Exposure to these compounds should be reduced to the lowest possible level. The laboratory is responsible for maintaining a current awareness file of OSHA regulations regarding the safe handling of the chemicals specified in this method. A reference file of materials safety data sheets (MSDSs) should be made available to all personnel involved in these analyses. Additional information on laboratory safety can be found in References 4 through 6.
5.2 Samples may contain high concentrations of toxic compounds, and should be handled with gloves and a hood opened to prevent exposure.

7.2.2 Ascorbic acid solution: Prepare a solution of ascorbic acid in reagent water at a concentration of 0.1 g/mL. This solution must be prepared fresh on each day when derivatizations will be performed. Therefore, do not prepare more than will be used that day. (A 50-mL volume is sufficient for ten analyses).
7.3 Solvents: Hexane, acetone, and methanol. Distilled in glass (Burdick and Jackson, or equivalent).

in 250 mL reagent water.
7.5.2 Acetic anhydride: Redistilled reagent grade.
7.6 Analytical standards.
7.6.1 Derivatization: Because the chlorinated phenolics are determined as their acetate derivatives after in situ acetylation, the method requires that the calibration standards be prepared by spiking the underivatized materials into reagent water and carrying the spiked reagent water aliquot through the entire derivatization and extraction procedure that is applied to the field samples.
7.6.2 Standard solutions: Purchased as solutions or mixtures with certification to their purity, concentration, and authenticity, or prepared from materials of known purity and composition. If chemical purity of a compound is 98% or greater, the weight may be used without correction to compute the concentration of the standard. When not being used, standards are stored in the dark at −20 to −10 °C in screw-capped vials with PTFE-lined lids. A mark is placed on the vial at the level of the solution so that solvent evaporation loss can be detected. The vials are brought to room temperature prior to use.
7.6.3 If the chemical purity of any standard does not meet the 98% requirement above, the laboratory must correct all calculations, calibrations, etc., for the difference in purity.
7.7 Preparation of stock solutions: Prepare chlorovanillins and chlorosyringaldehydes in acetone, as these compounds are subject to degradation in methanol. Prepare the remaining chlorophenolics in methanol. Prepare all standards per the steps below. Observe the safety precautions in Section 5.
7.7.1 Dissolve an appropriate amount of assayed reference material in a suitable solvent. For example, weigh 50 mg (±0.1 mg) of pentachlorophenol in a 10-mL ground-glass-
stoppered volumetric flask and fill to the mark with methanol. After the pentachlorophenol is completely dissolved, transfer the solution to a 15-mL vial with PTFE-lined cap.
7.7.2 Stock solutions should be checked for signs of degradation prior to the preparation of calibration or performance test standards and shall be replaced after six months, or sooner if comparison with quality control check standards indicates a change in concentration.
7.8 Labeled compound spiking solution: From stock solutions prepared as above, or from mixtures, prepare one spiking solution to contain the labeled chlorovanillin in acetone and a second spiking solution to contain the remaining chlorophenolics, including the 3,4,5-trichlorophenol sample matrix internal standard (SMIS), in methanol. The labeled compounds and SMIS are each at a concentration of 12.5 µg/mL.
7.9 Secondary standards for calibration: Using stock solutions (Section 7.7), prepare one secondary standard containing the chlorovanillins and chlorsyringaldehydes listed in Table 1 in acetone and a second secondary standard containing the remaining chlorophenolics in methanol. The monochlorinated phenol, guaiacol, and catechol are included at a concentration of 25 µg/mL; the trichlorinated catechols, tetrachlorinated guaiacol and catechol, pentachlorophenol, 5,6-dichlorovanillin, and 2,6-dichlorosyringaldehyde are included at a concentration of 100 µg/mL; and the remaining compounds are included at a concentration of 50 µg/mL, each in their respective solutions.
7.10 Instrument internal standard (IIS): Prepare a solution of 2,2′-difluorobiphenyl (DFB) at a concentration of 2.5 mg/mL in hexane.
7.11 DFTPP solution: Prepare a solution of DFTPP at 50 µg/mL in acetone.
7.12 Solutions for obtaining authentic mass spectra (Section 10.2): Prepare mixtures of compounds at concentrations which will assure authentic spectra are obtained for storage in libraries.
7.13 Preparation of calibration solutions.
7.13.1 Into five 1000-mL aliquots of reagent water, spike 50, 100, 200, 500 and 1000 µL of each of the two solutions in Section 7.9. Spike 1.00 mL of each of the two labeled compound spiking solutions (Section 7.8) into each of the five aliquots.
7.13.2 Using the procedure in Section 11, derivatize and extract each solution, and concentrate the extract to a final volume of 0.50 mL. This will produce calibration solutions of nominal 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 µg/mL of the native chlorophenolics and a constant concentration of 25 µg/mL of each labeled compound and the SMIS (assuming 100% derivatization and recovery). As noted in Section 11.1.6, ascorbic acid is added to all samples of final effluents to stabilize chlorocatechols, but is not added to samples of pulp and paper in-process wastewaters. Therefore, it is necessary to prepare separate sets of five initial calibration standards with and without the addition of ascorbic acid. Also, in the event that the laboratory is extracting final effluent samples by both the stir-bar and separatory funnel procedures (see Section 11.3), initial calibration standards should be prepared by both methods.
7.13.3 These solutions permit the relative response (labeled to unlabeled) and the response factor to be measured as a function of concentration (Sections 10.4 and 10.5).
7.13.4 The nominal 50 µg/mL standard may also be used as a calibration verification standard (see Section 9.6).
7.14 Ongoing precision and recovery (OPR) standard: Used for determination of initial (Section 9.3.2) and ongoing (Section 9.6) precision and recovery. This solution is prepared by spiking 500 µL of each the two solutions of the secondary calibration standards (Section 7.9) and 1 mL of each of the two labeled compound spiking solutions (Section 7.8) into 1000 mL of reagent water.
7.15 Stability of solutions: All standard solutions (Sections 7.7 through 7.14) shall be analyzed within 48 hours of preparation and on a monthly basis thereafter for signs of degradation. Standards will remain acceptable if the peak area at the quantitation m/z relative to the DFB internal standard remains within ±15% of the area obtained in the initial analysis of the standard.

# 8.0 Sample Collection, Preservation, and Storage
8.1 Collect samples in glass containers (Section 6.1) following conventional sampling practices (Reference 9). Aqueous samples are collected in refrigerated bottles using automatic sampling equipment.
8.2 Sample preservation.
8.2.1 Residual chlorine: If the sample contains residual chlorine, the chlorine must be reduced to eliminate positive interference resulting from continued chlorination reactions. Immediately after sampling, test for residual chlorine using the following method or an alternative EPA method (Reference 10).
8.2.1.1 Dissolve a few crystals of potassium iodide in the sample and add three to five drops of a 1% starch solution. A blue color indicates the presence of residual chlorine.
8.2.1.2 If residual chlorine is found, add 1 mL of sodium thiosulfate solution (Section 7.2.1) for each 2.5 ppm of free chlorine or until the blue color disappears.
8.2.2 Acidification: Adjust pH of all aqueous samples to
2 with sulfuric acid (Section 7.1.2). Failure to acidify samples may result in positive interferences from continued chlorination reactions.
8.2.3 Refrigeration: Maintain sample temperature at 0 to 4 °C from time of collection until extraction, and maintain extracts at a temperature of 0 to 4 °C from time of extraction until analysis.
8.3 Collect a minimum of 2000 mL of sample. This will provide a sufficient amount for all testing. Smaller amounts may be collected if the stream is known to contain high levels of chlorophenolics.
8.4 All samples must be acetylated and extracted within 30 days of collection, and must be analyzed within 30 days of acetylation. If labeled compound recoveries for a sample do not meet the acceptance criteria in Table 5 and the 30-day holding time is not met, a new sample must be collected.

# 9.0 Quality Control
9.1 Each laboratory that uses this method is required to operate a formal quality assurance program (Reference 8). The minimum requirements of this program consist of an initial demonstration of laboratory capability, analysis of samples spiked with labeled compounds to evaluate and document data quality, and analysis of standards and blanks as tests of continued performance. Laboratory performance is compared to established performance criteria to determine if the results of analyses meet the performance characteristics of the method.
9.1.1 DFTPP spectrum validity shall be checked at the beginning of each eight-hour shift during which analyses are performed. This test is described in Section 9.2.
9.1.2 The laboratory shall make an initial demonstration of the ability to generate acceptable results with this method. This ability is established as described in Section 9.3.
9.1.3 The laboratory is permitted to modify this method to improve separations or lower the costs of measurements, provided all performance specifications are met. Each time a modification is made to the method, the laboratory is required to repeat the procedures in Sections 10.3 and 9.3.2 to demonstrate method performance. If the detection limits for the analytes in this method will be affected by the modification, the laboratory should demonstrate that each MDL (40 CFR 136, appendix B) is less than or equal to the MDL in this method or one-third the regulatory compliance level, whichever is higher.
9.1.4 The laboratory shall spike all samples with labeled compounds and the sample matrix internal standard (SMIS) to monitor method performance. This test is described in Section 9.4. When results of these spikes indicate atypical method performance for samples, the samples are diluted to bring method performance within acceptable limits (Section 13).
9.1.5 Analyses of blanks are required to demonstrate freedom from contamination. The procedures and criteria for analysis of a blank are described in Section 9.5.
9.1.6 The laboratory shall, on an ongoing basis, demonstrate through analysis of the ongoing precision and recovery standard (Section 7.14) that the analysis system is in control. These procedures are described in Section 9.6.
9.1.7 The laboratory shall maintain records to define the quality of data that is generated. Development of accuracy statements is described in Section 9.4.4 and 9.6.3.
9.2 DFTPP spectrum validity: Inject 1 µL of the DFTPP solution (Section 7.11) either separately or within a few seconds of injection of the OPR standard (Section 9.6) analyzed at the beginning of each shift. The criteria in Table 3 shall be met.
9.3 Initial demonstration of laboratory capability.
9.3.1 Method Detection Limit (MDL): To establish the ability to detect the analytes in this method, the laboratory should determine the MDL per the procedure in 40 CFR 136, appendix B using the apparatus, reagents, and standards that will be used in the practice of this method. MDLs less than or equal to the MDLs in Table 2 should be achieved prior to the practice of this method.
9.3.2 Initial precision and recovery (IPR): To establish the ability to demonstrate control over the analysis system and to generate acceptable precision and accuracy, the laboratory shall perform the following operations:
9.3.2.1 Derivatize, extract, concentrate, and analyze four 1000-mL aliquots of the ongoing precision and recovery standard (OPR; Section 7.14), according to the procedure in Section 11. Separate sets of IPR aliquots must be prepared with the addition of ascorbic acid and without.
9.3.2.2 Using results of the four analyses, compute the average percent recovery (X) and the relative standard deviation of the recovery (s) for each compound, by isotope dilution for pollutants with a labeled analog, and by internal standard for pollutants with no labeled analog and for the labeled compounds and the SMIS.
9.3.2.3 For each compound, compare s and X with the corresponding limits for initial precision and recovery in Table 5. If s and X for all compounds meet the acceptance criteria, system performance is acceptable and analysis of blanks and samples may begin. If, however, any individual s exceeds the precision limit or any individual X falls outside the range for recovery, system performance is unacceptable for that compound. In this event, correct the problem and repeat the test (Section 9.3.2).
9.4 Labeled compound recovery: The laboratory shall spike all samples with labeled compounds and the sample matrix internal
standard (SMIS) to assess method performance on the sample matrix.
9.4.1 Analyze each sample according to the method beginning in Section 11.
9.4.2 Compute the percent recovery (P) of the labeled compounds and the SMIS using the internal standard method (Section 14.3) with 2,2′-difluorobiphenyl as the reference compound.
9.4.3 Compare the labeled compound and SMIS recovery for each compound with the corresponding limits in Table 5. If the recovery of any compound falls outside its warning limit, method performance is unacceptable for that compound in that sample. Therefore, the sample is complex. The sample is diluted and reanalyzed per Section 13.
9.4.4 As part of the QA program for the laboratory, it is suggested, but not required, that method accuracy for samples be assessed and records maintained. After the analysis of five samples for which the labeled compounds pass the tests in Section 9.4.3, compute the average percent recovery (P) and the standard deviation of the percent recovery (sp) for the labeled compounds only. Express the accuracy assessment as a percent recovery interval from P−2sp to P = 2sp for each matrix. For example, if P = 90% and sp = 10%, the accuracy interval is expressed as 70 to 110%. Update the accuracy assessment for each compound on a regular basis (e.g., after each 20 to 30 new accuracy measurements).
9.5 Blanks: Reagent water blanks are analyzed to demonstrate freedom from contamination.
9.5.1 Extract and concentrate a 1000-mL reagent water blank with each sample batch (samples started through the extraction process on the same eight-hour shift, to a maximum of 20 samples). Blanks associated with samples to which ascorbic acid is added must be prepared with ascorbic acid, and blanks associated with samples to which ascorbic acid is not added must be prepared without ascorbic acid. Analyze the blank immediately after analysis of the OPR (Section 7.14) to demonstrate freedom from contamination.
9.5.2 If any of the compounds of interest (Table 1) or any potentially interfering compound is found in an aqueous blank at greater than 5 µg/L (assuming a response factor of one relative to the sample matrix internal standard for compounds not listed in Table 1), analysis of samples is halted until the source of contamination is eliminated and a blank shows no evidence of contamination at this level.
9.6 Calibration verification and ongoing precision and recovery: At the beginning of each eight-hour shift during which analyses are performed, analytical system performance is verified for all compounds. Analysis of DFTPP (Section 9.2) and the nominal 50 µg/mL OPR (Section 11.1.5) is used to verify all performance criteria. Adjustment and/or recalibration, per Section 10, shall be performed until all performance criteria are met. Only after all performance criteria are met may samples and blanks be analyzed.
9.6.1 Analyze the extract of the OPR (Section 11.1.5) at the beginning of each eight-hour shift and prior to analysis of samples from the same batch. Alternatively, a separate calibration verification may be performed using an aliquot of the midpoint calibration standard from Section 7.13 (with a nominal concentration of 50 µg/mL). This alternative may be used to check instrument performance on failure of an OPR, or when samples extracted with an OPR aliquot are not analyzed within the same eight-hour analysis shift.
9.6.1.1 Retention times: The absolute retention time of 2,2′-difluorobiphenyl shall be within the range of 765 to 885 seconds, and the relative retention times of all pollutants and labeled compounds shall fall within the limits given in Table 2.
9.6.1.2 GC resolution: The valley height between 4,6-dichloroguaiacol and 3,4-dichloroguaiacol at m/z 192 shall not exceed 10% of the height of the taller of the two peaks.
9.6.1.3 Multiple peaks: Each compound injected shall give a single, distinct GC peak.
9.6.2 Compute the percent recovery of each pollutant (Table 1) by isotope dilution (Section 10.4) for those compounds that have labeled analogs. Compute the percent recovery of each pollutant that has no labeled analog by the internal standard method (Section 10.5), using the 3,4,5-trichlorophenol (SMIS) as the internal standard. Compute the percent recovery of the labeled compounds and the SMIS by the internal standard method, using the 2,2′-difluorobiphenyl as the internal standard.
9.6.2.1 For each compound, compare the recovery with the limits for ongoing precision and recovery in Table 5. If all compounds meet the acceptance criteria, system performance is acceptable and analysis of blanks and samples may proceed. If, however, any individual recovery falls outside of the range given, system performance is unacceptable for that compound. In this event, there may be a problem with the GCMS or with the derivatization/extraction/concentration systems.
9.6.2.2 GCMS system: To determine if the failure of the OPR test (Section 9.6.2.1) is due to instrument drift, analyze the current calibration verification extract (Section 7.13.4), calculate the percent recoveries of all compounds, and compare with the OPR recovery limits in Table 5. If all compounds meet these criteria, GCMS performance/stability is verified, and the failure of the OPR analysis is attributed to problems in the derivatization/extraction/concentration of the OPR. In this case, analysis of the sample
extracts may proceed. However, failure of any of the recovery criteria in the analysis of a sample extract requires rederivatization of that sample (Sections 13.3.1 and 13.3.2). If, however, the performance/stability of the GCMS is not verified by analysis of the calibration verification extract, the GCMS requires recalibration and all extracts associated with the failed OPR must be reanalyzed.
9.6.3 Add results that pass the specifications in Section 9.6.2.1 to initial and previous ongoing data for each compound. Update QC charts to form a graphic representation of continued laboratory performance. Develop a statement of laboratory accuracy for each pollutant and labeled compound in each matrix type (reagent water, C-stage filtrate, E-stage filtrate, final effluent, etc.) by calculating the average percent recovery (R) and the standard deviation of percent recovery (sr). Express the accuracy as a recovery interval from R− 2sr to R = 2sr. For example, if R = 95% and sr = 5%, the accuracy is 85 to 105%.
9.7 The specifications contained in this method can be met if the apparatus used is calibrated properly, then maintained in a calibrated state. The standards used for calibration (Section 10) and for initial (Section 9.3.2) and ongoing (Section 9.6) precision and recovery should be identical, so that the most precise results will be obtained. The GCMS instrument in particular will provide the most reproducible results if dedicated to the settings and conditions required for the analyses of chlorophenolics by this method.
9.8 Depending on specific program requirements, field replicates may be collected to determine the precision of the sampling technique, and spiked samples may be required to determine the accuracy of the analysis when the internal standard method is used.

# 10.0 Calibration and Standardization
10.1 Assemble the GCMS and establish the operating conditions in Section 12. Analyze standards per the procedure in Section 12 to demonstrate that the analytical system meets the minimum levels in Table 2, and the mass-intensity criteria in Table 3 for 50 ng DFTPP.
10.2 Mass-spectral libraries: Detection and identification of compounds of interest are dependent upon spectra stored in user-created libraries.
10.2.1 Obtain a mass spectrum of the acetyl derivative of each chlorophenolic compound (pollutant, labeled compound, and the sample matrix internal standard) by derivatizing and analyzing an authentic standard either singly or as part of a mixture in which there is no interference between closely eluting components. That only a single compound is present is determined by examination of the spectrum. Fragments not attributable to the compound under study indicate the presence of an interfering compound.
10.2.2 Adjust the analytical conditions and scan rate (for this test only) to produce an undistorted spectrum at the GC peak maximum. An undistorted spectrum will usually be obtained if five complete spectra are collected across the upper half of the GC peak. Software algorithms designed to “enhance” the spectrum may eliminate distortion, but may also eliminate authentic m/z's or introduce other distortion.
10.2.3 The authentic reference spectrum is obtained under DFTPP tuning conditions (Section 10.1 and Table 3) to normalize it to spectra from other instruments.
10.2.4 The spectrum is edited by removing all peaks in the m/z 42 to 45 range, and saving the five most intense mass spectral peaks and all other mass spectral peaks greater than 10% of the base peak (excluding the peaks in the m/z 42 to 45 range). The spectrum may be further edited to remove common interfering m/z's. The spectrum obtained is stored for reverse search and for compound confirmation. 10.3 Minimum level: Demonstrate that the chlorophenolics are detectable at the minimum level (per all criteria in Section 14). The nominal 5 µg/mL calibration standard (Section 7.13) can be used to demonstrate this performance.
10.4 Calibration with isotope dilution: Isotope dilution is used when (1) labeled compounds are available, (2) interferences do not preclude its use, and (3) the quantitation m/z (Table 4) extracted ion-current profile (EICP) area for the compound is in the calibration range. Alternative labeled compounds and quantitation m/z's may be used based on availability. If any of the above conditions preclude isotope dilution, the internal standard calibration method (Section 10.5) is used.
10.4.1 A calibration curve encompassing the concentration range is prepared for each compound to be determined. The relative response (pollutant to labeled) vs. concentration in standard solutions is plotted or computed using a linear regression. The example in Figure 1 shows a calibration curve for phenol using phenol-d5 as the isotopic diluent. Also shown are the ±10% error limits (dotted lines). Relative response (RR) is determined according to the procedures described below. A minimum of five data points are employed for calibration.
10.4.2 The relative response of a pollutant to its labeled analog is determined from isotope ratio values computed from acquired data. Three isotope ratios are used in this process:
R
x
= the isotope ratio measured for the pure pollutant.
R
y
= the isotope ratio measured for the labeled compound.
R
m
= the isotope ratio of an analytical mixture of pollutant and labeled compounds.
The m/z's are selected such that R
x
R
y
. If R
m
is not between 2R
y
and 0.5R
x
, the method does not apply and the sample is analyzed by the internal standard method.
10.4.3 Capillary columns sometimes separate the pollutant-labeled pair when deuterium labeled compounds are used, with the labeled compound eluted first (Figure 2). For this case,
ER15ap98.028
10.4.4 When the pollutant-labeled pair is not separated (as occurs with carbon-13-labeled compounds), or when another labeled compound with interfering spectral masses overlaps the pollutant (a case which can occur with isomeric compounds), it is necessary to determine the contributions of the pollutant and labeled compound to the respective EICP areas. If the peaks are separated well enough to permit the data system or operator to remove the contributions of the compounds to each other, the equations in Section 10.4.3 apply. This usually occurs when the height of the valley between the two GC peaks at the same m/z is less than 70 to 90% of the height of the shorter of the two peaks. If significant GC and spectral overlap occur, RR is computed using the following equation:
ER15ap98.029
Where:
R
x
is measured as shown in figure 3A,
R
y
is measured as shown in figure 3B,
R
m
is measured as shown in figure 3C.
For example, R
x
= 46100/4780 = 9.644; R
y
= 2650/43600 = 0.0608; R
m
= 49200/48300 = 1.1019; thus, RR = 1.114. 10.4.5 To calibrate the analytical system by isotope dilution, analyze a 1-µL aliquot of each of the calibration standards (Section 7.13) using the procedure in Section 12. Compute the RR at each concentration.
10.4.6 Linearity: If the ratio of relative response to concentration for any compound is constant (less than 20% coefficient of variation) over the five-point calibration range, an averaged relative response/concentration ratio may be used for that compound; otherwise, the complete calibration curve for that compound shall be used over the five-point calibration range.
10.5 Calibration by internal standard: The method contains two types of internal standards, the sample matrix internal standard (SMIS) and the instrument internal standard (IIS), and they are used for different quantitative purposes. The 3,4,5-trichlorophenol sample matrix internal standard (SMIS) is used for measurement of all pollutants with no labeled analog and when the criteria for isotope dilution (Section 10.4) cannot be met. The 2,2′-difluorobiphenyl instrument internal standard (IIS) is used for determination of the labeled compounds and the SMIS. The results are used for intralaboratory statistics (Sections 9.4.4 and 9.6.3).
10.5.1 Response factors: Calibration requires the determination of response factors (RF) for both the pollutants with no labeled analog and for the labeled compounds and the SMIS. The response factor is defined by the following equation:
ER15ap98.030
Where:
A
s
= the area of the characteristic mass for the compound in the daily standard.
A
is
= the area of the characteristic mass for the internal standard.
C
is
= the concentration of the internal standard (µg/mL).
C
s
= is the concentration of the compound in the calibration standard (µg/mL).
When this equation is used to determine the response factors for pollutant compounds without labeled analogs, use the area (A
is
) and concentration (C
is
) of 3,4,5-trichlorophenol (SMIS) as the internal standard. When this equation is used to determine the response factors for the labeled
analogs and the SMIS, use the area (A
is
) and concentration (C
is
) of 2,2′-difluorobiphenyl as the internal standard.
10.5.2 The response factor is determined for at least five concentrations appropriate to the response of each compound (Section 7.13); nominally, 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 µg/mL. The amount of SMIS added to each solution is the same (25 µg/mL) so that C
is
remains constant. Likewise, the concentration of IIS is constant in each solution. The area ratio (A
s
/A
is
) is plotted versus the concentration ratio (C
s
/C
is
) for each compound in the standard to produce a calibration curve.
10.5.3 Linearity: If the response factor (RF) for any compound is constant (less than 35% coefficient of variation) over the five-point calibration range, an averaged response factor may be used for that compound; otherwise, the complete calibration curve for that compound shall be used over the five-point range.
10.6 Combined calibration: By using calibration solutions (Section 7.13) containing the pollutants, labeled compounds, and the internal standards, a single set of analyses can be used to produce calibration curves for the isotope dilution and internal standard methods. These curves are verified each shift (Section 9) by analyzing the OPR standard, or an optional calibration verification (VER) standard. Recalibration is required only if OPR criteria (Section 9.6 and Table 5) cannot be met.

# 11.0 Sample Derivatization, Extraction, and Concentration
The procedure described in this section uses a stir-bar in a beaker for the derivatization. The extraction procedures applied to samples depend on the type of sample being analyzed. Extraction of samples from in-process wastewaters is performed using a separatory funnel procedure. All calibrations, IPR, OPR, and blank analyses associated with in-process wastewater samples must be performed by the separatory funnel procedure.
Extraction of samples of final effluents and raw water may be performed using either the stir-bar procedure or the separatory funnel procedure. However, all calibrations, IPR, OPR, blank, and sample analyses must be performed using the same procedure. Both procedures are described below.
11.1 Preparation of all sample types for stir-bar derivatization.
11.1.1 Allow sample to warm to room temperature.
11.1.2 Immediately prior to measuring, shake sample vigorously to insure homogeneity.
11.1.3 Measure 1000 mL (±10 mL) of sample into a clean 2000-mL beaker. Label the beaker with the sample number.
11.1.4 Dilute aliquot(s).
11.1.4.1 Complex samples: For samples that are expected to be difficult to derivatize, concentrate, or are expected to overload the GC column or mass spectrometer, measure an additional 100 mL (±1 mL) into a clean 2000-mL beaker and dilute to a final volume of 1000-mL (±50 mL) with reagent water. Label with the sample number and as the dilute aliquot. However, to ensure adequate sensitivity, a 1000-mL aliquot must always be prepared and analyzed.
11.1.4.2 Pulp and paper industry samples: For in-process streams such as E-stage and C-stage filtrates and other in-process wastewaters, it may be necessary to prepare an aliquot at an additional level of dilution. In this case, dilute 10 mL (±0.1 mL) of sample to 1000-mL (±50 mL).
11.1.5 QC aliquots: For a batch of samples of the same type to be extracted at the same time (to a maximum of 20), place two 1000-mL (±10 mL) aliquots of reagent water in clean 2000-mL beakers. Label one beaker as the blank and the other as the ongoing precision and recovery (OPR) aliquot. Because final effluent samples are treated with ascorbic acid and in-process wastewater samples are not (see Section 11.1.6), prepare an OPR aliquot and a blank for the final effluent and a separate pair for the in-process samples. Treat these QC aliquots in the same fashion as the associated samples, adding ascorbic acid to the pair associated with the final effluents, and not adding ascorbic acid to the pair associated with the in-process samples.
11.1.6 Ascorbic acid: Added to stabilize chlorocatechols. However, for pulp and paper industry in-process streams and other in-process wastewaters, the addition of ascorbic acid may convert chloro-o-quinones to catechols if these quinones are present. Separate calibration curves must be prepared with and without the addition of ascorbic acid (Section 7.13.2).
11.1.6.1 Spike 5 to 6 mL of the ascorbic acid solution (Section 7.2.2) into each final effluent sample, and the associated calibration standards, IPR and OPR aliquots, and blank.
11.1.6.2 For pulp and paper industry C-stage filtrates, E-stage filtrates, and untreated effluents, omit the ascorbic acid to prevent the conversion of chloro-o-quinones to catechols. Prepare calibration standards, IPR and OPR aliquots, and blanks associated with these samples without ascorbic acid as well.
11.1.7 Spike 1000 µL of the labeled compound spiking solution (Section 7.8) into the sample and QC aliquots.
11.1.8 Spike 500 µL of the nominal 50 µg/mL calibration solution (Section 7.13.4) into the OPR aliquot.
11.1.9 Adjust the pH of the sample aliquots to between 7.0 and 7.1. For calibration standards, IPR and OPR aliquots, and blanks, pH adjustment is not required.
11.1.10 Equilibrate all sample and QC solutions for approximately 15 minutes, with occasional stirring.
11.2 Derivatization: Because derivatization must proceed rapidly, particularly upon the addition of the K
2
CO
3
buffer, it is necessary to work with one sample at a time until the derivatization step (Section 11.2.3) is complete.
11.2.1 Place a beaker containing a sample or QC aliquot on the magnetic stirrer in a fume hood, drop a clean stirring bar into the beaker, and increase the speed of the stirring bar until the vortex is drawn to the bottom of the beaker.
11.2.2 Measure 25 to 26 mL of K
2
CO
3
buffer into a graduated cylinder or other container and 25 to 26 mL of acetic acid into another.
11.2.3 Add the K
2
CO
3
buffer to the sample or QC aliquot, immediately (within one to three seconds) add the acetic anhydride, and stir for three to five minutes to complete the derivatization.
11.3 Extraction: Two procedures are described below for the extraction of derivatized samples. The choice of extraction procedure will depend on the sample type. For final effluent samples, either of two procedures may be utilized for extraction of derivatized samples. For samples of in-process wastewaters, the separatory funnel extraction procedure must be used.

# Note:
Whichever procedure is employed, the same extraction procedure must be used for calibration standards, IPR aliquots, OPR aliquots, blanks, and the associated field samples.
11.3.1 Stir-bar extraction of final effluents.
11.3.1.1 Add 200 mL (±20 mL) of hexane to the beaker and stir for three to five minutes, drawing the vortex to the bottom of the beaker.
11.3.1.2 Stop the stirring and drain the hexane and a portion of the water into a 500-to 1000-mL separatory funnel. Allow the layers to separate.
11.3.1.3 Drain the aqueous layer back into the beaker.
11.3.1.4 The formation of emulsions can be expected in any solvent extraction procedure. If an emulsion forms, the laboratory must take steps to break the emulsion before proceeding. Mechanical means of breaking the emulsion include the use of a glass stirring rod, filtration through glass wool, and other techniques. For emulsions that resist these techniques, centrifugation is nearly 100% effective.
If centrifugation is employed to break the emulsion, drain the organic layer into a centrifuge tube, cap the tube, and centrifuge for two to three minutes or until the phases separate. If the emulsion cannot be completely broken, collect as much of the organic phase as possible, and measure and record the volume of the organic phase collected.
If all efforts to break the emulsion fail, including centrifugation, and none of the organic phase can be collected, proceed with the dilute aliquot (Section 11.1.4.2). However, use of the dilute aliquot will sacrifice the sensitivity of the method, and may not be appropriate in all cases.
11.3.1.5 Drain the organic layer into a Kuderna-Danish (K-D) apparatus equipped with a 10-mL concentrator tube. Label the K-D apparatus. It may be necessary to pour the organic layer through a funnel containing anhydrous sodium sulfate to remove any traces of water from the extract.
11.3.1.6 Repeat the extraction (Section 11.3.1.1 through 11.3.1.5) two more times using another 200-mL of hexane for each extraction, combining the extracts in the K-D apparatus.
11.3.1.7 Proceed with concentration of the extract, as described in Section 11.4.
11.3.2 Separatory funnel extraction of either final effluents or in-process wastewaters.
11.3.2.1 Transfer the derivatized sample or QC aliquot to a 2-L separatory funnel.
11.3.2.2 Add 200 mL (±20 mL) of hexane to the separatory funnel. Cap the funnel and extract the sample by shaking the funnel for two to three minutes with periodic venting.
11.3.2.3 Allow the organic layer to separate from the water phase for a minimum of 10 minutes.
11.3.2.4 Drain the lower aqueous layer into the beaker used for derivatization (Section 11.2), or into a second clean 2-L separatory funnel. Transfer the solvent to a 1000-mL K-D flask. It may be necessary to pour the organic layer through a funnel containing anhydrous sodium sulfate to remove any traces of water from the extract.
11.3.2.5 The formation of emulsions can be expected in any solvent extraction procedure. If an emulsion forms, the laboratory must take steps to break the emulsion before proceeding. Mechanical means of breaking the emulsion include the use of a glass stirring rod, filtration through glass wool, and other techniques. For emulsions that resist these techniques, centrifugation may be required.
If centrifugation is employed to break the emulsion, drain the organic layer into a centrifuge tube, cap the tube, and centrifuge for two to three minutes or until the phases separate. If the emulsion cannot be completely broken, collect as much of the organic phase as possible, and measure and record the volume of the organic phase collected. If all efforts to break the emulsion, including centrifugation, fail and none of the organic phase can be collected, proceed with the dilute aliquot (Section 11.1.4.2). However, use
of the dilute aliquot will sacrifice the sensitivity of the method, and may not be appropriate in all cases.
11.3.2.6 If drained into a beaker, transfer the aqueous layer to the 2-L separatory funnel (Section 11.3.2.1). Perform a second extraction using another 200 mL of fresh solvent.
11.3.2.7 Transfer the extract to the 1000-mL K-D flask in Section 11.3.2.4.
11.3.2.8 Perform a third extraction in the same fashion as above.
11.3.2.9 Proceed with concentration of the extract, as described in Section 11.4.
11.4 Macro concentration: Concentrate the extracts in separate 1000-mL K-D flasks equipped with 10-mL concentrator tubes. Add one to two clean boiling chips to the flask and attach a three-ball macro-Snyder column. Prewet the column by adding approximately 1 mL of hexane through the top. Place the K-D apparatus in a hot water bath so that the entire lower rounded surface of the flask is bathed with steam. Adjust the vertical position of the apparatus and the water temperature as required to complete the concentration in 15 to 20 minutes. At the proper rate of distillation, the balls of the column will actively chatter but the chambers will not flood. When the liquid has reached an apparent volume of 1 mL, remove the K-D apparatus from the bath and allow the solvent to drain and cool for at least 10 minutes. Remove the Snyder column and rinse the flask and its lower joint into the concentrator tube with 1 to 2 mL of hexane. A 5-mL syringe is recommended for this operation.
11.5 Micro-concentration: Final concentration of the extracts may be accomplished using either a micro-Snyder column or nitrogen evaporation.
11.5.1 Micro-Snyder column: Add a clean boiling chip and attach a two-ball micro-Snyder column to the concentrator tube. Prewet the column by adding approximately 0.5 mL hexane through the top. Place the apparatus in the hot water bath. Adjust the vertical position and the water temperature as required to complete the concentration in 5 to 10 minutes. At the proper rate of distillation, the balls of the column will actively chatter but the chambers will not flood. When the liquid reaches an apparent volume of approximately 0.2 mL, remove the apparatus from the water bath and allow to drain and cool for at least 10 minutes. Remove the micro-Snyder column and rinse its lower joint into the concentrator tube with approximately 0.2 mL of hexane. Adjust to a final volume of 0.5 mL.
11.5.2 Nitrogen evaporation: Transfer the concentrator tube to a nitrogen evaporation device and direct a gentle stream of clean dry nitrogen into the concentrator. Rinse the sides of the concentrator tube with small volumes of hexane, and concentrate the extract to a final volume of 0.5 mL.
11.6 Spike each extract with 10 µL of the 2,2′-difluorobiphenyl IIS (Section 7.10) and transfer the concentrated extract to a clean screw-cap vial using hexane to rinse the concentrator tube. Seal the vial with a PTFE-lined lid, and mark the level on the vial. Label with the sample number and store in the dark at −20 to −10 °C until ready for analysis.

# 12.0 GCMS Analysis
12.1 Establish the following operating conditions:
Carrier gas flow: Helium at 30 cm/sec at 50 °C
Injector temperature: 300 °C
Initial temperature: 50 °C
Temperature program: 8 °C/min to 270 °C
Final hold: Until after 2,6-dichlorosyringaldehyde elutes
Adjust the GC conditions to meet the requirements in Section 9.6.1.1 and Table 2 for analyte separation and sensitivity. Once optimized, the same GC conditions must be used for the analysis of all standards, blanks, IPR and OPR aliquots, and samples.
12.2 Bring the concentrated extract (Section 11.6) or standard (Sections 7.13 and 7.14) to room temperature and verify that any precipitate has redissolved. Verify the level on the extract (Sections 7.13, 7.14, and 11.6) and bring to the mark with solvent if required.
12.3 Inject a 1-µL volume of the standard solution or extract using on-column or splitless injection. For 0.5 mL extracts, this 1-µL injection volume will contain 50 ng of the DFB internal standard. If an injection volume other than 1 µL is used, that volume must contain 50 ng of DFB.
12.4 Start the GC column temperature ramp upon injection. Start MS data collection after the solvent peak elutes. Stop data collection after the 2,6-dichlorosyringaldehyde peak elutes. Return the column to the initial temperature for analysis of the next sample.

# 13.0 Analysis of Complex Samples
Some samples may contain high levels (
1000 µg/L) of the compounds of interest, interfering compounds, and/or other phenolic materials. Some samples will not concentrate to 0.5 mL (Section 11.5); others will overload the GC column and/or mass spectrometer; others may contain amounts of phenols that may exceed the capacity of the derivatizing agent.
13.1 Analyze the dilute aliquot (Section 11.1.4) when the sample will not concentrate to 0.5 mL. If a dilute aliquot was not extracted, and the sample holding time (Section 8.4) has not been exceeded, dilute an aliquot of sample with reagent water, and derivatize and extract it (Section 11.1.4).
Otherwise, dilute the extract (Section 14.7.3) and quantitate it by the internal standard method (Section 14.3).
13.2 Recovery of the 2,2′-difluorobiphenyl instrument internal standard: The EICP area of the internal standard should be within a factor of two of the area in the OPR or VER standard (Section 9.6). If the absolute areas of the labeled compounds and the SMIS are within a factor of two of the respective areas in the OPR or VER standard, and the DFB internal standard area is less than one-half of its respective area, then internal standard loss in the extract has occurred. In this case, analyze the extract from the dilute aliquot (Section 11.1.4).
13.3 Recovery of labeled compounds and the sample matrix internal standard (SMIS): SMIS and labeled compound recovery specifications have been developed for samples with and without the addition of ascorbic acid. Compare the recoveries to the appropriate limits in Table 5.
13.3.1 If SMIS or labeled compound recoveries are outside the limits given in Table 5 and the associated OPR analysis meets the recovery criteria, the extract from the dilute aliquot (Section 11.1.4) is analyzed as in Section 14.7.
13.3.2 If labeled compound or SMIS recovery is outside the limits given in Table 5 and the associated OPR analysis did not meet recovery criteria, a problem in the derivatization/extraction/concentration of the sample is indicated, and the sample must be rederivatized and reanalyzed.

# 14.0 Data Analysis and Calculations
14.1 Qualitative determination: Identification is accomplished by comparison of data from analysis of a sample or blank with data stored in the mass spectral libraries. Identification of a compound is confirmed when the following criteria are met:
14.1.1 The signals for m/z 43 (to indicate the presence of the acetyl derivative) and all characteristic m/z's stored in the spectral library (Section 10.2.4) shall be present and shall maximize within the same two consecutive scans.
14.1.2 Either (1) the background corrected EICP areas, or (2) the corrected relative intensities of the mass spectral peaks at the GC peak maximum shall agree within a factor of two (0.5 to 2 times) for all m/z's stored in the library.
14.1.3 The relative retention time shall be within the window specified in Table 2.
14.1.4 The m/z's present in the mass spectrum from the component in the sample that are not present in the reference mass spectrum shall be accounted for by contaminant or background ions. If the mass spectrum is contaminated, an experienced spectrometrist (Section 1.4) shall determine the presence or absence of the compound.
14.2 Quantitative determination by isotope dilution: By adding a known amount of a labeled compound to every sample prior to derivatization and extraction, correction for recovery of the pollutant can be made because the pollutant and its labeled analog exhibit the same effects upon derivatization, extraction, concentration, and gas chromatography. Relative response (RR) values for sample mixtures are used in conjunction with calibration curves described in Section 10.4 to determine concentrations directly, so long as labeled compound spiking levels are constant. For the phenol example given in Figure 1 (Section 10.4.1), RR would be equal to 1.114. For this RR value, the phenol calibration curve given in Figure 1 indicates a concentration of 27 µg/mL in the sample extract (C
ex
).
14.2.1 Compute the concentration in the extract using the response ratio determined from calibration data (Section 10.4) and the following equation:
ER15ap98.031
Where:
C
ex
= concentration of the pollutant in the extract.
A
n
= area of the characteristic m/z for the pollutant.
C
l
= concentration of the labeled compound in the extract.
A
l
= area of the characteristic m/z for the labeled compound.
RR = response ratio from the initial calibration.
14.2.2 For the IPR (Section 9.3.2) and OPR (Section 9.6), compute the percent recovery of each pollutant using the equation in Section 14.6. The percent recovery is used for the evaluation of method and laboratory performance, in the form of IPR (Section 9.3.2) and OPR (Section 9.6).
14.3 Quantitative determination by internal standard: Compute the concentration using the response factor determined from calibration data (Section 10.5) and the following equation:
ER15ap98.032
Where:
C
ex
= concentration of the pollutant in the extract.
A
s
= area of the characteristic m/z for the pollutant.
C
is
= concentration of the internal standard in the extract (see note below).
A
is
= area of the characteristic m/z for the internal standard.
RF = response factor from the initial calibration.

# Note:
When this equation is used to compute the extract concentrations of native compounds without labeled analogs, use the
area (A
is
) and concentration (C
is
) of 3,4,5-trichlorophenol (SMIS) as the internal standard.
For the IPR (Section 9.3.2) and OPR (Section 9.6), compute the percent recovery using the equation in Section 14.6.

# Note:
Separate calibration curves will be required for samples with and without the addition of ascorbic acid, and also for both extraction procedures (stir-bar and separatory funnel) where applicable.
14.4 Compute the concentration of the labeled compounds and the SMIS using the equation in Section 14.3, but using the area and concentration of the 2,2′-difluorobiphenyl as the internal standard, and the area of the labeled compound or SMIS as A
s
.
14.5 Compute the concentration of each pollutant compound in the sample using the following equation:
ER15ap98.033
Where:
C
s
= Concentration of the pollutant in the sample.
C
ex
= Concentration of the pollutant in the extract.
V
ex
= Volume of the concentrated extract (typically 0.5 mL).
V
o
= Volume of the original sample in liters.
14.6 Compute the recovery of each labeled compound and the SMIS as the ratio of concentration (or amount) found to the concentration (or amount) spiked, using the following equation:
ER15ap98.034
These percent recoveries are used to assess method performance according to Sections 9 and 13.
14.7 If the EICP area at the quantitation m/z for any compound exceeds the calibration range of the system, three approaches are used to obtain results within the calibration range.
14.7.1 If the recoveries of all the labeled compounds in the original sample aliquot meet the limits in Table 5, then the extract of the sample may be diluted by a maximum of a factor of 10, and the diluted extract reanalyzed.
14.7.2 If the recovery of any labeled compound is outside its limits in Table 5, or if a tenfold dilution of the extract will not bring the pollutant within the calibration range, then extract and analyze a dilute aliquot of the sample (Section 11). Dilute 100 mL, 10 mL, or an appropriate volume of sample to 1000 mL with reagent water and extract per Section 11.
14.7.3 If the recoveries of all labeled compounds in the original sample aliquot (Section 14.7.1) meet the limits in Table 5, and if the sample holding time has been exceeded, then the original sample extract is diluted by successive factors of 10, the DFB internal standard is added to give a concentration of 50 µg/mL in the diluted extract, and the diluted extract is analyzed. Quantitation of all analytes is performed using the DFB internal standard.
14.7.4 If the recoveries of all labeled compounds in the original sample aliquot (Section 14.7.1) or in the dilute aliquot (Section 14.7.2) (if a dilute aliquot was analyzed) do not meet the limits in Table 5, and if the holding time has been exceeded, re-sampling is required.
14.8 Results are reported for all pollutants, labeled compounds, and the sample matrix internal standard in standards, blanks, and samples, in units of µg/L.
14.8.1 Results for samples which have been diluted are reported at the least dilute level at which the area at the quantitation m/z is within the calibration range (Section 14.7).
14.8.2 For compounds having a labeled analog, results are reported at the least dilute level at which the area at the quantitation m/z is within the calibration range (Section 14.7) and the labeled compound recovery is within the normal range for the method (Section 13.3).

# 15.0 Method Performance
15.1 Single laboratory performance for this method is detailed in References 1, 2, and 11. Acceptance criteria were established from multiple laboratory use of the draft method.
15.2 A chromatogram of the ongoing precision and recovery standard (Section 7.14) is shown in Figure 4.

# 16.0 Pollution Prevention
16.1 The solvents used in this method pose little threat to the environment when recycled and managed properly.
16.2 Standards should be prepared in volumes consistent with laboratory use to minimize the volume of expired standards to be disposed.

# 17.0 Waste Management
17.1 It is the laboratory's responsibility to comply with all federal, state, and local regulations governing waste management, particularly the hazardous waste identification rules and land disposal restrictions, and to protect the air, water, and land by minimizing and controlling all releases from fume hoods and bench operations. Compliance with all sewage discharge permits and regulations is also required.
17.2 Samples preserved with HCl or H

§ 433.12
Monitoring requirements.
(a) In lieu of requiring monitoring for TTO, the permitting authority (or, in the case of indirect dischargers, the control authority) may allow dischargers to make the following certification statement: “Based on my inquiry of the person or persons directly responsible for managing compliance with the permit limitation [or pretreatment standard] for total toxic organics (TTO), I certify that, to the best of my knowledge and belief, no dumping of concentrated toxic organics into the wastewaters has occurred since filing of the last discharge monitoring report. I further certify that this facility is implementing the toxic organic management plan submitted to the permitting [or control] authority.” For direct dischargers, this statement is to be included as a “comment” on the Discharge Monitoring Report required by 40 CFR 122.44(i), formerly 40 CFR 122.62(i). For indirect dischargers, the statement is to be included as a comment to the periodic reports required by 40 CFR 403.12(e). If monitoring is necessary to measure compliance with the TTO standard, the industrial discharger need analyse for only those pollutants which would reasonably be expected to be present.
(b) In requesting the certification alternative, a discharger shall submit a solvent management plan that specifies to the satisfaction of the permitting authority (or, in the case of indirect dischargers, the control authority) the toxic organic compounds used; the method of disposal used instead of dumping, such as reclamation, contract hauling, or incineration; and procedures for ensuring that toxic organics do not routinely spill or leak into the wastewater. For direct dischargers, the permitting authority shall incorporate the plan as a provision of the permit.
(c) Self-monitoring for cyanide must be conducted after cyanide treatment and before dilution with other streams. Alternatively, samples may be taken of the final effluent, if the plant limitations are adjusted based on the dilution ratio of the cyanide waste stream flow to the effluent flow.

# Subpart G—Coal Remining

# Source:
67 FR 3406, Jan. 23, 2002, unless otherwise noted.
§ 434.70
Specialized definitions.
(a) The term
coal remining operation
means a coal mining operation at a site on which coal mining was previously conducted and where the site has been abandoned or the performance bond has been forfeited.
(b) The term
pollution abatement area
means the part of the permit area that is causing or contributing to the baseline pollution load of pre-existing discharges. The pollution abatement area must include, to the extent practicable, areas adjacent to and nearby the remining operation that also must be affected to reduce the pollution load of the pre-existing discharges and may include the immediate location of the pre-existing discharges.
(c) The term
pre-existing discharge
means any discharge resulting from mining activities that have been abandoned prior to the time of a remining permit application. This term shall include a pre-existing discharge that is relocated as a result of the implementation of best management practices (BMPs) contained in the Pollution Abatement Plan.
(d) The term
steep slope
means any slope above twenty degrees or such lesser slope as may be defined by the
regulatory authority after consideration of soil, climate, and other characteristics of a region or State. This term does not apply to those situations in which an operator is mining on flat or gently rolling terrain, on which an occasional steep slope is encountered and through which the mining operation is to proceed, leaving a plain or predominantly flat area.
(e) The term
new source remining operation
means a remining operation at a coal mine where mining first commences after February 22, 2002 and subsequently becomes an abandoned mine.
§ 434.71
Applicability.
(a) This subpart applies to pre-existing discharges that are located within or are hydrologically connected to pollution abatement areas of a coal remining operation.
(b) A pre-existing discharge that is intercepted by active mining or that is commingled with waste streams from active mining areas for treatment is subject to the provisions of § 434.61 Commingling of waste streams. For the purposes of this subpart, § 434.61 requires compliance with applicable BPT, BAT, BCT, and NSPS effluent limitations in subparts C, D, and F of this part. Section 434.61 applies to the commingled waste stream only during the time when the pre-existing discharge is intercepted by active mining or is commingled with active mine wastewater for treatment or discharge. After commingling has ceased, the pre-existing discharge is subject to the provisions of this part.
(c) In situations where coal remining operations seek reissuance of an existing remining permit with BPJ limitations and the regulatory authority determines that it is not feasible for a remining operator to re-establish baseline pollutant levels in accordance with the statistical procedures contained in appendix B of this part, pre-existing discharge limitations at existing remining operations shall remain subject to baseline pollutant levels established during the original permit application.
(d) The effluent limitations in this subpart apply to pre-existing discharges until the appropriate SMCRA authority has authorized bond release.
§ 434.72
Effluent limitations attainable by the application of the best practicable control technology currently available (BPT).
(a) The operator must submit a site-specific Pollution Abatement Plan to the permitting authority for the pollution abatement area. The plan must be approved by the permitting authority and incorporated into the permit as an effluent limitation. The Pollution Abatement Plan must identify characteristics of the pollution abatement area and the pre-existing discharges. The Pollution Abatement Plan must be designed to reduce the pollution load from pre-existing discharges and must identify the selected best management practices (BMPs) to be used. The plan must describe the design specifications, construction specifications, maintenance schedules, criteria for monitoring and inspection, and expected performance of the BMPs. The BMPs must be implemented as specified in the plan.
(b) (1) Except as provided in 40 CFR 125.30 through 125.32 and paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the following effluent limits apply to pre-existing discharges:
Effluent Limitations
Pollutant
Requirement
(i) Iron, total
May not exceed baseline loadings (as defined by appendix B of this part).
(ii) Manganese, total
May not exceed baseline loadings (as defined by appendix B of this part).
(iii) Acidity, net
May not exceed baseline loadings (as defined by appendix B of this part).
(iv) TSS
During remining and reclamation, may not exceed baseline loadings (as defined by appendix B of this part).
Prior to bond release, the pre-existing discharge must meet the applicable standards for TSS or SS contained in subpart E.
1
1
A pre-existing discharge is exempt from meeting standards in subpart E of this part for TSS and SS when the permitting authority determines that subpart E standards are infeasible or impractical based on the site-specific conditions of soil, climate, topography, steep slopes, or other baseline conditions provided that the operator demonstrates that significant reductions of TSS and SS will be achieved through the incorporation of sediment control BMPs into the Pollution Abatement Plan as required by paragraph (a) of this section.
(2) If the permitting authority determines that it is infeasible to collect samples for establishing the baseline pollutant levels pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section, and that remining will result in significant improvement that would not otherwise occur, then the numeric effluent limitations in paragraph (b)(1) of this section do not apply. Pre-existing discharges for which it is infeasible to collect samples for determination of baseline pollutant levels include, but are not limited to, discharges that exist as a diffuse groundwater flow that cannot be assessed via sample collection; a base flow to a receiving stream that cannot be monitored separate from the receiving stream; a discharge on a steep or hazardous slope that is inaccessible for sample collection; or, a number of pre-existing discharges so extensive that monitoring of individual discharges is infeasible.
§ 434.73
Effluent limitations attainable by application of the best available technology economically achievable (BAT).
Except as provided in 40 CFR 125.30 through 125.32 and 434.72(b)(2), a pre-existing discharge must comply with the effluent limitations listed in § 434.72(b) for net acidity, iron and manganese. The operator must also submit and implement a Pollution Abatement Plan as required in § 434.72(a) .

# Appendix A to Part 434—Alternate Storm Limitations for Acid or Ferruginous Mine Drainage
EC01MY92.113
Pt. 434, App. B

# Appendix B to Part 434—Baseline Determination and Compliance Monitoring for Pre-existing Discharges at Remining Operations

# I. General Procedure Requirements
a. This appendix presents the procedures to be used for establishing effluent limitations for pre-existing discharges at coal remining operations, in accordance with the requirements set forth in subpart G; Coal Remining. The requirements specify that pollutant loadings of total iron, total manganese, total suspended solids, and net acidity in pre-existing discharges shall not exceed baseline pollutant loadings. The procedures described in this appendix shall be used for determining site-specific, baseline pollutant loadings, and for determining whether discharge loadings during coal remining operations have exceeded the baseline loading. Both a monthly (single-observation) procedure and an annual procedure shall be applied, as described below.
b. In order to sufficiently characterize pollutant loadings during baseline determination and during each annual monitoring period, it is required that at least one sample result be obtained per month for a period of 12 months.
c. Calculations described in this appendix must be applied to pollutant loadings. Each loading value is calculated as the product of a flow measurement and pollutant concentration taken on the same date at the same discharge sampling point, using standard units of flow and concentration (to be determined by the permitting authority). For example, flow may be measured in cubic feet per second, concentration in milligrams per liter, and the pollutant loading could be calculated in pounds per year.
d. Accommodating Data Below the Maximum Daily Limit at subpart C of this part. In the event that a pollutant concentration in the data used to determine baseline is lower than the daily maximum limitation established in subpart C of this part for active mine wastewater, the statistical procedures should not establish a baseline more stringent than the BPT and BAT effluent standards established in subpart C of this part. Therefore, if the total iron concentration in a baseline sample is below 7.0 mg/L, or the total manganese concentration is below 4.0 mg/L, the baseline sample concentration may be replaced with 7.0 mg/L and 4.0 mg/L, respectively, for the purposes of some of the statistical calculations in this appendix B. The substituted values should be used for all methods in this appendix B with the exception of the calculation of the interquartile range (R) in Method 1 for the annual trigger (Step 3), and in Method 2 for the single observation trigger (Step 3). The interquartile range (R) is the difference between the quartiles M
−1
and M
1
; these values should be calculated using actual loadings (based on measured concentrations) when they are used to calculate R. This should be done in order to account for the full range of variability in the data.

# II. Procedure for Calculating and Applying a Single-Observation (Monthly) Trigger
Two alternative methods are provided for calculating a single-observation trigger. One method must be selected and applied by the permitting authority for any given remining permit.

# A. Method 1 for Calculating a Single Observation Trigger (L)
(1) Count the number of baseline observations taken for the pollutant of interest. Label this number n. In order to sufficiently characterize pollutant loadings during baseline determination and during each annual monitoring period, it is required that at least one sample result be obtained per month for a period of 12 months.
(2) Order all baseline loading observations from lowest to highest. Let the lowest number (minimum) be x
(1)
, the next lowest be x
(2)
, and so forth until the highest number (maximum) is x
(n).
(3) If fewer than 17 baseline observations were obtained, then the single observation trigger (L) will equal the maximum of the baseline observations (x
(n)
).
(4) If at least 17 baseline observations were obtained, calculate the median (M) of all baseline observations:
Instructions for calculation of a median of n observations:
If n is odd, then M equals x
(n/2 + 1/2).
For example, if there are 17 observations, then M = X
(17/2
+
1/2
) = x
(9)
, the 9th highest observation.
If n is even, then M equals 0.5 * (x
(n/2)
+ x
(n/2 + 1)
).
For example, if there are 18 observations, then M equals 0.5 multiplied by the sum of the 9th and 10th highest observations.
(a) Next, calculate M
1
as the median of the subset of observations that range from the calculated M to the maximum x
(n)
; that is, calculate the median of all x larger than or equal to M.
(b) Next, calculate M
2
as the median of the subset of observations that range from the calculated M
1
to x
(n)
; that is, calculate the median of all x larger than or equal to M
1
.
(c) Next, calculate M
3
as the median of the subset of observations that range from the calculated M
2
to x
(n)
; that is, calculate the median of all x larger than or equal to M
2
.
(d) Finally, calculate the single observation trigger (L) as the median of the subset of observations that range from the calculated M
3
to x
(n).

# Note:
When subsetting the data for each of steps 3a-3d, the subset should include all observations greater than or equal to the median calculated in the previous step. If the median calculated in the previous step is not an actual observation, it is not included in the new subset of observations. The new median value will then be calculated using the median procedure, based on whether the number of points in the subset is odd or even.
(5) Method for applying the single observation trigger (L) to determine when the baseline level has been exceeded
If two successive monthly monitoring observations both exceed L, immediately begin weekly monitoring for four weeks (four weekly samples).
(a) If three or fewer of the weekly observations exceed L, resume monthly monitoring
(b) If all four weekly observations exceed L, the baseline pollution loading has been exceeded.

# B. Method 2 for Calculating a Single Observation Trigger (L)
(1) Follow Method 1 above to obtain M
1
(the third quartile, that is, the 75th percentile).
(2) Calculate M
−1
as the median of the baseline data which are less than or equal to the sample median M.
(3) Calculate interquartile range, R = (M
1
− M
−1
).
(4) Calculate the single observation trigger L as
L = M
1
+ 3 * R
(5) If two successive monthly monitoring observations both exceed L, immediately begin weekly monitoring for four weeks (four weekly samples).
(a) If three or fewer of the weekly observations exceed L, resume monthly monitoring
(b) If all four weekly observations exceed L, the baseline pollution loading has been exceeded.

# III. Procedure for Calculating and Applying an Annual Trigger

# A. Method 1 for Calculating and Applying an Annual Trigger (T)
(1) Calculate M and M
1
of the baseline loading data as described above under Method 1 for the single observation trigger.
(2) Calculate M
−1
as the median of the baseline data which are less than or equal to the sample median M.
(3) Calculate the interquartile range, R = (M
1
− M
−1
).
(4) The annual trigger for baseline (Tb) is calculated as:
ER23JA02.002
where n is the number of baseline loading observations.
(5) To compare baseline loading data to observations from the annual monitoring period, repeat steps 1-3 for the set of monitoring observations. Label the results of the calculations M′ and R′. Let m be the number of monitoring observations.
(6) The subtle trigger (Tm) of the monitoring data is calculated as:
ER23JA02.003
(7) If Tm
Tb, the median loading of the monitoring observations has exceeded the baseline loading.

# B. Method 2 for Calculating and Applying an Annual Trigger (T)
Method 2 applies the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test to determine whether the median loading of the monitoring observations has exceeded the baseline median. No baseline value T is calculated.

# (1) Steps for Conducting the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney Test
(a) Let n be the number of baseline loading observations taken, and let m be the number of monitoring loading observations taken. In order to sufficiently characterize pollutant loadings during baseline determination and during each annual monitoring period, it is required that at least one sample result be obtained per month for a period of 12 months.
(b) Order the combined baseline and monitoring observations from smallest to largest.
(c) Assign a rank to each observation based on the assigned order: the smallest observation will have rank 1, the next smallest will have rank 2, and so forth, up to the highest observation, which will have rank n + m.
(1) If two or more observations are tied (have the same value), then the average rank for those observations should be used. For example, suppose the following four values are being ranked:
3, 4, 6, 4
Since 3 is the lowest of the four numbers, it would be assigned a rank of 1. The highest of the four numbers is 6, and would be assigned a rank of 4. The other two numbers are both 4. Rather than assign one a rank of 2 and the other a rank of 3, the average of 2 and 3 (
i.e.,
2.5) is given to both numbers.
(d) Sum all the assigned ranks of the n baseline observations, and let this sum be S
n
.
(e) Obtain the critical value (C) from Table 1. When 12 monthly data are available for both baseline and monitoring (
i.e.,
n = 12 and m = 12), the critical value C is 99.
(f) Compare C to S
n
. If S
n
is less than C, then the monitoring loadings have exceeded the baseline loadings.

For example, this calculation provides a result of 295.76 for n = m = 20, and a result of 96.476 for n = m = 12. Rounding up produces approximate critical values of 296 and 97.
(c) When n or m is greater than 20 and there are many ties, calculate an approximate critical value using the following formula and round the result to the next larger

Synthetic material
as applied to synthetic-based drilling fluid means material produced by the reaction of specific purified chemical feedstock, as opposed to the traditional base fluids such as diesel and mineral oil which are derived from crude oil solely through physical separation processes. Physical separation processes include fractionation and distillation and/or minor chemical reactions such as cracking and hydro processing. Since they are synthesized by the reaction of purified compounds, synthetic materials suitable for use in drilling fluids are typically free of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH's) but are sometimes found to contain levels of PAH up to 0.001 weight percent PAH expressed as phenanthrene. Internal olefins and vegetable esters are two examples of synthetic materials suitable for use by the oil and gas extraction industry in formulating drilling fluids. Internal olefins are synthesized from the isomerization of purified straight-chain (linear) hydrocarbons such as C
16
-C
18
linear alpha olefins. C
16
-C
18
linear alpha olefins are unsaturated hydrocarbons with the carbon to carbon double bond in the terminal position.
Internal olefins are typically formed from heating linear alpha olefins with a catalyst. The feed material for synthetic linear alpha olefins is typically purified ethylene. Vegetable esters are synthesized from the acid-catalyzed esterification of vegetable fatty acids with various alcohols. EPA listed these two branches of synthetic fluid base materials to provide examples, and EPA does not mean to exclude other synthetic materials that are either in current use or may be used in the future. A synthetic-based drilling fluid may include a combination of synthetic materials.

Pt. 435, Subpt. A, App. 1

# Appendix 1 to Subpart A of Part 435—Static Sheen Test (EPA Method 1617)

# 1. Scope and Application
This method is to be used as a compliance test for the “no discharge of free oil” requirement for discharges of drilling fluids, drill cuttings, produced sand, and well treatment, completion and workover fluids. “Free oil” refers to any oil contained in a waste stream that when discharged will cause a film or sheen upon or a discoloration of the surface of the receiving water.

# 2. Summary of Method
15-mL samples of drilling fluids or well treatment, completion, and workover fluids, and 15-g samples (wet weight basis) of drill cuttings or produced sand are introduced into ambient seawater in a container having an air-to-liquid interface area of 1000 cm
2
(155.5 in
2
). Samples are dispersed within the container and observations made no more than one hour later to ascertain if these materials cause a sheen, iridescence, gloss, or increased reflectance on the surface of the test seawater. The occurrence of any of these visual observations will constitute a demonstration that the tested material contains “free oil,” and therefore results in a prohibition of its discharge into receiving waters.

# 3. Interferences
Residual “free oil” adhering to sampling containers, the magnetic stirring bar used to mix the sample, and the stainless steel spatula used to mix the sample will be the principal sources of contamination problems. These problems should only occur if improperly washed and cleaned equipment are used for the test. The use of disposable equipment minimizes the potential for similar contamination from pipettes and the test container.

# 4. Apparatus, Materials, and Reagents
4.1 Apparatus
4.1.1 Sampling Containers: 1-liter polyethylene beakers and 1-liter glass beakers.
4.1.2 Graduated cylinder: 100-mL graduated cylinder required only for operations where predilution of mud discharges is required.
4.1.3 Plastic disposable weighing boats.
4.1.4 Triple-beam scale.
4.1.5 Disposable pipettes: 25-mL disposable pipettes.
4.1.6 Magnetic stirrer and stirring bar.
4.1.7 Stainless steel spatula.
4.1.8 Test container: Open plastic container whose internal cross-section parallel to its opening has an area of 1000 cm
2
±50 cm
2
(155.5 ±7.75 in
2
), and a depth of at least 13 cm (5 inches) and no more than 30 cm (11.8 inches).
4.2 Materials and Reagents.
4.2.1 Plastic liners for the test container: Oil-free, heavy-duty plastic trash can liners that do not inhibit the spreading of an oil film. Liners must be of sufficient size to completely cover the interior surface of the test container. Permittees must determine an appropriate local source of liners that do not inhibit the spreading of 0.05 mL of diesel fuel added to the lined test container under the test conditions and protocol described below.
4.2.2 Ambient receiving water.

# 5. Calibration
None currently specified.

# 6. Quality Control Procedures
None currently specified.

# 7. Sample Collection and Handling
7.1 Sampling containers must be thoroughly washed with detergent, rinsed a minimum of three times with fresh water, and allowed to air dry before samples are collected.
7.2 Samples of drilling fluid to be tested shall be taken at the shale shaker after cuttings have been removed. The sample volume should range between 200 mL and 500 mL.
7.3 Samples of drill cuttings will be taken from the shale shaker screens with a clean spatula or similar instrument and placed in a glass beaker. Cuttings samples shall be collected prior to the addition of any washdown water and should range between 200 g and 500 g.
7.4 Samples of produced sand must be obtained from the solids control equipment from which the discharge occurs on any given day and shall be collected prior to the addition of any washdown water; samples should range between 200 g and 500 g.
7.5 Samples of well treatment, completion, and workover fluids must be obtained from the holding facility prior to discharge; the sample volume should range between 200 mL and 500 mL.
7.6 Samples must be tested no later than 1 hour after collection.
7.7 Drilling fluid samples must be mixed in their sampling containers for 5 minutes prior to the test using a magnetic bar stirrer. If predilution is imposed as a permit condition, the sample must be mixed at the same ratio with the same prediluting water as the discharged muds and stirred for 5 minutes.
7.8 Drill cuttings must be stirred and well mixed by hand in their sampling containers prior to testing, using a stainless steel spatula.

# 8. Procedure
8.1 Ambient receiving water must be used as the “receiving water” in the test. The temperature of the test water shall be as close as practicable to the ambient conditions in the receiving water, not the room temperature of the observation facility. The test container must have an air-to-liquid interface area of 1000 ±50 cm
2
. The surface of the water should be no more than 1.27 cm (.5 inch) below the top of the test container.
8.2 Plastic liners shall be used, one per test container, and discarded afterwards. Some liners may inhibit spreading of added oil; operators shall determine an appropriate local source of liners that do not inhibit the spreading of the oil film.
8.3 A 15-mL sample of drilling fluid or well treatment, completion, and workover fluids must be introduced by pipette into the test container 1 cm below the water surface. Pipettes must be filled and discharged with test material prior to the transfer of test material and its introduction into test containers. The test water/test material mixture must be stirred using the pipette to distribute the test material homogeneously throughout the test water. The pipette must be used only once for a test and then discarded.
8.4 Drill cuttings or produced sand should be weighed on plastic weighing boats; 15-g samples must be transferred by scraping test material into the test water with a stainless steel spatula. Drill cuttings shall not be prediluted prior to testing. Also, drilling fluids and cuttings will be tested separately. The weighing boat must be immersed in the test water and scraped with the spatula to transfer any residual material to the test container. The drill cuttings or produced sand must be stirred with the spatula to an even distribution of solids on the bottom of the test container.
8.5 Observations must be made no later than 1 hour after the test material is transferred to the test container. Viewing points above the test container should be made from at least three sides of the test container, at viewing angles of approximately 60° and 30° from the horizontal. Illumination of the test container must be representative of adequate lighting for a working environment to conduct routine laboratory procedures. It is recommended that the water surface of the test container be observed under a fluorescent light source such as a dissecting microscope light. The light source shall be positioned above and directed over the entire surface of the pan.
8.6 Detection of a “silvery” or “metallic” sheen or gloss, increased reflectivity, visual color, iridescence, or an oil slick on the water surface of the test container surface shall constitute a demonstration of “free oil.” These visual observations include patches, streaks, or sheets of such altered surface characteristics. If the free oil content of the sample approaches or exceeds 10%, the water surface of the test container may lack color, a sheen, or iridescence, due to the increased thickness of the film; thus, the observation for an oil slick is required. The surface of the test container shall not be disturbed in any manner that reduces the size of any sheen or slick that may be present.
If an oil sheen or slick occurs on less than one-half of the surface area after the sample is introduced to the test container, observations will continue for up to 1 hour. If the sheen or slick increases in size and covers greater than one-half of the surface area of the test container during the observation period, the discharge of the material shall cease. If the sheen or slick does not increase in size to cover greater than one-half of the test container surface area after one hour of observation, discharge may continue and additional sampling is not required.
If a sheen or slick occurs on greater than one-half of the surface area of the test container after the test material is introduced, discharge of the tested material shall cease. The permittee may retest the material causing the sheen or slick. If subsequent tests do not result in a sheen or slick covering greater than one-half of the surface area of the test container, discharge may continue.

# Appendix 2 to Subpart A of Part 435—Drilling Fluids Toxicity Test (EPA Method 1619)

# I. Sample Collection
The collection and preservation methods for drilling fluids (muds) and water samples presented here are designed to minimize sample contamination and alteration of the physical or chemical properties of the samples due to freezing, air oxidation, or drying.

# I-A. Apparatus
(1) The following items are required for water and drilling mud sampling and storage:
a. Acid-rinsed linear-polyethylene bottles or other appropriate noncontaminating drilling mud sampler.
b. Acid-rinsed linear-polyethylene bottles or other appropriate noncontaminating water sampler.
c. Acid-rinsed linear-polyethylene bottles or other appropriate noncontaminated vessels for water and mud samples.
d. Ice chests for preservation and shipping of mud and water samples.

# I-B. Water Sampling
(1) Collection of water samples shall be made with appropriate acid-rinsed linear-polyethylene bottles or other appropriate
non-contaminating water sampling devices. Special care shall be taken to avoid the introduction of contaminants from the sampling devices and containers. Prior to use, the sampling devices and containers should be thoroughly cleaned with a detergent solution, rinsed with tap water, soaked in 10 percent hydrochloric acid (HCl) for 4 hours, and then thoroughly rinsed with glass-distilled water.

# I-C. Drilling Mud Sampling
(1) Drilling mud formulations to be tested shall be collected from active field systems. Obtain a well-mixed sample from beneath the shale shaker after the mud has passed through the screens. Samples shall be stored in polyethylene containers or in other appropriate uncontaminated vessels. Prior to sealing the sample containers on the platform, flush as much air out of the container by filling it with drilling fluid sample, leaving a one inch space at the top.
(2) Mud samples shall be immediately shipped to the testing facility on blue or wet ice (do not use dry ice) and continuously maintained at 0-4 °C until the time of testing.
(3) Bulk mud samples shall be thoroughly mixed in the laboratory using a 1000 rpm high shear mixer and then subdivided into individual, small wide-mouthed (e.g., one or two liter) non-contaminating containers for storage.
(4) The drilling muds stored in the laboratory shall have any excess air removed by flushing the storage containers with nitrogen under pressure anytime the containers are opened. Moreover, the sample in any container opened for testing must be thoroughly stirred using a 1000 rpm high shear mixer prior to use.
(5) Most drilling mud samples may be stored for periods of time longer than 2 weeks prior to toxicity testing provided that proper containers are used and proper condition are maintained.

# II. Suspended Particulate Phase Sample Preparation
(1) Mud samples that have been stored under specified conditions in this protocol shall be prepared for tests within three months after collection. The SPP shall be prepared as detailed below.

# II-A. Apparatus
(1) The following items are required:
a. Magnetic stir plates and bars.
b. Several graduated cylinders, ranging in volume from 10 mL to 1 L
c. Large (15 cm) powder funnels.
d. Several 2-liter graduated cylinders.
e. Several 2-liter large mouth graduated Erlenmeyer flasks.
(2) Prior to use, all glassware shall be thoroughly cleaned. Wash all glassware with detergent, rinse five times with tap water, rinse once with acetone, rinse several times with distilled or deionized water, place in a clean 10-percent (or stronger) HCl acid bath for a minimum of 4 hours, rinse five times with tap water, and then rinse five times with distilled or deionized water. For test samples containing mineral oil or diesel oil, glassware should be washed with petroleum ether to assure removal of all residual oil.

# Note:
If the glassware with nytex cups soaks in the acid solution longer than 24 hours, then an equally long deionized water soak should be performed.

# II-B. Test Seawater Sample Preparation
(1) Diluent seawater and exposure seawater samples are prepared by filtration through a 1.0 micrometer filter prior to analysis.
(2) Artificial seawater may be used as long as the seawater has been prepared by standard methods or ASTM methods, has been properly “seasoned,” filtered, and has been diluted with distilled water to the same specified 20±2 ppt salinity and 20±2 °C temperature as the “natural” seawater.

# II-C. Sample Preparation
(1) The pH of the mud shall be tested prior to its use. If the pH is less than 9, if black spots have appeared on the walls of the sample container, or if the mud sample has a foul odor, that sample shall be discarded. Subsample a manageable aliquot of mud from the well-mixed original sample. Mix the mud and filtered test seawater in a volumetric mud-to-water ratio of 1 to 9. This is best done by the method of volumetric displacement in a 2-L, large mouth, graduated Erlenmeyer flask. Place 1000 mL of seawater into the graduated Erlenmeyer flask. The mud subsample is then carefully added via a powder funnel to obtain a total volume of 1200 mL. (A 200 mL volume of the mud will now be in the flask).
The 2-L, large mouth, graduated Erlenmeyer flask is then filled to the 2000 mL mark with 800 mL of seawater, which produces a slurry with a final ratio of one volume drilling mud to nine volumes water. If the volume of SPP required for testing or analysis exceeds 1500 to 1600 mL, the initial volumes should be proportionately increased. Alternatively, several 2-L drill mud/water slurries may be prepared as outlined above and combined to provide sufficient SPP.
(2) Mix this mud/water slurry with magnetic stirrers for 5 minutes. Measure the pH and, if necessary, adjust (decrease) the pH of the slurry to within 0.2 units of the seawater by adding 6N HCl while stirring the slurry. Then, allow the slurry to settle for 1 hour. Record the amount of HCl added.
(3) At the end of the settling period, carefully decant (do not siphon) the Suspended Particulate Phase (SPP) into an appropriate container. Decanting the SPP is one continuous action. In some cases no clear interface will be present; that is, there will be no solid phase that has settled to the bottom. For those samples the entire SPP solution should be used when preparing test concentrations. However, in those cases when no clear interface is present, the sample must be remixed for five minutes. This insures the homogeneity of the mixture prior to the preparation of the test concentrations. In other cases, there will be samples with two or more phases, including a solid phase. For those samples, carefully and continuously decant the supernatant until the solid phase on the bottom of the flask is reached. The decanted solution is defined to be 100 percent SPP. Any other concentration of SPP refers to a percentage of SPP that is obtained by volumetrically mixing 100 percent SPP with seawater.
(4) SPP samples to be used in toxicity tests shall be mixed for 5 minutes and must not be preserved or stored.
(5) Measure the filterable and unfilterable residue of each SPP prepared for testing. Measure the dissolved oxygen (DO) and pH of the SPP. If the DO is less than 4.9 ppm, aerate the SPP to at least 4.9 ppm which is 65 percent of saturation. Maximum allowable aeration time is 5 minutes using a generic commercial air pump and air stone. Neutralize the pH of the SPP to a pH 7.8 ±.1 using a dilute HCl solution. If too much acid is added to lower the pH saturated NaOH may be used to raise the pH to 7.8 ±.1 units. Record the amount of acid or NaOH needed to lower/raise to the appropriate pH. Three repeated DO and pH measurements are needed to insure homogeneity and stability of the SPP. Preparation of test concentrations may begin after this step is complete.
(6) Add the appropriate volume of 100 percent SPP to the appropriate volume of seawater to obtain the desired SPP concentration. The control is seawater only. Mix all concentrations and the control for 5 minutes by using magnetic stirrers. Then, the animals shall be randomly selected and placed in the dishes in order to begin the 96-hour toxicity test.

# III. Guidance for Performing Suspended Particulate Phase Toxicity Tests Using Mysidopsis bahia

# III-A. Apparatus
(1) Each definitive test consists of 18 test containers: 3 replicates of a control and 5 SPP dilutions. Test containers should be Pyrex or equivalent glass. For definitive tests, 5 SPP dilutions with 3 replicates of at least 500 ml each are required. Twenty mysids per replicate, 360 per definitive test are required.

# III-B. Sample Collection Preservation
(1) Drilling muds and water samples are collected and stored, and the suspended particulate phase prepared as described in section 1-C.

# III-C. Species Selection
(1) The Suspended Particulate Phase (SPP) tests on drilling muds shall utilize the test species
Mysidopsis bahia.
Test animals shall be 3 to 6 days old on the first day of exposure. Whatever the source of the animals, collection and handling should be as gentle as possible. Transportation to the laboratory should be in well-aerated water from the animal culture site at the temperature and salinity from which they were cultured. Methods for handling, acclimating, and sizing bioassay organisms given by Borthwick [1] and Nimmo [2] shall be followed in matters for which no guidance is given here.

# III-D. Experimental Conditions
(1) Suspended particulate phase (SPP) tests should be conducted at a salinity of 20 ±2 ppt. Experimental temperature should be 20 ±2 °C. Dissolved oxygen in the SPP shall be raised to or maintained above 65 percent of saturation prior to preparation of the test concentrations. Under these conditions of temperature and salinity, 65 percent saturation is a DO of 5.3 ppm. Beginning at Day 0-before the animals are placed in the test containers DO, temperature, salinity, and pH shall be measured every 24 hours. DO should be reported in milligrams per liter.
(2) Aeration of test media is required during the entire test with a rate estimated to be 50-140 cubic centimeters/minute. This air flow to each test dish may be achieved through polyethylene tubing (0.045-inch inner diameter and 0.062-inch outer diameter) by a small generic aquarium pump. The delivery method, surface area of the aeration stone, and flow characteristics shall be documented. All treatments, including control, shall be the same.
(3) Light intensity shall be 1200 microwatts/cm
2
using cool white fluorescent bulbs with a 14-hr light and 10-hr dark cycle. This light/dark cycle shall also be maintained during the acclimation period and the test.

# III-E. Experimental Procedure
(1) Wash all glassware with detergent, rinse five times with tap water, rinse once with acetone, rinse several times with distilled or deionized water, place in a clean 10 percent HCl acid bath for a minimum of 4 hours, rinse five times with tap water, and then rinse five times with distilled water.
(2) Establish the definitive test concentrations based on results of a range finding test or based on prior experience and knowledge of the mud system.
(3) Twenty organisms are exposed in each test dish. Nytex ® cups shall be inserted into every test dish prior to adding the animals. These “nylon mesh screen” nytex holding cups are fabricated by gluing a collar of 363-micrometer mesh nylon screen to a 15-centimeter wide Petri dish with silicone sealant. The nylon screen collar is approximately 5 centimeters high. The animals are then placed into the test concentration within the confines of the Nytex cups.
(4) Individual organisms shall be randomly assigned to treatment. A randomization procedure is presented in section V of this protocol. Make every attempt to expose animals of approximately equal size. The technique described by Borthwick [1], or other suitable substitutes, should be used for transferring specimens. Throughout the test period, mysids shall be fed daily with approximately 50
Artemia
(brine shrimp) nauplii per mysid. This will reduce stress and decrease cannibalism.
(5) Cover the dishes, aerate, and incubate the test containers in an appropriate test chamber. Positioning of the test containers holding various concentrations of test solution should be randomized if incubator arrangement indicates potential position difference. The test medium is not replaced during the 96-hour test.
(6) Observations may be attempted at 4, 6 and 8 hours; they must be attempted at 0, 24, 48, and 72 hours and must be made at 96 hours. Attempts at observations refers to placing a test dish on a light table and visually counting the animals. Do not lift the “nylon mesh screen” cup out of the test dish to make the observation. No unnecessary handling of the animals should occur during the 96 hour test period. DO and pH measurements must also be made at 0, 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours. Take and replace the test medium necessary for the DO and pH measurements outside of the nytex cups to minimize stresses on the animals.
(7) At the end of 96 hours, all live animals must be counted. Death is the end point, so the number of living organisms is recorded. Death is determined by lack of spontaneous movement. All crustaceans molt at regular intervals, shedding a complete exoskeleton. Care should be taken not to count an exoskeleton. Dead animals might decompose or be eaten between observations. Therefore, always count living, not dead animals. If daily observations are made, remove dead organisms and molted exoskeletons with a pipette or forceps. Care must be taken not to disturb living organisms and to minimize the amount of liquid withdrawn.

# IV. Methods for Positive Control Tests (Reference Toxicant)
(1) Sodium lauryl sulfate (dodecyl sodium sulfate) is used as a reference toxicant for the positive control. The chemical used should be approximately 95 percent pure. The source, lot number, and percent purity shall be reported.
(2) Test methods are those used for the drilling fluid tests, except that the test material was prepared by weighing one gram sodium lauryl sulfate on an analytical balance, adding the chemical to a 100-milliliter volumetric flask, and bringing the flask to volume with deionized water. After mixing this stock solution, the test mixtures are prepared by adding 0.1 milliliter of the stock solution for each part per million desired to one liter of seawater.
(3) The mixtures are stirred briefly, water quality is measured, animals are added to holding cups, and the test begins. Incubation and monitoring procedures are the same as those for the drilling fluids.

# V. Randomization Procedure

# V-A. Purpose and Procedure
(1) The purpose of this procedure is to assure that mysids are impartially selected and randomly assigned to six test treatments (five drilling fluid or reference toxicant concentrations and a control) and impartially counted at the end of the 96-hour test. Thus, each test setup, as specified in the randomization procedure, consists of 3 replicates of 20 animals for each of the six treatments,
i.e.
, 360 animals per test. Figure 1 is a flow diagram that depicts the procedure schematically and should be reviewed to understand the over-all operation. The following tasks shall be performed in the order listed.
(2) Mysids are cultured in the laboratory in appropriate units. If mysids are purchased, go to Task 3.
(3) Remove mysids from culture tanks (6, 5, 4, and 3 days before the test will begin,
i.e.
, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday if the test will begin on Monday) and place them in suitably large maintenance containers so that they can swim about freely and be fed.

# Note:
Not every detail (the definition of suitably large containers, for example) is provided here. Training and experience in aquatic animal culture and testing will be required to successfully complete these tests.
EC01MY92.114
(4) Remove mysids from maintenance containers and place all animals in a single container. The intent is to have homogeneous test population of mysids of a known age (3-6 days old).
(5) For each toxicity test, assign two suitable containers (500-milliliter (mL) beakers are recommended) for mysid separation/enumeration. Label each container (A1, A2, B1, B2, and C1, C2, for example, if two drilling fluid tests and a reference toxicant test are to be set up on one day). The purpose of this task is to allow the investigator to obtain a close estimate of the number of animals available for testing and to prevent unnecessary crowding of the mysids while they are being counted and assigned to test containers. Transfer the mysids from the large test population container to the labeled separation and enumeration containers but do not place more than 200 mysids in a 500-mL beaker. Be impartial in transferring the mysids; place approximately equal numbers of animals (10-15 mysids is convenient) in each container in a cyclic manner rather than placing the maximum number each container at one time.

# Note:
It is important that the animals not be unduly stressed during this selection and assignment procedure. Therefore, it will probably be necessary to place all animals (except the batch immediately being assigned to test containers) in mesh cups with flowing seawater or in large volume containers with aeration. The idea is to provide the animals with near optimal conditions to avoid additional stress.
(6) Place the mysids from the two labeled enumeration containers assigned to a specific test into one or more suitable containers to be used as counting dishes (2-liter Carolina dishes are suggested). Because of the time required to separate, count, and assign mysids, two or more people may be involved in completing this task. If this is done, two or more counting dishes may be used, but the investigator must make sure that approximately equal numbers of mysids from each labeled container are placed in each counting dish.
(7) By using a large-bore, smooth-tip glass pipette, select mysids from the counting dish(es) and place them in the 36 individually numbered distribution containers (10-ml beakers are suggested). The mysids are assigned two at a time to the 36 containers by using a randomization schedule similar to the one presented below. At the end of selection/assignment round 1, each container will contain two mysids; at the end of round 2, they will contain four mysids; and so on until each contains ten mysids.

(8) Transfer mysids from the 36 distribution containers to 18 labeled test containers in random order. A label is assigned to each of the three replicates (A, B, C) of the six test concentrations. Count and record the 96 hour response in an impartial order.
(9) Repeat tasks 5-7 for each toxicity test. A new random schedule should be followed in Tasks 6 and 7 for each test.

# Note:
If a partial toxicity test is conducted, the procedures described above are appropriate and should be used to prepare the single test concentration and control, along with the reference toxicant test.

# V-B. Data Analysis and Interpretation
(1) Complete survival data in all test containers at each observation time shall be presented in tabular form. If greater than 10 percent mortality occurs in the controls, all data shall be discarded and the experiment repeated. Unacceptably high control mortality indicates the presence of important stresses on the organisms other than the material being tested, such as injury or disease, stressful physical or chemical conditions in the containers, or improper handling, acclimation, or feeding. If 10 percent mortality or less occurs in the controls, the data may be evaluated and reported.
(2) A definitive, full bioassay conducted according to the EPA protocol is used to estimate the concentration that is lethal to 50 percent of the test organisms that do not die naturally. This toxicity measure is known as the median lethal concentration, or LC-50. The LC-50 is adjusted for natural mortality or natural responsiveness. The maximum likelihood estimation procedure with the adjustments for natural responsiveness as given by D.J. Finney, in
Probit Analysis
3rd edition, 1971, Cambridge University Press, chapter 7, can be used to obtain the probit model estimate of the LC-50 and the 95 percent fiducial (confidence) limits for the LC-50. These estimates are obtained using the logarithmic transform of the concentration. The heterogeneity factor (Finney 1971, pages 70-72) is not used. For a test material to pass the toxicity test, according to the requirements stated in the offshore oil and gas extraction industry BAT effluent limitations and NSPS, the LC-50, adjusted for natural responsiveness, must be greater than 3 percent suspended particulate phase (SPP) concentration by volume unadjusted for the 1 to 9 dilution. Other toxicity test models may be used to obtain toxicity estimates provided the modeled mathematical expression for the lethality rate must increase continuously with concentration. The lethality rate is modeled to increase with concentration to reflect an assumed increase in toxicity with concentration even though the observed lethality may not increase uniformly because of the unpredictable animal response fluctuations.
(3) The range finding test is used to establish a reasonable set of test concentrations in order to run the definitive test. However, if the lethality rate changes rapidly over a narrow range of concentrations, the range finding assay may be too coarse to establish
an adequate set of test concentrations for a definitive test.
(4) The EPA Environmental Research Laboratory in Gulf Breeze, Florida prepared a Research and Development Report entitled Acute Toxicity of Eight Drilling Fluids to Mysid Shrimp (
Mysidopsis bahia
), May 1984 EPA-600/3-84-067. The Gulf Breeze data for drilling fluid number 1 are displayed in Table 1 for purposes of an example of the probit analysis described above. The SAS Probit Procedure (SAS Institute, Statistical Analysis System, Cary, North Carolina, 1982) was used to analyze these data. The 96-hour LC50 adjusted for the estimated spontaneous mortality rate is 3.3 percent SPP with 95 percent limits of 3.0 and 3.5 percent SPP with the 1 to 9 dilution. The estimated spontaneous mortality rate based on all of the data is 9.6 percent.

# V-C. The Partial Toxicity Test for Evaluation of Test Material
(1) A partial test conducted according to EPA protocol can be used economically to demonstrate that a test material passes the toxicity test. The partial test cannot be used to estimate the LC-50 adjusted for natural response.
(2) To conduct a partial test follow the test protocol for preparation of the test material and organisms. Prepare the control (zero concentration), one test concentration (3 percent suspended particulate phase) and the reference toxicant according to the methods of the full test. A range finding test is not used for the partial test.
(3) Sixty test organisms are used for each test concentration. Find the number of test organisms killed in the control (zero percent SPP) concentration in the column labeled X
0
of Table 2. If the number of organisms in the control (zero percent SPP) exceeds the table values, then the test is unacceptable and must be repeated. If the number of organisms killed in the 3 percent test concentration is less than or equal to corresponding number in the column labeled X
1
then the test material passes the partial toxicity test. Otherwise the test material fails the toxicity test.
(4) Data shall be reported as percent suspended particulate phase.

# Appendix 3 to Subpart A of Part 435—Procedure for Mixing Base Fluids With Sediments (EPA Method 1646)
This procedure describes a method for amending uncontaminated and nontoxic (control) sediments with the base fluids that are used to formulate synthetic-based drilling fluids and other non-aqueous drilling fluids. Initially, control sediments shall be press-sieved through a 2000 micron mesh sieve to remove large debris. Then press-sieve the sediment through a 500 micron sieve to remove indigenous organisms that may prey on the test species or otherwise confound test results. Homogenize control sediment to limit the effects of settling that
may have occurred during storage. Sediments should be homogenized before density determinations and addition of base fluid to control sediment. Because base fluids are strongly hydrophobic and do not readily mix with sediment, care must be taken to ensure base fluids are thoroughly homogenized within the sediment. All concentrations are weight-to-weight (mg of base fluid to kg of dry control sediment). Sediment and base fluid mixing shall be accomplished by using the following method.
1. Determine the wet to dry ratio for the control sediment by weighing approximately 10 g subsamples of the screened and homogenized wet sediment into tared aluminum weigh pans. Dry sediment at 105 °C for 18-24 h. Remove sediment and cool in a desiccator until a constant weight is achieved. Re-weigh the samples to determine the dry weight. Determine the wet/dry ratio by dividing the net wet weight by the net dry weight:
[Wet Sediment Weight (g)]/[Dry Sediment Weight (g)] = Wet to Dry Ratio [1]
2. Determine the density (g/mL) of the wet control or dilution sediment. This shall be used to determine total volume of wet sediment needed for the various test treatments.
[Mean Wet Sediment Weight (g)]/[Mean Wet Sediment Volume (mL)] = Wet Sediment Density (g/mL) [2]
3. To determine the amount of base fluid needed to obtain a test concentration of 500 mg base fluid per kg dry sediment use the following formulas:
Determine the amount of wet sediment required:
[Wet Sediment Density (g/mL)] × [Volume of Sediment Required per Concentration (mL)] = Weight Wet Sediment Required per Conc. (g) [3]
Determine the amount of dry sediment in kilograms (kg) required for each concentration:
{[Wet Sediment per Concentration (g)]/[Mean Wet to Dry Ratio]} × (1kg/1000g) = Dry Weight Sediment (kg) [4]
Finally, determine the amount of base fluid required to spike the control sediment at each concentration:
[Conc. Desired (mg/kg)] × [Dry Weight Sediment (kg)] = Base Fluid Required (mg) [5]
For spiking test substances other than pure base fluids (e.g., whole mud formulations), determine the spike amount as follows:
[Conc. Desired (mL/kg)] × [Dry Weight Sediment (kg)] × [Test Substance Density (g/mL)] = Test Substance Required (g) [6]
4. For primary mixing, place appropriate amounts of weighed base fluid into stainless mixing bowls, tare the vessel weight, then add sediment and mix with a high-shear dispersing impeller for 9 minutes. The concentration of base fluid in sediment from this mix, rather than the nominal concentration, shall be used in calculating LC
5
. values.
5. Tests for homogeneity of base fluid in sediment are to be performed during the procedure development phase. Because of difficulty of homogeneously mixing base fluid with sediment, it is important to demonstrate that the base fluid is evenly mixed with sediment. The sediment shall be analyzed for total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) using EPA Methods 3550A and 8015M, with samples taken both prior to and after distribution to replicate test containers. Base-fluid content is measured as TPH. After mixing the sediment, a minimum of three replicate sediment samples shall be taken prior to distribution into test containers. After the test sediment is distributed to test containers, an additional three sediment samples shall be taken from three test containers to ensure proper distribution of base fluid within test containers. Base-fluid content results shall be reported within 48 hours of mixing. The coefficient of variation (CV) for the replicate samples must be less than 20%. If base-fluid content results are not within the 20% CV limit, the test sediment shall be remixed. Tests shall not begin until the CV is determined to be below the maximum limit of 20%. During the test, a minimum of three replicate containers shall be sampled to determine base-fluid content during each sampling period.
6. Mix enough sediment in this way to allow for its use in the preparation of all test concentrations and as a negative control. When commencing the sediment toxicity test, range-finding tests may be required to determine the concentrations that produce a toxic effect if these data are otherwise unavailable. The definitive test shall bracket the LC
5
., which is the desired endpoint. The results for the base fluids shall be reported in mg of base fluid per kg of dry sediment.

# Appendix 4 to Subpart A of Part 435—Protocol for the Determination of Degradation of Non-Aqueous Base Fluids in a Marine Closed Bottle Biodegradation Test System: Modified ISO 11734:1995 (EPA Method 1647)

# 1.0. Summary of EPA Method 1647
a. This method determines the anaerobic degradation potential of mineral oils, paraffin oils and non-aqueous fluids (NAF) in sediments. These substrates are base fluids for formulating offshore drilling fluids. The test evaluates base fluid biodegradation rates by monitoring gas production due to microbial degradation of the test fluid in natural marine sediment.
b. The test procedure places a mixture of marine/estuarine sediment, test substrate (hydrocarbon or controls) and seawater into clean 120 mL (150 mL actual volume) Wheaton serum bottles. The test is run using four replicate serum bottles containing 2,000 mg carbon/kg dry weight concentration of test substrate in sediment. The use of resazurin dye solution (1 ppm) evaluates the anaerobic (redox) condition of the bottles (dye is blue when oxygen is present, reddish in low oxygen conditions and colorless if oxygen free). After capping the bottles, a nitrogen sparge removes air in the headspace before incubation begins. During the incubation period, the sample should be kept at a constant temperature of 29 ±1 °C. Gas production and composition is measured approximately every two weeks. The samples need to be brought to ambient temperature before making the measurements. Measure gas production using a pressure gauge. Barometric pressure is measured at the time of testing to make necessary volume adjustments.
c. ISO 11734:1995 specifies that total gas is the standard measure of biodegradation. While modifying this test for evaluating biodegradation of NAFs, methane was also monitored and found to be an acceptable method of evaluating biodegradation. Section 7 contains the procedures used to follow biodegradation by methane production. Measurement of either total gas or methane production is permitted. If methane is followed, determine the composition of the gas by using gas chromatography (GC) analysis at each sampling. At the end of the test when gas production stops, or at around 275 days, an analysis of sediment for substrate content is possible. Common methods which have been successfully used for analyzing NAFs from sediments are listed in Section 8.

# 2.0 System Requirements
This environmental test system has three phases, spiked sediment, overlying seawater, and a gas headspace. The sediment/test compound mixture is combined with synthetic sea water and transferred into 120-mL serum bottles. The total volume of sediment/sea water mixture in the bottles is 75 mL. The volume of the sediment layer will be approximately 50 mL, but the exact volume of the sediment will depend on sediment characteristics (wet:dry ratio and density). The amount of synthetic sea water will be calculated to bring the total volume in the bottles to 75 mL. The test systems are maintained at a temperature of 29 ±1 °C during incubation. The test systems are brought to ambient temperatures prior to measuring pressure or gas volume.

# 2.1 Sample Requirements
a. The concentration of base fluids are at least 2,000 mg carbon test material/kg dry sediment. Carbon concentration is determined by theoretical composition based on the chemical formula or by chemical analysis by ASTM D5291-96. Sediments with positive, intermediate and negative control substances as well as a C
16
-C
18
internal olefin type base fluid will be run in conjunction with test materials under the same conditions. The positive control is ethyl oleate (CAS 111-62-6), the intermediate control is 1-hexadecene (CAS 629-73-2), and the negative control is squalane (CAS 111-01-3). Controls must be of analytical grade or the highest grade available. Each test control concentration should be prepared according to the mixing procedure described in Section 3.1.
b. Product names will be used for examples or clarification in the following text. Any use of trade or product names in this publication is for descriptive use only, and does not constitute endorsement by EPA or the authors.

# 2.2. Seawater Requirements
Synthetic seawater at a salinity of 25 ±1 ppt should be used for the test. The synthetic seawater should be prepared by mixing a commercially available artificial seawater mix, into high purity distilled or de-ionized water. The seawater should be aerated and allowed to age for approximately one month prior to use.

# 2.3. Sediment Requirements
a. The dilution sediment must be from a natural estuarine or marine environment and be free of the compounds of interest. The collection location, date and time will be documented and reported. The sediment is prepared by press-sieving through a 2,000-micron mesh sieve to remove large debris, then press-sieving through a 500-micron sieve to
remove indigenous organisms that may confound test results. The water content of the sediment should be less than 60% (w/w) or a wet to dry ratio of 2.5. The sediment should have a minimum organic matter content of 3% (w/w) as determined by ASTM D2974-07a (Method A and D and calculate organic matter as in Section 8.3 of method ASTM D2974-07a).
b. To reduce the osmotic shock to the microorganisms in the sediment the salinity of the sediment's pore water should be between 20-30 ppt. Sediment should be used for testing as soon as possible after field collection. If required, sediment can be stored in the dark at 4 °C with 3-6 inches of overlying water in a sealed container for a maximum period of 2 months prior to use.

# 3.0 Test Set Up
The test is set up by first mixing the test or control substrates into the sediment inoculum, then mixing in seawater to make a pourable slurry. The slurry is then poured into serum bottles, which are then flushed with nitrogen and sealed.

# 3.1. Mixing Procedure
Because base fluids are strongly hydrophobic and do not readily mix with sediments, care must be taken to ensure base fluids are thoroughly homogenized within the sediment. All concentrations are weight-to-weight comparisons (mg of base fluid to kg of dry control sediment). Sediment and base fluid mixing will be accomplished by using the following method.
3.1.1. Determine the wet to dry weight ratio for the control sediment by weighing approximately 10 sub-samples of approximately 1 g each of the screened and homogenized wet sediment into tared aluminum weigh pans. Dry sediment at 105 °C for 18-24 h. Remove the dried sediments and cool in a desiccator. Repeat the drying, cooling, and weighing cycle until a constant weight is achieved (within 4% of previous weight). Re-weigh the samples to determine the dry weight. Calculate the mean wet and dry weights of the 10 sub samples and determine the wet/dry ratio by dividing the mean wet weight by the mean dry weight using Equation 5-1. This is required to determine the weight of wet sediment needed to prepare the test samples.
ER18MY12.008
3.1.2. Determine the density (g/ml) of the wet sediment. This will be used to determine total volume of wet sediment needed for the various test treatments. One method is to tare a 5 ml graduated cylinder and add about 5 ml of homogenized sediment. Carefully record the volume then weigh this volume of sediment. Repeat this a total of three times. To determine the wet sediment density, divide the weight by volume per the following formula:
ER18MY12.009
3.1.3. Determine the amount of base fluid to be spiked into wet sediment in order to obtain the desired initial base fluid concentration of 2,000 mg carbon/kg dry weight. An amount of wet sediment that is the equivalent of 30 g of dry sediment will be added to each bottle. A typical procedure is to prepare enough sediment for 8 serum bottles (3 bottles to be sacrificed at the start of the test, 4 bottles incubated for headspace analysis, and enough extra sediment for 2 extra bottles). Extra sediment is needed because some of the sediment will remain coated onto the mixing bowl and utensils. Experience with this test may indicate that preparing larger volumes of spiked sediment is a useful practice, then the following calculations should be adjusted accordingly.
a. Determine the total weight of dry sediment needed to add 30 g dry sediment to 8 bottles. If more bottles are used then the calculations should be modified accordingly. For example:
ER18MY12.010
b. Determine the weight of base fluid, in terms of carbon, needed to obtain a final base fluid concentration of 2,000 mg carbon/kg dry weight. For example:
ER18MY12.011
c. i. Convert from mg of carbon to mg of base fluid. This calculation will depend on the % fraction of carbon present in the molecular structure of each base fluid. For the control fluids, ethyl oleate is composed of 77.3% carbon, hexadecene is composed of 85.7% carbon, and squalane is composed of 85.3% carbon. The carbon fraction of each base fluid should be supplied by the manufacturer or determined before use. ASTM D5291-96 or equivalent will be used to determine composition of fluid.
ii. To calculate the amount of base fluid to add to the sediment, divide the amount of carbon (480 mg) by the percent fraction of carbon in the fluid.
iii. For example, the amount of ethyl oleate added to 240 g dry weight sediment can be calculated from the following equation:
ER18MY12.012
iv. Therefore, add 621 mg of ethyl oleate to 240 g dry weight sediment for a final concentration of 2,000 mg carbon/kg sediment dry weight.
3.1.4. Mix the calculated amount of base fluid with the appropriate weight of wet sediment.
a. Use the wet:dry ratio to convert from g sediment dry weight to g sediment wet weight, as follows:
ER18MY12.013
b. i. Weigh the appropriate amount of base fluid (calculated in Section 3.1.3.c) into stainless mixing bowls, tare the vessel weight, then add the wet sediment calculated in Equation 5, and mix with a high shear dispersing impeller for 9 minutes.
ii. The sediment is now mixed with synthetic sea water to form a slurry that will be transferred into the bottles.
3.2. Creating Seawater/Sediment Slurry
Given that the total volume of sediment/sea water slurry in each bottle is to be 75 mL, determine the volume of sea water to add to the wet sediment.
3.2.1. If each bottle is to contain 30 g dry sediment, calculate the weight, and then the volume, of wet sediment to be added to each bottle.
ER18MY12.014
3.2.4. Convert the wet sediment weight from Equation 6 into a volume using the sediment density.
ER18MY12.016
3.2.5. Determine the amount of sea water to mix with the wet sediment.
ER18MY12.017
Mix sea water thoroughly with wet sediment to form a sediment/sea water slurry.
3.3. Bottling the Sediment Seawater Slurry
The total volume of sediment/sea water slurry in each bottle is to be 75 mL. Convert the volume (mL) of sediment/sea water slurry into a weight (g) using the density of the sediment and the seawater.
ER18MY12.018
This should provide each bottle with 30 g dry sediment in a total volume of 75 mL.
3.3.4. Putting the sediment:seawater slurry in the serum bottles.
a.
Note:
The slurry will need to be constantly stirred to keep the sediment suspended.
b. Place a tared serum bottle on a balance and add the appropriate amount of slurry to the bottle using a funnel. Once the required slurry is in the bottle remove the funnel, add 2-3 drops (25 µL) of a 1 gram/L resazurin dye stock solution. Cap the bottle with a butyl rubber stopper (Bellco Glass, Part #2048-11800) and crimp with an aluminum seal (Bellco Glass Part #2048-11020).
c. Using a plastic tube with a (23-gauge, 1-inch long) needle attached to one side and a nitrogen source to the other, puncture the serum cap with the needle. Puncture the serum cap again with a second needle to sparge the bottle's headspace of residual air for two minutes. The nitrogen should be flowing at no more than 100 mL/min to encourage gentle displacement of oxygenated air with nitrogen. Faster nitrogen flow rates would cause mixing and complete oxygen removal would take much longer. Remove the nitrogen needle first to avoid any initial pressure problems. The second (vent) needle should be removed within 30 seconds of removing the nitrogen needle.
d. Triplicate blank test systems are prepared, with similar quantities of sediment and seawater without any base fluid. Incubate in the dark at a constant temperature of 29 ±1 °C.
e. Record the test temperature. The test duration is dependent on base fluid performance, but at a maximum should be no more than 275 days. Stop the test after all base fluids have achieved a plateau of gas production. At termination, base fluid concentrations can be verified in the terminated samples by extraction and GC analysis according to Section 8.

# 4.0. Concentration Verification Chemical Analyses
a. Because of the difficulty of homogeneously mixing base fluid with sediment, it is important to demonstrate that the base fluid is evenly mixed within the sediment sea water slurry that was added to each bottle. Of the seven serum bottles set up for each test or control condition, three are randomly selected for concentration verification analyses. These should be immediately placed at 4 °C and a sample of sediment from each bottle should be analyzed for base fluid content as soon as possible. The coefficient of variation (CV) for the replicate samples must be less than 20%. The results should show recovery of at least 70% of the spiked base fluid. Use an appropriate analytical procedure described in Section 8 to perform the extractions and analyses. If any set of sediments fail the criteria for concentration verification, then the corrective action for that set of sediments is also outlined in Section 8.
b. The nominal concentrations and the measured concentrations from the three bottles selected for concentration verification should be reported for the initial test concentrations. The coefficient of variation (CV) for the replicate samples must be less than 20%. If base fluid content results are not within the 20% CV limit, the test must be stopped and restarted with adequately mixed sediment.

# 5.0. Gas Monitoring Procedures
Biodegradation is measured by total gas as specified in ISO 11734:1995. Methane production can also be tracked and is described in Section 7.

# 5.1. Total Gas Monitoring Procedures
Bottles should be brought to room temperature before readings are taken.
a. The bottles are observed to confirm that the resazurin has not oxidized to pink or blue. Total gas production in the culture bottles should be measured using a pressure transducer (one source is Biotech International). The pressure readings from test and control cultures are evaluated against a calibration curve created by analyzing the pressure created by known additions of gas to bottles established identically to the culture bottles. Bottles used for the standard curve contain 75 mL of water, and are sealed with the same rubber septa and crimp cap seals used for the bottles containing sediment. After the bottles used in the standard curve have been sealed, a syringe needle inserted through the septa is used to equilibrate the pressure inside the bottles to the outside atmosphere. The syringe needle is removed and known volumes of air are injected into the headspace of the bottles. Pressure readings provide a standard curve relating the volume of gas injected into the bottles and headspace pressure. No less than three points may be used to generate the standard curve. A typical standard curve may use 0, 1, 5, 10, 20 and 40 mL of gas added to the standard curve bottles.
b. The room temperature and barometric pressure (to two digits) should be recorded at the time of sampling. One option for the barometer is Fisher Part #02-400 or 02-401. Gas production by the sediment is expressed in terms of the volume (mL) of gas at standard temperature (0 °C = 273 °K) and pressure (1 atm = 30 inches of Hg) using Eq. 16.
ER18MY12.020
Where:
V

= Volume of gas production at standard temperature and pressure
P

= Barometric pressure on day of sampling (inches of Hg)
V

T
2
= Standard temperature = 273 °K
T
1
= Temperature on day of sampling ( °C + 273 = °K)
P
2
= Standard pressure = 30 inches Hg
c. An estimate can be made of the total volume of anaerobic gas that will be produced in the bottles. The gas production measured for each base fluid can be expressed as a percent of predicted total anaerobic gas production.
5.1.1. Calculate the total amount of carbon in the form of the base fluid present in each bottle.
a. Each bottle is to contain 30 g dry weight sediment. The base fluid concentration is 2,000 mg carbon/kg dry weight sediment. Therefore:
ER18MY12.021
5.1.2. Theory states that anaerobic microorganisms will convert 1 mole of carbon substrate into 1 mole of total anaerobic gas production.
a. Calculate the number of moles of carbon in each bottle.
b. The molecular weight of carbon is 12 (
i.e.,
1 mole of carbon = 12 g). Therefore, the number of moles of carbon in each bottle can be calculated.
ER18MY12.022
5.1.3. Calculate the predicted volume of anaerobic gas.
One mole of gas equals 22.4 L (at standard temperature and pressure), therefore,
ER18MY12.023

# 5.2. Gas Venting
a. If the pressure in the serum bottle is too great for the pressure transducer or syringe, some of the excess gas must be wasted. The best method to do this is to vent the excess gas right after measurement. To do this, remove the barrel from a 10-mL syringe and fill it
1/3
full with water. This is then inserted into the bottle through the stopper using a small diameter (high gauge) needle. The excess pressure is allowed to vent through the water until the bubbles stop. This allows equalization of the pressure inside the bottle to atmospheric without introducing oxygen. The amount of gas vented (which is equal to the volume determined that day) must be kept track of each time the bottles are vented. A simple way to do this in a spreadsheet format is to have a separate column in which cumulative vented gas is tabulated. Each time the volume of gas in the cultures is analyzed, the total gas produced is equal to the gas in the culture at that time plus the total of the vented gas.
b. To keep track of the methane lost in the venting procedure, multiply the amount of gas vented each time by the corrected % methane determined on that day. The answer gives the volume of methane wasted. This must be added into the cumulative totals similarly to the total gas additions.

# 6.0. Test Acceptability and Interpretation

# 6.1. Test Acceptability
At day 275 or when gas production has plateaued, whichever is first, the controls are evaluated to confirm that the test has been performed appropriately. In order for
this modification of the closed bottle biodegradation test to be considered acceptable, all the controls must meet the biodegradation levels indicated in Table 1. The intermediate control hexadecene must produce at least 30% of the theoretical gas production. This level may be reexamined after two years and more data has been generated.
Table 1—Test Acceptability Criteria

# 6.2 Interpretation
a. In order for a fluid to pass the closed bottle test, the biodegradation of the base fluid as indicated by the total amount of total gas (or methane) generated once gas production has plateaued (or at the end of 275 days, which ever is first) must be greater than or equal to the volume of gas (or methane) produced by the reference standard (internal elefin or ester).
b. The method for evaluating the data to determine whether a fluid has passed the biodegradation test must use the equations:

# 7.0. Methane Measurement

# 7.1. Methane Monitoring Procedures
a. The use of total gas production alone may result in an underestimation of the actual metabolism occurring since CO
2
is slightly soluble in water. An acceptable alternative method is to monitor methane production and total gas production. This is easily done using GC analysis. A direct injection of headspace gases can be made into a GC using almost any packed or capillary column with an FID detector. Unless volatile fuels or solvents are present in the test material or the inocula, the only component of the headspace gas that can be detected using an FID detector is methane. The percent methane in the headspace gas is determined by comparing the response of the sample injections to the response from injections of known percent methane standards. The percent methane is corrected for water vapor saturation using Eq. 21 and then converted to a volume of dry methane using Eq. 22.
ER18MY12.025
Where:
D = The density of water vapor at saturation (g/m
3
, can be found in CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics) for the temperature of sampling.
ER18MY12.026
Where:
V
CH4
= Volume of methane in the bottle
S = Volume of excess gas production (measured with a pressure transducer)
V = Volume of the headspace in the culture bottle (total volume—liquid phase)
P = Barometric pressure (mm Hg, measured with barometer)
T = Temperature (°C)
P
w
= Vapor pressure of water at T (mm Hg, can be found in CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics)
CH
4
= % methane in headspace gas (after correction for water vapor)
b. The total volume of serum bottles sold as 125 mL bottles (Wheaton) is 154.8 mL.
c. The volumes of methane produced are then compared to the volumes of methane in the controls to determine if a significant inhibition of methane production or a significant increase of methane production has been observed. Effective statistical analyses are important, as variability in the results is common due to the heterogeneity of the inoculum's source. It is also common to observe that the timing of the initiation of culture activity is not equal in all of the cultures. Expect a great variability over the period when the cultures are active, some replicates will start sooner than others, but all of the replicates should eventually reach similar levels of base fluid degradation and methane production.

# 7.2. Expected Methane Production Calculations
a. The amount of methane expected can be calculated using the equation of Symons and Buswell (Eq. 23). In the case of complete mineralization, all of the carbon will appear as wither CO
2
or CH
4
, thus the total moles of gas produced will be equal to the total moles of carbon in the parent molecule. The use of the Buswell equation allows you to calculate the effects the redox potential will have on the distribution of the products in methanogenic cultures. More reduced electron donors will allow the production of more methane, while more oxidized electron donors will cause a production of more carbon dioxide.
ER18MY12.027
b. An example calculation of the expected methane volume in a culture fed 2,000 mg/kg hexadecene is as follows. The application of Symons and Buswell's equation reveals that hexadecene (C
16
H
32
) will yield 4 moles of CO
2
and 12 moles of CH
4
. Assuming 30 g of dry sediment are added to the bottles with 2,334 mg hexadecene/kg dry sediment (
i.e.,
equivalent to 2,000 mg carbon/kg dry sediment) the calculation is as follows.
ER18MY12.028
c. By subtracting the average amount of methane in control bottles from the test bottles and then dividing by the expected volume an evaluation of the completion of the process may be conducted.

# 8.0. Concentration Verification Analysis
The Concentration Verification analysis is required at the beginning of the test to ensure homogeneity and confirm that the required amount of fluid was delivered to the sediments at the start of the test.
8.1. Three samples per fluid need to be analyzed and achieve ≤20% Coefficient of Variability and an average of ≥70% to ≤120% of fluid delivered to sediment.
8.2. If a third party performs the analysis, then the laboratory should be capable of delivering the homogeneity data within seven days, in order to identify any samples that do not meet the homogeneity requirement as quickly as possible.
8.3. If one sediment/fluid set, out a multiple set batch of samples, fails these criteria, then that one set of samples must be discarded and a fresh set of spiked sediment prepared, started, and analyzed to ensure homogeneity. The same stock sediment is used to prepare the replacement set(s). The remaining sets do not need to be re-mixed or restarted.
8.4. The re-mixed set(s) will need to be run the additional days as appropriate to ensure that the total number of days is the same for all sets of bottles, even though the specific days are not aligned.
8.5. Re-mixing of bottle sets can be performed multiple times as a result of a failure of the analytical criteria, until the holding time for the stock sediment has expired (60 days). If the problem set(s) has not fallen within the acceptable analytical criteria by then, it must not be part of the batch of bottles run. If the problem batch is one of the controls, and those controls were not successfully prepared when the sediment holding time expired, then the entire test must be restarted.

# Appendix 5 to Subpart A of Part 435—Determination of Crude Oil Contamination in Non-Aqueous Drilling Fluids by Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS) (EPA Method 1655)

# 1.0 Scope and Application
1.1 This method determines crude (formation) oil contamination, or other petroleum oil contamination, in non-aqueous drilling fluids (NAFs) by comparing the gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) fingerprint scan and extracted ion scans of the test sample to that of an uncontaminated sample.
1.2 This method can be used for monitoring oil contamination of NAFs or monitoring oil contamination of the base fluid used in the NAF formulations.
1.3 Any modification of this method beyond those expressly permitted shall be considered as a major modification subject to application and approval of alternative test procedures under 40 CFR 136.4 and 136.5.
1.4 The gas chromatography/mass spectrometry portions of this method are restricted to use by, or under the supervision of analysts experienced in the use of GC/MS and in the interpretation of gas chromatograms and extracted ion scans. Each laboratory that uses this method must generate acceptable results using the procedures described in Sections 7, 9.2, and 12 of this appendix.

# 2.0 Summary of Method
2.1 Analysis of NAF for crude oil contamination is a step-wise process. The analyst first performs a qualitative assessment of the presence or absence of crude oil in the sample. If crude oil is detected during this qualitative assessment, the analyst must perform a quantitative analysis of the crude oil concentration.
2.2 A sample of NAF is centrifuged to obtain a solids free supernate.
2.3 The test sample is prepared by removing an aliquot of the solids free supernate, spiking it with internal standard, and analyzing it using GC/MS techniques. The components are separated by the gas chromatograph and detected by the mass spectrometer.
2.4 Qualitative identification of crude oil contamination is performed by comparing the Total Ion Chromatograph (TIC) scans and Extracted Ion Profile (EIP) scans of test sample to that of uncontaminated base fluids, and examining the profiles for chromatographic signatures diagnostic of oil contamination.
2.5 The presence or absence of crude oil contamination observed in the full scan profiles and selected extracted ion profiles determines further sample quantitation and reporting requirements.
2.6 If crude oil is detected in the qualitative analysis, quantitative analysis must be performed by calibrating the GC/MS using a designated NAF spiked with known concentrations of a designated oil.
2.7 Quality is assured through reproducible calibration and testing of GC/MS system and through analysis of quality control samples.

# 3.0 Definitions
3.1 A NAF is one in which the continuous—phase is a water immiscible fluid such as an oleaginous material (e.g., mineral oil,
enhance mineral oil, paraffinic oil, or synthetic material such as olefins and vegetable esters).
3.2 TIC—Total Ion Chromatograph.
3.3 EIP—Extracted Ion Profile.
3.4 TCB—1,3,5-trichlorobenzene is used as the internal standard in this method.
3.5 SPTM—System Performance Test Mix standards are used to establish retention times and monitor detection levels.

# 4.0 Interferences and Limitations
4.1 Solvents, reagents, glassware, and other sample processing hardware may yield artifacts and/or elevated baselines causing misinterpretation of chromatograms.
4.2 All Materials used in the analysis shall be demonstrated to be free from interferences by running method blanks. Specific selection of reagents and purification of solvents by distillation in all-glass systems may be required.
4.3 Glassware shall be cleaned by rinsing with solvent and baking at 400 °C for a minimum of 1 hour.
4.4 Interferences may vary from source to source, depending on the diversity of the samples being tested.
4.5 Variations in and additions of base fluids and/or drilling fluid additives (emulsifiers, dispersants, fluid loss control agents, etc.) might also cause interferences and misinterpretation of chromatograms.
4.6 Difference in light crude oils, medium crude oils, and heavy crude oils will result in different responses and thus different interpretation of scans and calculated percentages.

# 5.0 Safety
5.1 The toxicity or carcinogenicity of each reagent used in this method has not been precisely determined; however each chemical shall be treated as a potential health hazard. Exposure to these chemicals should be reduced to the lowest possible level.
5.2 Unknown samples may contain high concentration of volatile toxic compounds. Sample containers should be opened in a hood and handled with gloves to prevent exposure. In addition, all sample preparation should be conducted in a fume hood to limit the potential exposure to harmful contaminates.
5.3 This method does not address all safety issues associated with its use. The laboratory is responsible for maintaining a safe work environment and a current awareness file of OSHA regulations regarding the safe handling of the chemicals specified in this method. A reference file of material safety data sheets (MSDSs) shall be available to all personnel involved in these analyses. Additional references to laboratory safety can be found in References 16.1 through 16.3.
5.4 NAF base fluids may cause skin irritation, protective gloves are recommended while handling these samples.

8.4 After completion of GC/MS analysis, extracts shall be refrigerated at 4 °C until further notification of sample disposal.

# 9.0 Quality Control
9.1 Each laboratory that uses this method is required to operate a formal quality assurance program (Reference 16.4). The minimum requirements of this program shall consist of an initial demonstration of laboratory capability, and ongoing analysis of standards, and blanks as a test of continued performance, analyses of spiked samples to assess accuracy and analysis of duplicates to assess precision. Laboratory performance shall be compared to established performance criteria to determine if the results of analyses meet the performance characteristics of the method.
9.1.1 The analyst shall make an initial demonstration of the ability to generate acceptable accuracy and precision with this method. This ability shall be established as described in Section 9.2 of this appendix.
9.1.2 The analyst is permitted to modify this method to improve separations or lower the cost of measurements, provided all performance requirements are met. Each time a modification is made to the method, the analyst is required to repeat the calibration (Section 10.4 of this appendix) and to repeat the initial demonstration procedure described in Section 9.2 of this appendix.
9.1.3 Analyses of blanks are required to demonstrate freedom from contamination. The procedures and criteria for analysis of a blank are described in Section 9.3 of this appendix.
9.1.4 Analysis of a matrix spike sample is required to demonstrate method accuracy. The procedure and QC criteria for spiking are described in Section 9.4 of this appendix.
9.1.5 Analysis of a duplicate field sample is required to demonstrate method precision. The procedure and QC criteria for duplicates are described in Section 9.5 of this appendix.
9.1.6 Analysis of a sample of the clean NAF(s) (as sent from the supplier—
i.e.
, has not been circulated downhole) used in the drilling operations is required.
9.1.7 The laboratory shall, on an ongoing basis, demonstrate through calibration verification and the analysis of the precision and recovery standard (Section 7.2.6 of this appendix) that the analysis system is in control. These procedures are described in Section 11.6 of this appendix.
9.1.8 The laboratory shall maintain records to define the quality of data that is generated.
9.2 Initial precision and accuracy—The initial precision and recovery test shall be performed using the precision and recovery standard (1% by weight Reference Oil in IO Lab drilling fluid). The laboratory shall generate acceptable precision and recovery by performing the following operations.
9.2.1 Prepare four separate aliquots of the precision and recovery standard using the procedure outlined in Section 7.2.6 of this appendix. Analyze these aliquots using the procedures outlined in Section 11 of this appendix.
9.2.2 Using the results of the set of four analyses, compute the average recovery (X) in weight percent and the standard deviation of the recovery(s) for each sample.
9.2.3 If s and X meet the acceptance criteria of 80% to 110%, system performance is acceptable and analysis of samples may begin. If, however, s exceeds the precision limit or X falls outside the range for accuracy, system performance is unacceptable. In this event, review this method, correct the problem, and repeat the test.
9.2.4 Accuracy and precision—The average percent recovery (P) and the standard deviation of the percent recovery (Sp) Express the accuracy assessment as a percent recovery interval from P-2S
p
to P + 2S
p
. For example, if P = 90% and S
p
= 10% for four analyses of crude oil in NAF, the accuracy interval is expressed as 70% to 110%. Update the accuracy assessment on a regular basis.
9.3 Blanks—Rinse glassware and centrifuge tubes used in the method with 30 mL of methylene chloride, remove a 0.5-g aliquot of the solvent, spike it with the 500 µL of the internal standard solution (Section 7.2.3 of this appendix) and analyze a 1-µL aliquot of the blank sample using the procedure in Section 11 of this appendix. Compute results per Section 12 of this appendix.
9.4 Matrix spike sample—Prepare a matrix spike sample according to procedure outlined in Section 7.2.6 of this appendix. Analyze the sample and calculate the concentration (% oil) in the drilling fluid and % recovery of oil from the spiked drilling fluid using the methods described in Sections 11 and 12 of this appendix.
9.5 Duplicates—A duplicate field sample shall be prepared and analyzed according to Section 11. The relative percent difference (RPD) of the calculated concentrations shall be less than 15%.
9.5.1 Analyze each of the duplicates per the procedure in Section 11 of this appendix and compute the results per Section 12 of this appendix.
9.5.2 Calculate the relative percent difference (RPD) between the two results per the following equation:
ER18MY12.029
where:
D
1
= Concentration of crude oil in the sample; and
D
2
= Concentration of crude oil in the duplicate sample.
9.5.3 If the RPD criteria are not met, the analytical system shall be judged to be out of control, and the problem must be immediately identified and corrected, and the sample batch re-analyzed.
9.6 A clean NAF sample shall be prepared and analyzed according to Section 11. Ultimately the oil-equivalent concentration from the TIC or EIP signal measured in the clean NAF sample shall be subtracted from the corresponding authentic field samples in order to calculate the true contaminant concentration (% oil) in the field samples (
see
Section 12).
9.7 The specifications contained in this method can be met if the apparatus used is calibrated properly, and maintained in a calibrated state. The standards used for initial precision and recovery (Section 9.2 of this appendix) and ongoing precision and recovery (Section 11.6 of this appendix) shall be identical, so that the most precise results will be obtained. The GC/MS instrument will provide the most reproducible results if dedicated to the setting and conditions required for the analyses given in this method.
9.8 Depending on specific program requirements, field replicates and field spikes of crude oil into samples may be required when this method is used to assess the precision and accuracy of the sampling and sample transporting techniques.

# 10.0 Calibration
10.1 Establish gas chromatographic/mass spectrometer operating conditions given in Table 1 of this appendix. Perform the GC/MS system hardware-tune as outlined by the manufacture. The gas chromatograph shall be calibrated using the internal standard technique.

# Note:
Because each GC is slightly different, it may be necessary to adjust the operating conditions (carrier gas flow rate and column temperature and temperature program) slightly until the retention times in Table 2 of this appendix are met.

10.2 Internal standard calibration procedure—1,3,5-trichlorobenzene (TCB) has been shown to be free of interferences from diesel and crude oils and is a suitable internal standard.
10.3 The system performance test mix standards prepared in Section 7.2.4 of this appendix shall be used to establish retention times and establish qualitative detection limits.
10.3.1 Spike a 500-mL aliquot of the 1.25 mg/mL SPTM standard with 500 µL of the TCB internal standard solution.
10.3.2 Inject 1.0 µL of this spiked SPTM standard onto the GC/MS in order to demonstrate proper retention times. For the GC/MS used in the development of this method, the ten compounds in the mixture had typical retention times shown in Table 2 of this appendix. Extracted ion scans for m/z 91 and 105 showed a maximum abundance of 400,000.
10.3.3 Spike a 500-mL aliquot of the 0.125 mg/mL SPTM standard with 500 µL of the TCB internal standard solution.
10.3.4 Inject 1.0 µL of this spiked SPTM standard onto the GC/MS to monitor detectable levels. For the GC/MS used in the development of this test, all ten compounds showed a minimum peak height of three times signal to noise. Extracted ion scans for m/z 91 and 105 showed a maximum abundance of 40,000.
10.4 GC/MS crude oil/drilling fluid calibration—There are two methods of quantification: Total Area Integration (C
8
-C
13
) and EIP Area Integration using m/z's 91 and 105. The Total Area Integration method should be used as the primary technique for quantifying crude oil in NAFs. The EIP Area Integration method should be used as a confirmatory technique for NAFs. However, the EIP Area Integration method shall be used as the primary method for quantifying oil in enhanced mineral oil (EMO) based drilling fluid. Inject 1.0 µL of each of the four crude oil/drilling fluid calibration standards prepared in Section 7.2.5 of this appendix into the GC/MS. The internal standard should elute approximately 21-22 minutes after injection. For the GC/MS used in the development of this method, the internal standard peak was (35 to 40)% of full scale at an abundance of about 3.5e + 07.
10.4.1 Total Area Integration Method—For each of the four calibration standards obtain the following: Using a straight baseline integration technique, obtain the total ion chromatogram (TIC) area from C
8
to C
13
. Obtain the TIC area of the internal standard (TCB). Subtract the TCB area from the C
8
-C
13
area to obtain the true C
8
-C
13
area. Using the C
8
-C
13
and TCB areas, and known internal standard concentration, generate a linear regression calibration using the internal standard method. The r
2
value for the linear regression curve shall be greater than or equal to 0.998. Some synthetic fluids might have peaks that elute in the window and would interfere with the analysis. In this case the integration window can be shifted to other areas of scan where there are no interfering peaks from the synthetic base fluid.
10.4.2 EIP Area Integration—For each of the four calibration standards generate Extracted Ion Profiles (EIPs) for m/z 91 and 105. Using straight baseline integration techniques, obtain the following EIP areas:
10.4.2.1 For m/z 91 integrate the area under the curve from approximately 9 minutes to 21-22 minutes, just prior to but not including the internal standard.
10.4.2.2 For m/z 105 integrate the area under the curve from approximately 10.5 minutes to 26.5 minutes.
10.4.2.3 Obtain the internal standard area from the TCB in each of the four calibration standards, using m/z 180.
10.4.2.4 Using the EIP areas for TCB, m/z 91 and m/z105, and the known concentration of internal standard, generate linear regression calibration curves for the target ions 91 and 105 using the internal standard method. The r
2
value for each of the EIP linear regression curves shall be greater than or equal to 0.998.
10.4.2.5 Some base fluids might produce a background level that would show up on the extracted ion profiles, but there should not be any real peaks (signal to noise ratio of 1:3) from the clean base fluids.

# 11.0 Procedure
11.1 Sample Preparation—
11.1.1 Mix the authentic field sample (drilling fluid) well. Transfer (weigh) a 30-g aliquot of the sample to a labeled centrifuge tube.

The batch shall consist of 20 authentic samples, 1 blank (Section 9.3 of this appendix), 1 matrix spike sample (9.4), and 1 duplicate field sample (9.5), and a prepared sample of the corresponding clean NAF used in the drilling process.
11.2.2 An analytical sequence shall be analyzed on the GC/MS where the 3 SPTM standards (Section 7.2.4 of this appendix) containing internal standard are analyzed first, followed by analysis of the four GC/MS crude oil/drilling fluid calibration standards (Section 7.2.5 of this appendix), analysis of the blank, matrix spike sample, the duplicate sample, the clean NAF sample, followed by the authentic samples.
11.2.3 Samples requiring dilution due to excessive signal shall be diluted using methylene chloride.
11.2.4 Inject 1.0 µL of the test sample or standard into the GC, using the conditions in Table 1 of this appendix.
11.2.5 Begin data collection and the temperature program at the time of injection.
11.2.6 Obtain a TIC and EIP fingerprint scans of the sample (Table 3 of this appendix).
11.2.7 If the area of the C
8
to C
13
peaks exceeds the calibration range of the system, dilute a fresh aliquot of the test sample weighing 0.50-g and re-analyze.
11.2.8 Determine the C
8
to C
13
TIC area, the TCB internal standard area, and the areas for the m/z 91 and 105 EIPs. These shall be used in the calculation of oil concentration in the samples (see Section 12 of this appendix).
