# Criteria for Uniqueness of Fittings
(a) All fittings for alternative motor vehicle refrigerants must meet the following requirements:
(1) High-side screw-on fittings for each refrigerant must differ from high-side screw-on fittings for all other refrigerants, including CFC-12, and from low-side screw-on fittings for CFC-12;
(2) Low-side screw-on fittings for each refrigerant must differ from low-side screw-on fittings for all other refrigerants, including CFC-12;
(3) High-side screw-on fittings for a given refrigerant must differ from low-side screw-on fittings for that refrigerant, to protect against connecting a low-pressure system to a high-pressure one;
(4) High-side quick-connect fittings for each refrigerant must differ from high-side quick-connect fittings for all other refrigerants, including CFC-12 (if they exist);
(5) Low-side quick-connect fittings for each refrigerant must differ from low-side quick-connect fittings for all other refrigerants, including CFC-12 (if they exist);
(6) High-side quick-connect fittings for a given refrigerant must differ from low-side quick-connect fittings for that refrigerant, to protect against connecting a low-pressure system to a high-pressure one;
(7) For each type of container, the fitting for each refrigerant must differ from the fitting for that type of container for all other refrigerants, including CFC-12.
(b) For screw-on fittings, “differ” means that either the diameter must differ by at least
1/16
inch or the thread direction must be reversed (i.e. right-handed vs. left-handed). Simply changing the thread pitch is not sufficient. For quick-connect fittings, “differ” means that a person using normal force and normal tools (including wrenches) must not be able to cross-connect fittings.
(c) The sole exception to the
1/16
inch difference requirement is the difference between the small can fittings for GHG-X4 and R-406A. The GHG-X4 small can fitting uses a metric measurement, and is slightly less than
1/16
inch larger than the small can fitting for R-406A. EPA has concluded that these fittings will not cross-connect, and therefore they may be used.

In cases where this rule includes requirements more stringent than those in UL 563, the equipment must meet the requirements of the final rule in place of the requirements in the UL Standard.
The charge size must not exceed 150 g (5.29 oz) in each refrigerant circuit of a commercial ice machine.
As provided in clauses SA6.1.1 and SA6.1.2 of UL 563, the following markings must be attached at the locations provided and must be permanent:
(a) “DANGER—Risk of Fire or Explosion. Flammable Refrigerant Used. Do Not Use Mechanical Devices To Defrost Refrigerator. Do Not Puncture Refrigerant Tubing.” This marking must be provided on or near any evaporators that can be contacted by the consumer.
(b) “DANGER—Risk of Fire or Explosion. Flammable Refrigerant Used. To Be Repaired Only By Trained Service Personnel. Do Not Puncture Refrigerant Tubing.” This marking must be located near the machine compartment.
(c) “CAUTION—Risk of Fire or Explosion. Flammable Refrigerant Used. Consult Repair Manual/Owner's Guide Before Attempting To Service This Product. All Safety Precautions Must be Followed.” This marking must be located near the machine compartment.
(d) “CAUTION—Risk of Fire or Explosion. Dispose of Properly In Accordance With Federal Or Local Regulations. Flammable Refrigerant Used.” This marking must be provided on the exterior of the refrigeration equipment.
(e) “CAUTION—Risk of Fire or Explosion Due To Puncture Of Refrigerant Tubing; Follow Handling Instructions Carefully. Flammable Refrigerant Used.” This marking must be provided near all exposed refrigerant tubing.
All of these markings must be in letters no less than 6.4 mm (
1/4
inch) high.
The equipment must have red Pantone® Matching System #185 marked pipes, hoses, or other devices through which the refrigerant passes, to indicate the use of a flammable refrigerant. This color must be applied at all service ports and other parts of the system where service puncturing or other actions creating an opening from the refrigerant circuit to the atmosphere might be expected and must extend a minimum of one (1) inch in both directions from such locations.
Applicable OSHA requirements at 29 CFR part 1910 must be followed, including those at 29 CFR 1910.94 (ventilation), 1910.106 (flammable and combustible liquids), 1910.110 (storage and handling of liquefied petroleum gases), 1910.157 (portable fire extinguishers), and 1910.1000 (toxic and hazardous substances).
Proper ventilation should be maintained at all times during the manufacture and storage of equipment containing hydrocarbon refrigerants through adherence to good manufacturing practices as per 29 CFR 1910.106. If refrigerant levels in the air surrounding the equipment rise above one-fourth of the lower flammability limit, the space should be evacuated and re-entry should occur only after the space has been properly ventilated.
Technicians and equipment manufacturers should wear appropriate personal protective equipment, including chemical goggles and protective gloves, when handling propane. Special care should be taken to avoid contact with the skin since propane, like many refrigerants, can cause freeze burns on the skin.
A Class B dry powder type fire extinguisher should be kept nearby.
Technicians should only use spark-proof tools when working on equipment with propane.
Any recovery equipment used should be designed for flammable refrigerants.
Any refrigerant releases should be in a well-ventilated area, such as outside of a building.
Only technicians specifically trained in handling flammable refrigerants should service equipment containing propane. Technicians should gain an understanding of minimizing the risk of fire and the steps to use flammable refrigerants safely.
Room occupants should evacuate the space immediately following the accidental release of this refrigerant.
If a service port is added then, commercial ice machines or equipment using propane should have service aperture fittings that differ from fittings used in equipment or containers using non-flammable refrigerant. “Differ” means that either the diameter differs by at least
1/16
inch or the thread direction is reversed (
i.e.,
right-handed vs. left-handed). These different fittings should be permanently affixed to the unit at the point of service and maintained until the end-of-life of the unit and should not be accessed with an adaptor.

Destruction
means the expiration of a regulated substance to the destruction and removal efficiency actually achieved. Such destruction might result in a commercially useful end product, but such usefulness would be secondary to the act of destruction.
Etching
means, in the context of semiconductor manufacturing, a process type that uses plasma-generated fluorine atoms and other reactive fluorine-containing fragments that chemically react with exposed thin films (
e.g.,
dielectric, metals) or substrate (
e.g.,
silicon) to selectively remove portions of material. This includes semiconductor production processes using fluorinated GHG reagents to clean wafers.
Exchange value
means the value assigned to a regulated substance in accordance with AIM Act subsections (c) and (e), as applicable, and as provided in appendix A to this part.
Exchange value equivalent (EVe)

Fire suppressant recycler
means, generally, an entity that collects used HFC fire suppressants and directly resells those collected and aggregated HFCs—with or without any additional reprocessing—to another entity for reuse as a fire suppressant (also referred to as a “recycler for fire suppression” in this subpart). An entity that collects and aggregates used HFC fire suppressants for distribution to another entity for reprocessing before being sold for reuse as a fire suppressant would not be a fire suppressant recycler. An entity that resells HFC fire suppressants that have already been reprocessed for use as a fire suppressant by another entity would not be a fire suppressant recycler.
Foreign country
means an entity that is recognized as a sovereign nation or country other than the United States of America.

Transhipment
means the continuous shipment of a regulated substance, from a foreign country of origin through the United States or its territories, to a second foreign country of final destination, as long as the shipment does not enter U.S. commerce. A transhipment, as it moves through the United States or its territories, cannot be repackaged, sorted, or otherwise changed in condition.
Used regulated substances
means regulated substances that have been recovered from their intended use systems (including regulated substances that have been, or may be subsequently, recycled or reclaimed).
[86 FR 55201, 55206, Oct. 5, 2021, as amended at 88 FR 46893, July 20, 2023; 88 FR 46894, July 20, 2023]
§ 84.5
Prohibitions relating to regulated substances.
(a)
Production.
(1) As of January 1, 2022, no person may produce regulated substances, intentionally or unintentionally, in excess of the quantity of unexpended production allowances and consumption allowances or unexpended application-specific allowances held by that person under the authority of this subpart at that time in that control period. Every kilogram of production in excess of allowances expended constitutes a separate violation of this subpart. The required amount of allowances that must be expended will be calculated to the tenth with a minimum expenditure of 0.1 allowances for any production of regulated substances.
(2) As of January 1, 2022, no person may expend production allowances to produce a quantity of regulated substances unless that person expends an equal quantity of consumption allowances at the same time.
(3) A person is not required to expend production, consumption, or application-specific allowances to produce regulated substances if the regulated substances are destroyed using a technology approved by the Administrator for destruction under § 84.29 within 30 days of generating the regulated substance if the destruction technology is located at the facility where production occurred or 120 days of generating
the regulated substance if the destruction technology is not located at the facility where production occurred.
(4) No person may expend production or consumption allowances for generation of HFC-23 that is emitted at the same facility as where it is produced. Consistent with this prohibition, prior to the emissions standard compliance date established in § 84.27, neither production nor consumption allowances are required for HFC-23 emitted at the same facility as where it is produced.
(b)
Import.
This paragraph applies starting January 1, 2022.
(1) No person may import bulk regulated substances, either as a single component or a multicomponent substance, except:
(i) If the importer of record possesses at the time they are required to submit reports to EPA pursuant to § 84.31(c)(7), and expends at the time of ship berthing for vessel arrivals, border crossing for land arrivals such as trucks, rails, and autos, and first point of terminus in U.S. jurisdiction for arrivals via air, consumption or application-specific allowances in a quantity equal to the exchange-value weighted equivalent of the regulated substances imported, whether present as a single component or a multicomponent blend. The required amount of allowances must be calculated to the tenth, but a minimum expenditure of 0.1 allowances is required for any import of regulated substances;
(ii) After receipt of a non-objection notice for substances for use in a process resulting in their transformation or their destruction in accordance with § 84.25(a);
(iii) After receipt of a non-objection notice for used regulated substances imported for destruction in accordance with § 84.25(b);
(iv) As a transhipment in accordance with § 84.31(c)(3) if all transhipped regulated substance is exported from the United States within six months of its import; or
(v) All imports pursuant to paragraph (b)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section must be physically accompanied by a certificate of analysis, if the certificate of analysis has not been electronically submitted pursuant to § 84.31(c)(7)(xvi).
(2) No person may attempt to land bulk regulated substances on, bring regulated substances into, or introduce regulated substances into, any place subject to the jurisdiction of the United States without meeting one of the categories set forth in § 84.5(b)(1).
(3) Each person meeting the definition of importer for a particular regulated substance import transaction is jointly and severally liable for a violation of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, unless they can demonstrate that the importer of record possessed and expended allowances in accordance with the requirement outlined in paragraph (b)(1)(i) or (v) of this section or another party who meets the definition of an importer met one of the exceptions set forth in paragraphs (b)(1)(ii) through (iv) of this section.
(4) Imports authorized under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section may not be in containers designed to hold 100 pounds or less of a regulated substance.
(5) A person issued a non-objection notice for the import of an individual shipment of regulated substances under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) or (iii) of this section may not transfer or confer the right to import.
(6) No person may introduce into U.S. commerce any regulated substance claimed as a transhipment.
(7) Every kilogram of bulk regulated substances imported contrary to this paragraph (b) constitutes a separate violation of this subpart. Import of less than one kilogram of bulk regulated substance contrary to this paragraph (b) constitutes a separate violation of this subpart.
(c)
Application-specific uses.
(1) As of January 1, 2022, no person may confer application-specific allowances for the production or import of a regulated substance in excess of the amount of unexpended application-specific allowances held by that person under the authority of this subpart at that time in that control period. No person may expend an application-specific allowance for regulated substances to be used in any application other than the one identified by the application-specific allowance expended. Every kilogram of production or import in excess of the application-specific allowances expended by the producer or importer
constitutes a separate violation of this subpart. Production or import of less than one kilogram of regulated substance in excess of the application-specific allowances expended by the producer or importer constitutes a separate violation of this subpart.
(2) No person may use a regulated substance produced or imported by expending application-specific allowances for any purpose other than those for which the application-specific allowance was allocated, and as set forth in this paragraph (c). Application-specific allowances are apportioned to a person under §§ 84.13 and 84.15 for the production or import of regulated substances solely for the individual application listed on the allowance, which may include:
(i) A propellant in metered dose inhalers;
(ii) Defense sprays;
(iii) Structural composite preformed polyurethane foam for marine use and trailer use;
(iv) The etching of semiconductor material or wafers and the cleaning of chemical vapor deposition chambers within the semiconductor manufacturing sector;
(v) Mission-critical military end uses, such as armored vehicle engine and shipboard fire suppression systems and systems used in deployable and expeditionary applications; and
(vi) On board aerospace fire suppression.
(3) This provision applies starting January 1, 2022.
(i) No person may acquire application-specific allowances unless for use in the same application as associated with the application-specific allowance. No person may transfer or confer application-specific allowances unless for use in the same application as associated with the application-specific allowance.
(ii) No person may acquire or sell regulated substances produced or imported using application-specific allowances for use in anything other than the application for which it was originally allocated. Every kilogram of a regulated substance imported or exported in contravention of this paragraph constitutes a separate violation of this subpart. Import or export of less than one kilogram of regulated substance in contravention of this paragraph constitutes a separate violation of this subpart.
(d)
Calendar-year allowances.
All production, consumption, and application-specific allowances may only be expended for production or import occurring in the calendar year for which the allowances are allocated (
i.e.,
January 1 through December 31). No person may expend, transfer, or confer a production, consumption, or application-specific allowance after December 31 of the year for which it was issued. Entities may transfer or confer their production, consumption, or application-specific allowances before January 1 of the calendar year for which the allowances were allocated.
(e)
International transfers.
This paragraph applies starting January 1, 2022. (1) No person subject to the requirements of this subpart may transfer a production allowance to a person in a foreign country unless that country has established the same or similar requirements or otherwise undertaken commitments regarding the production and consumption of regulated substances as are contained in the AIM Act, as determined by the relevant agency official.
(2) No person may transfer production allowances to or from a person in a foreign country without satisfying the requirements in § 84.19. Every production allowance transferred in contravention of this paragraph constitutes a separate violation of this subpart.
(f)
Sale and distribution.
No person may sell or distribute, or offer for sale or distribution, any regulated substance that was produced or imported in violation of paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section, except for such actions needed to re-export the regulated substance. Every kilogram of a regulated substance sold or distributed, or offered for sale or distribution, in contravention of this paragraph constitutes a separate violation of this subpart. Sale or distribution, or offer for sale or distribution, of less than one kilogram of regulated substance in contravention of this paragraph constitutes a separate violation of this subpart.
(g)
False information.
No person may provide false, inaccurate, or misleading information to the EPA when petitioning, reporting, or for any communication required under this subpart.
(h) [Reserved]
(i)
Labeling.
(1) As of January 1, 2022, no person may sell or distribute, offer for sale or distribution, or import containers containing a regulated substance that lacks a label or other permanent markings stating the common name(s), chemical name(s), or ASHRAE designation of the regulated substance(s) or blend contained within, and the percentages of the regulated substances if a blend. The label or other permanent markings must be:
(i) Durable and printed or otherwise labeled on, or affixed to, the external surface of the bulk regulated substance container;
(ii) Readily visible and legible;
(iii) Able to withstand open weather exposure without a substantial reduction in visibility or legibility;
(iv) Displayed on a background of contrasting color; and
(v) If a container of a regulated substance is contained within a box or other overpack, the exterior packaging must contain legible and visible information of what regulated substance is contained within.
(2) No person other than the importer of record may repackage or relabel regulated substances that were initially unlabeled or mislabeled. In order to repackage the regulated substances, the importer of record must either:
(i) Expend consumption allowances equal to the amount of allowances that would be required if each cylinder were full of HFC-23; or
(ii) Verify the contents with independent laboratory testing results and affix a correct label on the container that matches the lab-verified test results before the date of importation (consistent with the definition at 19 CFR 101.1) of the container.
(3)(i) No person producing, importing, exporting, reclaiming, recycling for fire suppression, or repackaging regulated substances, whether as a single or multicomponent substance, may sell or distribute, or offer for sale or distribution, those regulated substances without first conducting laboratory testing of a representative sample of the regulated substances that they are producing, importing, exporting, reclaiming, recycling for fire suppression, or repackaging to verify that the composition of the regulated substance(s) matches the container labeling using the sampling and testing methodology prescribed in appendix A to 40 CFR part 82, subpart F for regulated substances offered for sale and distribution as refrigerants and using the following sampling and testing method for regulated substances offered for non-refrigerant uses:

§ 84.9
Allocation of calendar-year production allowances.
(a) The relevant agency official will issue, through a separate notification, calendar year 2022 and 2023 production allowances to entities that produced a regulated substance in 2020. The number of production allowances allocated to each eligible entity for 2022-2023 is calculated as follows:
(1) Take the average of the three highest annual exchange value-weighted production amounts that each eligible entity reported to the agency for calendar years 2011 through 2019;
(2) Sum the “average high year” values determined in step 1 of all eligible entities and determine each entity's percentage of that total;
(3) Determine the amount of general pool production allowances by subtracting the quantity of application-
specific allowances for that year as determined in accordance with § 84.13 and the set-aside in § 84.15 from the production cap in § 84.7(b)(3);
(4) Determine individual entities' production allowance quantities by multiplying each entity's percentage determined in step 2 by the amount of general pool allowances determined in step 3.
(b) Starting with the allocation of 2024 calendar years allowances, the relevant Agency official will issue, through a separate notification, calendar year production allowances to entities that produced a regulated substance in 2021 or 2022, or both 2021 and 2022. The allocation of calendar years 2024, 2025, 2026, 2027, and 2028 production allowances is calculated as follows for each entity:
(1) Take the average of the three highest annual exchange value-weighted production amounts that each eligible entity reported to the Agency for calendar years 2011 through 2019. If an entity, or commonly owned or controlled group of entities, does not have consumption amounts for three years between calendar years 2011 through 2019, the relevant Agency official will take the average of available year(s) of consumption for calendar years 2011 through 2019;
(2) Sum every entity's average values determined in paragraph (b)(1) of this section and determine each entity's percentage of that total;
(3) Determine the amount of general pool production allowances by subtracting the quantity of application-specific allowances for that year as determined in accordance with § 84.13 from the production cap in § 84.7(b)(3); and
(4) Determine individual entities' production allowance quantities by multiplying each entity's percentage determined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section by the amount of general pool allowances determined in paragraph (b)(3) of this section.
(c)(1) EPA will allocate calendar year production allowances to individual entities by October 1 of the calendar year prior to the year in which the allowances may be used based on the exchange value-weighted quantities calculated in paragraph (a)(4) of this section.
(2) EPA will provide public notice of the list of companies receiving production allowances as well as the quantities they will be allocated by that date.
(3) In addition to the procedure in paragraph (a) of this section, the relevant agency official will allocate calendar year production allowances to entities that qualified for allowances under § 84.15.
(4) If there are remaining production allowances after distribution from the set-aside under § 84.15, the relevant agency official will distribute such allowances on a pro rata basis to the entities in paragraph (a) of this section by March 31 of the calendar year in which the allowances may be used.
[86 FR 55201, Oct. 5, 2021, as amended at 88 FR 46895, July 20, 2023]
§ 84.11
Allocation of calendar-year consumption allowances.
(a) The relevant agency official will issue, through a separate notification, calendar years 2022 and 2023 consumption allowances to entities that imported or produced a bulk regulated substance in 2020, unless an individual accommodation is permitted by a relevant Agency official. If multiple entities that imported are related through shared corporate or common ownership or control, the relevant agency official will calculate and issue allowances to a single corporate or common owner. The number of consumption allowances allocated to each eligible entity for 2022-2023 is calculated as follows:
(1) Take the average of the three highest annual exchange value-weighted consumption amounts chosen at the corporate or common ownership level for eligible entities reporting to the agency for each calendar year 2011 through 2019;
(2) Sum the “average high year” values determined in step 1 of all eligible entities and determine each entity's percentage of that total;
(3) Determine the amount of general pool consumption allowances by subtracting the quantity of application-specific allowances for that year as determined in accordance with § 84.13 and
the set-aside in § 84.15 from the consumption cap § 84.7(b)(3);
(4) Determine individual entity consumption allowance quantities by multiplying each entity's percentage determined in step 2 by the amount of general pool allowances determined in step 3.
(b) Starting with the allocation of 2024 calendar years allowances the relevant Agency official will issue, through a separate notification, calendar year consumption allowances. The allocation of calendar year 2024, 2025, 2026, 2027, and 2028 consumption allowances is calculated as follows for each entity:
(1) For new market entrants that were allocated allowances pursuant to § 84.15(e)(3), take the allowances allocated for calendar year 2023 and divide that value by the proportion of calendar year 2023 consumption allowances received by general pool allowance holders pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section relative to their high three average calculated pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section;
(2) For entities that produced or imported a regulated substance in 2021 or 2022, or both 2021 and 2022, and have not been allocated allowances pursuant to § 84.15(e)(3), the relevant Agency official will calculate and issue allowances. This calculation and issuance will be to a single entity if multiple entities with historic consumption data are related through shared corporate or common ownership. The relevant Agency official will take the average of the three highest annual exchange value-weighted consumption amounts, which for entities related through shared corporate or common ownership or control would be aggregated and averaged at the corporate or common ownership level, that each eligible entity reported to the Agency for calendar years 2011 through 2019. If an entity, or commonly owned or controlled group of entities, does not have consumption amounts for three years between calendar years 2011 through 2019, the relevant Agency official will take the average of available year(s) of consumption for calendar years 2011 through 2019;
(3) If an entity has a value calculated under paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section, take the single higher value;
(4) If an entity allocated allowances pursuant to § 84.15(e)(3) was acquired by an entity that has a market share calculable under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, and EPA has approved this acquisition, sum the value calculated under paragraph (b)(1) of this section for the entity allocated allowances pursuant to § 84.15(e)(3) with the value calculated under paragraph (b)(2) of this section disregarding any historic consumption activity by the entity allocated allowances pursuant to § 84.15(e)(3), except this paragraph (b)(4) shall not apply to an entity allocated allowances pursuant to § 84.15(e)(3) that has a higher value calculated under paragraph (b)(2) of this section than under paragraph (b)(1) of this section;
(5) Sum every entity's values as determined in paragraphs (b)(1), (2), (3), and (4) of this section and determine each entity's percentage of that total;
(6) Determine the amount of general pool consumption allowances by subtracting the quantity of application-specific allowances for that year as determined in accordance with § 84.13 from the consumption cap in § 84.7(b)(3); and
(7) Determine individual entities' consumption allowance quantities by multiplying each entity's percentage determined in paragraph (b)(5) of this section by the amount of general pool allowances determined in paragraph (b)(6) of this section.
(c)(1) EPA will allocate calendar year consumption allowances to individual entities by October 1 of the calendar year prior to the year in which the allowances may be used based on the exchange value-weighted quantities calculated in paragraph (a)(4) of this section.
(2) EPA will provide public notice of the list of companies receiving consumption allowances as well as how they will be allocated by that date.

(b) Entities identified in paragraph (a) of this section must request application-specific allowances by July 31 of the calendar year prior to the year in which the allowances may be used starting with the calendar year 2023 allocation. The application must include the information required in § 84.31(h)(2) except for applications for mission-critical military end uses, which must include the information required in § 84.31(h)(3).
(1) Entities must provide additional information if requesting that EPA consider unique circumstances that are not reflected by the rates of growth calculated in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. The relevant agency official will consider the following situations as unique circumstances:
(i) Demonstrated manufacturing capacity coming on line;
(ii) The acquisition of another domestic manufacturer or its manufacturing facility or facilities; or
(iii) A global pandemic or other public health emergency that increases patients diagnosed with medical conditions treated by metered dose inhalers.
(2) [Reserved]
(c) The relevant agency official will determine the quantity of application-specific allowances to issue to each company by:
(1) Taking the higher of the use of regulated substances by the company in the specific application in the prior year multiplied by:
(i) The average growth rate of use for the company over the past three years; or
(ii) The average growth rate of use by all companies requesting allowances for that specific application over the past three years; and
(2) Accounting for any additional information provided regarding unique circumstances described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section; and
(3) Subtracting out any general pool allowances allocated to the company for that calendar year.
(d)(1) EPA will allocate application-specific allowances by October 1 of the calendar year prior to the year in which the allowances may be used. The relevant agency official will issue, through a separate notification, application-specific allowances to eligible entities consistent with paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section.
(2) EPA will provide public notice by that date of the list of entities receiving application-specific allowances, the quantity of allowances for each entity, and the specific application(s) for which the allowances may be used.
(e) Entities that use regulated substances in one of the six applications listed in paragraph (a) of this section and were not issued allowances as of October 1, 2021, may request allowances under the procedure in § 84.15. Such entities must meet the criteria for eligibility in this section and are subject to the requirements of this section and § 84.31(h).
(f) EPA will publish a list of entities allocated application-specific allowances, the application for which they may use regulated substances, and the quantity of allowances allocated.
(g) Application-specific allowances may be expended for either the import or production of a regulated substance.
(h) Entities allocated application-specific allowances may confer application-specific allowances to a producer, importer, or other supplier without being subject to the offset required of transfers of allowances in § 84.19. The recipient of a conferred application-specific allowance may continue to confer the allowance until it is expended for production or import. When conferring application-specific allowances, the conferring party must provide a statement certifying that the regulated substances produced or imported with the conferred allowances
will only be used for the application-specific use associated with the allowance(s). The producer(s), importer(s), and/or supplier(s) receiving application-specific allowances must certify to the conferring party that they will not sell regulated substances produced or imported with application-specific allowances for any application or use other than the application-specific use associated with the allowance(s).

§ 84.19
Transfers of allowances.
(a)
Inter-company transfers.
As of January 1, 2022, a person (“transferor”) may transfer to any other person (“transferee”) any quantity of the transferor's production allowances, consumption allowances, or application-specific allowances for use by the same type of application, as long as the following conditions are met:
(1) An offset equal to five percent of the amount of allowances transferred will be deducted from the transferor's production allowance balance if a transfer is made of production allowances, or deducted from the transferor's consumption allowance balance if a transfer is made of consumption allowances. In the case of transferring application-specific allowances, one percent of the amount of allowances transferred will be deducted from the transferor's application-specific allowance balance.
(2) The transferor must submit to the relevant Agency official a transfer claim setting forth the following:
(i) The identities and addresses of the transferor and the transferee;
(ii) The names, telephone numbers, and email addresses of contact persons for the transferor and the transferee;
(iii) The type of allowances being transferred, including the specific application (if applicable), for which allowances are to be transferred;
(iv) The quantity (in MTEVe) of allowances being transferred;
(v) The total cost of the allowances transferred;
(vi) The amount of unexpended allowances of the type and for the year being transferred that the transferor holds under authority of this subpart as of the date the claim is submitted to EPA;
(vii) The quantity of the offset to be deducted from the transferor's allowance balance; and
(viii) For transfers of application-specific allowances, a signed document from the transferee certifying that the transferee will use the application-specific allowances only for the same application for which the application-specific allowance was allocated.
(3) The relevant Agency official will determine whether the records maintained by EPA indicate that the transferor possesses unexpended allowances sufficient to cover the transfer claim as of the date the transfer claim is processed. The transfer claim is the
quantity in EVe to be transferred plus the quantity of the offset. The relevant Agency official will take into account any previous transfers, any production, and allowable imports and exports of regulated substances reported by the transferor. Within three working days of receiving a complete transfer claim, the relevant Agency official will take action to notify the transferor and transferee as follows:
(i) The relevant Agency official will issue a non-objection notice to both the transferor and transferee indicating if EPA's records show that the transferor has sufficient unexpended allowances to cover the transfer claim. In the case of transfers of production allowances or consumption allowances, the relevant agency official will reduce the transferor's balance of unexpended allowances by the quantity to be transferred plus five percent of that quantity. In the case of transfers of application-specific allowances the relevant agency official will reduce the transferor's balance of unexpended allowances by the quantity to be transferred plus one percent of that quantity. The transferor and the transferee may proceed with the transfer when the relevant agency official issues a non-objection notice. However, if EPA ultimately finds that the transferor did not have sufficient unexpended allowances to cover the claim, the transferor and transferee will be liable for any violations of the regulations of this subpart that occur as a result of, or in conjunction with, the improper transfer.
(ii) The relevant Agency official will issue an objection notice disallowing the transfer if EPA's records show that the transferor has insufficient unexpended allowances to cover the transfer claim, that the transferor has failed to respond to one or more Agency requests to supply information needed to make a determination, or that the transferor or transferee has been notified of an impending administrative consequence and therefore is disallowed from transferring allowances in accordance with § 84.35. Either transferor or transferee may file a notice of appeal, with supporting reasons, with the relevant Agency official within 10 working days after receipt of the objection notice. The official may affirm or vacate the disallowance. If no appeal is filed electronically by the tenth working day after notification, the disallowance shall be final on that day.
(4) The transferer and transferee must maintain a copy of the transfer claim and a copy of EPA's non-objection or objection notice for five years.
(5) An entity does not need to follow the procedures in this paragraph (a) to expend allowances possessed by another entity that is majority owned by it, it majority owns, related to it through majority ownership, or commonly owned with it.
(b)
International transfers of production allowances
—(1)
Requests.
A person may request to increase or decrease their production allowances for a specified control period through transfers of such allowances with a person in a foreign country if the applicable conditions in this paragraph are met. Once transferred, all allowances transferred consistent with this paragraph will function as a production allowance, as defined in § 84.3.
(i)
Timing of requests.
Any request for an increase or decrease in production allowances based on an international transfer under this paragraph must be submitted by October 1 of the year prior to the calendar year in which the transferred allowances would be usable.
(ii)
Timing of the transfer.
International transfers under this paragraph will be deemed to occur, and the transferred allowances will be usable, as of January 1 of the calendar year to which the transfer applies.
(2)
Transfer from a person in a foreign country—information requirements.
(i) A person requesting to change their production allowances based on a transfer from a person in a foreign country must submit to the relevant Agency official at the time the international transfer is requested a signed document from an official representative in that country's embassy in the United States stating that the appropriate authority within that country has revised the domestic production limits for that country equal to the lowest of the following three production quantities and identifying which of the following three production quantities was lowest:
(A) The maximum production level permitted in § 84.7(b) in the year of the international transfer minus the quantity of production allowances (in exchange value-weighted kilograms) to be transferred;
(B) The maximum production level for the applicable regulated substances that are allowed under applicable law (including the foreign country's applicable domestic law) minus the quantity of production allowances (in exchange value-weighted kilograms) to be transferred; or
(C) The average of the foreign country's actual national production level of the applicable regulated substances for the three calendar years prior to the year of the transfer minus the quantity of production allowances (in exchange value-weighted kilograms) to be transferred.
(ii) A person requesting a revision based on a transfer from a foreign country (“transferee”) must also submit to the relevant Agency official a true copy of the document that sets forth the following:
(A) The identity and address of the transferee;
(B) The foreign country authorizing the transfer;
(C) The names, telephone numbers, and email addresses of contact persons for the transferee and for the person in the foreign country;
(D) The name of the chemical and quantity (in kilograms) of production being transferred;
(E) Documentation that the foreign country possesses the necessary quantity of unexpended production rights;
(F) The calendar year to which the transfer applies; and
(G) A signed statement from a responsible official describing whether the increased production is intended for export or the market in the United States.
(3)
Transfer to a person in a foreign country—Information requirements.
A person requesting a transfer to a person in a foreign country must submit a request to the relevant Agency official that sets forth the following information:
(i) The identity and address of the person seeking to transfer the allowances (“transferor”);
(ii) The foreign country authorizing the transfer;
(iii) The names, telephone numbers, and email addresses of contact persons for the transferor and for the person in the foreign country;
(iv) The name of the chemical and quantity (in kilograms) of allowable production being transferred; and
(v) The calendar year to which the transfer applies;
(vi) A signed statement from a responsible official requesting that the relevant Agency official revise the number of production allowances the transferor holds such that the aggregate national production in the United States is equal to the lowest of the following three production quantities and identifying which of the following three production quantities was lowest:
(A) The maximum production level permitted in § 84.7(b) in the year of the international transfer minus the quantity of production allowances (in exchange value-weighted kilograms) to be transferred;
(B) The maximum production for the applicable regulated substances that are allowed under applicable law minus the quantity of production allowances (in exchange value-weighted kilograms) to be transferred; or
(C) The average of the United States' actual national production level of the applicable regulated substances for the three calendar years prior to the year of the transfer minus the quantity of production allowances (in exchange value-weighted kilograms) to be transferred.
(4)
Review of international transfer request to a foreign country.
After receiving a transfer request that meets the requirements of paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the relevant Agency official may, at his/her discretion, consider the following factors in deciding whether to approve such a transfer:
(i) Possible economic hardships created by a transfer;
(ii) Potential effects on trade;
(iii) Potential environmental implications; and
(iv) The total quantity of unexpended production allowances held by entities in the United States.
(5)
Notice of transfer.
The relevant Agency official will review the submitted requests to determine whether the foreign country in which the person is located has enacted or otherwise established the same or similar requirements or otherwise undertaken commitments regarding the production and consumption of regulated substances as are contained in the AIM Act, within a reasonable time frame of the date of its enactment. If it is determined that these conditions are not met, the relevant Agency official will notify the requestor in writing that no transfers to or from the country can occur. If these conditions are satisfied such that transfers to or from the country can occur, the relevant Agency official will consider if the request meets the applicable requirements of paragraph (b) of this section. If the request meets the requirements of paragraph (b)(2) of this section for transfers from foreign countries and paragraph (b)(3) of this section for transfers to foreign countries, and if the relevant Agency official has not decided to disapprove the request based on consideration of factors listed in paragraph (b)(4) of this section if applicable, the relevant Agency official will notify the person in writing that the appropriate production allowances were either granted or deducted and specify the control period to which the transfer applies. Notifications of production allowances granted or deducted will be provided before January 1 of the calendar year to which the transfer applies.
(i) For transfers from a foreign country, such notification will reflect a revision of the balance of allowances held by the recipient of the transfer to equal the unexpended production allowances held by the recipient of the transfer plus the quantity of allowable production transferred from the foreign country minus an offset of five percent of the quantity transferred. The relevant Agency official will not adjust available allowances until the foreign country's representative has confirmed the appropriate number of allowances were deducted in the foreign country.
(ii) For transfers to a foreign country, such notification will reflect a revision of the balance of production allowances for the transferor such that the aggregate national production of the regulated substance to be transferred is equal to the value the relevant Agency official determines to be the lowest of:
(A) The maximum production level permitted in § 84.7(b) in the year of the international transfer minus the quantity of production allowances transferred and minus an offset of five percent of the quantity transferred; or
(B) The maximum production level for the applicable regulated substances that is allowed under applicable law (in exchange-value weighted kilograms) minus the quantity of production allowances transferred and minus an offset of five percent of the quantity transferred; or
(C) The average of the actual annual U.S. production of the applicable regulated substances for the three years prior to the date of the transfer (in exchange-value weighted kilograms minus the quantity of production allowances transferred and minus an offset of five percent of the quantity transferred).
(6)
Revised production limit for previous transferors.
If the average actual U.S. production during the three most recent calendar years before the date of the transfer is less than the total allowable U.S. production for the applicable regulated substances permitted in § 84.7(b) for a calendar year for which international transfers are approved to occur, the aggregate allowed national U.S. production of those substances will be reduced by an additional amount beyond a simple deduction of the number of allowances reflected in the notifications under paragraph (b)(5)(ii)(B) of this section. In these circumstances, the relevant Agency official will revise the production limit for each transferor who obtained approval of a transfer of the applicable regulated substances to a foreign country in the same calendar year and notify each transferor of the revision in writing. The amount of the revision will equal the result of the following set of calculations:
(i) The total U.S. allowable production of the applicable regulated substances minus the average of the actual annual U.S. production of those
substances during the three most recent calendar years prior to the calendar year of the transfer.
(ii) The quantity of production allowances for the applicable regulated substances transferred by the transferor in that calendar year divided by the total quantity of production allowances for those substances approved for transfer to a person in a foreign country by all the persons approved to make such transfers in that calendar year.
(iii) The result of paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section multiplied by the result of paragraph (b)(6)(ii) of this section.
(iv) The unexpended production allowances held by the person minus the result of paragraph (b)(6)(iii) of this section.
(7)
Effective date of revised production limit
s. If a revision is issued under paragraph (b)(6) of this section, the change in production allowances will be effective on the date that the notification is issued.

The leak rate is expressed in terms of the percentage of the appliance's full charge that would be lost over a 12-month period if the current rate of loss were to continue over that period. The rate must be calculated using one of the following methods. The same method must be used for all appliances subject to the leak repair requirements located at an operating facility.
(1)
Annualizing Method
—(i)
Step 1.
Take the number of pounds of refrigerant added to the appliance to return it to a full charge, whether in one addition or in multiple additions related to same leak, and divide it by the number of pounds of refrigerant the appliance normally contains at full charge;
(ii)
Step 2.
Take the shorter of the number of days that have passed since the last day refrigerant was added or 365 days and divide that number by 365 days;
(iii)

(1) EPA determines through a subsequent rulemaking that the information is emission data or data not otherwise entitled to confidential treatment; or
(2) The Office of General Counsel issues a final determination, based on the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4), stating that the information is no longer entitled to confidential treatment because of change in the applicable law or newly discovered or changed facts. Prior to making such final determination, EPA shall afford the business an opportunity to submit comments on pertinent issues in the manner described by 40 CFR 2.204(e) and 2.205(b). If, after consideration of any timely comments submitted by the business, the Office of General Counsel makes a revised final determination that the information is not entitled to confidential treatment, the relevant agency official will notify the business in accordance with the procedures described in 40 CFR 2.205(f)(2).
