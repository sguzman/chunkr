(a) A manufacturer, distributor, or importer of a device may be required to submit to the Food and Drug Administration all relevant and available data and information to enable the Commissioner to determine whether the device presents substantial deception, unreasonable and substantial risk of illness or injury, or unreasonable, direct, and substantial danger to the health of individuals. The data and information required by the Commissioner may include scientific or test data, reports, records, or other information, including data and information on whether the device is safe and effective for its intended use or when used as directed, whether the device performs according to the claims made for the device, and information on adulteration or misbranding. Any relevant information that is voluntarily submitted will also be reviewed.
(b) A manufacturer, distributor, or importer of a device required to submit data and information as provided in paragraph (a) of this section will be notified in writing by the Food and Drug Administration that such data and information shall be submitted. The
written notification will advise the manufacturer, distributor, or importer of the device that the purpose for the request is to enable the Commissioner to determine whether any of the conditions listed in paragraph (a) of this section or § 895.30(a)(1) exists with respect to the device such that a proceeding should be initiated to make the device a banned device. When the required data and information can be identified by the Food and Drug Administration at the time of the notification, the agency will provide such identification to the manufacturer, distributor, or importer of the device.
(c) The required data and information shall be submitted to the Food and Drug Administration no more than 30 days after the date of receipt of the request, unless the Commissioner determines that the data and information shall be submitted by some other date and so informs the manufacturer, distributor, or importer, in which case the data and information shall be submitted on the date specified by the Commissioner.
(d) If the data or information submitted to the Food and Drug Administration is sufficient to persuade the Commissioner that the deception or risk of illness or injury or the danger to the health of individuals presented by a device could be corrected or eliminated by labeling or change in labeling, or change in advertising if the device is a restricted device, the Commissioner will proceed in accordance with § 895.25.
(e) If the data or information submitted to the Food and Drug Administration is insufficient to show that the device does not present a substantial deception or an unreasonable and substantial risk of illness or injury, or an unreasonable, direct, and substantial danger to the health of individuals, or if the manufacturer, distributor, or importer fails to submit the required information, the Commissioner may rely upon this insufficiency or failure to submit the required information in considering whether to initiate a proceeding to make the device a banned device under § 895.21(d) and, when appropriate, to establish a special effective date in accordance with § 895.30. The Commissioner may also initiate other regulatory action as provided in the act or this chapter.
§ 895.25
Labeling.
(a) If the Commissioner determines that the substantial deception or unreasonable and substantial risk of illness or injury or the unreasonable, direct, and substantial danger to the health of individuals presented by a device can be corrected or eliminated by labeling or a change in labeling, or change in advertising if the device is a restricted device, the Commissioner will provide written notice to the manufacturer, distributor, importer, or any other person(s) responsible for the labeling or advertising of the device specifying:
(1) The deception or risk of illness or injury or the danger to the health of individuals,
(2) The labeling or change in labeling, or change in advertising if the device is a restricted device, necessary to correct the deception or eliminate or reduce such risk or danger, and
(3) The period of time within which the labeling, change in labeling, or change in advertising must be accomplished.
(b) In specifying the labeling or change in labeling or change in advertising to correct the deception or to eliminate or reduce the risk of illness or injury or the danger to the health of individuals, the Commissioner may require the manufacturer, distributor, importer, or any other person(s) responsible for the labeling or advertising of the device to include in labeling for the device, and in advertising if the device is a restricted device, a statement, notice, or warning. Such statement, notice, or warning shall be in the manner and form prescribed by the Commissioner and shall identify the deception or risk of illness or injury or the unreasonable, direct, and substantial danger to the health of individuals associated with the device as previously labeled. Such statement, notice, or warning shall be used in the labeling and advertising of the device for a time period specified by the Commissioner on the basis of the degree of deception, risk of illness or injury, or danger to health; the frequency of sale
of the device; the length of time the device has been on the market; the intended uses of the device; the method of its use; and any other factors that the Commissioner considers pertinent.
(c) The Commissioner will allow a manufacturer, distributor, importer, or any other person(s) responsible for the labeling or advertising of the device a reasonable time, considering the deception or risk of illness or injury or the danger to the health of individuals presented by the device, within which to accomplish the required labeling, change in labeling, and, if the device is a restricted device, any change in advertising. The Commissioner may, however, request that no additional devices be introduced into commerce until the labeling or change in labeling, or change in advertising is accomplished by the manufacturer, distributor, importer, or other person(s) responsible for the labeling or advertising of the device.
(d) If such voluntary action is not taken, the Commissioner may take action under other sections of the act to prevent the introduction of the devices into commerce. The Commissioner may consider the failure of a manufacturer, distributor, importer, or any other person(s) responsible for the labeling or advertising of the device to accomplish the required labeling or change in labeling, or change in advertising in accordance with this section as a basis for initiating a proceeding to make a device a banned device in accordance with § 895.21(d) and when appropriate to establish a special effective date in accordance with § 895.30.
§ 895.30
Special effective date.
(a) The Commissioner may declare a proposed regulation under § 895.21(d) to be effective upon its publication in the
Federal Register
and until the effective date of any final action taken respecting the regulation if:
(1) The Commissioner determines, on the basis of all available data and information, that the deception or risk of illness or injury associated with use of the device that is subject to the regulation presents an unreasonable, direct, and substantial danger to the health of individuals, and
(2) Before the date of the publication of such regulation, the Commissioner notifies the domestic manufacturer and importer, if any, of the device that the regulation is to be made so effective. If necessary, the Commissioner may also notify the distributor or any other responsible person(s). In addition, the Commissioner will attempt to notify any foreign manufacturer when the name and address of the foreign manufacturer are readily available.
(b) This procedure may be used when the Commissioner determines that the potential or actual injury involved is a serious one that the Commissioner believes will endanger the health of individuals who have been, or will be, exposed to the device. In assessing the degree of danger, the Commissioner need not find that the danger is immediate, and it shall be sufficient for the Commissioner to determine that the danger may involve a serious long-term risk.
(c) If the Commissioner makes a proposed regulation effective in accordance with this section, the Commissioner will, as expeditiously as possible, give interested persons prompt notice of this action in the
Federal Register
and will provide an opportunity for an informal hearing in accordance with part 16 of this chapter.
(d) After the hearing, if any, and after considering any written comments submitted on the proposal and any additional available information and data, the Commissioner will as expeditiously as possible either affirm, modify, or revoke the proposed regulation making the device a banned device. If the Commissioner decides to affirm or modify the proposed regulation to make a device a banned device, the Commissioner will amend subpart B by adding the name or description of the device, or both, to the list of banned devices. If the Commissioner decides to revoke a proposed regulation making a device a banned device, a notice of termination of rulemaking proceedings and reasons therefor will be published in the
Federal Register.
(e) The Commissioner may declare the special effective date provided by this section to be in effect after the publication of a proposed regulation
under § 895.21(d), if, based on new information, or upon reconsideration of previously available information, the Commissioner makes the determination and provides the appropriate notices and an opportunity for a hearing in accordance with paragraphs (a) and (c) of this section.
(f) Those devices that have been named banned devices under § 895.30 and that have already been sold to the public may be subject to relabeling by the manufacturer, distributor, importer, or any other person(s) responsible for the labeling of the device or may be subject to the provisions of section 518(a) or (b) of the act.

(F) “Known Biopsy-Proven Malignancy.” Reserved for known malignancies being mammographically evaluated for definitive therapy; and
(G) “Post-Procedure Mammogram for Marker Placement.” Reserved for a post-procedure mammogram used to confirm the deployment and position of a breast tissue marker.
(v) In cases where no final assessment category can be assigned due to incomplete work-up, one of the following classification statements shall be assigned as an assessment and reasons why no final assessment can be made shall be stated by the interpreting physician.
(A) “Incomplete: Need additional imaging evaluation.” Reserved for examinations where additional imaging needs to be performed before an assessment category identified in paragraphs (c)(1)(iv)(A) through (G) of this section can be given; or
(B) “Incomplete: Need prior mammograms for comparison.” Reserved for examinations where comparison with prior mammograms should be performed before an assessment category identified in paragraphs (c)(1)(iv)(A) through (G) of this section can be given. If this assessment category is used, a followup report with an assessment category identified in paragraphs (c)(1)(iv)(A) through (E) of this section must be issued within 30 calendar days of the initial report whether or not comparison views can be obtained.
(vi) Overall assessment of breast density, classified in one of the following categories:

(2)
Communication of mammography results to the patients.
Each facility shall provide each patient a summary of the mammography report written in lay terms within 30 calendar days of the mammographic examination which shall, at a minimum, include the name of the patient; the name, address, and telephone number of the facility performing the mammographic examination; and an assessment of breast density as described in paragraphs (c)(2)(iii) and (iv) of this section. If the assessment of the mammography report is “Suspicious” or “Highly Suggestive of Malignancy,” the facility shall provide the patient a summary of the mammography report written in lay language within 7 calendar days of the final interpretation of the mammograms.
(i) Patients who do not name a healthcare provider to receive the mammography report shall be sent the report described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section within 30 days, in addition to the written notification of results in lay terms. If the assessment of the mammography report is “Suspicious” or “Highly Suggestive of Malignancy,” the facility shall send this report to the patient within 7 calendar days of the final interpretation of the mammograms.
(ii) Each facility that accepts patients who do not have a healthcare provider shall maintain a system for referring such patients to a healthcare provider when clinically indicated, which shall include when such patients' mammogram assessment is either probably benign, suspicious, or highly suggestive of malignancy.
(iii) If the mammography report identifies the patient's breast density as “The breasts are almost entirely fatty” or “There are scattered areas of fibroglandular density,” the lay summary shall include the statement “Breast tissue can be either dense or not dense. Dense tissue makes it harder to find breast cancer on a mammogram and also raises the risk of developing breast cancer. Your breast tissue is not dense. Talk to your healthcare provider about breast density, risks for breast cancer, and your individual situation.”
(iv) If the mammography report identifies the breast density as “The breasts are heterogeneously dense, which may obscure small masses” or “The breasts are extremely dense, which lowers the sensitivity of mammography,” the lay summary shall include the statement “Breast tissue can be either dense or not dense. Dense tissue makes it harder to find breast cancer on a mammogram and also raises the risk of developing breast cancer. Your breast tissue is dense. In some people with dense tissue, other imaging tests in addition to a mammogram may help find cancers. Talk to your healthcare provider about breast density, risks for breast cancer, and your individual situation.”
(3)
Communication of mammography results to health care providers.

(j)
Additional mammography review and patient and referring provider notification.
(1) If FDA or the State certification agency believes that mammographic quality at a facility has been compromised and may present a significant risk to human health, the facility shall provide clinical images and other relevant information, as specified by FDA or the State certification agency, for review by the accreditation body or the State certification agency. This additional mammography review will help FDA or the State certification agency determine whether the facility is in compliance with this section and whether there is a need to notify affected patients, their referring physicians or other healthcare providers, and/or the public that there is a significant risk to human health.
(2) Based on the results of the additional mammography review, the facility's failure to comply with the terms of the additional mammography review, or other information, FDA or the State certification agency may determine that the quality of mammography performed by a facility, whether or not certified under § 900.11, was so inconsistent with the quality standards established in this part as to present a significant risk to human health. FDA or the State certification agency may require such a facility to notify all patients who received mammograms at the facility or those patients who are determined to be at risk due to the quality of their mammography, and their referring physicians or other healthcare providers, of the deficiencies and resulting potential harm, appropriate remedial measures, and such other relevant information as FDA or the State certification agency may require. Such notification shall occur within a timeframe and in a manner specified by FDA or the State certification agency. If the facility is unable or unwilling to perform such notification, FDA or the State certification agency may notify patients and their referring physicians or other healthcare providers individually or through the mass media.

§ 900.13
Revocation of accreditation and revocation of accreditation body approval.
(a)
FDA action following revocation of accreditation.
If a facility's accreditation is revoked by an accreditation body, the agency may conduct an investigation into the reasons for the revocation. Following such investigation, the agency may determine that the facility's certificate shall no longer be in effect or the agency may take whatever other action or combination of actions will best protect the public health, including the establishment and implementation of a corrective plan of action that will permit the certificate to continue in effect while the facility seeks reaccreditation. A facility whose certificate is no longer in effect because it has lost its accreditation may not practice mammography.
(b)
Withdrawal of FDA approval of an accreditation body.
(1) If FDA withdraws approval of an accreditation body under § 900.6, the certificates of facilities previously accredited by such body shall remain in effect for up to 1 year from the date of the withdrawal of approval, unless FDA determines, in order to protect human health or because the accreditation body fraudulently accredited facilities, that the certificates of some or all of the facilities should be revoked or suspended or that a shorter time period should be established for the certificates to remain in effect.
(2) After 1 year from the date of withdrawal of approval of an accreditation body, or within any shorter period of time established by the agency, the affected facilities must obtain accreditation from another accreditation body, or from another entity designated by FDA.
§ 900.14
Suspension or revocation of certificates.
(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, FDA may suspend or revoke a certificate if FDA finds, after providing the owner or operator of the facility with notice and opportunity for a hearing in accordance with part 16 of this chapter, that the facility, owner, operator, or any employee of the facility:
(1) Has been guilty of misrepresentation in obtaining the certificate;
(2) Has failed to comply with the standards of § 900.12;
(3) Has failed to comply with reasonable requests of FDA, the State certification agency, or the accreditation body for records, information, reports, or materials, including clinical images for an additional mammography review under § 900.12(j), that FDA or the State certification agency believes are necessary to determine the continued eligibility of the facility for a certificate or continued compliance with the standards of § 900.12;
(4) Has refused a reasonable request of a duly designated FDA inspector, State inspector, or accreditation body representative for permission to inspect the facility or the operations and pertinent records of the facility;
(5) Has violated or aided and abetted in the violation of any provision of or regulation issued pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 263b;
(6) Has failed to comply with prior sanctions imposed by FDA or the State certification agency under 42 U.S.C. 263b(h), including a directed plan of correction or a patient and referring physician notification; or
(7) Has failed to comply with requests of current or former facility personnel for records of their training or experience relevant to their qualification under MQSA, in violation of § 900.12(a)(4).
(b) FDA may suspend the certificate of a facility before holding a hearing if FDA makes a finding described in paragraph (a) of this section and also determines that;
(1) The failure to comply with required standards presents a serious risk to human health;
(2) The refusal to permit inspection makes immediate suspension necessary; or
(3) There is reason to believe that the violation or aiding and abetting of the violation was intentional or associated with fraud.
(c) If FDA suspends a certificate in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section:
(1) The agency shall provide the facility with an opportunity for an informal hearing under part 16 of this chapter
not later than 60 days from the effective date of this suspension;
(2) The suspension shall remain in effect until the agency determines that:

(b)
Minor deficiencies.
If FDA determines that a certification agency has demonstrated deficiencies in performing certification functions and responsibilities that are less serious or more limited than the deficiencies in paragraph (a) of this section, including failure to follow the certification agency's own procedures and policies as approved by FDA, FDA shall notify the certification agency that it has a specified period of time to take particular corrective measures as directed by FDA or to submit to FDA for approval the certification agency's own plan of corrective action addressing the minor deficiencies. If the approved corrective actions are not being implemented satisfactorily or within the established schedule, FDA may place the agency on probationary status for a period of time determined by FDA, or may withdraw approval of the certification agency.
(1) If FDA places a certification agency on probationary status, the certification agency shall notify all facilities certified or seeking certification by it of its probationary status within a time period and in a manner approved by FDA.
(2) Probationary status shall remain in effect until such time as the certification agency can demonstrate to the satisfaction of FDA that it has successfully implemented or is implementing the corrective action plan within the established schedule, and that the corrective actions have substantially eliminated all identified problems, or
(3) If FDA determines that a certification agency that has been placed on probationary status is not implementing corrective actions satisfactorily or within the established schedule, FDA may withdraw approval of the certification agency. The certification agency shall notify all facilities certified or seeking certification by it, as well as the appropriate accreditation bodies with jurisdiction in the State, of its loss of FDA approval, within a timeframe and in a manner approved by FDA.
(c)
Transfer of records.
A certification agency that has its approval withdrawn shall transfer facility records and other related information as required by FDA to a location and according to a schedule approved by FDA.
§ 900.25
Hearings and appeals.
(a) Opportunities to challenge final adverse actions taken by FDA regarding approval of certification agencies or withdrawal of approval of certification agencies shall be communicated through notices of opportunity for informal hearings in accordance with part 16 of this chapter.

The radiation emitted by a component other than the diagnostic source assembly shall not exceed an air kerma of 18 microGy (vice 2 mR exposure) in 1 hour at 5 cm from any accessible surface of the component when it is operated in an assembled x-ray system under any conditions for which it was designed. Compliance shall be determined by measurements averaged over an area of 100 square cm with no linear dimension greater than 20 cm.

If it is necessary to determine such HVL at an x-ray tube potential which is not listed in table 1 in paragraph (m)(1) of this section, linear interpolation or extrapolation may
be made. Positive means

§ 1107.1
Exemptions.
(a)
General requirements.
Under section 905(j)(3) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 387e(j)(3)), FDA may exempt from the requirements relating to the demonstration that a tobacco product is substantially equivalent within the meaning of section 910 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 387j), tobacco products that are modified by adding or deleting a tobacco additive, or increasing or decreasing the quantity of an existing tobacco additive, if FDA determines that:
(1) Such modification would be a minor modification of a tobacco product that can be sold under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (a legally marketed tobacco product);
(2) A report under section 905(j)(1) intended to demonstrate substantial equivalence is not necessary to ensure that permitting the tobacco product to be marketed would be appropriate for protection of the public health; and
(3) An exemption is otherwise appropriate.
(b)
Request for an exemption under section 905(j)(3) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.
A request for an exemption from the requirement of demonstrating substantial equivalence may be made only by the manufacturer of a legally marketed tobacco product
for a minor modification to that tobacco product. To request an exemption, the manufacturer must submit the request and all information supporting the request in an electronic format that FDA can process, review, and archive. If the manufacturer is unable to submit an exemption request in an electronic format, the manufacturer may submit a written request to the Center for Tobacco Products explaining in detail why the manufacturer cannot submit the request in an electronic format and requesting an alternative format. Such request must include an explanation of why an alternative format is necessary. All submissions, including requests to submit the information in an alternative format, requests for exemptions, and all supporting information must be legible and in the English language. An exemption request must contain:
(1) The manufacturer's address and contact information;
(2) Identification of the tobacco product(s);
(3) A detailed explanation of the purpose of the modification;
(4) A detailed description of the modification, including a statement as to whether the modification involves adding or deleting a tobacco additive, or increasing or decreasing the quantity of an existing tobacco additive;
(5) A detailed explanation of why the modification is a minor modification of a tobacco product that can be sold under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act;
(6) A detailed explanation of why a report under section 905(j)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act intended to demonstrate substantial equivalence is not necessary to ensure that permitting the tobacco product to be marketed would be appropriate for protection of the public health;
(7) A certification (
i.e.,
a signed statement by a responsible official of the manufacturer) summarizing the supporting evidence and providing the rationale for the official's determination that the modification does not increase the tobacco product's appeal to or use by minors, toxicity, addictiveness, or abuse liability;
(8) Other information justifying an exemption; and
(9) An environmental assessment under part 25 of this chapter prepared in accordance with the requirements of § 25.40 of this chapter.
(c)
Exemption determination.
FDA will review the information submitted and determine whether to grant or deny an exemption request based on whether the criteria in section 905(j)(3) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act are met. FDA may request additional information if necessary to make a determination. FDA will consider the exemption request withdrawn if the information is not provided within the requested timeframe.
(d)
Rescission of an exemption.
FDA may rescind an exemption if it finds that the exemption is not appropriate for the protection of public health. In general, FDA will rescind an exemption only after notice and opportunity for a hearing under part 16 of this chapter is provided. However, FDA may rescind an exemption prior to notice and opportunity for a hearing under part 16 of this chapter if the continuance of the exemption presents a serious risk to public health. In that case, FDA will provide the manufacturer an opportunity for a hearing as soon as possible after the rescission.

86 FR 55275, Oct. 4, 2021, unless otherwise noted.
§ 1107.16
Submission of a substantial equivalence report.
An applicant may submit an SE Report intended to demonstrate that a new tobacco product is substantially equivalent to a predicate tobacco product. The applicant must submit the SE Report at least 90 calendar days prior to the date the applicant intends to introduce or deliver for introduction a new tobacco product into interstate commerce for commercial distribution. The applicant cannot begin commercial distribution of the new tobacco product until FDA has provided the applicant an order stating that the Agency has determined that the new tobacco product is substantially equivalent to a predicate tobacco product, unless the new tobacco product has received authorization to be marketed through another premarket pathway.
§ 1107.18
Required content and format of an SE Report.
(a)
Overview.
The SE Report must provide information uniquely identifying the new tobacco product and the predicate tobacco product, and compare the new tobacco product to either a tobacco product commercially marketed (other than for test marketing) in the United States as of February 15, 2007, or a tobacco product that FDA previously found to be substantially equivalent. The SE Report must provide sufficient information as described in this section to enable FDA to determine whether the new tobacco product is substantially equivalent to a tobacco product that was commercially marketed (other than for test marketing) in the United States as of February 15, 2007. If FDA cites deficiencies and requests information to support a statement in the SE Report, the applicant must provide that information for review to continue, or FDA may issue an order under § 1107.48. FDA generally intends to refuse to accept an SE Report for review if it does not comply with
§ 1105.10 and this section. The SE Report must contain the following information:
(1) General information (as described in paragraph (c) of this section);
(2) Summary (as described in paragraph (d) of this section);
(3) New tobacco product description (as described in paragraph (e) of this section);
(4) Predicate tobacco product description (as described in paragraph (f) of this section), including a statement that the predicate tobacco product has not been removed from the market at the initiative of FDA and has not been determined by judicial order to be adulterated or misbranded, and the submission tracking number of the SE order finding the predicate product SE, or the submission tracking number of, or information to support, that the predicate tobacco product was commercially marketed (other than for test marketing) in the United States as of February 15, 2007;
(5) Comparison information (as described in paragraph (g) of this section);
(6) Comparative testing information (as described in paragraph (h) of this section);
(7) Statement of compliance with applicable tobacco product standards (as described in paragraph (i) of this section);
(8) Health information summary or statement that such information will be made available upon request (as described in paragraph (j) of this section);
(9) Compliance with part 25 of this chapter (as described in paragraph (k) of this section); and
(10) Certification statement (as described in paragraph (
l
) of this section).
(b)
Format.
The applicant must submit the SE Report using the form(s) that FDA provides. The SE Report must contain a comprehensive index and table of contents, be well-organized and legible, and be written in English. As described in § 1107.62, the applicant must submit the SE Report and all information supporting the SE Report in an electronic format that FDA can process, read, review, and archive, unless FDA has provided a waiver under § 1107.62(b).
(c)
General information.
The SE Report must include the following information, using the form FDA provides:
(1) The date the SE Report is submitted;
(2) Type of submission (
e.g.,
the SE Report or amendment to a report);
(3) FDA STN, if previously assigned;
(4) Any other relevant FDA STN, such as a voluntary request for a determination that a tobacco product was commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 2007, or SE Report previously found substantially equivalent (if applicable), and cross-references to meetings with FDA regarding the new tobacco product;
(5) Applicant name, address, and contact information (including email address);
(6) Authorized representative or U.S. agent (for a foreign applicant), including the name, address, and contact information (including email address);
(7) For both the new and predicate tobacco products, the following information to uniquely identify the products:
(i) Manufacturer;
(ii) Product name, including the brand and sub brand (or other commercial name used in commercial distribution); and
(iii) Product category, product subcategory, and product properties (if the product does not have a listed product property,
e.g.,
ventilation or characterizing flavor, the report must state “none” for that property) as provided in the following table:

In addition, to demonstrate that a new tobacco product is substantially equivalent, an applicant must also explain why any differences in the manufacturing process between the new tobacco product and the predicate tobacco product would not change the characteristics of the new tobacco product such that the new tobacco product could raise different questions of public health (§ 1107.18(e)). Similarly, for smokeless tobacco products and tobacco products that contain fermented tobacco, an applicant must explain why any difference in stability between the new tobacco product and the predicate tobacco product does not cause the new tobacco product to raise different questions of public health (paragraph (f) of this section).
(h)
Comparison to original predicate tobacco product.
If the applicant is comparing the new tobacco product to a predicate tobacco product that FDA has previously found to be substantially equivalent, FDA may request that the applicant include information related to the original predicate tobacco product that was commercially marketed (other than for test marketing) in the United States as of February 15, 2007, even if that original predicate tobacco product is back several predicate tobacco products. FDA will request this information when necessary to ensure that any order the Agency issues finding the new tobacco product substantially equivalent complies with section 910(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. FDA may need to review the first SE Report that received a finding of substantial equivalence using the original predicate tobacco product as a predicate tobacco product in order to make this finding.
§ 1107.20
Amendments.
(a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, the applicant may submit an amendment to an SE Report in accordance with subpart C of this part.

(a) An applicant may at any time make a written request to withdraw an SE Report for which FDA has not issued an order. The withdrawal request must state:
(1) Whether the withdrawal is due to a health or safety concern related to the tobacco product;
(2) The submission tracking number; and
(3) The name of the new tobacco product that is the subject of the SE Report.
(b) An SE Report will be considered withdrawn when FDA issues a notice stating the SE Report has been withdrawn.
(c) The SE Report is an Agency record, even if withdrawn. FDA will retain the withdrawn SE Report under Federal Agency records schedules. The
availability of the withdrawn SE Report will be subject to FDA's public information regulations in part 20 of this chapter.
§ 1107.24
Change in ownership of an SE Report.
An applicant may transfer ownership of its SE Report. On or before the time of transfer, the new and former applicants are required to submit information to FDA as follows:
(a) The former applicant must sign and submit a notice to FDA that states that all of the former applicant's rights and responsibilities relating to the SE Report have been transferred to the new applicant. This notice must identify the name and address of the new applicant and the SE Report transferred.
(b) The new applicant must sign and submit a notice to FDA containing the following:
(1) The new applicant's commitment to agreements, promises, and conditions made by the former applicant and contained in the SE Report;
(2) The date that the change in ownership is effective;

Communications between FDA and applicants.
(a)
General principles.
During the course of reviewing an SE Report, FDA may communicate with applicants about relevant matters, including scientific, medical, and procedural issues that arise during the review process. These communications may take the form of telephone conversations, letters, or emails, and will be documented in the SE Report in accordance with § 10.65 of this chapter.
(b)
Meeting.
Meetings between FDA and applicants may be held to discuss scientific and other issues. Requests for meetings will be directed to the Office of Science, Center for Tobacco Products, and FDA will make every attempt to grant requests for meetings that involve important issues.
(c)
Acceptance of an SE Report for review.
After receiving an SE Report under § 1107.18, FDA will either refuse to accept the SE Report for review or issue an acceptance for review letter.
(d)
Notification of deficiencies in an SE Report submitted under § 1107.18.
FDA will make reasonable efforts to communicate to applicants the procedural, administrative, or scientific deficiencies found in an SE Report and any additional information and data needed for the Agency's review. The applicant must also provide additional comparison information under § 1107.19 if requested by FDA.
(e)
Withdrawal of SE Report.
An SE Report will be considered withdrawn when FDA issues a notice stating that the SE Report has been withdrawn.
§ 1107.42
Review cycles.
(a)
Initial review cycle.
FDA intends to review the SE Report and either communicate with the applicant as described in § 1107.40 or take an action under § 1107.44 within 90 calendar days of FDA's receipt of the SE Report, or within 90 calendar days of determining that the predicate was found to be commercially marketed (other than for test marketing) in the United States as of February 15, 2007 (if applicable), whichever is later. This 90-day period is called the “initial review cycle.”
(b)
Additional review cycles.
If FDA issues a deficiency notification under § 1107.40(d) during the initial review cycle, FDA will stop reviewing the SE Report until it receives a response from the applicant or the timeframe specified in the notification of deficiencies for response has elapsed. If the
applicant fails to respond within the time period provided in the notification of deficiency, FDA will issue an order denying marketing authorization under the criteria set forth in § 1107.48. If the applicant's response to the notification of deficiencies provides the information FDA requested, but FDA identifies additional deficiencies, FDA may issue an additional deficiency notification. Each response will begin a new 90-day review cycle.
(c)
Inadequate response.
If the applicant's response to FDA's deficiency notification(s) does not provide the information FDA requested, or the applicant provides information but the SE Report is still deficient, FDA generally intends to issue an order denying market authorization under the criteria set forth in § 1107.48. At any time before FDA issues an order, an applicant may make a written request to withdraw an SE Report under § 1107.22.
§ 1107.44
FDA action on an SE Report.
After receipt of an SE Report, FDA will:
(a) Refuse to accept the SE Report for review if it does not comply with § 1107.18 and § 1105.10 of this chapter;

(c) Issue a letter administratively closing the SE Report if it is not possible to make a determination on an SE Report;
(d) Issue a letter canceling the SE Report if FDA finds the SE Report was created in error;
(e) Issue an order as described in § 1107.46 finding the new tobacco product to be substantially equivalent and in compliance with the requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act; or
(f) Issue an order as described in § 1107.48 denying marketing authorization because the new tobacco product is:
(1) Not substantially equivalent to a tobacco product commercially marketed (other than for test marketing) in the United States on February 15, 2007, or
(2) Not in compliance with the requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.
§ 1107.46
Issuance of an order finding a new tobacco product substantially equivalent.
If FDA finds that the information submitted in the SE Report establishes that the new tobacco product is substantially equivalent to a predicate tobacco product that was commercially marketed (other than for test marketing) in the United States on February 15, 2007, and finds that the new tobacco product is in compliance with the requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, FDA will send the applicant an order authorizing marketing of the new tobacco product. A marketing authorization order becomes effective on the date the order is issued.
§ 1107.48
Issuance of an order denying marketing authorization.
(a)
General.
FDA will issue an order that the new tobacco product cannot be marketed if FDA finds that:
(1) The information submitted in the SE Report does not establish that the new tobacco product is substantially equivalent to a predicate tobacco product that was commercially marketed (other than for test marketing) in the United States on February 15, 2007; or
(2) The new tobacco product is not in compliance with the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.
(b)
Basis for order.
The order will describe the basis for denying marketing authorization.
§ 1107.50
Rescission of order.
(a)
Grounds for rescinding a substantially equivalent order.
FDA may rescind a substantially equivalent order allowing a new tobacco product to be marketed if FDA determines that:
(1) The tobacco product for which the order has been issued:
(i) Does not have the same characteristics as the predicate tobacco product; or
(ii) Has different characteristics and there is insufficient information demonstrating that it is not appropriate to require a premarket tobacco product application under section 910(b) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act because the product does not raise different questions of public health; or
(2) The SE Report (including any submitted amendments) contains an untrue statement of material fact; or
(3) Concerning an SE Report that compared the new tobacco product to a tobacco product that FDA previously found substantially equivalent,
(i) The predicate tobacco product relied on in the SE Report has been found ineligible because its SE Report (including any amendments) contains an untrue statement of material fact; or
(ii) A predicate tobacco product on which any of the previous substantial equivalence determinations was based, going back to the original predicate tobacco product, has been found ineligible because its SE Report (including any amendments) contains an untrue statement of material fact; or
(4) FDA or the applicant has removed from the market, due to a health or safety concern related to the tobacco product:
(i) The predicate tobacco product on which the substantial equivalence determination is based; or
(ii) A predicate tobacco product on which any of the previous substantial equivalence determinations is based, going back to the original predicate tobacco product, if the substantial equivalence SE Report compared the new tobacco product to a tobacco product that FDA previously found substantially equivalent.
(b)

# Subpart C—FDA Review
§ 1114.25
Communication between FDA and applicants.
During the course of reviewing an application, FDA may communicate with an applicant about relevant matters, including scientific, medical, and procedural issues that arise during the review process and inspections.

§ 1114.27
Review procedure.
(a)
Acceptance review.
(1) After an applicant submits a PMTA, FDA will perform an initial review of the PMTA to determine whether it may be accepted for further review. FDA may refuse to accept an application that:
(i) Does not comply with the applicable format requirements in § 1114.7(b), § 1114.15, or § 1114.17 (as applicable);
(ii) Is not administratively complete because it does not appear to contain the information required by § 1114.7 (excluding product samples), § 1114.15 or § 1114.17, as applicable;
(iii) Does not pertain to a tobacco product subject to chapter IX of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (as required by § 1105.10 of this chapter); or
(iv) FDA can otherwise refuse to accept under § 1105.10.
(2) If FDA accepts an application for further review, FDA will issue an acknowledgement letter to the applicant that specifies the PMTA STN. If FDA determines that it will require product samples as part of the PMTA, it will send instructions on how and where to submit product samples, as described in § 1114.7(e) of this chapter.
(3) If FDA refuses to accept an application, FDA will issue a letter to the applicant identifying the deficiencies, where practicable, that prevented FDA from accepting the application.

(i) The PMTA does not contain sufficient information required by section 910(b)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and by § 1114.7, § 1114.15, or § 1114.17, as applicable, to permit a substantive review of the application;
(ii) The application does not contain any substantive information, including information from published literature or bridged from an investigation of another tobacco product, regarding each of the following topics.
(A) The health risks of the new tobacco product as described in either § 1114.7(k)(1)(i)(A), (B), or (C));
(B) The health risks of the new tobacco product compared to the health risks generally presented by products in the same product category as well as products in at least one different category that are used by the consumers an applicant expects will use its new tobacco product (as described in a portion of § 1114.7(k)(1)(i)(D)).
(C) The abuse liability of the new tobacco product (as set forth in § 1114.7(k)(1)(ii)(A));
(D) How consumers would be expected to actually use the product, such as use frequency, use trends over time, and how such use affects the health risks of the product to individual users (as described in § 1114.7(k)(1)(ii)(B));
(E) The potential impact that the marketing of the new tobacco product would have on the likelihood that current tobacco product users would change their tobacco product use behavior, such as starting to using the new tobacco product, using the product in conjunction with other tobacco products, or, after using the product, switching to or switch back to other tobacco products that may present increased risks to individual health (
i.e.,
any of the information set forth in either § 1114.7(k)(1)(ii)(C), (D), (E), or (F));
(F) The impact of the tobacco product and its label, labeling, or advertising, to the extent that advertising has been studied, on tobacco product use behavior of current nonusers of tobacco products (
i.e.,
any of the information described in § 1114.7(k)(1)(iii));
(G) The impact of the product and its label, labeling, or advertising, to the extent that advertising has been studied, on individuals' perception of the product and their use intentions (
i.e.,
any of the information described in § 1114.7(k)(1)(iv)); and
(H) The ways in which human factors can affect the health risks of the new tobacco product (

(3) If FDA files an application, FDA will issue a filing letter to the applicant.
(c)
Application review.
(1) Except as described in this paragraph and § 1114.9(b), within 180 days of receipt of an application described in section 910(b)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act meeting the filing requirements set out in 1114.27(b), FDA will complete its review of the PMTA and act on the application.
(2) FDA will begin substantive review of the application after it is filed under paragraph (b) of this section. FDA may communicate with the applicant as set
forth under § 1114.25 to seek additional or clarifying information.
(3) FDA may refer the PMTA or portions of the PMTA, upon its own initiative or applicant request, to TPSAC for reference and for the submission of a report and recommendation respecting the application, together with all underlying data and the reasons or basis for the recommendation.

(b)
Adjustments.
Annually, FDA will make any necessary adjustments to individual domestic manufacturer or importer assessments if needed to account for any corrections (for example, to include domestic manufacturers or importers that were not included in a relevant assessment calculation).

§ 1230.46
Violation.
(a) If a violation of the Federal Caustic Poison Act is disclosed, the chief of the district shall send to the importer due notice of the nature of the violation and of the time and place where evidence may be presented, showing that the containers should not be refused admission. At the same time similar notice regarding detention of the containers shall be sent to the District Director of Customs, requesting him to refuse delivery thereof or to require their return to customs custody if by any chance the containers were released without the bond referred to in § 1230.41. The time allowed the importer for representations regarding the shipment may be extended at his request for a reasonable period to permit him to secure such evidence.
(b) If the importer does not reply to the notice of hearing in person or by letter within the time allowed on the notice, a second notice, marked “second and last notice,” shall be sent at once by the chief of the district, advising him that failure to reply will cause definite recommendation to the District Director of Customs that the containers be refused admission and that the containers be exported within 3 months under customs supervision.
§ 1230.47
Rejected containers.
(a) In all cases where the containers are to be refused admission, the chief of the district within 1 day after hearing, or, if the importer does not appear or reply within 3 days after second notice, shall notify the District Director of Customs in duplicate accordingly.
(b) Not later than 1 day after receipt of this notice the District Director of Customs shall sign and transmit to the importer one of the copies, which shall serve as notification to the importer that the containers must be exported under customs supervision within 3 months from such date, as provided by law; the other notice shall be retained as office record and later returned as a report to the chief of the district. In all cases the importer shall return his notice to the District Director of Customs, properly certified as to the information required, as the form provides.
§ 1230.48
Relabeling of containers.
(a) If containers are to be released after relabeling, a notice shall be sent by the chief of district direct to the importer, a carbon copy being sent to the
District Director of Customs. This notice must state specifically the conditions to be performed, so as to bring the performance thereof under the provisions of the customs bonds on consumption and warehouse entries, these bonds including provisions requiring compliance with all of the requirements of the Federal Caustic Poison Act and all regulations and instructions issued thereunder. The notice will also state the officer to be notified by the importer when the containers are ready for inspection.
(b) The importer must return the notice to the District Director of Customs or chief of district, as designated, with the certificate thereon filled out, stating that he has complied with the prescribed conditions and that the containers are ready for inspection at the place named.
(c) This notice will be delivered to the inspection officer, who, after inspection, will endorse the result thereof on the back of the notice and return the same to the District Director of Customs or to the chief of district, as the case may be.
(d) When the conditions to be complied with are under the supervision of the chief of district, and these conditions have been fully met, he shall release the containers to the importer, sending a copy of the notice of release to the District Director of Customs for his information. If the containers have not been properly relabeled within the period allowed, the chief of district shall immediately give notice in duplicate to the District Director of Customs of the results of inspection. The District Director of Customs shall sign and immediately transmit one copy of the notice to the importer and proceed in the usual manner.
(e) If the containers are detained subject to relabeling to be performed under the supervision of the District Director of Customs, the District Director of Customs, as soon as relabeling is accomplished, will notify the importer that the containers are released.
(f) If the containers have not been properly relabeled within the period allowed, their sale after labeling as required by the act or other disposition must be effected by the District Director of Customs.
(g) When the final action has been taken on containers which have been refused admission, sold, or otherwise disposed of as provided for by the act or which have been relabeled under the supervision of the District Director of Customs, he shall send to the chief of district a notice of such final action, giving the date and disposition.
(h) When relabeling is allowed the importer must furnish satisfactory evidence as to the identity of the containers before release is given. The relabeling must be done at a stated place and apart from other containers of a similar nature.
(i) When containers are shipped to another port for relabeling or exportation, they must be shipped under customs carrier's manifest, in the same manner as shipments in bond.
(j) District Directors of Customs will perform the inspection service whenever containers are to be exported, sold, or otherwise disposed of, and in other cases when there is no officer of the district available.
(k) District Directors of Customs and representatives of the district will confer and arrange the apportionment of the inspection service according to local conditions. Officers of the district will, whenever feasible, perform the inspection service in connection with relabeling.
§ 1230.49
Penalties.
(a) In case of failure to comply with the instructions or recommendations of the chief of district as to conditions under which containers may be disposed of, the District Director of Customs shall notify the chief of district in all cases coming to his attention within 3 days after inspection or after the expiration of the 3 months allowed by law if no action is taken.
(b) The chief of district, upon receipt of the above-described notice, and in all cases of failure to meet the conditions imposed in order to comply with the provisions of the Federal Caustic Poison Act coming directly under his supervision, shall transmit to the District Director of Customs such evidence as he may have at hand tending
to indicate the importer's liability and make a recommendation accordingly.
(c) The District Director of Customs, within 3 days of the receipt of this recommendation, whether favorable or otherwise, shall notify the importer that, the legal period of 3 months for exportation or relabeling having expired, action will be taken within 30 days to enforce the terms of the bond.

§ 1271.75
How do I screen a donor?
(a)
All donors.
Except as provided under § 1271.90, if you are the establishment that performs donor screening, you must screen a donor of cells or tissue by reviewing the donor's relevant medical records for:
(1) Risk factors for, and clinical evidence of, relevant communicable disease agents and diseases, including:
(i) Human immunodeficiency virus;
(ii) Hepatitis B virus;
(iii) Hepatitis C virus;
(iv) Human transmissible spongiform encephalopathy, including Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease;
(v)
Treponema pallidum
; and
(2) Communicable disease risks associated with xenotransplantation.
(b)
Donors of viable, leukocyte-rich cells or tissue.
In addition to the relevant communicable disease agents and diseases for which screening is required under paragraph (a) of this section, and except as provided under § 1271.90, you must screen the donor of viable, leukocyte-rich cells or tissue by reviewing the donor's relevant medical records for risk factors for and clinical evidence of relevant cell-associated communicable disease agents and diseases, including Human T-lymphotropic virus.
(c)
Donors of reproductive cells or tissue.
In addition to the relevant communicable disease agents and diseases for which screening is required under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, as applicable, and except as provided under § 1271.90, you must screen the donor of reproductive cells or tissue by reviewing the donor's relevant medical records for risk factors for and clinical evidence of infection due to relevant communicable diseases of the genitourinary tract. Such screening must include screening for the communicable disease agents listed in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section. However, if the reproductive cells or tissues are recovered by a method that ensures freedom from contamination of the cells or tissue by infectious disease organisms that may be present in the genitourinary tract, then screening for the communicable disease agents listed
in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section is not required. Communicable disease agents of the genitourinary tract for which you must screen include:
(1)
Chlamydia trachomatis
; and
(2)
Neisseria gonorrhea.
(d)
Ineligible donors.
You must determine ineligible a donor who is identified as having either of the following:
(1) A risk factor for or clinical evidence of any of the relevant communicable disease agents or diseases for which screening is required under paragraphs (a)(1), (b), or (c) of this section; or
(2) Any communicable disease risk associated with xenotransplantation.
(e)
Abbreviated procedure for repeat donors.
If you have performed a complete donor screening procedure on a living donor within the previous 6 months, you may use an abbreviated donor screening procedure on repeat donations. The abbreviated procedure must determine and document any changes in the donor's medical history since the previous donation that would make the donor ineligible, including relevant social behavior.

§ 1271.80
What are the general requirements for donor testing?
(a)
Testing for relevant communicable diseases is required.
To adequately and appropriately reduce the risk of transmission of relevant communicable diseases, and except as provided under § 1271.90, if you are the establishment that performs donor testing, you must test a donor specimen for evidence of infection due to communicable disease agents in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section. You must test for those communicable disease agents specified in § 1271.85. In the case of a donor 1 month of age or younger, you must test a specimen from the birth mother instead of a specimen from the donor.
(b)
Timing of specimen collection.
You must collect the donor specimen for testing at the time of recovery of cells or tissue from the donor; or up to 7 days before or after recovery, except:
(1) For donors of peripheral blood stem/progenitor cells, bone marrow (if not excepted under § 1271.3(d)(4)), or oocytes, you may collect the donor specimen for testing up to 30 days before recovery; or
(2) In the case of a repeat semen donor from whom a specimen has already been collected and tested, and for whom retesting is required under § 1271.85(d), you are not required to collect a donor specimen at the time of each donation.
(c)
Tests.
You must test using appropriate FDA-licensed, approved, or cleared donor screening tests, in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions, to adequately and appropriately reduce the risk of transmission of relevant communicable disease agents or diseases; however, until such time as appropriate FDA-licensed, approved, or cleared donor screening tests for
Chlamydia trachomatis
and for
Neisseria gonorrhea
are available, you must use FDA-licensed, approved, or cleared tests labeled for the detection of those organisms in an asymptomatic, low-prevalence population. You must use a test specifically labeled for cadaveric specimens instead of a more generally labeled test when applicable and when available. Required testing under this section must be performed by a laboratory that either is certified to perform such testing on human specimens under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (42 U.S.C. 263a) and 42 CFR part 493, or has met equivalent requirements as determined by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.
(d)
Ineligible donors.
You must determine the following donors to be ineligible:
(1) A donor whose specimen tests reactive on a screening test for a communicable disease agent in accordance with § 1271.85, except for a donor whose specimen tests reactive on a non-treponemal screening test for syphilis and negative on a specific treponemal confirmatory test;
(2)(i) A donor in whom plasma dilution sufficient to affect the results of communicable disease testing is suspected, unless:
(A) You test a specimen taken from the donor before transfusion or infusion and up to 7 days before recovery of cells or tissue; or
(B) You use an appropriate algorithm designed to evaluate volumes administered in the 48 hours before specimen collection, and the algorithm shows that plasma dilution sufficient to affect the results of communicable disease testing has not occurred.
(ii) Clinical situations in which you must suspect plasma dilution sufficient to affect the results of communicable disease testing include but are not limited to the following:
(A) Blood loss is known or suspected in a donor over 12 years of age, and the donor has received a transfusion or infusion of any of the following, alone or in combination:
(
1
) More than 2,000 milliliters (mL) of blood (e.g., whole blood, red blood cells) or colloids within 48 hours before death or specimen collection, whichever occurred earlier, or
(
2
) More than 2,000 mL of crystalloids within 1 hour before death or specimen collection, whichever occurred earlier.
(B) Regardless of the presence or absence of blood loss, the donor is 12 years of age or younger and has received a transfusion or infusion of any amount of any of the following, alone or in combination:
(
1
) Blood (e.g., whole blood, red blood cells) or colloids within 48 hours before death or specimen collection, whichever occurred earlier, or
(
2
) Crystalloids within 1 hour before death or specimen collection, whichever occurred earlier.

# Subpart D—Current Good Tissue Practice

# Source:
69 FR 68681, Nov. 24, 2004, unless otherwise noted.
§ 1271.145
Prevention of the introduction, transmission, or spread of communicable diseases.
You must recover, process, store, label, package, and distribute HCT/Ps, and screen and test cell and tissue donors, in a way that prevents the introduction, transmission, or spread of communicable diseases.
§ 1271.150
Current good tissue practice requirements.
(a)
General.
This subpart D and subpart C of this part set forth current good tissue practice (CGTP) requirements. You must follow CGTP requirements to prevent the introduction, transmission, or spread of communicable diseases by HCT/Ps (e.g., by ensuring that the HCT/Ps do not contain communicable disease agents, that they are not contaminated, and that they do not become contaminated during manufacturing). Communicable diseases include, but are not limited to, those transmitted by viruses, bacteria, fungi, parasites, and transmissible spongiform encephalopathy agents. CGTP requirements govern the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture of HCT/Ps, including but not limited to all steps in recovery, donor screening, donor testing, processing, storage, labeling, packaging, and distribution. The CGTP provisions specifically governing determinations of donor eligibility, including donor screening and testing, are set out separately in subpart C of this part.
(b)
Core CGTP requirements.
The following are core CGTP requirements:
(1) Requirements relating to facilities in § 1271.190(a) and (b);
(2) Requirements relating to environmental control in § 1271.195(a);
(3) Requirements relating to equipment in § 1271.200(a);
(4) Requirements relating to supplies and reagents in § 1271.210(a) and (b);
(5) Requirements relating to recovery in § 1271.215;
(6) Requirements relating to processing and process controls in § 1271.220;
(7) Requirements relating to labeling controls in § 1271.250(a) and (b);
(8) Requirements relating to storage in § 1271.260 (a) through (d);
(9) Requirements relating to receipt, predistribution shipment, and distribution of an HCT/P in § 1271.265(a) through (d); and
(10) Requirements relating to donor eligibility determinations, donor screening, and donor testing in §§ 1271.50, 1271.75, 1271.80, and 1271.85.
(c)
Compliance with applicable requirements
—(1)
Manufacturing arrangements
(i) If you are an establishment that engages in only some operations subject to the regulations in this subpart and subpart C of this part, and not others, then you need only comply with those requirements applicable to the operations that you perform.
(ii) If you engage another establishment (e.g., a laboratory to perform communicable disease testing, or an irradiation facility to perform terminal sterilization), under a contract, agreement, or other arrangement, to perform any step in manufacture for you, that establishment is responsible for complying with requirements applicable to that manufacturing step.
(iii) Before entering into a contract, agreement, or other arrangement with another establishment to perform any step in manufacture for you, you must ensure that the establishment complies with applicable CGTP requirements. If, during the course of this contract, agreement, or other arrangement, you become aware of information suggesting that the establishment may no longer be in compliance with such requirements, you must take reasonable steps to ensure the establishment complies with those requirements. If you determine that the establishment is
not in compliance with those requirements, you must terminate your contract, agreement, or other arrangement with the establishment.
(2) If you are the establishment that determines that an HCT/P meets all release criteria and makes the HCT/P available for distribution, whether or not you are the actual distributor, you are responsible for reviewing manufacturing and tracking records to determine that the HCT/P has been manufactured and tracked in compliance with the requirements of this subpart and subpart C of this part and any other applicable requirements.
(3) With the exception of §§ 1271.150(c) and 1271.155 of this subpart, the regulations in this subpart are not being implemented for reproductive HCT/Ps described in § 1271.10 and regulated solely under section 361 of the Public Health Service Act and the regulations in this part, or for the establishments that manufacture them.
(d)
Compliance with parts 210, 211, and 820 of this chapter.
