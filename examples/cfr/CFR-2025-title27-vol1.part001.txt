It is unlawful for an industry member, directly or indirectly or through an affiliate, to induce a trade buyer to purchase the industry member's products, to the complete or partial exclusion of products sold or offered for sale by other persons in interstate or foreign commerce, by offering or giving a bonus, premium, compensation, or other thing of value to any officer, employee, or representative of the trade buyer. The bonus, premium, compensation, or other thing of value need not
be offered or given for the purpose of directly inducing a trade buyer to purchase from the seller, but rather is applicable if an industry member induces officers, employees or representatives of the trade buyer to promote sales of the industry member's products and thereby indirectly induces the trade buyer to purchase from the industry member.
§ 10.22
Employee associations.
Gifts, donations, and other payments such as for advertising in publications, by an industry member, to trade buyer employee associations are considered the same as bonuses, premiums, compensation, or other things of value given directly to the employees, since the benefits resulting from the gifts or payments flow to the individual members of the association.
§ 10.23
Gifts or payments to wholesalers.
Although industry members are not prohibited from offering or giving money or other things of value to a wholesale entity (
i.e.
, the corporation, partnership, or individual who owns the business), the wholesaler will be considered as acting as a mere conduit between its officers, employees, or representatives and the industry member, if:
(a) There is an agreement or understanding, implied or explicit, that the money or thing of value will be passed on to the officers, employees, or representatives, or
(b) It is obvious by the very nature of the item given (such as a free trip) that a pass through to the officers, employees, or representatives is clearly contemplated, or
(c) The records of the recipient wholesaler do not accurately reflect such money or item as an asset or the wholesale entity, thus being subject to all ensuing tax consequences as distinguished from the receipt of the money or item as a personal asset of an officer, employee, or representative.
§ 10.24
Sales promotion contests.
Sales contests sponsored by an industry member which offer prizes directly or indirectly to trade buyer officers, employees or representatives are inducements within the meaning of the Act.

# Subpart D—Exclusion

# Source:
T.D. ATF-364, 60 FR 20427, Apr. 26, 1995, unless otherwise noted.
§ 10.51
Exclusion, in general.
(a) Exclusion, in whole or in part occurs:
(1) When a practice by an industry member, whether direct, indirect, or through an affiliate, places (or has the potential to place) trade buyer independence at risk by means of a tie or link between the industry member and trade buyer or by any other means of industry member control over the trade buyer, and
(2) Such practice results in the trade buyer purchasing less than it would have of a competitor's product.
(b) Section 10.52 lists practices that create a tie or link that places trade buyer independence at risk. Section 10.53 is reserved and will list practices not resulting in exclusion. Section 10.54 lists the criteria used for determining whether other practices can put trade buyer independence at risk.
§ 10.52
Practice which puts trade buyer independence at risk.
The practice specified in this section is deemed to place trade buyer independence at risk within the description of exclusion in § 10.51: Industry member payments of money to the employee(s) of a trade buyer without the knowledge or consent of the trade buyer-employer in return for the employee agreeing to order distilled spirits, wine, or malt beverages from the industry member. The practice enumerated here is an example and does not constitute a complete list of those situations which result in such control.
§ 10.53
Practices not resulting in exclusion. [Reserved]
§ 10.54
Criteria for determining trade buyer independence.
The criteria specified in this section are indications that a particular practice between an industry member and an officer, employee, or representative of a trade buyer, other than those in
§ 10.52, places trade buyer independence at risk. A practice need not meet all of the criteria specified in this section in order to place trade buyer independence at risk.
(a) The practice restricts or hampers the free economic choice of a trade buyer to decide which products to purchase or the quantity in which to purchase them for sale to retailers and consumers.
(b) The industry member obligates the trade buyer to participate in the promotion to obtain the industry member's product.
(c) The trade buyer has a continuing obligation to purchase or otherwise promote the industry member's product.
(d) The trade buyer has a commitment not to terminate its relationship with the industry member with respect to purchase of the industry member's products.
(e) The practice involves the industry member in the day-to-day operations of the trade buyer. For example, the industry member controls the trade buyer's decisions on which brand of products to purchase, the pricing of products, or the manner in which the products will be displayed on the trade buyer's premises.
(f) The practice is discriminatory in that it is not offered to all trade buyers in the local market on the same terms without business reasons present to justify the difference in treatment.

It is unlawful for an industry member to sell, offer for sale, or contract to sell to any trade buyer, or for any such trade buyer to purchase, offer to purchase, or contract to purchase any products (a) on consignment; or (b) under conditional sale; or (c) with the privilege of return; or (d) on any basis other than a bona fide sale; or (e) if any part of the sale involves, directly or indirectly, the acquisition by such person of other products from the trade buyer or the agreement to acquire other products from the trade buyer. Transactions involving the bona fide return of products for ordinary and usual commercial reasons arising after the product has been sold are not prohibited.
§ 11.22

(b)
Exchange.
The exchange of one product for another is prohibited as a sales transaction conditioned on the acquisition of other products. However, the exchange of a product for equal quantities (case for case) of the same type and brand of product, in containers of another size is not considered an acquisition of “other” products and is not prohibited if there was no direct or implied privilege of return extended when the product was originally sold. Industry members may make price adjustments on products eligible for exchange under this paragraph.

Other than a bona fide sale.
“Other than a bona fide sale” includes, but is not limited to, sales in connection with which the industry member purchases or rents the display, shelf, storage or warehouse space to be occupied by such products at premises owned or controlled by the retailer.

(b) An industry member is under no obligation to accept the return of products for the reasons listed in §§ 11.32 through 11.39.

# Exchanges and Returns for Ordinary and Usual Commercial Reasons
§ 11.32
Defective products.
Products which are unmarketable because of product deterioration, leaking containers, damaged labels or missing or mutilated tamper evident closures may be exchanged for an equal quantity of identical products or may be returned for cash or credit against outstanding indebtedness.
[T.D. ATF-364, 60 FR 20427, Apr. 26, 1995]
§ 11.33
Error in products delivered.
Any discrepancy between products ordered and products delivered may be corrected, within a reasonable period after delivery, by exchange of the products delivered for those which were ordered, or by a return for cash or credit against outstanding indebtedness.
§ 11.34
Products which may no longer be lawfully sold.
Products which may no longer be lawfully sold may be returned for cash or credit against outstanding indebtedness. This would include situations where, due to a change in regulation or administrative procedure over which the trade buyer or an affiliate of the trade buyer has no control, a particular size or brand is no longer permitted to be sold.
[T.D. ATF-364, 60 FR 20428, Apr. 26, 1995]

§ 11.39
Seasonal dealers.
Industry members may accept the return of products from retail dealers who are only open a portion of the year, if the products are likely to spoil during the off season. These returns will be for cash or for credit against outstanding indebtedness.

# Exchanges and Returns for Reasons Not Considered Ordinary and Usual
§ 11.45
Overstocked and slow-moving products.
The return or exchange of a product because it is overstocked or slow-moving does not constitute a return for “ordinary and usual commercial reasons.”

(2)

(b)
Use of certificate during period of appeal.
If a certificate holder files a timely appeal after receipt of a decision to revoke a certificate pursuant to § 13.44, the holder may continue to use the certificate at issue until the effective date of a final decision issued by the appropriate TTB officer.

Surrender of certificates.
On the effective date of a final decision that has been issued to revoke a certificate of label approval, certificate of exemption from label approval, or distinctive liquor bottle approval, the certificate holder must surrender the original of the certificate to TTB for manual cancellation. Regardless of whether the original certificate of label approval, certificate of exemption from label approval, or distinctive liquor bottle approval has been manually canceled or not, the certificate is null and void after the effective date of the revocation. It is a violation of this section for any certificate holder to present a certificate of label approval, certificate of exemption from label approval, or distinctive liquor bottle approval to an official of the United States Government as a valid certificate after the effective date of the revocation of the certificate if the certificate holder has been previously notified that such certificate has been revoked by TTB.

In the absence of proof of receipt, the date the document is logged in by TTB will be considered the date of receipt.
§ 13.76
Service on applicant or certificate holder.
(a)
Method of service.
TTB must serve notices of denial on an applicant by first class mail, or by personal delivery. TTB must serve notices of proposed revocation and notices of revocation on a certificate holder by certified mail, return receipt requested, by a commercial delivery service that will provide an equivalent written acknowledgment from the recipient, or by personal delivery.
(b)
Date of receipt.

Strengthening bonds.
Whenever the amount of a bond on file and in effect becomes insufficient, the principal may give a strengthening bond in a sufficient amount, provided the surety is the same as on the bond already on file and in effect; otherwise
a superseding bond covering the entire liability shall be filed. Strengthening bonds, filed to increase the bond liability of the surety, shall not be construed in any sense to be substitute bonds, and the appropriate TTB officer shall not approve a strengthening bond containing any notation which may be interpreted as a release of any former bond or as limiting the amount of either bond to less than its full amount.
§ 17.108
Superseding bonds.
(a) The principal on any bond filed pursuant to this part may at any time replace it with a superseding bond.
(b) Executors, administrators, assignees, receivers, trustees, or other persons acting in a fiduciary capacity continuing or liquidating the business of the principal, shall execute and file a superseding bond or obtain the consent of the surety or sureties on the existing bond or bonds.

A superseding bond shall be filed immediately in case of the insolvency of the surety. If a bond is found to be not acceptable or for any reason becomes invalid or of no effect, the principal shall immediately file a satisfactory superseding bond.
(d) A bond filed under this section to supersede an existing bond shall be marked by the obligors at the time of execution, “Superseding Bond.” When such a bond is approved, the superseded bond shall be released as to transactions occurring wholly subsequent to the effective date of the superseding bond, and notice of termination of the superseded bond shall be issued, as provided in § 17.111.

# Termination of Bonds
§ 17.111

(b) However, the bond shall not be terminated until all outstanding liability under it has been discharged. Upon termination, the appropriate TTB officer shall mark the bond “canceled,” followed by the date of cancellation, and shall issue a notice of termination of bond. A copy of this notice shall be given to the principal and to each surety.
§ 17.112
Notice by surety of termination of bond.
A surety on any bond required by this part may at any time, in writing, notify the principal and the appropriate TTB officer in whose office the bond is on file that the surety desires, after a date named, to be relieved of liability under the bond. Unless the notice is withdrawn, in writing, before the date named in it, the notice shall take effect on that date. The date shall not be less than 60 days after the date on which both the notice and proof of service on the principal have been received by the appropriate TTB officer. The surety shall deliver one copy of the notice to the principal and the original to the appropriate TTB officer. The surety shall also file with the appropriate TTB officer an acknowledgment or other proof of service on the principal.
§ 17.113
Extent of release of surety from liability under bond.

§ 17.114
Release of collateral.
The release of collateral security pledged and deposited to satisfy the bond requirement of this part is governed by the provisions of 31 CFR part
225. When the appropriate TTB officer determines that there is no outstanding liability under the bond, and is satisfied that the interests of the Government will not be jeopardized, the security shall be released and returned to the principal.

Filing.
Formulas shall be filed on TTB Form 5154.1, Formula and Process for Nonbeverage Products. Filing shall be accomplished no later than 6 months after the end of the quarter in which taxpaid distilled spirits were first used to manufacture the product for purposes of drawback. If a product's formula is disapproved, no drawback shall be allowed on spirits used to manufacture that product, unless it is later used as an intermediate product, as provided in § 17.137.
(c)
Numbering.
The formulas shall be serially numbered by the manufacturer, commencing with number 1 and continuing thereafter in numerical sequence. However, a new formula for use at several plants shall be given the highest number next in sequence at any of those plants. The numbers that were skipped at the other plants shall not be used subsequently.
(d)
Distribution and retention of approved formulas.
One copy of each approved Form 5154.1 shall be returned to the manufacturer. The formulas returned to manufacturers shall be kept in serial order at the place of manufacture, as provided in § 17.170, and shall be made available to appropriate TTB officers for examination in the investigation of drawback claims.
[T.D. ATF-379, 61 FR 31412, June 20, 1996, as amended by T.D. ATF-436, 66 FR 5471, Jan. 19, 2001]
§ 17.122

Except as provided in this section, amended or revised formulas are considered to be new formulas and shall be numbered accordingly. Minor changes may be made to a current formula on TTB Form 5154.1 with retention of the original formula number, if approval is obtained from the appropriate TTB officer. In order to obtain approval to make a minor formula change, the person holding the Form 5154.1 shall submit a letter of application to the appropriate TTB officer, indicating the formula change and requesting that the proposed change be considered a minor change. Each such application shall clearly identify the original formula by number, date of approval, and name of product. The application shall indicate whether the product is, has been, or will be used in alcoholic beverages, and shall specify whether the proposed change is intended as a substitution or merely as an alternative for the original formula. No changes may be made to current formulas without specific TTB approval in each case.
[T.D. ATF-379, 61 FR 31412, June 20, 1996, as amended by T.D. ATF-436, 66 FR 5471, Jan. 19, 2001]
§ 17.123
Statement of process.
Any person claiming drawback under the regulations in this part may be required, at any time, to file a statement of process, in addition to that required by TTB Form 5154.1, as well as any other data necessary for consideration of the claim for drawback. When pertinent to consideration of the claim, submission of copies of the commercial labels used on the finished products may also be required.
§ 17.124
Samples.
Any person claiming drawback or submitting a formula for approval under the regulations in this part may be required, at any time, to submit a sample of each nonbeverage or intermediate product for analysis. If the
product is manufactured with a mixture of oil or other ingredients, the composition of which is unknown to the claimant, a 1-ounce sample of the mixture shall be submitted with the sample of finished product when so required.
§ 17.125
Adoption of formulas and processes.
(a)
Adoption of predecessor's formulas.
If there is a change in the proprietorship of a nonbeverage plant and the successor desires to use the predecessor's formulas at the same location, the successor may, in lieu of submitting new formulas in its own name, adopt any or all of the formulas of the predecessor by filing a notice of adoption with the appropriate TTB officer. The notice shall be filed with the first claim relating to any of the adopted formulas. The notice shall list, by name and serial number, all formulas to be adopted, and shall state that the products will be manufactured in accordance with the adopted formulas and processes. The notice shall be accompanied by a certified copy of the articles of incorporation or other document(s) necessary to prove the transfer of ownership. The manufacturer shall retain a copy of the notice with the related formulas.
(b)
Adoption of manufacturer's own formulas from a different location.
A manufacturer's own formulas may be adopted for use at another of the manufacturer's plants. Further, a wholly owned subsidiary may adopt the formulas of the parent company, and vice versa. A letterhead notice must be filed with the appropriate TTB officer and be accompanied by two photocopies of each formula to be adopted. The notice shall list the numbers of all formulas to be adopted and shall indicate the plant where each was originally approved and the plant(s) where each is to be adopted. Some evidence of the relationship between the plants involved in the adoption shall be attached to the notice. The notice shall be referenced in Part IV of the supporting data (TTB Form 5154.2) filed with the first claim relating to the adopted formula(s).
[T.D. ATF-379, 61 FR 31412, June 20, 1996, as amended by T.D. ATF-436, 66 FR 5471, Jan. 19, 2001]
§ 17.126
Formulas for intermediate products.
(a) The manufacturer shall submit a formula on TTB Form 5154.1 for each self-manufactured ingredient made with taxpaid spirits and intended for the manufacturer's own use in nonbeverage products, unless the formula for any such ingredient is fully expressed as part of the approved formula for each nonbeverage product in which that ingredient is used, or unless the formula for the ingredient is contained in one of the pharmaceutical publications listed in § 17.132.
(b) Upon receipt of Form 5154.1 covering a self-manufactured ingredient made with taxpaid spirits, the formula shall be examined under § 17.131. If the formula is approved for drawback, the ingredient shall be treated as a finished nonbeverage product for purposes of this part, rather than as an intermediate product, notwithstanding its use by the manufacturer. (For example, see § 17.152(d).) If the formula is disapproved for drawback, the ingredient may be treated as an intermediate product in accordance with this part. Requirements pertaining to intermediate products are found in § 17.185(b).
(c) If there is a change in the composition of an intermediate product, the manufacturer shall submit an amended or revised formula, as provided in § 17.122.
§ 17.127
Self-manufactured ingredients treated optionally as unfinished nonbeverage products.
A self-manufactured ingredient made with taxpaid spirits, which otherwise would be treated as an intermediate product, may instead be treated as an unfinished nonbeverage product, if the ingredient's formula is fully expressed as a part of the approved formula for the nonbeverage product in which the ingredient will be used. A manufacturer desiring to change the treatment of an ingredient from “intermediate product” to “unfinished nonbeverage product” (or vice versa) may do so by resubmitting the applicable formula(s) on TTB Form 5154.1. Requirements pertaining to unfinished nonbeverage products are found in § 17.185(c).

# Approval of Formulas
§ 17.131
Formulas on TTB Form 5154.1.
Upon receipt, formulas on TTB Form 5154.1 shall be examined and, if found to be medicines, medicinal preparations, food products, flavors, flavoring extracts, or perfume which are unfit for beverage purposes and which otherwise meet the requirements of law and this part, they shall be approved for drawback. If the formulas do not meet the requirements of the law and regulations for drawback products, they shall be disapproved.
§ 17.132
U.S.P., N.F., and H.P.U.S. preparations.
(a)
General.
Except as otherwise provided by paragraph (b) of this section or by TTB ruling, formulas for compounds in which alcohol is a prescribed quantitative ingredient, which are stated in the current revisions or editions of the United States Pharmacopoeia (U.S.P.), the National Formulary (N.F.), or the Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia of the United States (H.P.U.S.), shall be considered as approved formulas and may be used as formulas for drawback products without the filing of TTB Form 5154.1.
(b)
Exceptions.
Alcohol (including dehydrated alcohol and dehydrated alcohol injection), U.S.P.; alcohol and dextrose injection, U.S.P.; and tincture of ginger, H.P.U.S., have been found to be fit for beverage use and are disapproved for drawback. All attenuations of other H.P.U.S. products diluted beyond one part in 10,000 (“4 × ”) are also disapproved for drawback, unless the manufacturer receives approval for a formula submitted on Form 5154.1 in accordance with this subpart. The formula for such attenuations shall be submitted with a sample of the product and a statement explaining why it should be classified as unfit for beverage use.
§ 17.133
Food product formulas.
Formulas for nonbeverage food products on TTB Form 5154.1 may be approved if they are unfit for beverage purposes. Approval does not authorize manufacture or sale contrary to State law. Examples of food products that have been found to be unfit for beverage purposes are stated below:
(a)
Sauces or syrups.
Sauces, or syrups consisting of sugar solutions and distilled spirits, in which the alcohol content is not more than 12 percent by volume and the sugar content is not less than 60 grams per 100 cubic centimeters.
(b)
Brandied fruits.
Brandied fruits consisting of solidly packaged fruits, either whole or segmented, and distilled spirits products not exceeding the quantity and alcohol content necessary for flavoring and preserving. Generally, brandied fruits will be considered to have met these standards if the container is well filled, the alcohol in the liquid portion does not exceed 23 percent by volume, and the liquid portion does not exceed 45 percent of the volume of the container.
(c)
Candies.
Candies with alcoholic fillings, if the fillings meet the standards prescribed for sauces and syrups by paragraph (a) of this section.
(d)
Other food products.
Food products such as mincemeat, plum pudding, and fruit cake, where only sufficient distilled spirits are used for flavoring and preserving; and ice cream and ices where only sufficient spirits are used for flavoring purposes. Also food adjuncts, such as preservatives, emulsifying agents, and food colorings, that are unfit for beverage purposes and are manufactured and used, or sold for use, in food.
§ 17.134
Determination of unfitness for beverage purposes.
The appropriate TTB officer has responsibility for determining whether products are fit or unfit for beverage purposes within the meaning of 26 U.S.C. 5111. This determination may be based either on the content and description of the ingredients as shown on TTB Form 5154.1, or on organoleptic examination. In such examination, samples of products may be diluted with water to an alcoholic concentration of 15% and tasted. Sale or use for beverage purposes is indicative of fitness for beverage use.
[T.D. ATF-379, 61 FR 31412, June 20, 1996, as amended by T.D. TTB-79, 74 FR 37402, July 28, 2009]

Use of S.D.A. in nonbeverage or intermediate products
—(1)
General.
Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the use of specially denatured alcohol (S.D.A.) and taxpaid spirits in the same product by a nonbeverage manufacturer is prohibited where drawback of tax is claimed.
(2)
Alternative formulations.
No formula for a product on TTB Form 5154.1 shall be approved for drawback under this subpart if the manufacturer also has on file an approved TTB Form 1479-A or Form 5150.19, Formula for Article Made With Specially Denatured Alcohol or Rum, pertaining to the same product.
(b)
Use of S.D.A. in ingredients
—(1)
Purchased ingredients.
Generally, purchased ingredients containing S.D.A. may be used in nonbeverage or intermediate products. However, such ingredients shall not be used in medicinal preparations or flavoring extracts intended for internal human use, where any of the S.D.A. remains in the finished product.
(2)
Self-manufactured ingredients.
Self-manufactured ingredients may be made with S.D.A. and used in nonbeverage or intermediate products, provided—
(i) No taxpaid spirits are used in manufacturing such ingredients; and
(ii) All S.D.A. is recovered or dissipated from such ingredients prior to their use in nonbeverage or intermediate products. (Recovery of S.D.A. shall be in accordance with subpart K of part 20 of this chapter; recovered S.D.A., with or without its original denaturants, shall not be reused in nonbeverage or intermediate products.)
(Sec. 201, Pub. L. 85-859, 72 Stat. 1372, as amended (26 U.S.C. 5273))
§ 17.136
Compliance with Food and Drug Administration requirements.
A product is not a medicine, medicinal preparation, food product, flavor, flavoring extract, or perfume for nonbeverage drawback if its formula would violate a ban or restriction of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) pertaining to such products. If FDA bans or restricts the use of any ingredient in such a way that further manufacture of a product in accordance with its formula would violate the ban or restriction, then the manufacturer shall change the formula and resubmit it on TTB Form 5154.1 . This section does not preclude approval for products manufactured solely for export or for uses other than internal human consumption (e.g. tobacco flavors or animal feed flavors) in accordance with laws and regulations administered by FDA. Under § 17.123, manufacturers may be required to demonstrate compliance with FDA requirements applicable to this section.
§ 17.137
Formulas disapproved for drawback.
A formula may be disapproved for drawback either because it does not prescribe appropriate ingredients in sufficient quantities to make the product unfit for beverage use, or because the product is neither a medicine, a medicinal preparation, a food product, a flavor, a flavoring extract, nor a perfume. The formula for a disapproved product may be used as an intermediate product formula under § 17.126. No drawback will be allowed on distilled spirits used in a disapproved product, unless that product is later used in the manufacture of an approved nonbeverage product. In the case of a product that is disapproved because it is fit for beverage use, any further use or disposition of such a product, other than as an intermediate product in accordance with this part, subjects the manufacturer to the qualification requirements of parts 1 and 19 of this chapter.

# Subpart G—Claims for Drawback
§ 17.141
Drawback.
Upon the filing of a claim as provided in this subpart, drawback shall be allowed to any person who meets the requirements of this part. Drawback shall be paid at the rate specified by 26 U.S.C. 5114 on each proof gallon of distilled spirits on which the tax has been paid or determined and which have been used in the manufacture of nonbeverage products. The drawback rate is $1.00 less than the effective tax rate.
Drawback shall be allowed only to the extent that the claimant can establish, by evidence satisfactory to the appropriate TTB officer, the actual quantity of taxpaid or tax-determined distilled spirits used in the manufacture of the product, and the effective tax rate applicable to those spirits.
[T.D. ATF-379, 61 FR 31412, June 20, 1996, as amended by T.D. TTB-79, 74 FR 37402, July 28, 2009; T.D. TTB-91, 76 FR 5477, Feb. 1, 2011]
§ 17.142
Claims.
(a)
General.
The manufacturer must file claim for drawback with the appropriate TTB officer who has the authority to approve or disapprove claims. A separate claim shall be filed for each place of business. Each claim shall pertain only to distilled spirits used in the manufacture or production of nonbeverage products during any one quarter of the tax year. Unless the manufacturer is eligible to file monthly claims (see §§ 17.143 and 17.144), only one claim per quarter may be filed for each place of business. Claims shall be filed on TTB Form 2635 (5620.8), Claim—Alcohol and Tobacco Taxes.
(b)
Manufacturers who are also proprietors of distilled spirits plants.
If a manufacturer of nonbeverage products is owned and operated by the same business entity that owns and operates a distilled spirits plant, the manufacturer's claim for drawback may be filed for credit on Form 2635 (5620.8). After the claim is approved, the distilled spirits plant may use the claim as an adjustment decreasing the taxes due in Schedule B of TTB Form 5000.24, Excise Tax Return. Adjustments resulting from an approved drawback claim are not subject to interest. This procedure may be utilized only if the manufacturer of nonbeverage products and the distilled spirits plant have the same employer identification number.
[T.D. ATF-379, 61 FR 31412, June 20, 1996, as amended by T.D. ATF-436, 66 FR 5471, Jan. 19, 2001]
§ 17.143
Notice for monthly claims.
If the manufacturer has notified the appropriate TTB officer, in writing, of an intention to file claims on a monthly basis instead of a quarterly basis, and has filed a bond in compliance with the provisions of this part, claims may be filed monthly instead of quarterly. The election to file monthly claims shall not preclude a manufacturer from filing a single claim covering an entire quarter, or a single claim covering just two months of a quarter, or two claims (one of them covering one month and the other covering two months). An election for the filing of monthly claims may be withdrawn by the manufacturer by filing a notice to that effect, in writing, with the appropriate TTB officer.
§ 17.144
Bond for monthly claims.
Each person intending to file claims for drawback on a monthly basis shall file an executed bond on TTB Form 5154.3, conforming to the provisions of subpart E of this part. A monthly drawback claim shall not be allowed until bond coverage in a sufficient amount has been approved by the appropriate TTB officer. When the limit of liability under a bond given in less than the maximum amount has been reached, further drawback on monthly claims may be suspended until a strengthening or superseding bond in a sufficient amount is furnished.
§ 17.145
Date of filing claim.
Quarterly claims for drawback shall be filed within six months after the quarter in which the distilled spirits covered by the claim were used in the manufacture of nonbeverage products. Monthly claims for drawback may be filed at any time after the end of the month in which the distilled spirits covered by the claim were used in the manufacture of nonbeverage products, but shall be filed not later than the close of the sixth month succeeding the quarter in which the spirits were used.
§ 17.146
Information to be shown by the claim.
The claim shall show the following:
(a) [Reserved]
(b) That the distilled spirits on which drawback is claimed were fully taxpaid or tax-determined at the effective tax rate applicable to the distilled spirits.
(c) That the distilled spirits on which the drawback is claimed were used in the manufacture of nonbeverage products.
(d) Whether the nonbeverage products were manufactured in compliance with quantitative formulas approved under subpart F of this part. (If not, attach explanation.)
(e) That the data submitted in support of the claim are correct.
[T.D. ATF-379, 61 FR 31412, June 20, 1996, as amended by T.D. TTB-79, 74 FR 37402, July 28, 2009]
§ 17.147
Supporting data.
(a) Each claim for drawback shall be accompanied by supporting data presented according to the format shown on TTB Form 5154.2, Supporting Data for Nonbeverage Drawback Claims (or according to any other suitable format which provides the same information). Modifications of Form 5154.2 may be used without prior authorization, if the modified format clearly shows all of the required information that is pertinent to the manufacturing operation. Under § 17.123, the appropriate TTB officer may require additional supporting data when needed to determine the correctness of drawback claims.
(b) Separate data shall be shown for eligible distilled spirits taxpaid at different effective tax rates. This requirement applies to all eligible spirits, including eligible recovered alcohol and eligible spirits contained in intermediate products.
(c) Separate data shall be shown for imported rum, spirits from Puerto Rico containing at least 92% rum, and spirits from the U.S. Virgin Islands containing at least 92% rum. The total number of proof gallons of each such category used subject to drawback during the claim period shall also be shown, with separate totals for each effective tax rate. These amounts shall include eligible spirits and rum from intermediate products or recovered alcohol.
(d) Any gain in eligible distilled spirits reported in the supporting data shall be reflected by an equivalent deduction from the amount of drawback claimed. Gains shall not be offset by known losses.
§ 17.148
Allowance of claims.
(a)
General.
Except in the case of fraudulent noncompliance, no claim for drawback shall be denied for a failure to comply with either 26 U.S.C. 5111-5114 or the requirements of this part, if the claimant establishes that spirits on which the tax has been paid or determined were in fact used in the manufacture of medicines, medicinal preparations, food products, flavors, flavoring extracts, or perfume, which were unfit for beverage purposes.
(b)
Penalty.
Noncompliance with the requirements of 26 U.S.C. 5111-5114 or of this part subjects the claimant to a civil penalty of $1,000 for each separate product, reflected in a claim for drawback, to which the noncompliance relates, or the amount claimed for that product, whichever is less, unless the claimant establishes that the noncompliance was due to reasonable cause. Late filing of a claim subjects the claimant to a civil penalty of $1,000 or the amount of the claim, whichever is less, unless the claimant establishes that the lateness was due to reasonable cause.
(c)
Reasonable cause.
Reasonable cause exists where a claimant establishes it exercised ordinary business care and prudence, and still was unable to comply with the statutory and regulatory requirements. Ignorance of law or regulations, in and of itself, is not reasonable cause. Each case is individually evaluated.
(26 U.S.C. 5114(c))
[T.D. ATF-379, 61 FR 31412, June 20, 1996, as amended by T.D. TTB-79, 74 FR 37402, July 28, 2009]

# Spirits Subject to Drawback
§ 17.151
Use of distilled spirits.
Distilled spirits are considered to have been used in the manufacture of a product under this part if the spirits are consumed in the manufacture, are incorporated into the product, or are determined by TTB to have been otherwise utilized as an essential part of the manufacturing process. However, spirits lost by causes such as spillage, leakage, breakage or theft, and spirits used for purposes such as rinsing or cleaning a system, are not considered to have been used in the manufacture of a product.
§ 17.152
Time of use of spirits.
(a)
General.
Distilled spirits shall be considered used in the manufacture of a product as soon as that product contains all the ingredients called for by its formula.
(b)
Spirits used in an ion exchange column.
Distilled spirits used in recharging an ion exchange column, the operation of which is essential to the production of a product, shall be considered to be used when the spirits are entered into the manufacturing system in accordance with the product's formula.
(c)
Products requiring additional processing or treatment.
Further manipulation of a product, such as aging or filtering, subsequent to the mixing together of all of its ingredients, shall not postpone the time when spirits are considered used, as determined under paragraph (a) of this section. This is true even if at the time of use there has not yet been a final determination of alcoholic content by assay. If, however, it is later found necessary to add more distilled spirits to standardize the product, such added spirits shall be considered as used in the period during which they were added.
(d)
Nonbeverage products used to manufacture other products.
Nonbeverage products may be used to manufacture other nonbeverage (or intermediate) products. However, such subsequent usage of a nonbeverage product shall not affect the time when the distilled spirits contained therein are considered used. When distilled spirits are used in the manufacture of a nonbeverage product, the time of use shall be the point at which that product first contains all of its prescribed ingredients, and such use shall not be determined by the time of any subsequent usage of that product in another product.
§ 17.153
Recovered spirits.
(a)
Recovery from intermediate products.
Eligible spirits recovered in the manufacture of intermediate products are not subject to drawback until such recovered spirits are used in the manufacture of a nonbeverage product. (However, see § 17.127 with respect to optional treatment of ingredients as unfinished nonbeverage products, rather than as intermediate products.) Spirits recovered in the manufacture of intermediate products shall be reused only in the manufacture of intermediate or nonbeverage products.
(b)
Recovery from nonbeverage products.
Distilled spirits recovered in the manufacture of a nonbeverage product are considered as having been used in the manufacture of that product. If the spirits were eligible when so used, they became subject to drawback at that time. Upon recovery, such spirits may be reused in the manufacture of nonbeverage products, but shall not be reused for any other purpose. When reused, such recovered spirits are not again eligible for drawback and shall not be used in the manufacture of intermediate products.
(c)
Cross references.
For additional provisions respecting the recovery of distilled spirits and related recordkeeping requirements, see §§ 17.168 and 17.183.
§ 17.154
Spirits contained in intermediate products.
Spirits contained in an intermediate product are not subject to drawback until that intermediate product is used in the manufacture of a nonbeverage product.
§ 17.155
Spirits consumed in manufacturing intermediate products.
Spirits consumed in the manufacture of an intermediate product—which are not contained in the intermediate product at the time of its use in nonbeverage products—are not subject to drawback. Such spirits are not considered to have been used in the manufacture of nonbeverage products. However, see § 17.127 with respect to optional treatment of ingredients as unfinished nonbeverage products, rather than as intermediate products.

# Subpart H—Records
§ 17.161
General.
Each person claiming drawback on taxpaid distilled spirits used in the manufacture of nonbeverage products shall maintain records showing the information required in this subpart. No particular form is prescribed for these records, but the data required to be
shown shall be clearly recorded and organized to enable appropriate TTB officers to trace each operation or transaction, monitor compliance with law and regulations, and verify the accuracy of each claim. Ordinary business records, including invoices and cost accounting records, are acceptable if they show the required information or are annotated to show any such information that is lacking. The records shall be kept complete and current at all times and shall be retained by the manufacturer at the place where the taxpaid distilled spirits are used in the manufacture or production of nonbeverage products, for the period prescribed in § 17.170.
[T.D. ATF-379, 61 FR 31412, June 20, 1996, as amended by T.D. TTB-79, 74 FR 37402, July 28, 2009]
§ 17.162
Receipt of distilled spirits.
(a)
Distilled spirits received in tank cars, tank trucks, barrels, or drums.
For distilled spirits received in tank cars, tank trucks, barrels, or drums, the manufacturer shall record, with respect to each shipment received—
(1) The date of receipt;
(2) The name and address of the person from whom received;
(3) The serial number or other identification mark (if any) of each tank car, tank truck, barrel, or drum;
(4) The name of the producer or warehouseman who paid or determined the tax;
(5) The effective tax rate (if other than the rate prescribed by 26 U.S.C. 5001); and
(6) The kind, quantity, and proof (or alcohol percentage by volume) of the spirits.
(b)
Distilled spirits received in bottles.
For distilled spirits received in bottles, the manufacturer shall record—
(1) The date of receipt;
(2) The name and address of the seller;
(3) The serial number of each case, if the bottles are received in cases;
(4) The name of the bottler;
(5) The effective tax rate (if other than the rate prescribed by 26 U.S.C. 5001); and
(6) The kind, quantity, and proof (or alcohol percentage by volume) of the spirits.
(c)
Distilled spirits received by pipeline.
For distilled spirits received by pipeline, the manufacturer shall record—
(1) The date of receipt;
(2) The name of the producer or warehouseman who paid or determined the tax;
(3) The effective tax rate (if other than the rate prescribed by 26 U.S.C. 5001); and
(4) The kind, quantity, and proof (or alcohol percentage by volume) of the spirits.
(d)
Determination of quantity.
At the time of receipt, each manufacturer shall determine (preferably by weight) and record the exact number of proof gallons of distilled spirits received. The amount received in bottles may be determined by the required statements on the labels. The amount received in sealed drums with no evidence of leakage may be determined from the record of shipment, which is required by § 19.626 of this chapter to accompany spirits received from a distilled spirits plant. If spirits are received in a tank car or tank truck, and the result of the manufacturer's gauge of the spirits is within 0.2 percent of the number of proof gallons reported on the record of shipment required by § 19.626, then the number of proof gallons reported on that record may be recorded as the quantity received. Nevertheless, the receiving gauge shall be noted on the record of receipt. If, for any shipment, the amount recorded in the manufacturer's records as the quantity received is greater than the amount shown as taxpaid on the record required by § 19.626, a deduction equivalent to the excess shall be made from the amount of drawback claimed in the manufacturer's claim covering that period. If no claim is filed for that period, then the deduction shall be made in the manufacturer's next claim. Losses in transit that exceed the 0.2 percent limitation provided in this paragraph shall be determined and noted on the record of receipt. Such losses shall not be recorded as distilled spirits received.
(e)
Receipt of imported rum, or spirits from Puerto Rico or the Virgin Islands.
If spirits are received which contain at least 92% rum, and which originate
from Puerto Rico or the U.S. Virgin Islands, the record of receipt shall indicate the place of origin. If rum is received, the record shall indicate whether it is from Puerto Rico, from the U.S. Virgin Islands, imported from other countries, or domestic.
(f)
Shipments from distilled spirits plants.
If spirits are received directly from the distilled spirits plant that paid or determined the tax, the manufacturer shall retain the record of shipment required by § 19.626 of this chapter. To the extent that the information on that record duplicates the requirements of this section, retention of that record shall satisfy those requirements. If there are differences between the information on the record of shipment and the information required to be recorded by this section, the requirements of this section may be met by appropriate annotations on the record of shipment.
[T.D. ATF-379, 61 FR 31412, June 20, 1996, as amended by T.D. TTB-92, 76 FR 9090, Feb. 16, 2011]
§ 17.163
Evidence of taxpayment of distilled spirits.
(a)
Shipments from distilled spirits plants.
For each shipment of taxpaid spirits from the bonded premises of a distilled spirits plant, the manufacturer shall obtain the record of shipment prepared by the supplier under § 19.626 of this chapter. This record shall be retained with the commercial invoice (if the latter is a separate document) as evidence of taxpayment of the spirits. The record shall show the effective tax rate(s) (if other than the rate prescribed by 26 U.S.C. 5001) applicable to the shipment.
(b)
Purchases from wholesale and retail liquor dealers.
Manufacturers shall obtain commercial invoices or other documentation pertaining to purchases of distilled spirits from wholesale and retail liquor dealers (including such dealership operations when conducted in conjunction with a distilled spirits plant). For spirits other than alcohol, grain spirits, neutral spirits, distilled gin, or straight whisky (as defined in the standards of identity prescribed by § 5.22 of this chapter), the manufacturer of nonbeverage products shall obtain evidence, from the producer or bottler of the spirits, as to the effective tax rate paid thereon.
(c)
Imported spirits.
For imported spirits that were taxpaid through U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), evidence of such taxpayment (such as CBP Forms 7501 and 7505, receipted to indicate payment of tax, and the certificate of effective tax rate computation, if applicable) shall be secured from the importer and retained by the manufacturer.
(d)
Evidence of effective tax rate.
If the evidence of effective tax rate, required by this section for distilled spirits products that may contain wine or flavors, is not obtained, drawback shall only be allowed based on the lowest effective tax rate possible for the kind of distilled spirits product used.
[T.D. ATF-379, 61 FR 31412, June 20, 1996, as amended by T.D. TTB-92, 76 FR 9090, Feb. 16, 2011; T.D. TTB-196, 89 FR 87937, Nov. 6, 2024]
§ 17.164
Production record.
(a)
General.
Each manufacturer shall keep a production record for each batch of intermediate product and for each batch of nonbeverage product. The production record shall be an original record made at the time of production by a person (or persons) having actual knowledge thereof. If any product is produced by a continuous process rather than by batches, the production record shall pertain to the total quantity of that product produced during each claim period.
(b)
Information to be shown.
The record shall show the name and formula number of the product, the actual quantities of all ingredients used in the manufacture of the batch (including the proof or alcohol percentage by volume of all spirits), the date when eligible spirits were considered used (see § 17.152), the effective tax rate applicable to those spirits (if other than the rate prescribed by 26 U.S.C. 5001), and the quantity of product produced. The alcohol content of the product shall be shown if a test of alcohol content was made (see paragraph (e) of this section). Usage of eligible and ineligible spirits shall be shown separately. If spirits from Puerto Rico or the U.S. Virgin Islands, containing at least 92% rum, were used, the record shall indicate their place of origin. If rum was
used, the record shall indicate whether it was from Puerto Rico, from the U.S. Virgin Islands, imported from other countries, or domestic. If spirits were recovered, the production record shall so indicate, and the record required by § 17.168 shall be kept. If drawback is claimed on spirits consumed as an essential part of the manufacture of a nonbeverage product, which were not contained in that product at its completion, then the production record shall show the quantity of spirits so consumed in the manufacture of each batch.
(c)
Specificity of information.
The production record shall refer to ingredients by the same names as are used for them in the product's formula. This includes formulas submitted to TTB and formulas contained in the publications listed in § 17.132. Other names for the ingredients may be added in the production record, if necessary for the manufacturer's operations. Usage of ingredients (including spirits) may be shown in units of weight or volume.
(d)
Determining quantity of distilled spirits used.
Each manufacturer shall accurately determine, by weight or volume, and record in the production records the quantity of all distilled spirits used. When the quantity used is determined by volume, adjustments shall be made if the temperature of the spirits is above or below 60 degrees Fahrenheit. A table for correction of volume of spirituous liquors to 60 degrees Fahrenheit, Table 7 of the “Gauging Manual,” is available. See subpart E of part 30 of this chapter and § 30.67. Losses after receipt due to leakage, spillage, evaporation, or other causes not essential to the manufacturing process shall be accurately recorded in the manufacturer's permanent records at the time such losses are determined.
(e)
Tests of alcohol content.
At representative intervals, the manufacturer shall verify the alcohol content of nonbeverage products. The results of such tests shall be recorded.
§ 17.165
Receipt of raw ingredients.
For raw ingredients destined to be used in nonbeverage or intermediate products, the manufacturer shall record, for each shipment received—
(a) The date of receipt;
(b) The quantity received; and
(c) The identity of the supplier.
§ 17.166
Disposition of nonbeverage products.
(a)
Shipments.
For each shipment of nonbeverage products, the manufacturer shall record—
(1) The formula number of the product;
(2) The date of shipment;
(3) The quantity shipped; and
(4) The identity of the consignee.
(b)
Other disposition.
For other dispositions of nonbeverage products, the manufacturer shall record—
(1) The type of disposition;
(2) The date of disposition; and
(3) The quantity of each product so disposed of.
(c)
Exception.
The manufacturer need not keep the records required by paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section for any nonbeverage product which either contains less than 3 percent of distilled spirits by volume, or is sold by the producer directly to the consumer in retail quantities. However, when needed for protection of the revenue, the appropriate TTB officer may at any time require the keeping of these records upon giving at least five days' notice to the manufacturer.
§ 17.167
Inventories.
(a)
Distilled spirits.
The “on hand” figures reported in Part II of TTB Form 5154.2 shall be verified by physical inventories taken as of the end of each quarter in which nonbeverage products were manufactured for purposes of drawback. Spirits taxpaid at different effective tax rates shall be inventoried separately. The inventory record shall show the date inventory was taken, the person(s) by whom it was taken, subtotals for each product inventoried, and any gains or losses disclosed; and shall be retained with the manufacturer's records. The manufacturer shall explain in Part IV of the supporting data (Form 5154.2) any discrepancy between the amounts on hand as disclosed by physical inventory and the amounts indicated by the manufacturer's records. Any gain in eligible spirits disclosed by inventory requires an equivalent deduction from the claim
with which the inventory is reported. Gains shall not be offset by known losses. If no claim is filed for a quarter (nor for any monthly period therein), then no physical inventory is required for that quarter.
(b)
Raw ingredients and nonbeverage products.
When necessary for ensuring compliance with regulations and protection of the revenue, the appropriate TTB officer may require a manufacturer to take physical inventories of finished nonbeverage products, and/or raw ingredients intended for use in the manufacture of nonbeverage or intermediate products. The results of such inventories shall be recorded in the manufacturer's records. Any discrepancy between the amounts on hand as disclosed by physical inventory and such amounts as indicated by the manufacturer's records shall also be recorded with an explanation of its cause.
§ 17.168
Recovered spirits.
(a) Each manufacturer intending to recover distilled spirits under the provisions of this part shall first notify the appropriate TTB officer. Any apparatus used to separate alcohol is subject to the registration requirements of 26 U.S.C. 5179 and subpart C of part 29 of this chapter. Recovery operations may only be conducted on the premises where the recovered spirits were used in the manufacture or production of nonbeverage or intermediate products.
(b) The manufacturer shall keep a record of the distilled spirits recovered and the subsequent use to which such spirits are put. The record shall show—
(1) The date of recovery;
(2) The commodity or process from which the spirits were recovered;
(3) The amount in proof gallons, or by weight and proof (or alcohol percentage by volume) of distilled spirits recovered;
(4) The amount in proof gallons, or by weight and proof (or alcohol percentage by volume) of recovered distilled spirits reused;
(5) The commodity in which the recovered distilled spirits were reused; and
(6) The date of reuse.
(c) Whenever recovered spirits are destroyed (see § 17.183), the record shall further show—
(1) The reason for the destruction;
(2) The date, time, location, and manner of destruction;
(3) The number of proof gallons destroyed; and
(4) The name of the individual who accomplished or supervised the destruction.

§ 17.169
Transfer of intermediate products.
When intermediate products are transferred as permitted by § 17.185(b), supporting records of such transfers shall be kept at the shipping and receiving plants, showing the date and quantity of each product transferred.
§ 17.170
Retention of records.
Each manufacturer shall retain for a period of not less than 3 years all records required by this part, a copy of all claims and supporting data filed in support thereof, all commercial invoices or other documents evidencing taxpayment or tax-determination of domestic spirits, all documents evidencing taxpayment of imported spirits, and all bills of lading received which pertain to shipments of spirits. In addition, a copy of each formula submitted on TTB Form 5154.1 shall be retained at each factory where the formula is used, for not less than 3 years from the date of filing of the last claim for drawback under the formula. A copy of an approval to use an alternate method or procedure shall be retained as long as the manufacturer employs the method or procedure, and for 3 years thereafter. Further, the appropriate TTB officer may require these records, forms, and documents to be retained for an additional period of not more than 3 years in any case where he or she deems such retention to be necessary or advisable for protection of the revenue.
§ 17.171
Inspection of records.
All of the records, forms, and documents required to be retained by
§ 17.170 shall be kept at the premises where distilled spirits are used in the manufacture or production of nonbeverage products and shall be readily available during the manufacturer's regular business hours for examination and copying by the appropriate TTB officers. At the same time, any other books, papers, records or memoranda in the possession of the manufacturer, which have a bearing upon the matters required to be alleged in a claim for drawback, shall be available for inspection by appropriate TTB officers.

Exportation of medicinal preparations and flavoring extracts.
Medicinal preparations and flavoring extracts, approved for drawback under the provisions of this part, may be exported subject to 19 U.S.C. 1313(d), which authorizes export drawback equal to the entire amount of internal revenue tax found to have been paid on the domestic alcohol used in the manufacture of such products. (Note: Export drawback is not allowed for imported alcohol under this provision of customs law.) Claims for such export drawback shall be filed in accordance with the applicable regulations of U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Such claims may cover either the full rate of tax which has been paid on the alcohol, if no nonbeverage drawback has been claimed thereon, or else the remainder of the tax if nonbeverage drawback under 26 U.S.C. 5114 has been or will be claimed.
[T.D. ATF-379, 61 FR 31412, June 20, 1996, as amended by T.D. TTB-79, 74 FR 37402, July 28, 2009; T.D. TTB-196 89 FR 87937, Nov. 6, 2024]
§ 17.182
Drawback claims by druggists.
Drawback of tax under 26 U.S.C. 5114 is allowable on taxpaid distilled spirits used by druggists in compounding prescriptions. The prescriptions so compounded shall be shown in the supporting data by listing the first and last serial numbers thereof. The amount of taxpaid spirits used in each prescription need not be shown, but such prescriptions shall be made available for examination by appropriate TTB officers. If refills have been made of prescriptions received in a previous claim period, their serial numbers shall be recorded separately. Druggists claiming drawback as authorized by this section are subject to all the applicable requirements of this part, except those requiring the filing of quantitative formulas.
[T.D. ATF-379, 61 FR 31412, June 20, 1996, as amended by T.D. TTB-79, 74 FR 37402, July 28, 2009]
§ 17.183
Disposition of recovered alcohol and material from which alcohol can be recovered.
(a)
Recovered alcohol.
Manufacturers of nonbeverage products shall not sell or transfer recovered spirits to any other premises without TTB authorization under § 17.3. If recovered spirits are stored pending reuse, storage facilities shall be adequate to protect the revenue. If recovered spirits are destroyed, the record required by § 17.168(c) must be kept. Spirits recovered from intermediate products may be destroyed without notice to TTB. Spirits recovered from nonbeverage products may be destroyed pursuant to a notice filed with the appropriate TTB officer at least 12 days prior to the date of destruction. The notice shall state the reason for the destruction, the intended date of destruction, and the approximate quantity involved. The appropriate TTB officer may impose specific conditions, including requiring that the destruction be witnessed by an appropriate TTB officer. Unless the manufacturer is otherwise advised by the appropriate TTB officer before the date specified in the notice, the destruction may proceed as planned.
(b)
By-product material (general).
By-product material from which alcohol can be recovered shall not be sold or transferred unless the alcohol has been removed or an approved substance has been added to prevent recovery of residual alcohol. Material from which alcohol can be recovered may also be destroyed on the manufacturer's premises by a suitable method. Except as
provided in paragraph (c) of this section, prior written approval shall be obtained from the appropriate TTB officer as to the adequacy, under this section, of any substance proposed to be added to prevent recovery of alcohol, or of any proposed method of destruction.
(c)
Spent vanilla beans.
Specific approval from the appropriate TTB officer is not required when spent vanilla beans containing residual alcohol are destroyed on the manufacturer's premises by burning, or when they are removed from those premises after treatment with sufficient kerosene, mineral spirits, rubber hydrocarbon solvent, or gasoline to prevent recovery of residual alcohol.
[T.D. ATF-379, 61 FR 31412, June 20, 1996, as amended by T.D. TTB-196, 89 FR 87937, Nov. 6, 2024]
§ 17.184
Distilled spirits container marks.
All marks required by part 19 of this chapter shall remain on containers of taxpaid distilled spirits until the contents are emptied. Whenever such a container is emptied, such marks shall be completely obliterated.
(Sec. 454, Pub. L. 98-369, 98 Stat. 820 (26 U.S.C. 5206(d)))
§ 17.185
Requirements for intermediate products and unfinished nonbeverage products.
(a)
General.
Self-manufactured ingredients made with taxpaid spirits may be accounted for either as intermediate products or as unfinished nonbeverage products. The manufacturer may choose either method of accounting for such self-manufactured ingredients (see § 17.127). However, the method selected determines the requirements that will apply to those ingredients, as prescribed in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.
(b)
Intermediate products.
Intermediate products shall be used exclusively in the manufacture of nonbeverage products. Intermediate products may be accumulated and stored indefinitely and may be used in any nonbeverage product whose formula calls for such use. Intermediate products shall be manufactured by the same entity that manufactures the finished nonbeverage products. Intermediate products shall not be sold or transferred between separate and distinct entities. However, they may be transferred to another branch or plant of the same manufacturer, for use there in the manufacture of approved nonbeverage products. (See § 17.169 for recordkeeping requirement.) For the purposes of this section, the phrase “separate and distinct entities” includes parent and subsidiary corporations, regardless of any corporate (or other) relationship, and even if the stock of both the manufacturing firm and the receiving firm is owned by the same persons.
(c)
Unfinished nonbeverage products.
An unfinished nonbeverage product shall only be used in the particular nonbeverage product for which it was manufactured, and shall be entirely so used within the time limit stated in the approved TTB Form 5154.1. Spirits dissipated or recovered in the manufacture of unfinished nonbeverage products shall be regarded as having been dissipated or recovered in the manufacture of nonbeverage products. Spirits contained in such unfinished products shall be accounted for in the supporting data under § 17.147 and inventoried under § 17.167 as “in process” in nonbeverage products. Production of unfinished nonbeverage products shall be recorded as an integral part of the production records for the related nonbeverage products. Unfinished nonbeverage products shall not be transferred to other premises.
§ 17.186
Transfer of distilled spirits to other containers.
A manufacturer may transfer taxpaid distilled spirits from the original package to other containers at any time for the purpose of facilitating the manufacture of products unfit for beverage use. Containers into which distilled spirits have been transferred under this section shall bear a label identifying their contents as taxpaid distilled spirits, and shall be marked with the serial number of the original package from which the spirits were withdrawn.
§ 17.187
Discontinuance of business.
The manufacturer shall notify TTB when business is to be discontinued. Upon discontinuance of business, a
manufacturer's entire stock of taxpaid distilled spirits on hand may be sold in a single sale without the necessity of qualifying as a wholesaler under part 1 of this chapter or registering and keeping records as a liquor dealer under part 31 of this chapter.The spirits likewise may be returned to the person from whom purchased, or they may be destroyed or given away.

In the case of an outgoing proprietor who intends to alternate processing operations with another proprietor, the outgoing proprietor:
(1) Before the effective date and time of the alternation, must process to completion and remove from the affected area all spirits, denatured spirits, wines, or articles located in any rooms, areas, or buildings that will alternate, or must transfer these spirits, wines, and articles in bond to the incoming proprietor;
(2) Except where no bond is required under § 19.151(d), must execute a TTB F 5000.18, Change of Bond (Consent of
Surety), to continue in effect the operations or unit bond whenever operations of the areas, rooms, or buildings will be resumed by the outgoing proprietor following suspension of operations by the other proprietor; and
(3) May retain denatured spirits and articles in tanks locked with approved locks if the outgoing proprietor maintains custody and control of the locks and keys for the tanks. In this case, the outgoing proprietor must obtain a consent of surety on TTB F 5000.18 to continue liability on the operations or unit bond for the tax on the denatured spirits or articles that retained in the locked tanks.
(f)
Records.
Each alternating proprietor must maintain its own records and submit its own reports. Records kept by an outgoing proprietor for spirits, wines, and alcoholic flavoring materials may be used by the incoming proprietor. All transfers of distilling materials, unfinished spirits, spirits, denatured spirits, and wines must be reflected in the records of each proprietor.

# Subpart F—Bonds and Consents of Surety

# Bonding Requirements for a DSP
§ 19.151
General.
(a)
Bond required.
Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, any person who plans to establish and operate a distilled spirits plant must provide TTB with one or more bonds on
form TTB F 5110.56, Distilled Spirits Bond. TTB will not approve a registration or allow a person to operate a distilled spirits plant until the applicant has provided the necessary bonds. If a proprietor fails to pay any liability covered by a bond, TTB may seek payment from the proprietor, from the surety (see § 19.153) or from both the proprietor and the surety. The types and penal sums of bonds required will depend upon the type and size of the operations that the proprietor will conduct.
(b)
Bond terms and conditions.
The terms and conditions of a distilled spirits bond require that the proprietor comply with all provisions of law and regulations relating to activities covered by the bond, and to pay all taxes imposed by 26 U.S.C. chapter 51, including taxes on unexplained shortages of bottled distilled spirits. The bond will further specify that the proprietor will pay all penalties incurred, or fines imposed, for violations of law and regulations relating to activities covered by the bond. The specific terms of the required bond(s) are stated on TTB F 5110.56.
(c)
Corporations and controlled subsidiaries.
For purposes of this subpart, the term “corporation” includes a Limited Liability Company (LLC) or Limited Liability Partnership (LLP) in any jurisdiction where the law authorizes such a business organization to operate. Whenever used in this subpart, the term “controlled subsidiary” means a corporation (or LLC or LLP) in which more than 50 percent of the voting power is controlled by a parent corporation.
(d)
Bonds covering distilled spirits for nonindustrial use and industrial use
—(1)
Nonindustrial use.
A proprietor who pays tax on a deferred basis under § 19.235 is not required to provide a bond or bonds to cover operations and withdrawals of distilled spirits for nonindustrial use during any portion of a calendar year for which the proprietor is eligible to use an annual or quarterly return period under § 19.235(b) or (c). For purposes of the preceding sentence, a proprietor is considered to be paying tax on a deferred basis even if the proprietor does not pay tax during every return period as long as the proprietor intends to pay tax in a future period. See §§ 19.73 and 19.136 for rules governing applying for this bond exemption. See § 19.168(b) for rules governing when an existing proprietor who has not provided a bond under this paragraph must obtain bond coverage.
(2)
Industrial use.
A proprietor is required to provide one or more bonds to cover operations and withdrawals of distilled spirits for industrial use even if the proprietor pays tax on a deferred basis under § 19.235 and is eligible to use an annual or quarterly return period under § 19.235(b) or (c). In the case of a proprietor whose operations involve distilled spirits for both nonindustrial and industrial use, distilled spirits are considered to be for industrial use for purposes of this paragraph unless the proprietor designates the spirits as being solely for nonindustrial use either upon taking the production gauge (see § 19.304) or upon receiving the spirits and, in either case, does not thereafter mix the spirits with any spirits for industrial use.
(3)
Nonindustrial use and industrial use defined.
See § 19.472 for the provisions defining the nonindustrial and industrial uses of distilled spirits.

§ 19.152
Types of bonds.
(a)
Basic Bonds.
There are two basic types of bonds: the operations bond, and the withdrawal bond.
(1)
Operations bond.
An operations bond covers the tax liability for a variety of operations at a distilled spirits plant, along with any penalties incurred and fines imposed for violation of the law and regulations relating to activities covered by the bond.
(2)
Withdrawal bond.
A withdrawal bond covers the tax liability for tax determined distilled spirits withdrawn from the bonded premises on a tax deferred basis.
(b)
Other bonds.
In addition to the basic operations and withdrawal bonds, several variations of these bonds are available:
(1) An adjacent wine cellar bond covers operations at a distilled spirits
plant and an adjacent bonded wine cellar;
(2) An area bond covers operations at two or more distilled spirits plant and any adjacent bonded wine cellars; and
(3) A unit bond covers both operations and withdrawals at one or more distilled spirits plants and operations at any adjacent bonded wine cellars.
(26 U.S.C. 5173)
§ 19.153
Bond guaranteed by a corporate surety.
(a)
Corporate surety.
A company that issues bonds is called a “corporate surety.” Proprietors must obtain the surety bonds required by this subpart from a corporate surety approved by the Secretary of the Treasury.
(b)
How to find an approved surety.
The Department of the Treasury publishes a list of approved corporate surety companies in Treasury Department Circular 570, Companies Holding Certificates of Authority as Acceptable Sureties on Federal Bonds and as Acceptable Reinsuring Companies. Treasury Department Circular 570 is published in the
Federal Register
annually on the first business day in July, and supplemental changes are published periodically thereafter (see

§ 19.154
Bond guaranteed by deposit of securities or cash (including cash equivalents).
(a)
Bond guaranteed by deposit of securities
—(1)
General.
As an alternative to the corporate surety bond under § 19.153, a person can file a bond that guarantees payment of the liability by pledging one or more acceptable negotiable securities. These securities must have a par value (face amount) equal to or greater than the penal sums of the required bonds. The pledged securities are held in the Federal Reserve Bank in a safekeeping account with TTB as the pledgee. Should the proprietor fail to pay one or more of the guaranteed liabilities, TTB can take action to sell the deposited securities to satisfy the debt. Pledged securities will be released if there are no outstanding liabilities when the bond is terminated. (See § 19.170.)
(2)
Acceptable securities.
Only public debt obligations of the United States, the principal and interest of which are unconditionally guaranteed by the United States Government, are acceptable for the purpose described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. The Department of the Treasury and certain other United States Government agencies issue debt instruments that are acceptable as collateral, such as Treasury notes and Treasury bills. Savings bonds, certificates of deposit and letters of credit are not acceptable. A list of securities acceptable as collateral in lieu of surety bonds is available from the Bureau of the Fiscal Service. Current information and guidance from the Bureau of the Fiscal Service Web site may be found at
https://www.fiscal.treasury.gov.
(b)
Bond guaranteed by deposit of cash or cash equivalent.
As an alternative to the corporate surety bond under § 19.153, a person can file a bond that guarantees payment of the liability by submitting cash or its equivalent (including a money order, cashier's check, or personal check). Cash or its equivalent must be no less than the penal sums of the required bond. Cash equivalents must be payable to the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau. A bond described in this paragraph will be released if there are no outstanding liabilities when the bond is terminated. (See § 19.170.)
(31 U.S.C. 9301, 9303; 31 CFR part 380)
[T.D. TTB-146, 82 FR 1120, Jan. 4, 2017]
§ 19.155
Change of surety bond terms—consent of surety.
In order to change the terms of an approved bond, both the principal and the surety company that guaranteed the bond must agree to the change. TTB must also approve the change. All changes to the terms of a bond must be executed on form TTB F 5000.18, Change of Bond (Consent of Surety) by both the principal and the surety with the same formality and proof of authority as required for the original
bond. The completed, executed TTB F 5000.18 must be submitted to the National Revenue Center.
(26 U.S.C. 5173)
§ 19.156
Power of attorney for surety.
(a)
Requirement for power of attorney.
Every bond and every consent of surety filed with TTB in which an agent or officer executed the bond or consent on behalf of the surety must be supported by a power of attorney authorizing the agent or officer to execute the bond or consent of surety. The power of attorney assures TTB that the person who signed the bond on behalf of the surety has the legal authority to obligate the surety.
(b)
Form of power of attorney and endorsement.
A power of attorney will be prepared on the surety's own form, and must be executed under the surety's corporate seal. If the power of attorney submitted is other than a manually signed original, it must be accompanied by a certification from the surety that the power of attorney is valid.
(c)
Additional documentation.
The appropriate TTB officer authorized to approve and accept the bond may require additional evidence of the authenticity of signatures and the authority of persons signing on behalf of the surety to execute the bond or consent.
(31 U.S.C. 9304, 9306)
§ 19.157
Disapproval of bonds and consents of surety.
(a)
Grounds for disapproval.
The appropriate TTB officer may disapprove any bond or consent of surety required by this part if the principal or any person having ownership, control or responsibility for actively managing the business of the surety has been previously convicted, in a court of competent jurisdiction of:
(1) Any fraudulent noncompliance with any provision of any law of the United States relating to internal revenue or customs taxation of spirits, wines, or beer, or if the offense was compromised by payment of penalties or otherwise, or
(2) Any felony under a law of any State or the District of Columbia, or the United States, prohibiting the manufacture, sale, importation, or transportation of spirits, wine, beer, or other intoxicating liquor.
(b)
Appeal.
If the appropriate TTB officer disapproves a bond or consent of surety, the person giving the bond may appeal the disapproval to the Administrator, who will hear the appeal. The decision of the Administrator will be final.
(26 U.S.C. 5551)

# Requirements for Operations and Withdrawal Bonds
§ 19.161
Operations bond.
(a)
General.
Except as provided in § 19.151(d), any person who intends to establish a distilled spirits plant must furnish an operations bond (or a unit bond, see § 19.165) covering distilled spirits operations at such plant on TTB F 5110.56 with the original application to register the distilled spirits plant.
(b)
Approval of bond.
The appropriate TTB officer may require a statement, executed under the penalty of perjury, as to whether the principal, or any person owning, controlling, or managing the business of the applicant has been convicted of, or has compromised any offense listed in § 19.157(a)(1), or has been convicted of any offense listed in § 19.157(a)(2). If the above statement contains an affirmative answer, the applicant must provide an additional detailed statement describing the circumstances surrounding each conviction or compromise. The appropriate TTB officer will decide whether to approve or disapprove the bond.
(26 U.S.C. 5173, 5551)
[T.D. TTB-92, 76 FR 9090, Feb. 16, 2011, as amended by T.D. TTB-146, 82 FR 1121, Jan. 4, 2017]
§ 19.162
Operations bond for distilled spirits plant and adjacent bonded wine cellar.
(a)
One bond satisfying two requirements.
A proprietor who operates a bonded wine cellar that is adjacent to the proprietor's distilled spirits plant may file a single operations bond to cover the operations of the distilled spirits plant and the bonded wine cellar. A proprietor who files this type of bond satisfies the requirement in 26
U.S.C. 5173 for an operations bond covering the distilled spirits plant and the requirement in 26 U.S.C. 5354 for a bond covering wine and spirits possessed at, and in transit to, the bonded wine cellar. (The proprietor may still have to obtain a supplemental bond for the wine cellar to cover liabilities resulting from deferred payment of tax. See the second sentence of 26 U.S.C. 5354.)
(b)
One bond combining terms and coverage of separate bonds.
An operations bond filed under paragraph (a) of this section must contain the same terms and conditions that would be in separate bonds for the distilled spirits plant and for the bonded wine cellar. The proprietor may not allocate or divide the penal sum between the distilled spirits plant and the bonded wine cellar. The total amount of the bond must be available to satisfy any liability incurred under the terms of the bond at either facility.
(c)
Persons qualified for a single bond.
A proprietor may choose to file a single operations bond for a distilled spirits plant and adjacent bonded wine cellar only if:
(1) Such distilled spirits plant is qualified under subpart D of this part for the production of distilled spirits; and
(2) Such wine cellar and distilled spirits plant are operated by the same person (or in the case of a corporation, by such corporation and its controlled subsidiaries).
(26 U.S.C. 5173, 5351, 5354)
§ 19.163
Area operations bond.
(a)
Area operations bond covering multiple locations.
A person who operates more than one distilled spirits plant within the geographical area serviced by the National Revenue Center may submit to TTB an area operations bond covering the operations of any two or more such plants and any bonded wine cellars that are adjacent to such plants and which otherwise could be covered by an operations bond. Area operations bonds filed under this section will be in lieu of the operations bond requirements for single distilled spirits plants under §§ 19.161 and 19.166 and must contain the same terms and conditions as those contained in separate bonds filed for single distilled spirits plants. Any person who files an area operations bond may not allocate or divide the penal sum of the area operations bond between the separate locations and the total penal sum of the bond must be available to satisfy liability incurred at any of the covered locations.
(b)
Area operations bonds filed by corporations.
An area operations bond may only cover distilled spirits plants and adjacent bonded wine cellars that are operated by the same person. For purposes of this section, a corporation and its controlled subsidiaries are considered to be one person. Further, a controlled subsidiary is a corporation in which more than 50 percent of the voting power is controlled by the parent corporation. Consequently, an area operations bond may cover distilled spirits plants and adjacent bonded wine cellars operated by a parent corporation and one or more of its controlled subsidiaries. The name of each corporation that operates a covered facility must appear on the bond as a principal, whether the operating corporation is the parent or a subsidiary. The bond must bear an authorized signature for each operating corporation appearing on the bond.
(26 U.S.C. 5173)
§ 19.164
Withdrawal bond.
(a)
Requirement for a withdrawal bond.
Except as provided in § 19.151(d), a person must provide TTB with a withdrawal bond for a distilled spirits plant if the person intends to withdraw spirits from the distilled spirits plant upon determination of the taxes due on the spirits but before payment of the tax. The withdrawal bond must guarantee payment of any taxes due on distilled spirits withdrawn from bonded premises up to the amount of the bond. Such bond will be in addition to the operations bond, and if the distilled spirits are withdrawn under the withdrawal bond, the operations bond will no longer cover liability for payment of the tax on the spirits withdrawn. For purposes of this section, a person includes a corporation, together with all of its controlled subsidiaries, and a controlled subsidiary has the same meaning as in § 19.163(b).
(b)
One bond covering multiple plants.
A person who operates more than one
distilled spirits plant within the geographical area serviced by the National Revenue Center may submit to TTB a single withdrawal bond that covers withdrawals from all such distilled spirits plants within that geographic area.
(c)
Penal sum of bonds
—(1)
Penal sum of a bond covering a single plant.
A person who files a withdrawal bond for a single plant must compute the penal sum of such bond in accordance with § 19.166. If the penal sum of such bond is less than the maximum amount, withdrawals from the plant may not exceed the penal sum.
(2)
Penal sum of bond covering multiple plants.
A person who files one withdrawal bond to cover two or more distilled spirits plants must compute the required penal sum for each plant individually in accordance with § 19.166. The penal sum of the withdrawal bond must be equal to, or greater than, the total of the minimum amounts required for the individual plants. The bond must show the amount of coverage allocated to each individual plant as well as the total penal sum for all plants. If the portion of the penal sum allocated to a particular plant is less than the maximum amount prescribed in § 19.166 for a single plant, withdrawals from that plant must not exceed the amount of the penal sum allocated to that plant. The allocation of the penal sum notwithstanding, the entire penal sum of the bond must be available to satisfy all liability for tax on withdrawals from any and all of the covered plants.
(26 U.S.C. 5173)
[T.D. TTB-92, 76 FR 9090, Feb. 16, 2011, as amended by T.D. TTB-146, 82 FR 1121, Jan. 4, 2017]
§ 19.165
Unit bonds.
(a)
Unit bond covering operations and withdrawals.
If a person is otherwise required to file bonds for both operations at one or more distilled spirits plants and withdrawals from one or more distilled spirits plants, the person may instead submit a single unit bond that provides all of the guarantees that would otherwise be provided by separate operations and withdrawal bonds. The unit bond may also provide coverage for operations at adjacent bonded wine cellars. For purposes of this section, a person includes a corporation, together with all of its controlled subsidiaries, and a controlled subsidiary has the same meaning as in § 19.163(b).
(b)
Required penal sum
—(1)
General.
A person must determine the penal sum for the unit bond by separately calculating in accordance with § 19.166, and then totaling, the amounts needed to cover operations and withdrawals at each individual plant covered by the bond. The penal sum for the unit bond must not be less than the sum of the minimum penal sums that would be required if each of the plants had its own bond.
(2)
Allocation between operations and withdrawals.
A unit bond must show separately the amount of coverage provided for operations (including operations at each adjacent bonded wine cellar if applicable) and for withdrawals at each distilled spirits plant covered by the bond.
(3)
Tax liability must not exceed allocated penal sum.
If the amount of the penal sum allocated to operations at, or withdrawals from, a particular plant is less than the maximum amount prescribed in § 19.166 for a single plant, the tax liability for operations at, or withdrawals from, that plant must not exceed that allocated amount.
(4)
Total penal sum available for each plant.
Even when the penal sum of a unit bond is allocated among multiple plants, the bond must provide that the total penal amount of the bond will be available to satisfy any liability incurred under the terms and conditions of the bond at any plant covered by the bond.
(26 U.S.C. 5173)
§ 19.166
Required penal sums.
A person must determine the penal sums for the various bonds required by this subpart according to the following table:
(a) Operations bond for a single plant operating as a:

§ 19.167
Increase of bond coverage.
(a)
When required.
If the penal sum of a bond is less than the maximum amount specified by § 19.166, and liabilities increase to the point where they exceed the bond coverage, the proprietor must increase the amount of the bond to cover the increased liability. The proprietor must increase the bond coverage either by replacing the existing bond with a new, larger bond that covers the entire liability, or by supplementing the existing bond with a separate strengthening bond in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.
(b)
Strengthening bonds.
A strengthening bond is a second bond with the same surety as on the original bond which covers the increased liability. A strengthening bond must show both its execution date and its effective date. TTB will not accept a strengthening bond if it contains any term or condition that is a release, or could be interpreted as a release, from liability under any former bond, or that limits the liability of any bond to less than its full penal sum.
(26 U.S.C. 5173)
§ 19.168
Superseding bonds and new bonds for existing proprietors.
(a)
Superseding bonds.
A new bond that replaces another bond is called a superseding bond. The proprietor must replace an existing bond with a superseding bond in any of the following circumstances:
(1)
Surety company no longer acceptable.
The proprietor must file a superseding bond if the surety on the proprietor's current bond becomes insolvent or if the surety is removed from the list of approved sureties in Treasury Department Circular 570 (see § 19.153). TTB may also require the filing of a superseding bond if any other contingency affecting the validity or efficiency of the bond arises.
(2)
Change of control.
An executor, administrator, assignee, receiver, trustee, or other person acting in a fiduciary capacity, continuing or liquidating the business of the principal on a bond, must either provide TTB with a superseding bond, or obtain consent from the surety on each existing bond when assuming control of the business.
(3)
Termination of bond by surety.
If the surety applies to terminate a bond under § 19.171, and the proprietor wishes to continue the activity covered by the bond, the proprietor must file a superseding bond that becomes effective on or before the termination date of the existing bond. The superseding bond must show both its execution date and its effective date.
(b)
New bonds for existing proprietors
—(1)
General.
Subject to paragraph (b)(2) of this section, if an existing proprietor has not furnished a bond or bonds covering operations and withdrawals of distilled spirits for nonindustrial use because the proprietor was exempt from bond requirements under § 19.151(d), the proprietor must furnish a bond or bonds as provided in this subpart beginning in any portion of a calendar year following the first date on which the aggregate amount of tax due
from the proprietor during the calendar year exceeds $50,000. When furnishing the bond or bonds, the proprietor must also file an amendment to TTB F 5110.41, Registration of Distilled Spirits Plant, as provided in § 19.136 to change the proprietor's bond status.
(2)
Grace period for bonds covering operations.
An existing proprietor who must furnish an operations bond as provided in paragraph (b)(1) of this section will be treated as having furnished the required bond if the proprietor submits the bond on TTB F 5110.56 no later than 30 days following the first date on which the aggregate amount of tax due from the proprietor during the relevant calendar year exceeds $50,000. The proprietor will be treated as having furnished the required operations bond for purposes of this paragraph until TTB approves or disapproves the bond.
(3)
Bonds covering withdrawals.
Paragraph (b)(2) of this section does not apply to withdrawal bonds. If an existing proprietor must furnish a withdrawal bond as provided in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the proprietor may not withdraw distilled spirits from the bonded premises on a tax deferred basis until TTB approves the withdrawal bond.

§ 19.169
Effect of failure to furnish a superseding bond or a new bond.
(a)
Operations bond.
Except as provided in § 19.151(d), a person may not operate a distilled spirits plant without an operations bond. A person who does not submit an acceptable superseding operations bond when required to do so under § 19.168(a) must immediately discontinue the activities to which the lapsed bond coverage relates upon lapse of the existing bond coverage. If a proprietor must furnish an operations bond under § 19.168(b)(1) and does not submit an operations bond within the time prescribed in § 19.168(b)(2), the proprietor must immediately discontinue the activities required to be covered by the operations bond.
(b)
Withdrawal bond.
Except as provided in § 19.151(d), a person may not defer payment of taxes on spirits withdrawn from a distilled spirits plant upon determination of tax without a withdrawal bond. If a person is required to submit a new or superseding withdrawal bond under § 19.168, the person must submit the bond in accordance with that section. A person who does not submit and receive approval of an acceptable withdrawal bond when required to do so under § 19.168 may not withdraw distilled spirits from the bonded premises on a deferred basis. Upon lapse of the existing bond coverage, or upon the date a new bond is required under § 19.168(b), the person must pay the tax at the time of withdrawal, except in the case of distilled spirits withdrawn free of tax or withdrawn without payment of tax under 26 U.S.C. 5214 or withdrawn exempt from tax under 26 U.S.C. 7510.
(c)
Unit bond.
A person who does not provide an acceptable superseding unit bond when required to do so under § 19.168 must immediately discontinue the business or distilled spirits operations to which the lapsed bond coverage relates. Upon lapse of the existing bond coverage the person must also pay the tax at the time of withdrawal, except in the case of distilled spirits withdrawn free of tax or withdrawn without payment of tax under 26 U.S.C. 5214 or withdrawn exempt from tax under 26 U.S.C. 7510.

§ 19.170
Termination of bonds.
Liability under operations bonds, withdrawal bonds, and unit bonds may be terminated for future withdrawals, future production, or future deposits as set forth below:
(a)
On application by the surety.
A surety may terminate a bond by filing a notice as provided in § 19.171;
(b)
By replacement of the bond.
A principal may terminate an existing bond by replacing it with a superseding bond approved by TTB;
(c)
By discontinuing withdrawals.
A principal may terminate a withdrawal bond by notifying TTB that the principal has stopped making withdrawals covered by the bond, if the bond was filed solely as a withdrawal bond;
(d)
By discontinuing the business.
A principal may terminate a bond by notifying TTB that the principal has discontinued business; and
(e)
On application by an existing proprietor who becomes exempt from bond requirements.
If a proprietor has held a bond or bonds covering operations or withdrawals of distilled spirits for nonindustrial use and becomes exempt from those bond requirements as provided under § 19.151(d), the proprietor may apply to TTB to terminate the bond or bonds covering such operations or withdrawals. To apply, the proprietor must file an amendment to TTB F 5110.41, Registration of Distilled Spirits Plant, as provided in § 19.136. The proprietor must accurately state in the submission that the proprietor:
