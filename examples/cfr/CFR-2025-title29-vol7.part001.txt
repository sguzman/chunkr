# Subpart E—Opening and Closing Hatches
§ 1918.41
Coaming clearances.
(a)
Weather decks.
If a deck load (such as lumber or other smooth sided deck cargo) more than five feet (1.52 m) high is stowed within three feet (.91 m) of the hatch coaming and employees handling hatch beams and hatch covers are not protected by a coaming at least 24-inch (.61 m) high, a taut handline shall be provided along the side of the deckload. The requirements of § 1918.35 are not intended to apply in this situation.
(b)
Intermediate decks.
(1) There shall be a three-foot (.91 m) working space between the stowed cargo and the coaming at both sides and at one end of the hatches with athwartship hatch beams, and at both ends of those hatches with fore and aft hatch beams, before intermediate deck hatch covers and hatch beams are removed or replaced. Exception: The three-foot (.91 m) clearance is not required on the covered portion of a partially open hatch, nor is it required when lower decks have been filled to hatch beam height with cargo of such a nature as to provide a safe surface upon which employees may work.
(2) For purposes of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, fitted gratings that are in good condition shall be considered a part of the decking when properly placed within the three-foot (.91 m) area.

§ 1918.52
Specific requirements.
(a)
Preventers.
(1) When preventers are used they shall be of sufficient strength for the intended purpose. They shall be secured to the head of the boom independent of working guys unless, for cast fittings, the strength of the fitting exceeds the total strength of all lines secured to it. Any tails, fittings, or other means of making the preventers fast on the deck shall provide strength equal to that of the preventer itself.
(2) Wire rope clips or knots shall not be used to form eyes in, nor to join sections of, preventer guys.
(b)
Stoppers.
(1) Chain topping lift stoppers shall be in good condition, equipped with fiber tails, and long enough to allow not fewer than three half-hitches in the chain.
(2) Chain stoppers shall be shackled or otherwise secured so that their links are not bent by being passed around fittings. The point of attachment shall be of sufficient strength and so placed that the stoppers are in line with the normal topping lift lead at the time the stopper is applied.
(3) Patent stoppers of the clamp type shall be appropriate for the size of the rope used. Clamps shall be in good condition and free of any substance that would prevent their being drawn tight.
(c)

(d)
Heel blocks.
(1) When an employee works in the bight formed by the heel block, a preventer at least three-quarters of an inch (1.91 cm) in diameter wire rope shall be securely rigged, or equally effective means shall be taken, to hold the block and fall if the heel block attachments fail. Where physical limitations prohibit the fitting of a wire rope preventer of the required size, two turns of a one-half inch (1.27 cm) diameter wire rope shall be sufficient.
(2) If the heel block is not so rigged as to prevent its falling when not under strain, it shall be secured to prevent alternate raising and dropping of the block. This requirement shall not apply when the heel block is at least 10 feet (3.05 m) above the deck when at its lowest point.
(e)
Coaming rollers.
Portable coaming rollers shall be secured by wire preventers in addition to the regular coaming clamps.
(f)
Cargo hooks.
Cargo hooks shall be as close to the junction of the falls as the assembly permits, but never farther than two feet (.61 m) from it. Exception: This provision shall not apply when the construction of the vessel and the operation in progress are such that fall angles are less than 120 degrees. Overhaul chains shall not be shortened by bolting or knotting.
[62 FR 40202, July 25, 1997, as amended at 65 FR 40944, June 30, 2000]

Each guy or preventer shall be placed to prevent it from making contact with any other guy, preventer, or stay.
(b)
Guys.
When alternate positions for securing guys are provided, the guys shall be so placed as to produce a minimum stress and not permit the boom to jackknife.
(c)
Boom placement.
The head of the midship boom shall be spotted no farther outboard of the coaming than is necessary for control of the load.
(d)
Preventers.
(1) Preventers shall be properly secured to suitable fittings other than those to which the guys are secured, and shall be as nearly parallel to the guys as the fittings will permit.
(2) Unless the cleat is also a chock and the hauling part is led through the chock opening, the leads of preventers to cleats shall be such that the direction of the line pull of the preventer is as parallel as possible to the plane of the surface on which the cleat is mounted.
(3) Guys and associated preventers shall be adjusted to share the load as equally as possible where cargo operations are being conducted by burtoning. Exception: Where guys are designed and intended for trimming purposes only, and the preventer is intended to do the function of the guy, the guy may be left slack.
(e)
Cargo falls.
Cargo falls under load shall not be permitted to chafe on any standing or other running rigging. Exception: Rigging shall not be construed to mean hatch coamings or other similar structural parts of the vessel.
(f)
Bull wire.
(1) Where a bull wire is taken to a winch head for lowering or topping a boom, the bull wire shall be secured to the winch head by shackle or other equally strong method. Securing by fiber rope fastening does not meet this requirement.

(f)
Load-indicating devices.
(1) Unless exempted by the provisions of paragraph (f)(1)(viii) of this section, every crane used to load or discharge cargo into or out of a vessel shall be fitted with a load-indicating device or alternative device in proper working condition that shall meet the following criteria:
(i) The type or model of any load-indicating device used shall be such as to provide:
(A) A direct indication in the cab of actual weight hoisted or a means of determining this by reference to crane ratings posted and visible to the operator, except that the use of a dynamometer or simple scale alone will not meet this requirement; or
(B) An automatic weight-moment device (e.g., a computer) providing indications in the cab according to the radius and load at the moment; or
(C) A device that will prevent an overloaded condition.
(ii) The accuracy of the load-indicating device, weight-moment device, or overload protection device shall be such that any indicated load (or limit), including the sum of actual weight hoisted and additional equipment or “add ons” such as slings, sensors, blocks, etc., is within the range between 95 percent (5 percent underload) and 110 percent (10 percent overload) of the actual true total load. Such accuracy shall be required over the range of daily operating variables reasonably anticipated under the conditions of use.
(iii) The device shall enable the operator to decide before making any lift that the load indicating device or alternative device is operative. In the alternative, if the device is not so mounted or attached and does not include such means of checking, it shall be certified by the manufacturer to remain operative for a specific time. The device shall be checked for accuracy, using known values of the load, at the time of every certification survey (see § 1918.11) and at such additional times as may be recommended by the manufacturer.
(iv) When the load indicating device or alternative device is so arranged in the supporting system (crane structure) that its failure could cause the load to be dropped, its strength shall not be the limiting factor of the supporting system (crane structure).
(v) Units of measure in pounds or both pounds and kilograms (or other
indicators of measurement, such as colored indicator lights), capacity of the indicating system, accuracy of the indicating system, and operating instructions and precautions shall be conspicuously marked. If the system used provides no readout but automatically ceases crane operation when the rated load limit is reached under any specific condition of use, the marking shall provide the make and model of the device installed, a description of what it does, how it is operated, and any necessary precautions regarding the system. All of these markings shall be readily visible to the operator.
(vi) All load indicating devices shall operate over the full operating radius. Overall accuracy shall be based on actual applied loads and not on full scale (full capacity) load.

# Note to paragraph (
f

# )(1)(
vi

# ):
If the accuracy of the load indicating device is based on full scale loads and the device is arbitrarily set at plus or minus 10 percent, it would accept a reading between 90,000 and 110,000 lbs. at full capacity for a machine with a maximum rating of 100,000 lbs. but would also show a reading of between zero and 20,000 lbs. at that outreach (radius) at which the load would be 10,000 lbs.; this is clearly unacceptable. If, however, the accuracy of the device is based on actual applied loads under the same conditions, the acceptable range would remain the same with the 100,000-lb. load but would show a figure between 9,000 and 11,000 lbs. at the 10,000-lb. load; this is an acceptable reading.
(vii) When a load-indicating device uses the radius as a factor in its use or in its operating indications, the indicated radius (which may be in feet and/or meters, or degrees of boom angle, depending on the system used) shall be within the range between 97 percent and 110 percent of the actual (true) radius. When radius is presented in degrees, and feet or meters are required for necessary determinations, a conversion chart shall be provided.
(viii) The load indicating device requirements of this paragraph do not apply to a crane:
(A) Of the trolley equipped bridge type while handling containers known to be and identified as empty, or loaded, and in either case according to the provisions of § 1918.85(b) of this part, or while hoisting other lifts by means of a lifting beam supplied by the crane manufacturer for the purpose and in all cases within the crane rating;
(B) While handling bulk commodities or cargoes by means of clamshell bucket or magnet;
(C) While used to handle or hold hoses in connection with transfer of bulk liquids, or other hose-handled products; or
(D) While the crane is used exclusively to handle cargo or equipment whose total actual gross weight is marked on the unit or units hoisted, and the total actual gross weight never exceeds 11,200 lbs., and the load is less than the rated capacity of the crane at the maximum outreach possible at the time.

# Instructions
1. Every lifting appliance shall be tested with a test load which shall exceed the Safe Working Load (SWL) as follows:
SWL
Test load
Up to 20 tonnes
25 percent in excess.
20 to 50 tonnes
5 tonnes in excess.
Over 50 tonnes
10 percent in excess.
2. In the case of derrick systems, the test load shall be lifted with the ship's normal tackle with the derrick at the minimum angle to the horizontal for which the derrick system was designed (generally 15 degrees), or at such greater angle as may be agreed. The angle at which the test was made should be stated in the certificate.
2.1. The SWL shown is applicable to swinging derrick systems only. When derricks are used in union purchase, the SWL (U) is to be shown on Form 2 (U).
2.2. In the case of heavy derricks, care should be taken to ensure that the appropriate stays are correctly rigged.
3. In the case of cranes, the test load is to be hoisted and luffed at slow speed. Gantry and traveling cranes together with their trolleys, where appropriate, are to be traversed and traveled over the full length of their track.
3.1. In the case of variable load-radius cranes, the tests are generally to be carried out with the appropriate test load at maximum, minimum and intermediate radii.
3.2. In the case of hydraulic cranes where limitations of pressure make it impossible to lift a test load 25 percent in excess of the safe working load, it will be sufficient to lift the greatest possible load, but in general this should not be less than 10 percent in excess of the safe working load.
4. As a general rule, tests should be carried out using test loads, and no exception should be allowed in the case of initial tests. In the case of repairs/replacement or when the periodic examination calls for re-test, consideration may be given to the use of spring or hydraulic balances provided the SWL of the lifting appliance does not exceed 15 tonnes. Where a spring or hydraulic balance is used, it shall be calibrated and accurate to within #2 percent and the indicator should remain constant for five minutes.
4.1. If the test weights are not used, this is to be indicated in Col. (3).
5. The expression “tonne” shall mean a tonne of 1000 kg.

# Appendix III to Part 1918—The Mechanics of Conventional Cargo Gear (Non-mandatory)

# Note:
This appendix is non-mandatory and provides an explanation of the mechanics in the correct spotting of cargo handling gear.
Although the most prevalent method of cargo handling is accomplished through the use of modern shoreside container gantry cranes, there are occasions when break-bulk cargo is handled with conventional ship's cargo gear. This appendix provides a reference for those unfamiliar with such cargo gear.
Sections 1918.52, 1918.53, and 1918.54 all address the subject of rigging and operating vessel's cargo handling gear. It is important to understand that under the Burton System of cargo handling (conventional gear consisting of two cargo derricks with married falls), the midships or up-and-down boom should be spotted as close to the fore and aft centerline of the hatch as operationally possible. Such spotting of the up-and-down boom will allow the most effective leads for the guy(s) and preventer(s) to safely support the lateral stresses generated in the boom(s) by the married falls. As the lead of the guy(s) and preventer(s) approaches the vertical, in supporting the boom(s) head, the total stress in the guy(s) increases rapidly due to the increased vertical force that is generated in the guy(s) in order to counteract any particular horizontal or lateral force exerted on the boom(s) head. The appreciable vertical forces that are generated in this process are transmitted, in substantial part, to the boom(s) and topping lift(s), causing proportionate compressive stresses in the boom(s) and tension stresses in the topping lift(s).
In general, guys and preventers must be located so that enough vertical resistance is developed so as to prohibit the boom(s) from jackknifing as cargo passes across the deck. Special care must be exercised in the proper placement of guys and preventers associated with the Burton or yard boom. Preventers, when used, must parallel as closely as possible the guys that they support. Guys and preventers must not be attached to the same fitting.
While under a load, the cargo falls (running rigging) must not be permitted to chafe on any standing or other running gear. Special attention must be paid to ensure that cargo runners work freely through the heel block, without chafing the cheek of the block. Also, bobbing chains and heel block preventers must be attached so as to not interfere with the movement of the cargo runners.

The assumption is made that gear in use prior to January 21, 1998, has already been proof load tested, although not necessarily by an accredited agency. However, if the employer cannot certify that such gear was proof load tested under § 1918.61(b), in effect prior to January 21, 1998, (See 29 CFR Parts 1911 to 1925 revised as of July 1, 1997), than it must be proof load tested in accordance with § 1918.61 in effect on January 21, 1998, (See 29 CFR Parts 1911 to 1925 revised as of July 1, 1998.)

§ 1919.2
Definition of terms.
(a)
Vessel
means every description of watercraft or other artificial contrivance used, or capable of being used, as a means of transportation on water, including special-purpose floating structures not primarily designed for or used as a means of transportation on water.
(b) Except as otherwise noted,
cargo gear,
as used in subparts B through E of this part, includes that gear forming a part of a vessel's equipment which is used for the handling of cargo other than bulk liquids, but does not include gear which is used only for handling or holding hoses, handling ships' stores, or handling the gangway, or boom conveyor belt.
(c) With reference to equipment covered by this part—
(1)
Derrick
means:
(i) When applied to vessels' cargo handling gear, a mechanical device for lifting, including a boom which is suspended at its head by a topping lift from a mast, king post, or similar structure, controlled in the horizontal plane by vangs, and used either singly or in pairs with married falls;
(ii) When applied to shore-based material handling devices, a mechanical device intended for lifting, with or without a boom supported at its head by a topping lift from a mast, fixed A frame, or similar structure. The mast or equivalent member may or may not be supported by guys or braces. The boom, where fitted, may or may not be controlled in the horizontal plane by guys (vangs). The term includes shear legs.
(2)
Crane
means a mechanical device, intended for lifting or lowering a load and moving it horizontally, in which the hoisting mechanism is an integral part of the machine. A crane may be a fixed or mobile machine.
(3)
Bulk cargo spout
means a spout which may or may not be telescopic and may or may not have removable sections, but is suspended over the vessel from some overhead structure by wire rope or other means. Such a spout is often used with a “thrower” or “trimming machine”. A grain loading spout is an example of those covered by this definition.
(4)
Bulk cargo sucker
means a pneumatic conveyor which utilizes a spoutlike device, which may be adjustable vertically and/or laterally, and which is suspended over a vessel from some overhead structure by wire rope or other means. An example of an installation of this nature is the “grain sucker” used to discharge grain from barges.

(b) Safe working loads assigned to assembled units of gear, shall be based on
applicable design criteria acceptable to the accredited person. Where no design data on which to base a rating is obtainable, the safe working load ratings assigned shall be based on the owner's information and warranty that those so assigned are correct. Unit test certificates shall state the basis for any such safe working load assignment.
§ 1919.14
Initial tests of cargo gear and tests after alterations, renewals or repairs.
(a)(1) Before being taken into use, hoisting machines, fixed gear aboard vessels accessory thereto, and loose gear and wire rope used in connection therewith shall be tested and examined and the safe working load thereof certified in the manner set forth in subpart E of this part.
(2) Replacement or additional loose gear and wire rope obtained from time to time shall also be tested and examined in the manner set forth in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. However, the replacement of a component part of an article of loose gear such as a sheave, pin, or bushing does not require a new test certificate as long as the new component at least equals in all particulars the part replaced.
(b) In the case of untested gear which has been in use, an initial test in conformance with paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall be carried out:
Provided, however,
That existing standing rigging and wire rope will not be required to be tested but shall be thoroughly examined to ascertain its fitness for continued use in conformance with the requirements of §§ 1919.24 and 1919.25.
(c) In the case of important alterations or renewals of the machinery and gear and also after repairs due to failure of or damage to other than loose components, a test as required in paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall be carried out.
(d) If the operation in which cargo gear is engaged never utilizes more than a fraction of the safe working load rating, the owner may, at his option, have said gear certificated for, and limited in operation to, a lesser maximum safe working load:
Provided, however,
That the gear concerned is physically capable of operation at the original load rating and the load reduction is not for the purpose of avoiding correction of any deficiency.
(e) In no case shall safe working loads be increased beyond the original design limitations unless such increase is based on engineering calculations by or acceptable to the accredited certification agency, and all necessary structural changes are carried out.
§ 1919.15
Periodic tests, examinations and inspections.
After being taken into use, every hoisting machine, all fixed gear aboard vessels accessory thereto and loose gear used in connection therewith shall be tested, thoroughly examined or inspected as follows:
(a) Derricks with their winches and accessory gear, including the attachments, as a unit; and cranes and other hoisting machines with their accessory gear, as a unit, shall be tested and thoroughly examined every 5 years in the manner set forth in subpart E of this part.

(c) All hoisting machines (e.g., cranes, winches, blocks, shackles, and all other accessory gear) not included in paragraph (b) of this section shall be thoroughly examined every 12 months by means of a visual examination, supplemented as necessary by other means, such as a hammer test or with electronic, ultrasonic, or other nondestructive methods, carried out as carefully as conditions permit in order to arrive at a reliable conclusion as to the safety of the parts examined. Particular attention shall be paid to the suitability for continued use of all swivels and the pins and bushings of blocks. If necessary, parts of the machines or gear shall be dismantled. If blocks are disassembled, all shell bolt nuts shall be securely locked upon reassembly.
(d) Where a derrick or crane is mounted on a barge hull, and ballast tanks within the hull are used to facilitate use of the derrick or crane, or uncontrolled free surface may be a factor,
each annual inspection or examination, as required, shall include such inspection as is necessary for the purpose of determining the integrity of any internals contributing to stability under conditions of use. The owner shall provide the accredited person with necessary information on any ballasting arrangements required.
(e) Annual inspection or examination, as required, shall include, among other things, examination of the following:
(1) Derrick heel attachment points. Heel pins may, if possible, be examined by nondestructive examination.
(2) Shrouds and stays necessary in the use of the gear, together with attachment points.
(3) Deck fittings for the securing of vangs, topping lifts, and/or preventers.
(4) Means of attachment to the hull of “A” frame or other fixed derrick or crane structure and of mobile types of equipment permanently placed aboard the barge or vessel.
(5) Clamshell buckets or other similar equipment, such as magnets, etc., used in conjunction with a derrick or crane mounted aboard a vessel, with particular attention to closing line wires and sheaves.

All types of winches and cranes shall be provided with means to stop and hold the proof load in any position, and the efficiency of such means shall be demonstrated. Electric winches, electrohydraulic winches fitted with electromagnetic or hydraulic brakes at the winch, or electric cranes shall be equipped so that a failure of the electric power shall stop the motion and set the brakes without any action on the part of the operator. Current for operation of electric winches and cranes during the tests shall be taken from the vessel's circuits. Shore current may be used if it passes through the vessel's main switchboard.
§ 1919.23
Means of derrick attachment.
Appropriate measures shall be taken to prevent the foot of a derrick from being accidentally lifted from its socket or support during the test.
§ 1919.24
Limitations on use of wire rope.
(a) An eye splice made in any wire rope shall have at least three tucks with a whole strand of rope and two tucks with one-half of the wires cut out of each strand. However, this requirement shall not operate to preclude the use of another form of splice or connection which can be shown to be as efficient and which is not prohibited by part 1918 of this chapter.
(b) Except for eye splices in the ends of wires, each wire rope used in hoisting or lowering, in guying derricks, or as a topping lift, preventer or pendant shall consist of one continuous piece without knot or splice.
(c) Eyes in the ends of wire rope cargo falls shall not be formed by knots and, in single part falls, shall not be formed by wire rope clips.
(d) The ends of falls shall be secured to the winch drums by clamps, U-bolts, shackles or some other equally strong method. Fiber rope fastenings shall not be used.
(e) Wire rope shall not be used for the vessel's cargo gear if in any length of eight diameters, the total number of visible broken wires exceeds 10 percent of the total number of wires, or if the rope shows other signs of excessive wear, corrosion, or defect. Particular attention shall be given to the condition of those sections of wire rope adjacent to any terminal connections, those sections exposed to abnormal wear, and those sections not normally exposed for examination.
§ 1919.25
Limitations on use of chains.
Chains forming a part of vessel's cargo gear shall not be used when, due to stretch, the increase of length of a measured section exceeds five percent, when a link is damaged, or when other external defects are evident. Chains shall not be shortened by bolting, wiring, or knotting.

# Subpart E—Certification of Vessels: Tests and Proof Loads; Heat Treatment; Competent Persons
§ 1919.26
Visual inspection before tests.
Before any test under this subpart E is carried out, a visual inspection of the gear involved shall be conducted and any visibly defective gear shall be replaced or repaired. The provisions of § 1919.15(d) shall be adhered to.
§ 1919.27
Unit proof tests—winches, derricks and gear accessory thereto.
(a) Winches, with the whole of the gear accessory thereto (including derricks, goosenecks, eye plates, eye bolts, or other attachments), shall be tested with a proof load which shall exceed the safe working load as follows:
Safe working load
Proof load
Up to 20 tons
25 percent in excess.
20-50 tons
5 tons in excess.
Over 50 tons
10 percent in excess.
(b) The proof load shall be lifted with the vessel's normal tackle with the derrick at an angle not more than 15 degrees to the horizontal, or, at the designed minimum angle when this is greater, or, when this is impracticable, at the lowest practicable angle. The angle at which the test was made shall be stated in the certificate of test. After the proof load has been lifted, it shall be swung as far as possible in both directions. In applying the proof load, the design factors of the gear concerned will determine whether the load is applied with a single part fall or with a purchase and the certificate of test shall state the means used. Where winches are fitted with mechanical brakes for manual operation they shall be demonstrated to be in satisfactory operating condition.
(c) In the case of heavy lift derrick barges, proof loads shall be applied, except as limited by design and stability considerations, at the maximum and minimum radii for which designed, as well as at any intermediate radius which the surveyor may deem necessary, and shall be swung as far as possible in both directions. Data with respect to each proof load applied shall be entered in the test certificate.
(d) No items of cargo gear furnished by outside sources shall be used as a part of the vessel's gear for the purpose of accomplishing the proof test.
(e) All tests prescribed by this section should in general be carried out by dead load, except that in the case of quadrennial tests, replacements, or renewals, spring or hydraulic balances may be used where dead loads are not reasonably available. However, no exception shall be allowed in the case of gear on new vessels.
(f) The test shall not be regarded as satisfactory unless the indicator remains constant under the proof load for a period of at least 5 minutes.
(g)(1) The safe working load, determined pursuant to the requirements of this section, shall be applicable only to a swinging derrick. When using two fixed derricks in “union purchase” rigs, the safe working load should generally be reduced. It is recommended that owners obtain union purchase safe working load certification based upon design study and analysis by, or acceptable to, a qualified technical office of an accredited gear certification agency, with the recognition that such determinations are valid only for the conditions contemplated in the analysis.
(2) Where both guys and preventers are fitted, union purchase certification shall state whether the guy or the preventer is the working strength member, when the guy is for slewing only, and when the guy and preventer should share working loads as far as practicable.
(h) When necessary in the proof testing of heavy derricks, the appropriate shrouds and stays shall be rigged.
§ 1919.28
Unit proof tests—cranes and gear accessory thereto.
(a) Except as noted in paragraph (e) of this section, cranes and other hoisting machines, together with gear accessory thereto, shall be tested with a proof load which shall exceed the safe working load as follows:
Safe working load
Proof load
Up to 20 tons
25 percent in excess.
20-50 tons
5 tons in excess.
Over 50 tons
10 percent in excess.
(b) The proof load shall be lifted and swung as far as possible in both directions. If the jib or boom of the crane has a variable radius, it shall be tested with proof loads, as specified in paragraph (a) of this section, at the maximum and minimum radii. In the case of hydraulic cranes, when due to the limitation of pressure it is impossible to lift a load 25 percent in excess of the safe working load, it will be sufficient to lift the greatest possible load.
(c) Initial proof tests of new cranes shall be made only with a dead load as specified in paragraph (b) of this section.
(d) Initial tests of cranes which have been in service, quadrennial tests, or tests associated with replacements or renewals, may be made with spring or hydraulic balances where dead loads are not reasonably available under the following conditions:
(1) Tests shall be conducted at maximum, minimum, and intermediate radius points, as well as such points in the arc of rotation as meet with the approval of the accredited person.
(2) An additional test shall be conducted with partial load and shall include all functions and movements contemplated in the use of the crane.
(e) In cases where shore-type cranes are mounted permanently aboard barges, the requirements of this Subpart E with respect to unit proof tests and examinations shall not apply and the applicable requirements of Subpart H of this part shall be adhered to with respect to unit proof tests and examinations.
§ 1919.29
Limitations on safe working loads and proof loads.
The proof loads specified by §§ 1919.27 and 1919.28 shall be adjusted as necessary to meet any pertinent limitations based on stability and/or on structural competence at particular radii. Safe working loads shall be reduced accordingly.
§ 1919.30
Examinations subsequent to unit tests.
(a) After satisfactory completion of the unit proof load tests required by §§ 1919.27 and 1919.28, the cargo gear and all component parts thereof shall be given a thorough visual examination, supplemented as necessary by other means, such as a hammer test or with electronic, ultrasonic, or other nondestructive methods, to determine if any of the parts were damaged, deformed, or otherwise rendered unsafe for further use.
(b) When the test of gear referred to in paragraph (a) of this section is being conducted for the first time on a vessel, accessory gear shall be dismantled or disassembled for examination after the test. The sheaves and pins of the blocks included in this test need not be removed unless there is evidence of deformation or failure.
(c) For subsequent tests such parts of the gear shall be dismantled or disassembled after the test as necessary to determine their suitability for continued service.
(d) When blocks are disassembled all shell bolt nuts shall be securely locked upon reassembly.
(e) In carrying out the requirements of this section, replacement shall be required of:
(1) Any swivel found to have excessive tolerance as a result of wear on any bearing surface.
(2) Pins of blocks found to be shouldered, notched, or grooved from wear, in which case, in addition to replacing the pin, sheave bushings shall be examined for suitability for continued use.
§ 1919.31
Proof tests—loose gear.
(a) Chains, rings, shackles and other loose gear (whether accessory to a machine or not) shall be tested with a proof load against the article equal to that shown in the following table:
Article of gear
Proof load
Chain, ring, hook, shackle or swivel
100 percent in excess of the safe working load.
Blocks:
Single sheave block
300 percent in excess of the safe working load.
1
Multiple sheave block with safe working load up to and including 20 tons
100 percent in excess of the safe working load.
Multiple sheave block with safe working load over 20 tons up to and including 40 tons
20 tons in excess of the safe working load.
Multiple sheave block with safe working load over 40 tons
50 percent in excess of the safe working load.
Pitched chains used with hand-operated blocks and rings, hooks, shackles or swivels permanently attached thereto
50 percent in excess of the safe working load.
Hand-operated blocks used with pitched chains and rings, hooks, shackles or swivels permanently attached thereto
50 percent in excess of the safe working load.
1
The proof load applied to the block is equivalent to twice the maximum resultant load on the eye of pin of the block when lifting the nominal safe working load defined in (i) below. The proof load is, therefore, equal to four times the safe working load as defined in (i) below or twice the safe working load as defined in (ii) below.
(i) The nominal safe working load of a single-sheave block should be the maximum load which can be safely lifted by the block when the load is attached to a rope which passes around the sheave of the block.
(ii) In the case of a single-sheave block where the load is attached directly to the block instead of to a rope passing around the sheave, it is permissible to lift a load equal to twice the nominal safe working load of the block as defined in (i) above.
(iii) In the case of a lead block so situated that an acute angle cannot be formed by the two parts of the rope passing over it (i.e., the angle is always 90° or more), the block need not have a greater nominal safe working load than one-half the maximum resultant load which can be placed upon it.
(b) In cases where persons accredited to carry out loose gear tests may be retained to conduct tests of special stevedoring gear as described in § 1918.61(b) of this chapter, which does not form part of a vessel's equipment, such tests shall adhere to the requirements set forth in § 1918.61(b) (1), (2), and (3) of this chapter.
(c) After being tested as required by paragraph (a) of this section, and before being taken into use, all chains, rings, hooks, shackles, blocks or other loose gear, except as noted in § 1919.32, shall be thoroughly examined, the sheaves and pins of the blocks being removed for this purpose, to determine whether any part has been injured or permanently deformed by the test. Shell bolt nuts shall be securely locked upon reassembly. Defective loose gear components shall be replaced before the certificate is issued.
(d) Any certificate relating to shackles, swivels or strength members of single-sheave blocks which have been restored to original dimensions by welding shall state this fact.
§ 1919.32
Specially designed blocks and components.
(a) Blocks and connecting components of an unusual nature which are specially designed and constructed as an integral part of a particular lifting unit and are either permanently affixed or of such design that two or more components must be tested together need not be considered as loose gear for purposes of § 1919.31.
(b) In lieu of the loose gear proof test required by § 1919.31(a), design data shall be submitted to an accredited certification agency indicating design and material specifications and analysis whereby the designed strength of such gear may be determined.
(c) Subsequent to the test of the lifting unit as a whole, a thorough visual examination shall be made of disassembled parts and an electronic, ultrasonic, or other equally efficient nondestructive examination shall be made of those parts not dismantled to ensure the safe condition of such parts.
§ 1919.33
Proof tests—wire rope.
Wire rope, except as provided in § 1919.14(b), shall be tested by sample, a piece being tested to destruction, and the safe working load of running ropes, unless otherwise acceptable to the Administration on the basis of design, shall not exceed one-fifth of the breaking load of the sample tested. In the case of running ropes used in gear with a safe working load exceeding 10 tons, the safe working load shall not exceed one-fourth of the breaking load of the sample tested.
§ 1919.34
Proof tests after repairs or alterations.
When proof loads are applied after repairs or alterations, all parts of the assembled gear shall be examined as required in §§ 1919.30, 1919.31(c), or 1919.32(c), whichever is applicable.
§ 1919.35
Order of tests.
When both unit and loose gear proof load tests are required, the loose gear test may be carried out after completion of the unit test.
§ 1919.36
Heat treatment.
(a) The annealing of wrought iron gear required by this part shall be accomplished at a temperature between 1100° and 1200 °F. and the exposure shall be of between 30 and 60 minutes duration. After being annealed, the gear shall be allowed to cool slowly and shall then be carefully inspected. All annealing shall be carried out in a closed furnace.
(b) When heat treatment of loose gear made of other than wrought iron or steel is recommended by the manufacturer, it shall be carried out in accordance with the specifications of the manufacturer.

Safe working load
Proof Load
Up to 20 tons
25 percent in excess.
20-50 tons
5 tons in excess.
Over 50 tons
10 percent in excess.
Proof loads shall be applied at the designed maximum and minimum boom angles or radii, or, if this is impracticable, as close to these as practicable. The angles or radii of test shall be stated in the certificate of test. Proof loads shall be swung as far as possible in both directions. The weight of all auxiliary handling devices shall be considered a part of the load.

Unit test certificates shall state the basis for any such safe working load assignment.
§ 1919.76
Safe working load reduction.
(a) If the operation in which equipment is engaged never utilizes more than a fraction of the safe working
load rating, the owner of such equipment may, at his option, have the crane or derrick certificated for and operated at a lesser maximum safe working load in keeping with the use and based on radius and other pertinent factors:
Provided, however,
That the equipment concerned is physically capable of operation at the original load rating and the load reduction is not for the purpose of avoiding correction of any deficiency.
§ 1919.77
Safe working load increase.
(a) In no case shall safe working loads be increased beyond the manufacturer's ratings or original design limitations unless such increase meets with the manufacturer's approval. Where the manufacturer's services are not available, or where the equipment is of foreign manufacture, engineering design analysis by, or acceptable to, the accredited certification agency is required. All necessary structural changes shall be carried out.
§ 1919.78
Nondestructive examinations.
(a) Wherever it is considered necessary by the accredited person or his authorized representative and wherever it is practical and advisable to avoid disassembly of equipment, removal of pins, etc., examination of structure or parts by electronic, ultrasonic, or other nondestructive methods may be carried out, provided that the procedure followed is acceptable to the Assistant Secretary and the person carrying out such examination is accredited or acceptable to the Assistant Secretary for the purpose.

§ 1921.14
Exceptions.
Within 20 days after the date of the decision of the hearing examiner, the
parties may file exceptions thereto with supporting reasons. Any party who desires to take exception to any matter set out in that decision shall transmit his exceptions in writing to the Chief Hearing Examiner, referring to the specific findings of fact, conclusions of law, or order excepted to, and the specific pages of transcript relevant to the exceptions, and suggesting corrected findings of fact, conclusions of law, or order.

Decision and order of the Director.
(a) Upon the basis of and after due consideration of the whole record, the Assistant Secretary shall render his decision, which shall adopt, modify, or set aside the findings, conclusions, and order contained in the decision of the hearing examiner, and shall include a statement of the reasons or bases for the action taken. With respect to the findings of fact, the Assistant Secretary shall upset only those findings that are clearly erroneous. Copies of the decision and order shall be served upon the parties.
(b) When a final order of the Assistant Secretary issued pursuant to § 1921.13(c) or paragraph (a) of this section has been in force for 2 years or more, a party may file with the Assistant Secretary a petition for modification or vacation of the order. Such petition must be in writing, and must be based upon satisfactory compliance with the order during the 24 months immediately preceding the filing thereof and upon such changes in conditions and circumstances as to demonstrate, if established, that a continuation of the order in full force and effect is no longer required to assure satisfactory compliance with the regulations under the order. Such changes in conditions and circumstances as are relied upon must be expressly set forth together with the reasons why petitioner believes relief is justified and the precise nature of the relief sought. The petition may be supported by affidavits as to matters of fact.
(c) If, after such investigation as the Assistant Secretary deems appropriate, in his judgment sufficient cause has been shown to justify the relief requested, he will enter an order granting relief. If in his judgment, sufficient cause has not been shown he shall so notify petitioner, who may then in writing request a hearing. Upon receipt of such request the Assistant Secretary will refer the petition with its supporting documents and the request to the Chief Hearing Examiner who will assign the matter for a hearing to be held on not less than 10 days notice at a time and place to be set by the hearing examiner. The Deputy Solicitor of Labor may file a pleading and otherwise appear in opposition to the petition. The hearing will be subject to all of the provisions of §§ 1921.9 through 1921.22.

# Authority:
Service Contracts Act of 1965 (41 U.S.C. 351, et. seq.); 5 U.S.C. 301.
§ 1925.1
Scope and application.
(a) The McNamara-O'Hara Service Contract Act of 1965 (79 Stat. 1034, 41 U.S.C. 351, et seq.) requires that every contract entered into by the United States or the District of Columbia in excess of $2,500 (except as provided in section 7 of the Act), the principal purpose of which is to furnish services in the United States through the use of service employees, must contain, among other provisions, a stipulation that “no part of the services covered
by this Act will be performed in buildings or surroundings or under working conditions, provided by or under the control or supervision of the contractor or any subcontractor, which are unsanitary or hazardous or dangerous to the health or safety of service employees engaged to furnish the services.” This part 1925 expresses certain minimum safety and health standards which will be applied in the administration and enforcement of the Act to determine whether services covered by the Act are being, or have been, performed in compliance with its safety and health requirements.
(b)(1) Investigators conducting investigations and all officers of the Department of Labor evaluating, reviewing and analyzing investigations, as well as officers of the Department determining whether there are or have been violations of the safety and health requirements of the Service Contract Act of 1965 or any contract subject thereto and the terms on which there may be a settlement of issues arising from an investigation without resort to administrative or judicial litigation, will consider a failure to comply with the safety and health measures provided in § 1925.2 to result in working conditions which are “unsanitary or hazardous or dangerous to the health or safety of service employees” within the meaning of section 2(a)(3) of the Act and the contract stipulation it requires.
(c) [Reserved]
(d) The standards expressed in this part 1925 are for application to ordinary employment situations, and do not preclude proof or recognition of the necessity for additional standards in employment situations of extraordinary hazard. Neither do the standards expressed in this Part 1925 purport to cover all of the working conditions which are unsanitary or hazardous or dangerous to the health or safety of service employees. Other working conditions may be found to be unsanitary or hazardous or dangerous to the health or safety of such employees on evidence to that effect.
(e) Compliance with the standards expressed in this part 1925 will not relieve anyone from any obligation he may have to comply with any stricter standard, such as state or local law or ordinance or collective bargaining agreement.
