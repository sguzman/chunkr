# Explanation
The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.
Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:
Title 1 through Title 16
as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27
as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41
as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50
as of October 1
The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.

# LEGAL STATUS
The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

# HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS
The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, January 1, 2025), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

# EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES
Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.

# OMB CONTROL NUMBERS
The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request.
Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.

# PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE
Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.

# “[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY
The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not dropped in error.

# INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE
What is incorporation by reference?
Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.
What is a proper incorporation by reference?
The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:
(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.
(b) The matter incorporated is adequately summarized in the preamble of the final rule and is available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.
(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?
If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or email fr.inspection@nara.gov.

# CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES
A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR
Index and Finding Aids.
This volume contains the Parallel Table of Authorities and Rules. A list of CFR titles, chapters, subchapters, and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in this volume.
An index to the text of “Title 3—The President” is carried within that volume.
The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. This index is based on a consolidation of the “Contents” entries in the daily Federal Register.
A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

# REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL
There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing in the Code of Federal Regulations.

# Source:
28 FR 10022, Sept. 14, 1963, unless otherwise noted.
§ 1.1
Positions and employees affected by the rules in this subchapter.
The rules in this subchapter shall apply to all positions in the competitive service and to all incumbents of such positions. Except as expressly provided in the rule concerned, the rules in this subchapter shall not apply to positions and employees in the excepted service.
§ 1.2
Extent of the competitive service.
The competitive service shall include: (a) All civilian positions in the executive branch of the Government unless specifically excepted therefrom by or pursuant to statute or by the Office of Personnel Management (hereafter referred to in this subchapter as OPM) under § 6.1 of this subchapter; and (b) all positions in the legislative and judicial branches of the Federal Government and in the Government of the District of Columbia which are specifically made subject to the civil service laws by statute. OPM is authorized and directed to determine finally whether a position is in the competitive service.
§ 1.3
Definitions.
As used in the rules in this subchapter:
(a)
Competitive service
shall have the same meaning as the words “classified service”, or “classified (competitive) service”, or “classified civil service” as defined in existing statutes and executive orders.
(b)
Competitive position
shall mean a position in the competitive service.
(c)
Competitive status
shall mean basic eligibility to be noncompetitively selected to fill a vacancy in a competitive position. A competitive status shall be acquired by career-conditional or career appointment through open competitive examination upon satisfactory completion of a probationary period, or may be granted by statute, executive order, or the Civil Service Rules without competitive examination. A person with competitive status may be promoted, transferred, reassigned, reinstated, or demoted without taking an open competitive examination, subject to the conditions prescribed by the Civil Service Rules and Regulations.
(d) An employee shall be considered as being in the competitive service when he has a competitive status and occupies a competitive position unless he is serving under a temporary appointment:
Provided,
that an employee who is in the competitive service at the time his position is first listed under Schedule A, B, or C shall be considered as continuing in the competitive service as long as he continues to occupy such position.
(e)
Tenure
shall mean the period of time an employee may reasonably expect to serve under his current appointment. Tenure shall be granted and governed by the type of appointment under which an employee is currently serving without regard to whether he has a competitive status or whether his appointment is to a competitive position or an excepted position.
§ 1.4
Extent of the excepted service.
(a) The excepted service shall include all civilian positions in the executive branch of the Government which are specifically excepted from the requirements of the Civil Service Act or from the competitive service by or pursuant to statute or by OPM under § 6.1 of this subchapter.
(b)
Excepted service
shall have the same meaning as the words “unclassified service”, or “unclassified civil service”, or “positions outside the competitive civil service” as used in existing statutes and executive orders.
(c)
Excepted position
shall have the same meaning as “unclassified position”, or “position excepted by law”, or “position excepted by executive order”, or “position excepted by Civil Service Rule”, or “position outside the competitive service” as used in existing statutes and Executive orders.
Pt. 2

# PART 2—APPOINTMENT THROUGH THE COMPETITIVE SERVICE; RELATED MATTERS (RULE II)
Sec.
2.1
Competitive examinations and eligible registers; suitability and fitness for civil service employment.
2.2
Appointments.
2.3
Apportionment.
2.4
Probationary period.

# Authority:
5 U.S.C. 3301, 3302.

# Source:
28 FR 10023, Sept. 14, 1963, unless otherwise noted.
§ 2.1
Competitive examinations and eligible registers; suitability and fitness for civil service employment.
(a) OPM shall be responsible for:
(i) Open competitive examinations for admission to the competitive service that will fairly test the relative capacity and fitness of the persons examined for the position to be filled.
(ii) Standards with respect to citizenship, age, education, training and experience, physical and mental fitness, and for residence or other requirements that applicants must meet to be admitted to or rated in examinations.
(iii) Standards of suitability based on character and conduct for appointment to a position in the competitive service, for appointment to a position in the excepted service where the incumbent can be noncompetitively converted to the competitive service, and for career appointment to a position in the Senior Executive Service.
(iv) Minimum standards of fitness based on character and conduct for appointment in any other position in the excepted service of the executive branch, except for (A) positions in any element of the intelligence community as defined in the National Security Act of 1947, as amended, to the extent they are not otherwise subject to OPM appointing authorities, and (B) positions where OPM is statutorily precluded from prescribing such standards.”
(b) In addition to the names of persons who qualify in competitive examinations, the names of persons who have lost eligibility on a career or career-conditional register because of service in the armed forces, and the names of persons who lost opportunity for certification or who have served under career or career-conditional appointment when OPM determines that they should be given certification, may also be entered at such places on appropriate registers and under such conditions as OPM may prescribe.
(c) Whenever the Office of Personnel Management (1) is unable to certify a sufficient number of names to permit the appointing officer to consider three eligibles for appointment to a fourth-class postmaster position in accordance with the regular procedure, or (2) finds that a particular rate of compensation for fourth-class postmaster positions is too low to warrant regular competitive examinations for such positions, it may authorize appointment to any such position or positions in accordance with such procedure as may be prescribed by OPM. Persons appointed under this paragraph may acquire competitive status subject to satisfactory completion of a probationary period prescribed by OPM.
[28 FR 10023, Sept. 14, 1963, as amended by E.O. 13764, 82 FR 8115, Jan. 23, 2017]
§ 2.2
Appointments.
(a) OPM shall establish and administer a career-conditional appointment system for positions subject to competitive examinations which will permit adjustment of the career service to necessary fluctuations in Federal employment, and provide an equitable and orderly system for stabilizing the Federal work force. A competitive status shall be acquired by a career-conditional appointee upon satisfactory completion of a probationary period, but the appointee shall have career-conditional tenure for a period of service to be prescribed by regulation of OPM. When an employee has completed
the required period of service his appointment shall be converted to a career appointment without time limitation:
Provided,
That his career-conditional appointment shall not be converted to a career appointment if the limitation on the number of permanent employees in the Federal civil service established under paragraph (b) of this section would be exceeded thereby. Persons selected from competitive civil service registers for other than temporary appointment shall be given career-conditional appointments:
Provided,
That career appointments shall be given to the following classes of eligibles:
(1) Persons whose appointments are required by statute to be made on a permanent basis;
(2) Employees serving under career appointments at the time of selection from such registers;
(3) Former employees who have eligibility for career appointments upon reinstatement; and
(4) To the extent permitted by law, persons appointed to positions in the field service of the U.S. Postal Service for which salary rates are fixed by the act of July 6, 1945, 59 Stat. 435, as heretofore or hereafter amended and supplemented.
(b) Under the career-conditional appointment system there shall be a limit on the number of permanent employees in the Federal civil service which shall be the ceiling established by section 1310 of the Supplemental Appropriation Act, 1952 (65 Stat. 757), as amended. In the event section 1310, supra, is repealed, OPM is authorized to fix such limitation on the number of permanent employees in the Federal civil service as it finds necessary to meet the needs of the service.
(c) OPM may determine the types, duration, and conditions of indefinite and temporary appointments, and may prescribe the method for replacing persons holding such appointments.
§ 2.3
Apportionment.
Subject to such modifications as OPM finds to be necessary in the interest of good administration, appointments to positions in agencies' headquarters offices which are located within the metropolitan area of Washington, DC, shall be made so as to maintain the apportionment of appointments among the several States, Territories, and the District of Columbia upon the basis of population.
§ 2.4
Probationary period.
Persons selected from registers of eligibles for career or career-conditional appointment and employees promoted, transferred, or otherwise assigned, for the first time, to supervisory or managerial positions shall be required to serve a probationary period under terms and conditions prescribed by the Office.

# PART 3—NONCOMPETITIVE ACQUISITION OF STATUS (RULE III)
Sec.
3.1
Classes of persons who may noncompetitively acquire status.
3.2
Appointments without competitive examination in rare cases.
3.3
Conversion of appointments.

# Authority:
5 U.S.C. 3301, 3302.

# Source:
28 FR 10023, Sept. 14, 1963, unless otherwise noted.
§ 3.1
Classes of persons who may noncompetitively acquire status.
(a) Upon recommendation by the agency concerned, and subject to such noncompetitive examination, time limits, or other requirements as OPM may prescribe the following classes of persons may acquire a competitive status without competitive examination:
(1) A person holding a permanent position when it is placed in the competitive service by statute or executive order or is otherwise made subject to competitive examination.
(2) A disabled veteran who, in a manner satisfactory to OPM, has completed a course of training in the executive branch of the Government prescribed by the Administrator of Veterans' Affairs in accordance with the act of March 24, 1943 (57 Stat. 43).
(3) An employee who has served at least two years in the immediate office of the President or on the White House Staff and who is transferred to a competitive position at the request of an agency.
(4) An employee who was serving when his name was reached for certification on a civil service register appropriate for the position in which he was serving:
Provided,
That the recommendation for competitive status is made prior to expiration of the register on which his name appears or is made during a period of continuous service since his name was reached:
Provided further,
That the register was being used for appointments conferring competitive status at the time his name was reached.
(b) Upon recommendation by the employing agency, and subject to such requirements as the Office of Personnel Management may prescribe, the following classes of handicapped employees may acquire competitive status without competitive examination:
(1) A severely physically handicapped employee who completes at least two years of satisfactory service in a position excepted from the competitive service.
(2) A mentally retarded employee who completes at least two years of satisfactory service in a position excepted from the competitive service.
(3) An employee with a psychiatric disability who completes at least 2 years of satisfactory service in a position excepted from the competitive service.
[28 FR 10023, Sept. 14, 1963, as amended by E.O. 12125, 3 CFR, 1979 Comp., p. 375; 65 FR 41868, July 7, 2000]
§ 3.2
Appointments without competitive examination in rare cases.
Subject to receipt of satisfactory evidence of the qualifications of the person to be appointed, OPM may authorize an appointment in the competitive service without competitive examination whenever it finds that the duties or compensation of the position are such, or that qualified persons are so rare, that, in the interest of good civil-service administration, the position cannot be filled through open competitive examination. Any person heretofore or hereafter appointed under this section shall acquire a competitive status upon completion of at least one year of satisfactory service and compliance with such requirements as OPM may prescribe. Detailed statements of the reasons for the noncompetitive appointments made under this section shall be published in OPM's annual reports.
§ 3.3
Conversion of appointments.
Any person who acquires a competitive status under this part shall have his appointment converted to career-conditional appointment unless he meets the service requirement for career appointment prescribed under § 2.2(a) of this subchapter.

Sec.
4.1
Prohibition against political activity.

# Authority:
5 U.S.C. 3301, 3302.
§ 4.1
Prohibition against political activity.
No person employed in the executive branch of the Federal Government, or any agency or department thereof, shall use his official authority or influence for the purpose of interfering with an election or affecting the result thereof.

§ 4.2
Prohibition against racial, political or religious discrimination.
No person employed in the executive branch of the Federal Government who has authority to take or recommend any personnel action with respect to any person who is an employee in the competitive service or any eligible or applicant for a position in the competitive service shall make any inquiry concerning the race, political affiliation, or religious beliefs of any such employee, eligible, or applicant.

Whenever a variation is granted the Director shall note the official record to show:
(a) The particular practical difficulty or hardship involved, (b) what is permitted in place of what is required by regulations, (c) the circumstances which protect or promote the efficiency of the Government and the integrity of the competitive service, and (d) a statement limiting the application of the variation to the continuation of the conditions which gave rise to it.

(i) The Director may require appointments to be made subject to investigation to enable the Director to determine, after appointment, that the requirements of law or the Civil Service Rules and Regulations have been met.
(ii) The Director may cause positions to be designated based on risk to determine the appropriate level of investigation, and may prescribe investigative standards, policies, and procedures.
(iii) The Director may prescribe standards for reciprocal acceptance by agencies of investigations and adjudications of suitability and fitness, except to the extent authority to apply
additional fitness standards is vested by statute in an agency.
(b) Evaluating the effectiveness of: (1) Personnel policies, programs, and operations of Executive and other Federal agencies subject to the jurisdiction of the Office, including their effectiveness with regard to merit selection and employee development; (2) agency compliance with and enforcement of applicable laws, rules, regulations and office directives; and (3) agency personnel management evaluation systems.
(c) Investigating, or directing an agency to investigate and report on, apparent violations of applicable laws, rules, regulations, or directives requiring corrective action, found in the course of an evaluation.

§ 5.3
Enforcement.
(a) The Director is authorized to ensure enforcement of the civil service laws, rules, and regulations, and all applicable Executive orders, by:
(1) Instructing an agency to separate or take other action against an employee serving an appointment subject to investigation when the Director finds that the employee is disqualified or unsuitable for Federal employment. Where the employee or the agency appeals the Director's finding that a separation or other action is necessary, the Director may instruct the agency as to whether or not the employee should remain on duty and continue to receive pay pending adjudication of the appeal:
Provided,
That when an agency separates or takes other action against an employee pursuant to the Director's instructions, and the Director, on the basis of new evidence, subsequently reverses the initial decision as to the employee's qualifications and suitability, the agency shall, upon request of the Director, restore the employee to duty or otherwise reverse any action taken.
(2) Reporting the results of evaluation or investigations to the head of the agency concerned with instructions for any corrective action necessary, including cancellation of personnel actions where appropriate. The Director's findings resulting from evaluations or investigations are binding unless changed as a result of agency evidence and arguments against them. If, during the course of any evaluation or investigation under this section, the Director finds evidence of matters which come within the investigative and prosecutorial jurisdiction of the Special Counsel of the Merit Systems Protection Board, the Director shall refer this evidence to the Special Counsel for appropriate disposition.
(b) Whenever the Director issues specific instructions as to separation or other corrective action with regard to an employee, including cancellation of a personnel action, the head of the agency concerned shall comply with the Director's instructions.
(c) If the agency head fails to comply with the specific instructions of the Director as to separation or other corrective action with regard to an employee, including cancellation of a personnel action, the Director may certify to the Comptroller General of the United States the agency's failure to act together with such additional information as the Comptroller General may require, and shall furnish a copy of such certification to the head of the agency concerned. The individual with respect to whom such separation or other corrective action was instructed shall be entitled thereafter to no pay or only to such pay as appropriate to effectuate the Director's instructions.

All such employees, and all applicants or eligibles for positions covered by these rules, shall give to the Office, the Merit Systems Protection Board, the Special
Counsel, or to their authorized representatives, all information, testimony, documents, and material in regard to the above matters, the disclosure of which is not otherwise prohibited by law or regulation. These employees, applicants, and eligibles shall sign testimony given under oath or affirmation before an officer authorized by law to administer oaths.

§ 6.1
Authority to except positions from the competitive service.
(a) OPM may except positions from the competitive service when it determines that (A) appointments thereto through competitive examination are not practicable, or (B) recruitment from among students attending qualifying educational institutions or individuals who have recently completed qualifying educational programs can better be achieved by devising additional means for recruiting and assessing candidates that diverge from the processes generally applicable to the competitive service. These positions shall be listed in OPM's annual report for the fiscal year in which the exceptions are made.
(b) OPM shall decide whether the duties of any particular position are such that it may be filled as an excepted position under the appropriate schedule.
(c) Notice of OPM's decision granting authority to make appointments to an excepted position under the appropriate schedule shall be published in the
Federal Register.

§ 6.2
Schedules of excepted positions.
OPM shall list positions that it excepts from the competitive service in Schedules A, B, C, and D, and it shall list the position of administrative law judge in Schedule E, which schedules shall constitute parts of this rule, as follows:
Schedule A. Positions other than those of a confidential or policy-determining character for which it is not practicable to examine shall be listed in Schedule A.
Schedule B. Positions other than those of a confidential or policy-determining character for which it is not practicable to hold a competitive examination shall be listed in Schedule B. Appointments to these positions shall be subject to such noncompetitive examination as may be prescribed by OPM.
Schedule C. Positions of a confidential or policy-determining character shall be listed in Schedule C.
Schedule D. Positions other than those of a confidential or policy-determining character for which the competitive service requirements make impracticable the adequate recruitment of sufficient numbers of students attending qualifying educational institutions or individuals who have recently completed qualifying educational programs shall be listed in Schedule D. These positions are temporarily placed in the excepted service to enable more effective recruitment from all segments of society by using means of recruiting and assessing candidates that diverge from the rules generally applicable to the competitive service.
Schedule E. Positions of administrative law judge appointed under 5 U.S.C. 3105 shall be listed in Schedule E. Conditions of good administration warrant placing the position of administrative law judge in the excepted service and exempting appointment to this position from the requirements of 5 CFR, part 302, including examination and rating requirements, though each agency shall follow the principle of veteran preference as far as administratively feasible.
[E.O. 14029, 86 FR 27025, May 19, 2021]
§ 6.3
Method of filling excepted positions and status of incumbents.
(a) The head of an agency may fill excepted positions by the appointment of
persons without civil service eligibility or competitive status and such persons shall not acquire competitive status by reason of such appointment:
Provided,
That OPM, in its discretion, may by regulation prescribe conditions under which excepted positions may be filled in the same manner as competitive positions are filled and conditions under which persons so appointed may acquire a competitive status in accordance with the Civil Service Rules and Regulations.
(b) To the extent permitted by law and the provisions of this part, and subject to the suitability and fitness requirements of the applicable Civil Service Rules and Regulations, appointments and position changes in the excepted service shall be made in accordance with such regulations and practices as the head of the agency concerned finds necessary. These shall include, for the position of administrative law judge appointed under 5 U.S.C. 3105, the requirement that, at the time of application and any new appointment, the individual, other than an incumbent administrative law judge, must possess a professional license to practice law and be authorized to practice law under the laws of a State, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, or any territorial court established under the United States Constitution. For purposes of this requirement, judicial status is acceptable in lieu of “active” status in States that prohibit sitting judges from maintaining “active” status to practice law, and being in “good standing” is also acceptable in lieu of “active” status in States where the licensing authority considers “good standing” as having a current license to practice law. This requirement shall constitute a minimum standard for appointment to the position of administrative law judge, and such appointments may be subject to additional agency requirements where appropriate.

§ 6.5
Assignment of excepted employees.
No person who is serving under an excepted appointment shall be assigned to the work of a position in the competitive service without prior approval of OPM.
§ 6.6
Revocation of exceptions.
OPM may remove any position from or may revoke in whole or in part any provision of Schedule A, B, C, or D. Notice of OPM's decision making these changes shall be published in the
Federal Register.

§ 6.7
Movement of persons between the civil service system and other merit systems.
Whenever OPM and any Federal agency having an established merit system determine it to be in the interest of good administration and consistent with the intent of the civil service laws and any other applicable laws, they may enter into an agreement prescribing conditions under which persons may be moved from one system to the other and defining the status and tenure that the persons affected shall acquire upon such movement.
§ 6.8
Specified exceptions.
(a) Positions in the Department of the Interior and in the Department of Commerce whose incumbents serve as the principal representative of the Secretary in their respective regions shall be listed in Schedule C for grades not exceeding grade GS-15 of the General

(c) Within the Department of Agriculture, positions in the Agriculture Stabilization and Conservation Service the incumbents of which serve as State Executive Directors and positions in the Farmers Home Administration the incumbents of which serve as State Directors or State Directors-at-Large shall be listed in Schedule C for all grades of the General Schedule.
(d) Effective on July 10, 2018, the position of administrative law judge appointed under 5 U.S.C. 3105 shall be listed in Schedule E for all levels of basic pay under 5 U.S.C. 5372(b). Incumbents of this position who are, on July 10, 2018, in the competitive service shall remain in the competitive service as long as they remain in their current positions.

What are OPM's Notice and Posting System responsibilities?
OPM will issue a notice that will provide information for Federal agencies, employees, managers, and other stakeholders on each of its new proposed, interim, and final regulations. Each notice will transmit:
(a) A posting notice that briefly explains the nature of the change, and provides a place for Federal agencies to indicate where the full text of the
Federal Register
notice will be available for review.
(b) A copy of the notice of rulemaking that appears in the
Federal Register
or a link to a Web site where the notice of rulemaking appears.
§ 110.102
What are Agency responsibilities?
(a) Agencies will make regulations available for review by employees, managers, and other interested parties. Federal agencies receiving the notices of rulemaking described in § 110.101(b) will make those regulations available for review upon request. Each agency will complete the posting notice described in § 110.101(a) indicating where and how requests to review these materials should be made.
(b) Agencies will determine posting locations and, if desired, develop supplemental announcements. Agencies will display completed posting notices in a prominent place where the notices can be easily seen and read. Agencies will choose the posting location that best fits their physical layout. Agencies may supplement these postings with announcements in employee newsletters, agency Web sites, or other communication methods. The basic requirement to post the notice continues, however, even if supplemental announcement methods are used.
(c) Agencies will post notices of the new regulations even if the
Federal Register
comment date has passed. The public comment period on proposed regulations begins when a notice of proposed rulemaking is published in the
Federal Register,
not with the posting of the notice described in § 110.101(a). The purpose of posting notice is solely to inform agency personnel of changes. Agencies are required to post the posting notice even if the formal deadline for comments shown in the preamble of the
Federal Register
notice of rulemaking has passed. Agencies should make every reasonable effort to minimize delays in distributing the notice described in § 110.101 to their field offices.
(d) No fixed posting period. There are no minimum or maximum time limits on displaying the notice described in § 110.101(a). Each office receiving a notice for posting should choose the posting period which provides the best opportunity to inform managers and employees of regulatory changes based upon office layout, geographic dispersion of employees, and other local factors.

§ 175.102
Requests for the declassification of documents.
Any Federal agency, Government employee or member of the public has the right to request a mandatory review of any classified document, held by the Office of Personnel Management, which was classified for national security purposes by the Civil Service Commission.

§ 177.101
Scope of regulations.
The regulations in this part apply only to claims presented or filed with the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) under the Federal Tort Claims Act, as amended, for money damages against the United States for injury to or loss of property or personal injury or death caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of an officer or employee of OPM while acting within the scope of his or her office or employment.
§ 177.102
Administrative claim; when presented; appropriate OPM office.
(a) For purposes of the provisions of 28 U.S.C. 2401(b), 2672, and 2675, a claim is deemed to have been presented when OPM receives from a claimant, his or her authorized agent or legal representative, an executed Standard Form 95 (Claim for Damage, Injury or Death), or other written notification of an incident, accompanied by a claim for money damages stating a sum certain (a specific dollar amount) for injury to or loss of property, personal injury, or death alleged to have occurred as a result of the incident.
(b) All claims filed under the Federal Tort Claims Act as a result of the alleged negligence or wrongdoing of OPM or its employees will be mailed or delivered to the Office of the General Counsel, United States Office of Personnel Management, 1900 E Street NW, Washington, DC 20415-1300.
(c) A claim must be presented to the Federal agency whose activities gave rise to the claim. A claim that should have been presented to OPM, but was mistakenly addressed to or filed with another Federal agency, is presented to OPM, as required by 28 U.S.C. 2401(b), as of the date the claim is received by OPM. When a claim is mistakenly presented to OPM, OPM will transfer the claim to the appropriate Federal agency, if ascertainable, and advise the claimant of the transfer, or return the claim to the claimant.
(d) A claimant whose claim arises from an incident involving OPM and one or more other Federal agencies, will identify each agency to which the claim has been submitted at the time the claim is presented to OPM. OPM will contact all other affected Federal agencies in order to designate the single agency that will investigate and decide the merits of the claim. In the event a designation cannot be agreed upon by the affected agencies, the Department of Justice will be consulted and will designate an agency to investigate and determine the merits of the claim. The designated agency will notify the claimant that all future correspondence concerning the claim must be directed to that Federal agency. All involved Federal agencies may agree to conduct their own administrative reviews and to coordinate the results, or to have the investigation conducted by the designated Federal agency. But, in either event, the designated agency will be responsible for the final determination of the claim.
(e) A claim presented in compliance with paragraph (a) of this section may be amended by the claimant at any time prior to final agency action or prior to the exercise of the claimant's option under 28 U.S.C. 2675(a). Amendments must be in writing and signed by the claimant or his or her authorized agent or legal representative. Upon timely filing of an amendment to a pending claim, OPM will have 6 months in which to make a final disposition of the claim as amended and claimant's option under 28 U.S.C. 2675 (a) will not accrue until 6 months after the filing of an amendment.
§ 177.103
Administrative claim; who may file.
(a) A claim for injury to or loss of property may be presented by the owner of the property, his or her authorized agent or legal representative.
(b) A claim for personal injury may be presented by the injured person, his or her authorized agent or legal representative.
(c) A claim based on death may be presented by the executor or administrator of the decedent's estate or by any other person legally entitled to assert a claim under the applicable State law.
(d) A claim for loss totally compensated by an insurer with the rights to subrogate may be presented by the insurer. A claim for loss partially compensated by an insurer with the rights to subrogate may be presented by the insurer or the insured individually, as their respective interests appear, or jointly. When an insurer presents a claim asserting the rights to subrogate, he or she will present with the claim appropriate evidence that he or she has the rights to subrogate.
(e) A claim presented by an agent or legal representative must be presented in the name of the claimant, be signed by the agent or legal representative, show the title or legal capacity of the person signing, and be accompanied by evidence of his or her authority to
present a claim on behalf of the claimant as agent, executor, administrator, parent, guardian, or other representative.
§ 177.104
Investigations.
OPM may investigate, or may request any other Federal agency to investigate, a claim filed under this part.

(2) A question of policy is or may be involved; or
(3) The United States is or may be entitled to indemnity or contribution from a third party and OPM is unable to adjust the third party claim; or

(c) An administrative claim may be adjusted, determined, compromised, or settled under 28 U.S.C. 2672, and this part, only after consultation with the Department of Justice when, OPM is informed or is otherwise aware that the United States or an employee, agent, or cost-type contractor of the United States is involved in litigation based on a claim arising out of the same incident or transaction.
§ 177.108
Referral to Department of Justice.
When Department of Justice approval or consultation is required, or the advice of the Department of Justice is otherwise to be requested, under § 177.107, the written referral or request will be transmitted to the Department of Justice by the General Counsel of OPM or his or her designee.
§ 177.109

When a claimant is represented by an attorney, the Voucher for Payment will designate
both the claimant and his or her attorney as payees, and the check will be delivered to the attorney, whose address is to appear on the Voucher for Payment.
(b) Acceptance by the claimant, his or her agent, or legal representative, of an award, compromise, or settlement made under 28 U.S.C. 2672 or 28 U.S.C. 2677 is final and conclusive on the claimant, his or her agent or legal representative, and any other person on whose behalf or for whose benefit the claim has been presented, and constitutes a complete release of any claim against the United States and against any employee of the Federal Government whose act or omission gave rise to the claim, by reason of the same subject matter.

§ 178.203
Designation of beneficiary.
(a)
Agency notification.
The employing agency shall notify each employee of his or her right to designate a beneficiary or beneficiaries to receive money due, and of the disposition of money due if a beneficiary is not designated. An employee may change or revoke a designation at any time under regulations promulgated by the Director of the Office of Personnel Management or his or her designee.
(b)
Designation Form.
Standard Form 1152, Designation of Beneficiary, Unpaid Compensation of Deceased Civilian Employee, is prescribed for use by employees in designating a beneficiary and in changing or revoking a previous designation; each agency will furnish the employee a Standard Form 1152 upon request. In the absence of the prescribed form, however, any designation, change, or cancellation of beneficiary witnessed and filed in accordance with the general requirements of this part will be acceptable.

The Standard Form 1152 must be executed in duplicate by the employee and filed with the employing agency where the proper officer will sign it and insert the date of receipt in the space provided on each part, file the original, and return the duplicate to the employee. When a designation of beneficiary is changed or revoked, the employing agency should return the earlier designation to the employee, keeping a copy of only the current designation on file.
(e)
Effective period of a designation.
A properly executed and filed designation of beneficiary will be effective as long as employment by the same agency continues. If an employee resigns and is reemployed, or is transferred to another agency, the employee must execute another designation of beneficiary form in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section. A new designation of beneficiary is not required, however, when an employee's agency or site, function, records, equipment, and personnel are absorbed by another agency.
§ 178.204
Order of payment precedence.
To facilitate the settlement of the accounts of the deceased employees, money due an employee at the time of the employee's death shall be paid to the person or persons surviving at the date of death, in the following order of precedence, and the payment bars recovery by another person of amounts so paid:

§ 179.201
Purpose.
The purpose of the Debt Collection Act of 1982 (Pub. L. 97-365), is to provide a comprehensive statutory approach to the collection of debts due the Federal Government. These regulations implement section 5 of the Act which authorizes the collection of debts owed by Federal employees to the Federal Government by means of salary offset, except that no claim may be collected by such means if outstanding for more than 10 years after the agency's right to collect the debt first accrued, unless facts material to the Government's right to collect were not known, and could not reasonably have been known, by the official or officials who were charged with the responsibility for discovery and collection of such debts. These regulations are consistent with the regulations on salary offset published by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) on July 3, 1984 (49 FR 27470) in 5 CFR part 550, subpart K.
§ 179.202
Scope.
(a) These regulations provide procedures for the collection of monies from a Federal employee's pay by salary offset to satisfy certain debts owed the Government.

(1) Federal employees who owe debts to OPM; and
(2) OPM employees who owe debts to other agencies.
(c) These regulations do not apply to debts or claims arising under the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended (26 U.S.C. 1
et seq.
); the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 301
et seq.
); the tariff laws of the United States; or to any case where collection of a debt by salary offset is explicitly provided for or prohibited by another statute (e.g., travel advances in 5 U.S.C. 5705 and employee training expenses in 5 U.S.C. 4108).
(d) Section 179.207 does not apply to any adjustment to pay arising from an employee's election of coverage or a change in coverage under a Federal benefits program requiring periodic deductions from pay, if the amount to be recovered was accumulated over four pay periods or less.
(e) Nothing in these regulations precludes the compromise, suspension, or termination of collection actions, where appropriate, under the standards implementing the Federal Claims Collection Act (31 U.S.C. 3711
et seq.,
4 CFR parts 101-105, 38 CFR 1.900
et seq.
).
(f) Nothing in these regulations precludes an employee from requesting a waiver of the debt under applicable statute; under the standards and procedures specified by the Federal Claims Collection Standards (FCCS); or waiver of salary overpayment under 5 U.S.C. 5584, 10 U.S.C. 2774, or 32 U.S.C. 716, by submitting a subsequent claim to the General Accounting Office in accordance with procedures established by the General Accounting Office.

(b)
Failure to timely submit.
(1) If the employee files a petition for a hearing after the expiration of the 15 calendar day period provided for in paragraph (a) of this section, the Office may accept the request if the employee can show that the delay was the result of circumstances beyond his of her control or failure to receive actual notice of the filing deadline (unless the employee had actual notice of the filing deadline).

(i) Fails to file a timely request for a hearing unless such failure is excused; or
(ii) Fails to appear at an oral hearing of which he or she was notified unless the hearing official determines that failure to appear was due to circumstances beyond the employee's control.

The creditor agency may be represented by legal counsel. The employee may represent himself or herself or may be represented by an individual of his or her choice and at his or her expense.
(d)
Review of Office records related to the debt.
(1) An employee who intends to inspect or copy creditor agency records related to the debt, as provided by § 179.207(a)(5), must send a letter to the official designated in the notice of intent to offset stating his or her intention. The letter must be received within 15 calendar days after the employee's receipt of the notice.
(2) In response to a timely request submitted by the debtor, the designated official will notify the employee of the location and time when the employee may inspect and copy records related to the debt.
(3) If personal inspection is impractical, arrangements shall be made to end copies of such records to the employee.
(e)
Hearing official.
The Office may request an administrative law judge to conduct the hearing, or the Office may obtain a hearing official who is not under the supervision or control of the Director of OPM.
(f)
Obtaining the services of a hearing official when OPM is the creditor agency.
(1) When the debtor is not an OPM employee and the Office cannot provide a prompt and appropriate hearing before a hearing official furnished pursuant to another lawful arrangement, the Office may contact an agent of the paying agency designated in 5 CFR part 581, appendix A, or other individual designated by the paying agency, and request a hearing official.
(2) When the debtor is an OPM employee, the Office may contact any agent of another agency designated in 5 CFR part 581, appendix A, or otherwise designated by that agency, to request a hearing official.
(g)
Procedure
—(1)
General.
After the employee requests a hearing, the hearing official shall notify the employee of the form of the hearing to be provided. If the hearing will be oral, the notice shall set forth the date, time and location of the hearing. If the hearing will be paper, the employee shall be notified that he or she should submit arguments in writing to the hearing official by a specified date after which the record shall be closed. This date shall give the employee reasonable time to submit documentation.
(2)
Oral hearing.
An employee who requests an oral hearing shall be provided an oral hearing if the hearing official determines that the matter cannot be resolved by review of documentary evidence alone (e.g., when an issue of credibility or veracity is involved). The hearing is not an adversarial adjudication and need not take the form of an evidentiary hearing. Oral hearings may take the form of, but are not limited to:
(i) Informal conferences with the hearing official, in which the employee and agency representative will be given full opportunity to present evidence, witnesses, and argument;
(ii) Informal meetings with an interview of the employee; or
(iii) Formal written submissions with an opportunity for oral presentation.
(3)
Paper hearing.
If the hearing official determines that an oral hearing is not necessary, he or she will make a determination based upon a review of the available written record (4 CFR 102.3(c) (2) and (3)).
(4)
Record.
The hearing official must maintain a summary record of any hearing provided by this subpart (4 CFR 102.3(c)(1)(ii)). Witnesses who testify in oral hearings will do so under oath or affirmation.
(h)
Date of decision.
The hearing official shall issue a written opinion stating his or her decision, based upon documentary evidence and information developed at the hearing, as soon as practicable after the hearing, but not later than 60 days after the date on which the petition was received by the creditor agency, unless the employee requests a delay in the proceedings. In such case the 60-day decision period shall be extended by the number of days by which the hearing was postponed.
(i)
Content of decision.
The written decision shall include:
(1) A statement of the facts presented to support the origin, nature, and amount of the debt;
(2) The hearing official's findings, analysis, and conclusions including a determination whether the debtor's petition for hearing was baseless and resulted from an intent to delay creditor agency collection activity and whether the Office should pursue other actions
against the debtor as provided by 5 CFR 550.1104(d)(11); and
(3) The terms of any repayment schedules, if applicable.
(j)
Failure to appear.
In the absence of good cause shown (e.g., illness), an employee who fails to appear at a hearing shall be deemed, for the purpose of this subpart, to admit the existence and amount of the debt as described in the notice of intent. If the representative of the creditor agency fails to appear, the hearing official shall proceed with the hearing as scheduled and make his/her determination based upon the oral testimony presented and the documentary evidence submitted by both parties. With the agreement of both parties, the hearing official shall schedule a new hearing date. Both parties shall be given reasonable notice of the time and place of the new hearing.
§ 179.208
Certification.
(a) OPM salary offset coordinator shall provide a certification to the paying agency in all cases where:
(1) The hearing official determines that a debt exists;
(2) The employee fails to contest the existence and amount of the debt by failing to request a hearing; or
(3) The employee fails to contest the existence of the debt by failing to appear at a hearing.
(b) The certification must be in writing and must state:
(1) That the employee owes the debt;
(2) The amount and basis of the debt;
(3) The date the Government's right to collect the debt first accrued;
(4) That the Office's regulations have been approved by OPM pursuant to 5 CFR part 550, subpart K;
(5) The date on which payment(s) is due;
(6) If the collection is to be made in installments, the number of installments to be collected, the amount of each installment or percentage of disposable pay, and the commencement date of the first installment, if a date other than the next officially established pay period is required; and
(7) The date(s) of any action(s) taken under 5 U.S.C. 5514(b).
§ 179.209
Voluntary repayment agreement as alternative to salary offset.
(a)(1) In response to a notice of intent, an employee may propose to repay the debt by making voluntary installment payments as an alternative to salary offset. An employee who wishes to repay a debt without salary offset shall submit in writing a proposed agreement to repay the debt. The proposal shall admit the existence of the debt, and the agreement must be in such form that it is legally enforceable. The agreement must:
(i) Be in writing;
(ii) Be signed by both the employee and the creditor agency;
(iii) Specify all the terms of the arrangement for payment; and
(iv) Contain a provision accelerating the debt in the event of default by the debtor, but such an increase may not result in a deduction that exceeds 15 percent of the employee's disposable pay unless the employee has agreed in writing to deduction of a greater amount (5 CFR 550.1104(i)).
(2) Any proposal under paragraph (a) of this section must be received by the official designated in the notice of intent within 30 calendar days after receipt of the notice.
(b) The creditor agency will review a timely and properly submitted repayment proposal by the employee debtor and notify the employee whether the proposed written agreement for repayment is acceptable. It is within the creditor agency's discretion to accept a repayment agreement instead of proceeding by offset.
(c) If the creditor agency decides that the proposed repayment agreement is unacceptable, the employee will have 15 days from the date he or she received notice of that decision to file a petition for a hearing or a special review as provided by § 179.210.
(d) If the creditor agency decides that the proposed repayment agreement is acceptable, the alternative arrangement must be in writing, signed by both the employee and the creditor agency designee and meet the other requirements of this section for a voluntary repayment agreement.
§ 179.210
Special review.
(a) An OPM employee subject to salary offset or a voluntary repayment agreement, may, at any time, request a special review by the Office of the amount of the salary offset or voluntary payment, based on materially changed circumstances such as, but not limited to, catastrophic illness, divorce, death, or disability.
(b) In determining whether an offset would prevent the employee from meeting essential subsistence expenses (food, housing, clothing, transportation and medical care), the employee shall submit a detailed statement and supporting documents for the employee, his or her spouse, and dependents indicating:
(1) Income from all sources;
(2) Assets;
(3) Liabilities;
(4) Number of dependents;
(5) Expenses for food, housing, clothing and transportation;
(6) Medical expenses; and
(7) Exceptional expenses, if any.
If an OPM employee requests a special review under this section, the employee shall file an alternative proposed offset or payment schedule and a statement, with supporting documents (§ 179.210(b)), stating why the current salary offset or payments result in an extreme financial hardship to the employee.
(c) The Director shall evaluate the statement and supporting documents, and determine whether the original offset or repayment schedule imposes an extreme financial hardship on the employee. The Director shall notify the employee in writing of such determination, including, if appropriate, a revised offset or repayment schedule.
(d) If the special review results in a revised offset or repayment schedule, the OPM salary offset coordinator shall provide a new certification to the payroll office.
§ 179.211
Notice of salary offset.
(a) Upon receipt of proper certification from a creditor agency, the OPM payroll office will send the OPM employee, identified in the certification as the debtor, a written notice of salary offset. Such notice shall, at a minimum:
(1) State that OPM has received a properly certified debt claim from a creditor agency;
(2) Contain a copy of the certification received from the creditor agency;
(3) Advise the employee that salary offset will be initiated at the next officially established pay interval; and
(4) State the amount of the claim and amount of deductions.
(b) The payroll office shall provide a copy of the notice to the creditor agency and advise such agency of the dollar amount to be offset and the pay period when the offset will begin.
§ 179.212
Procedures for salary offset.
(a) The Director or his or her designee shall coordinate salary deductions under this subpart.
(b) OPM payroll office shall determine the amount of an employee's disposable pay and implement the salary offset.
(c) Deductions shall begin effective the pay period following receipt by OPM's payroll office of proper certification of the debt (§ 179.208).
(d)
Types of collection
—(1)
Lump-sum payment.
A debt will be collected in a lump sum if possible. If an employee is financially unable to pay in one lump sum or the amount of the debt exceeds 15 percent of disposable pay for an officially established pay interval, collection must be made in installments.
(2)
Installment deductions.
Installment deductions will be made over a period not greater than the anticipated period of employment and, except in rare circumstances, not to exceed 3 years. The size and frequency of installment deductions will bear a reasonable relation to the size of the debt and the employee's ability to pay. The amount deducted for any period will not exceed 15 percent of the disposable pay from which the deduction is made unless the employee has agreed in writing to the deduction of a greater amount.
(3)
Lump-sum deductions from final check.
A lump-sum deduction exceeding the 15 percent disposable pay limitation may be made from any final salary payment pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3716 in order to liquidate the debt, whether the employee is being separated voluntarily or involuntarily.
(4)
Lump-sum deductions from other sources.
When an employee subject to salary offset is separated from OPM and the balance of the debt cannot be liquidated by offset of the final salary check, the Office, pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3716, the FCCS and OPM's implementing regulations, may offset the balance of the debt against any financial payment due the employee from the U.S. Government.
(e)
Multiple debts.
In instances where two or more creditor agencies are seeking salary offset, or where two or more debts are owed to a single creditor agency, OPM payroll office may, at its discretion, determine whether one or more debts should be offset simultaneously within the 15 percent limitation.
(f)
Precedence of debts owed to OPM.
For OPM employees, debts owed to the Office generally take precedence over debts owed to other agencies. In the event that a debt to the Office is certified while an employee is subject to a salary offset to repay another agency, the OPM payroll office may decide whether to have that debt repaid in full before collecting its claim or whether changes should be made in the salary deduction being sent to the other agency. If debts owed the Office can be collected in one pay period, the payroll office may suspend the salary offset to the other agency for that pay period in order to liquidate the office debt.
(g) When an employee owes two or more debts, the best interests of the Government shall be the primary consideration in determining the order of debt collection. The OPM payroll office, in making this determination, will be guided primarily by the statute of limitations that affects the collection of the debt(s).
§ 179.213
Coordinating salary offset with other agencies.
(a)
Responsibility of OPM as the creditor agency.
(1) The Director or his or her designee shall coordinate debt collections with other agencies and shall, as appropriate:
(i) Arrange for a hearing or special review upon proper petitioning by a Federal employee; and
(ii) Prescribe, upon consultation with the General Counsel, such additional practices and procedures as may be necessary to carry out the intent of this regulation.
(2) The designated salary offset coordinator will be responsible for:
(i) Ensuring that each notice of intent to offset is consistent with the requirements of § 179.206;
(ii) Ensuring that each certification of debt that is sent to a paying agency is consistent with the requirements of § 179.208;
(iii) Obtaining hearing officials from other agencies pursuant to § 179.207(f); and
(iv) Ensuring that hearings are properly scheduled.
(3)
Requesting recovery from current paying agency.
Upon completion of the procedures established in these regulations and pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 5514, the Office must:
(i) Certify, in writing, to the paying agency that the employee owes the debt, the amount and basis of the debt, the date on which payment(s) is due, the date the Government's right to collect the debt first accrued, and that the Office's regulations implementing 5 U.S.C. 5514 have been approved by the Office of Personnel Management;
(ii) Advise the paying agency of the amount or percentage of disposable pay to be collected in each installment and the number and commencing date of the installments (if a date other than the next officially established pay period is required);
(iii) Advise the paying agency of the action(s) taken under 5 U.S.C. 5514(b) and give the date(s) and action(s) was taken (unless the employee has consented to the salary offset in writing or signed a statement acknowledging receipt of the required procedures and the written consent or statement is forwarded to the paying agency);
(iv) Submit a debt claim certification containing the information specified in paragraphs (a)(3)(i), (a)(3)(ii) and (a)(3)(iii) of this section and an installment agreement (or other instruction on the payment schedule), if applicable, to the employee's paying agency; and
(v) Submit the debt claim, as provided in § 179.208, to the employee's paying agency for collection if the employee is in the process of separating,
and has not received a final salary check, or other final payment(s) from the paying agency. The paying agency must certify the total amount of its collection on the debt and send a copy of the certification to the employee and another copy to the creditor agency. If the paying agency's collection does not fully satisfy the debt, and the paying agency is aware that the debtor is entitled to payments from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund or other similar payments that may be due the debtor employee from other Federal Government sources, the paying agency will provide written notification of the outstanding debt to the agency responsible for making such other payments to the debtor employee. The written notification shall state that the employee owes a debt (including the amount) and that the provisions of this section have been fully complied with. The Office must submit a properly certified claim to the agency responsible for making such payments before the collection can be made.
(4)
Separated employee.
If the employee is already separated and all payments due from his or her former paying agency have been paid, the Office may request, unless otherwise prohibited, that money due and payable to the employee from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund (5 CFR 831.1801
et seq.
or 5 CFR 845.401
et seq.
) or other similar funds, be administratively offset to collect the debt (31 U.S.C. 3716 and the FCCS).
(5)
Employee transfer.
When an employee transfers from one paying agency to another paying agency, the Office is not required to repeat the due process procedures described in 5 U.S.C. 5514 and this subpart to resume the collection. The Office will submit a properly certified claim to the new paying agency and will subsequently review the debt to make sure the collection is resumed by the new paying agency.
(b)
Responsibility of the Office as the paying agency
—(1)
Complete claim.
When the Office receives a certified claim from a creditor agency, deductions should be scheduled to begin at the next officially established pay interval. Before deductions can begin, the employee must receive written notice from the Office including:
(i) A statement that the Office has received a certified debt claim from the creditor agency;
(ii) The amount of the debt claim;
(iii) The date salary offset deductions will begin, and
(iv) The amount of such deductions.
(2)
Incomplete claim.
When the Office receives an incomplete certification of debt from a creditor agency, the Office must return the debt claim with notice that procedures under 5 U.S.C. 5514 and 5 CFR 550.1101
et seq.
must be followed and a properly certified debt claim received before action will be taken to collect from the employee's current pay account.
(3)
Review.
The Office is not authorized to review the merits of the creditor agency's determination with respect to the amount or validity of the debt certified by the creditor agency.
(4)
Employees who transfer from one paying agency to another.
If, after the creditor agency has submitted the debt claim to the Office, the employee transfers from OPM to a different paying agency before the debt is collected in full, the Office will certify the total amount collected on the debt. One copy of the certification will be furnished to the employee and one copy to the creditor agency along with notice of the employee's transfer.
§ 179.214
Interest, penalties and administrative costs.
The office shall assess interest, penalties and administrative costs on debts owed pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3717 and 4 CFR part 101.1
et seq.
Penalties and administrative costs will be assessed on all delinquent debts.
(a) In cases of default on a previous repayment agreement, the Office reserves the right to set a new interest rate which reflects the current value of funds to the Treasury at the time a new repayment agreement is executed.
(b) The Office, on a case-by-case basis, may waive all interest accrued on debts paid in full within 60 days of the due date if there is no indication of fault or lack of good faith on the part of the debtor.
(c) The Office may waive, in whole or in part, the collection of interest, penalties, and/or administrative costs assessed under this section under the criteria specified in part 103 of 4 CFR, chapter II, relating to the compromise of claims (without regard to the amount of the debt).
(d) The Office may waive, in whole or in part, the collection of interest, penalties, and/or administrative costs assessed under this section if the Office determines that collection of these charges would be against equity and good conscience or not in the best interests of the United States.
(e) The Office shall waive the accrual of interest pending consideration of a request for reconsideration, administrative review, or waiver of the underlying debt under provisions of a permissive statute providing for such review related to the debt.
(f) The Office shall waive interest on repayment agreements when the amount of interest accruing equals or exceeds the amount of installments the debtor can reasonably afford and there is no indication of fault or lack of good faith on the part of the debtor.
§ 179.215
Refunds.
(a) The Office shall promptly refund any amounts deducted under the authority of 5 U.S.C. 5514 when:
(1) The debt is waived or otherwise found not to be owing the United States (unless expressly prohibited by statute or regulation); or
(2) An administrative or judicial order directs the Office to make a refund.
(b) Unless required or permitted by law or contract, refunds under this subsection shall not bear interest.
§ 179.216
Request for the services of a hearing official when the creditor agency is not OPM.
(a) The Office will provide a hearing official upon request of the creditor agency when the debtor is employed by the Office and the creditor agency cannot provide a prompt and appropriate hearing before a hearing official furnished pursuant to another lawful arrangement.
(b) The salary offset coordinator will secure qualified personnel to serve as hearing officials.
(c) Services rendered under this section will be provided on a fully reimbursable basis pursuant to the Economy Act of 1932,
as amended,
31 U.S.C. 1535.
§ 179.217
Non-waiver of rights by payments.
An employee's involuntary payment of all or any portion of a debt collected under this subpart must not be construed as a waiver of any rights which the employee may have under 5 U.S.C. 5514 or any other provision of contract or law unless there are statutory or contractual provisions to the contrary.
§ 179.218
Additional administrative collection action.
Nothing contained in this subpart is intended to preclude the use of any other administrative remedy which may be appropriate.

# Subpart C—Administrative Offset

# Source:
59 FR 35214, July 11, 1994, unless otherwise noted.
§ 179.301
Scope of regulations.
These regulations apply to the collection of debts owed to the United States arising from transactions with OPM other than those involving payments made from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund (the Fund), or where a request for an offset from OPM's administrative accounts—other than the Fund—is received by OPM from another Federal agency. Regulations for other agencies to request OPM's Retirement and Insurance Group to recover a debt from the Fund are provided at subpart R of part 831 and subpart D of part 845 of title 5, Code of Federal Regulations. These regulations are consistent with the Federal Claims Collection Standards on Administrative Offset issued jointly by the Department of Justice and the General Accounting Office as set forth in 4 CFR 102.3.
§ 179.302
Definitions.
Administrative offset,
as defined in 31 U.S.C. 3701(a)(1), means withholding
money payable by the United States Government to, or held by the Government for, a person to satisfy a debt the person owes the Government.
Person,
includes a natural person or persons, profit or non-profit corporation, partnership, association, trust, estate, consortium, or other entity which is capable of owing a debt to the United States Government except that agencies of the United States, or of any State or local government, shall be excluded.
§ 179.303
General.
(a) The Director or his or her designee, after attempting to collect a debt from a person under section 3(a) of the Federal Claims Collection Act of 1966, as amended (31 U.S.C. 3711(a)), may collect the debt by administrative offset subject to the following:
(1) The debt is certain in amount; and
(2) It is in the best interest of the United States to collect the debt by administrative offset because it is less costly and speeds payment of the debt;
(b) The Director, or his or her designee, may initiate administrative offset with regard to debts owed by a person to another agency of the United States Government, upon receipt of a request from the head of another agency, or his or her designee, and a certification that the debt exists and that the person has been afforded the necessary due process rights.
(c) The Director, or his or her designee, may request another agency that holds funds payable to an OPM debtor to offset the debt against the funds held and will provide certification that:
(1) The debt exists; and
(2) The person has been afforded the necessary due process rights.
(d) If the 6-year period for bringing action on a debt provided in 28 U.S.C. 2415 has expired, then administrative offset may be used to collect the debt only if the costs of bringing such action are likely to be less than the amount of the debt.
(e) No collection by administrative offset shall be made on any debt that has been outstanding for more than 10 years unless facts material to the Government's right to collect the debt were not known, and reasonably could not have been known, by the official or officials responsible for discovering and collecting such debt.
(f) These regulations do not apply to:
(1) A case in which administrative offset of the type of debt involved is explicitly provided for or prohibited by another statute.
(2) Debts owed to OPM by other agencies of the United States or by any State or local government.
§ 179.304
Notification procedures.
Before collecting any debt through administrative offset, a notice of intent to offset shall be sent to the debtor by certified mail, return receipt requested, at the most current address that is available to OPM. The notice shall provide:
(a) A description of the nature and amount of the debt and the intention of OPM to collect the debt through administrative offset;
(b) An opportunity to inspect and copy the records of OPM with respect to the debt;
(c) An opportunity for review within OPM concerning OPM's determinations with respect to the debt; and
(d) An opportunity to enter into a written agreement for the repayment of the amount of the debt.
§ 179.305
Agency review.
(a) A debtor may dispute the existence of the debt, the amount of the debt, or the terms of repayment. The request to review a disputed debt must be received by the OPM official identified in the notification within 30 calendar days of the debtor's receipt of the written notice described in § 179.304.
(b) If the debtor requests an opportunity to inspect or copy OPM's records concerning the disputed claim, 10 business days will be granted for the review. The time period will be measured from the time the request for inspection is granted or from the time the copy of the records is received by the debtor.
(c) Pending the resolution of a dispute initiated by the debtor, transactions in any of the debtor's account(s) maintained in OPM may be temporarily suspended to the extent of the debt that is owed. Depending on the type of transaction, the suspension
could preclude payment, removal, or transfer, as well as prevent the payment of interest or discount due thereon. Should the dispute be resolved in the debtor's favor, the suspension will be lifted immediately.
(d) During the review period, interest, penalties, and administrative costs authorized under the Federal Claims Collection Act of 1966, as amended, will continue to accrue.
§ 179.306
Written agreement for repayment.
A debtor who admits liability but elects not to have the debt collected by administrative offset will be afforded an opportunity to negotiate a written agreement for the repayment of the debt. If the financial condition of the debtor does not support the ability to pay in one lump-sum, reasonable installments may be considered. No installment arrangement will be considered unless the debtor submits a financial statement, executed under penalty of perjury, reflecting the debtor's assets, liabilities, income, and expenses. The financial statement must be submitted within 10 business days of OPM's request for the statement. At OPM's option, a confess-judgment note or bond of indemnity with surety may be required for the installment agreement. Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, any reduction or compromise of a claim will be governed by 4 CFR part 103 and 31 U.S.C. 3711.
§ 179.307
Administrative offset.
(a) If the debtor does not exercise the right to request a review within the time specified in § 179.305 or, if as a result of the review, it is determined that the debt is due and no written agreement is executed, then administrative offset shall be ordered in accordance with these regulations without further notice.
(b) Request for offset to a Federal agency: The Director or his or her designee may request that funds due and payable to a debtor by a Federal agency be administratively offset in order to collect a debt owned to OPM by that debtor. In requesting administrative offset OPM, as creditor, will certify in writing to the Federal agency holding funds of the debtor:
(1) That the debtor owes the debt;
(2) The amount and basis of the debt; and
(3) That OPM has complied with the requirements of 31 U.S.C. 3716, its own administrative offset regulations, and the applicable provisions of 4 CFR part 102 with respect to providing the debtor with due process.
(c) Request for offset from a Federal agency: When administrative offset is authorized, any Federal creditor agency may request OPM to make an administrative offset from any OPM funds that are due and payable to a creditor agency's debtor. OPM shall initiate the requested administrative offset only upon:
(1) Receipt of written certification from the creditor agency:
(i) That the debtor owes the debt;
(ii) The amount and basis of the debt;
(iii) That the agency has prescribed regulations for the exercise of administrative offset; and
(iv) That the agency has complied with its own administrative offset regulations and with the applicable provisions of 4 CFR part 102, including providing any required hearing or review.
(2) A determination by OPM that collection by offset against funds payable by OPM would not otherwise be contrary to law.
§ 179.308
Accelerated procedures.
OPM may make an administrative offset against a payment to be made to the debtor prior to the completion of the procedures required by §§ 179.304 and 179.305 if failure to take the offset would substantially jeopardize OPM's ability to collect the debt, and the time before the payment is to be made does not reasonably permit the completion of those procedures. Such prior offset shall be promptly followed by the completion of those procedures. Amounts recovered by offset but later found not to be owed to OPM shall be promptly refunded.
§ 179.309
Additional administrative procedures.
Nothing contained in this chapter is intended to preclude the use of any other administrative remedy which may be available.

15 U.S.C. 46; 31 U.S.C. 3720D; 31 CFR 285.11(f).
§ 179.401
Administrative wage garnishment.
General.
OPM may use administrative wage garnishment to collect debts in accordance with the requirements of 31 U.S.C. 3720D and 31 CFR 285.11, including debts it refers to the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, Department of the Treasury, for cross-servicing pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3711. This part adopts and incorporates all of the provisions of 31 CFR 285.11 concerning administrative wage garnishment, including the hearing procedures described in 31 CFR 285.11(f).

§ 180.101
Scope and purpose.
(a) The Military Personnel and Civilian Employees' Claims Act of 1964, 31 U.S.C. 240 to 243, authorizes the Director, Office of Personnel Management to settle and pay (including replacement in kind) claims of officers and employees of OPM, amounting to not more than $15,000, for damage to or loss of personal property incident to their service. Claims are payable only for such types, quantities, or amounts of tangible personal property (including money) as the approving authority shall determine to be reasonable, useful, or proper under the circumstances existing at the time and place of the loss. In determining what is reasonable, useful, or proper, the approving authority will consider the type and quantity of property involved, circumstances attending acquistion and use of the property, and whether possession or use by the claimant at the time of damage or loss was incident to service.
(b) The Government does not underwrite all personal property losses that a claimant may sustain and it does not underwrite individual tastes. While the Government does not attempt to limit possession of property by an individual, payment for damage or loss is made only to the extent that the possession of the property is determined to be reasonable, useful, or proper. If individuals possess excessive quantities of items, or expensive items, they should have such property privately insured.
§ 180.102
Claimants.
(a) The following are proper claimants:
(1) Officers and employees of OPM;
(2) Former officers and employees of OPM whose claims arose out of incidents which occurred before their separation;
(3) The authorized agent or legal representative of persons in §§ 180.102(a)(1) and 180.102(a)(2);
(4) Survivors of persons in §§ 180.102(a)(1) and 180.102(a)(2) in the following order of precedence:
(i) Spouse,
(ii) Children,
(iii) Father or mother, or both,
(iv) Brothers or sisters, or both.
(b) A claim may not be presented by or for the benefit of a subrogee, assignee, conditional vendor, or other third party.
§ 180.103
Time limitations.
A claim must be presented in writing within 2 years after it accrues, except during war or armed conflict. If war or armed conflict occurs within the 2-year period following accrual, when claimant shows good cause, the claim may be presented within 2 years after the cause ceases to exist but not more than 2 years after termination of the war or
armed conflict. A claim accrues when loss or damage is or should have been discovered by claimant even though such loss or damage occurred at a prior time.
§ 180.104
Allowable claims.
(a) A claim may be allowed only if:
(1) The damage or loss was not caused wholly or partly by the negligent or wrongful act of the claimant, claimant's agent, a member of claimant's family, or claimant's private employee (the standard to be applied is that of reasonable care under the circumstances);
(2) The possession of the property damaged or lost and the quantity possessed is determined to have been reasonable, useful, or proper under the circumstances; and
(3) The claim is substantiated by proper and convincing evidence.
(b) Claims which are otherwise allowable under this part shall not be disallowed solely because the property was not in the possession of the claimant at the time of the damage or loss or solely because the claimant was not legal owner of the property for which the claim is made. For example, borrowed property may be the subject of a claim.
(c) Subject to the conditions in § 180.104(a) and the other provisions of this part, any claim for damage to or loss of personal property incident to service with OPM may be considered and allowed. The following are examples of the principal types of claims which may be allowed. These examples are not exclusive and other types of claims may be allowed unless excluded by § 180.106:

Claims may be allowed for damage to or loss of property located at:
(i) Quarters within the 50 States and the District of Columbia that were assigned to the claimant or otherwise provided in kind by the United States;

Money.
Claims for money in an amount that is determined to be reasonable for the claimant to possess at the time of the loss are payable:
(i) Where personal funds were accepted by responsible Government personnel with apparent authority to receive them for safekeeping deposit, transmittal, or other authorized disposition, but were neither applied as directed by the owner nor returned;
(ii) When lost incident to a marine or aircraft disaster;
(iii) When lost by fire, flood, hurricane, or other natural disaster;

(8)
Enemy action or public service.

However, where, in the opinion of the approving authority, the claimant could not obtain an estimate without paying a fee, such a claim may be considered in an amount reasonable in relation to the value or the cost of repairs of the articles involved, provided that the evidence furnished clearly indicates that the amount of the fee paid will not be deducted from the cost of repairs if the work is accomplished by the estimator.
(20)
Items fraudulently claimed.
Claims are not payable for items fraudulently claimed. When investigation discloses that a claimant, claimant's agent, claimant's employee, or member of claimant's family has intentionally misrepresented an item claimed as to cost, condition, cost to repair, etc., the item will be disallowed in its entirety even though some actual damage has been sustained. However, if the remainder of the claim is proper it will be paid. This does not preclude appropriate disciplinary action if warranted.
§ 180.106
Claims involving carriers and insurers.
(a) Claimants must comply with the following before presenting claims involving a carrier or insurer:
(1) Whenever property is damaged or lost while being shipped pursuant to authorized travel orders, the owner must file a written claim for reimbursement with the carrier according to the terms of its bill of lading or contract before submitting a claim against the Government. The claimant may present a claim to the Government immediately after making demand on the carrier.
(2) Whenever property which is damaged or lost incident to the claimant's service is insured in whole or in part,
the claimant must make a written demand against the insurer for reimbursement under the terms and conditions of the insurance coverage. Such demand should be made within the time limit provided in the policy and prior to the filing of a claim against the Government. The claimant may present a claim to the Government immediately after making demand on the insurer.
(b) If the claimant fails to make the required demand on the carrier or insurer or make reasonable efforts to collect the amount recoverable, the amount payable under the provisions of these regulations shall be reduced by the maximum amount recoverable. However, no deduction will be made if the circumstances of the claimant's service were such as to preclude timely filing of the claim with the carrier or insurer and it is determined that a demand would have been impracticable or unavailing in any event.
(c) When a claim is paid by OPM, the claimant will assign to the United States, to the extent of any payment on the claim accepted by claimant, all rights, title, and interest in any claim against any carrier, insurer, or other party arising out of the incident on which the claim against the United States is based. On request, the claimant also will furnish such evidence as may be required to enable the United States to enforce the claim.
(d) After payment of a claim by the United States, if the claimant receives any payment from a carrier, contractor, insurer, or other third party, the claimant will pay the proceeds to the United States to the extent of the payment received by the claimant from the United States.
§ 180.107
Claims procedure.

Claims not exceeding $500 shall be filed with the appropriate bureau or regional director. Claims in excess of $500 shall be filed with the Office of the General Counsel, Office of Personnel Management, 1900 E Street NW., Washington, DC 20415. Claims shall be in writing, using G.C.

§ 180.108
Settlement of claims.
(a)
Authority.
Associate Directors and Regional Directors are authorized to settle and pay any claim not exceeding $500 and arising under this part. The General Counsel is authorized to settle and pay any claim not exceeding $15,000 and arising under this part. Unless cognizable under § 180.104(c)(3), claims for damage to or loss of motor vehicles may be settled and paid only by the General Counsel.
(b)
Redelegation.
The approving authorities may establish such procedures and make such redelegations as may be required to fulfill the objectives of this part.
(c)
Cost or value.
The amount awarded on any item of property will not exceed the cost of the item (either the price paid in cash or property) or the value at the time of acquisition if not acquired by purchase or exchange. The amount payable will be determined by applying the principles of depreciation to the adjusted dollar value or other base price of property lost or damaged beyond economical repair; by allowing the cost of repairs when an item is economically repairable, provided the cost of repairs does not exceed the depreciated value of the item; and by deducting salvage value, if appropriate.
(d)
Depreciation.
Depreciation in value of an item is determined by considering the type of article involved, its cost, condition when damaged beyond economical repair or lost, and the time elapsed between the date of acquisition and the date of damage or loss.
(e)
Appreciation.
There will be no allowance for appreciation in the value of the property except that the cost of the item may be adjusted to reflect changes in the purchasing power of the dollar before depreciation is computed. Appreciation will not be allowed solely because the loss occurred or the claimant now resides in an area remote from the place of purchase of the property.
(f)
Expensive articles.
Allowance for expensive items (including heirlooms and antiques) or for items purchased at unreasonably high prices will be based on the fair and reasonable purchase price for substitute articles of a similar nature.
(g)
Acquisition.
Allowance for articles acquired by barter will not exceed the cost of the articles tendered in barter. No reimbursement will be made for articles acquired in black market or other prohibited activities.
(h)
Replacement.
Replacement of damaged or lost property may be made in kind whenever appropriate.
(i)
Amount allowable.
Subject to the limitations of §§ 180.108(c) through 180.108(h), the amount allowable in settlement of a claim is either:
(1) The depreciated value immediately prior to damage or loss of property damaged beyond economical repair or lost, less any salvage value; or
(2) The reasonable cost of repairs when property is economically repairable, provided that the cost of repairs does not exceed the depreciated value.
(j)
Notification.
The approving authority shall notify the claimant in writing of the action taken on the claim and, if the claim is disapproved or only partially approved, the reasons therefor.
(k)
Carrier or insurer.
In the event a claim submitted against a carrier or insurer under § 180.106 had not been settled before settlement of a claim against the Government under this part, the approving authority shall notify such carrier or insurer to pay the proceeds of the claim to OPM to the extent OPM has made payment to the claimant.
(l)
Review.
The action of the approving authority is final; however, the decision may be reconsidered if the claimant so requests and submits a written explanation why reconsideration is appropriate.
(m)
Attorney's fees.
No more than 10 per centum of the amount paid in settlement of each individual claim submitted and settled under this subpart shall be paid or delivered to or received by any agent or attorney on account of services rendered in connection with that claim and the same shall be unlawful, any contract to the contrary notwithstanding. Any person violating this or any other provision of sections 240 to 243 of title 31, United States Code, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction thereof shall be fined in any sum not exceeding $1000.

§ 185.133
Determining the amount of penalties and assessments.
(a) In determining an appropriate amount of civil penalties and assessments, the ALJ and the authority head, upon appeal, should evaluate any circumstances that mitigate or aggravate the violation and should articulate in their opinions the reasons that support the penalties and assessments they impose. Because of the intangible costs of fraud, the expense of investigating such conduct, and the need to deter others who might be similarly tempted, double damages and a significant civil penalty ordinarily should be imposed.
(b) Although not exhaustive, the following factors are among those that may influence the ALJ and the authority head in determining the amount of penalties and assessments to impose with respect to the misconduct (
i.e.,
the false, fictitious, or fraudulent claims or statements) charged in the complaint;
(1) The number of false, fictitious or fraudulent claims or statements;
(2) The time period over which such claims or statements were made;
(3) The degree of the defendant's culpability with respect to the misconduct;
(4) The amount of money or the value of the property, services, or benefit falsely claimed;
(5) The value of the Government's actual loss as a result of the misconduct, including foreseeable consequential damages and the costs of investigation;
(6) The relationship of the amount imposed as civil penalties to the amount of the Government's loss;
(7) The potential or actual impact of the misconduct upon public confidence in the management of Government programs and operations;
(8) Whether the defendant has engaged in a pattern of the same or similar misconduct;
(9) Whether the defendant attempted to conceal the misconduct;
(10) The degree to which the defendant has involved others in the misconduct or in concealing it;
(11) Where the misconduct of employees or agents is imputed to the defendant, the extent to which the defendant's practices fostered or attempted to preclude such misconduct;
(12) Whether the defendant cooperated in or obstructed an investigation of the misconduct;
(13) Whether the defendant assisted in identifying and prosecuting other wrongdoers;
(14) The complexity of the program or transaction, and the degree of the defendant's sophistication with respect to it, including the extent of the defendant's prior participation in the program or in similar transactions;
(15) Whether the defendant has been found, in any criminal, civil, or administrative proceeding to have engaged in similar misconduct or to have dealt dishonestly with the Government of the United States or of a State, directly or indirectly;
(16) The need to deter the defendant and others from engaging in the same or similar misconduct; and
(17) The potential impact of the misconduct on the rights of others.

§ 185.134
Witnesses.
(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, testimony at the hearing shall be given orally by witnesses under oath or affirmation.

Prior written statements of witnesses proposed to testify at the hearing and deposition transcripts shall be exchanged as provided in § 185.123(a).
(c) The ALJ shall exercise reasonable control over the mode and order of interrogating witnesses and presenting evidence so as to—

To the extent permitted by the ALJ, cross-examination on matters outside the scope of direct examination shall be conducted in the manner of direct examination and may proceed by leading questions only if the witness is a hostile witness, an adverse party, or a witness identified with an adverse party.
(f) Upon motion of any party, the ALJ shall order witnesses excluded so that they cannot hear the testimony of other witnesses. This rule does not authorize exclusion of the following:
(1) A party who is an individual;
(2) In the case of a party that is not an individual, an officer or employee of the party designated by the party's representative; or
(3) An individual whose presence is shown by a party to be essential to the presentation of its case, including an
individual employed by the Government engaged in assisting the representative for the Government.

(c) The ALJ shall promptly serve the initial decision on all parties within 90 days after the time for submission of post-hearing briefs and reply briefs (if permitted) has expired. The ALJ shall at the same time serve all parties with a statement describing the right of any defendant determined to be liable for a civil penalty or assessment to file a motion for reconsideration with the ALJ or a notice of appeal with the authority head. If the ALJ fails to meet the deadline contained in this paragraph, he or she shall notify the parties of the reason for the delay and shall set a new deadline.
(d) Unless the initial decision of the ALJ is timely appealed to the authority head, or a motion for reconsideration of the initial decision is timely filed, the initial decision shall constitute the final decision of the authority head and shall be final and binding on the parties 30 days after it is issued by the ALJ.

Definitions.
In this chapter:
(a) Excepted service has the meaning given that term by section 2103 of title 5, United States Code, and includes all positions in the executive branch of the Federal Government which are specifically excepted from the competitive service by or pursuant to statute, by the President, or by the Office of Personnel Management, and which are not in the Senior Executive Service.
(b)
Excepted position
means a position in the excepted service.
(5 U.S.C. 2103)
§ 213.102
Identification of positions in Schedule A, B, C, or D.
(a) As provided in 5 U.S.C. 3302, the President may prescribe rules governing the competitive service. The rules shall provide, as nearly as conditions of good administration warrant, for—
(1) Necessary exceptions of positions from the competitive service; and
(2) Necessary exceptions from the provisions of sections 2951, 3304(a), 3321, 7202, and 7203 of title 5, U.S. Code.
(b) The President delegated authority to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) in Civil Service Rule VI to except positions from the competitive service when OPM determines that:
(1) Appointments thereto through competitive examination are not practicable; or
(2) Recruitment from among students attending qualifying educational institutions or individuals who have recently completed qualifying educational programs can better be achieved by devising additional means for recruiting and assessing candidates that diverge from the processes generally applicable to the competitive service.
(3)(i) Upon determining that any position or group of positions, as defined in § 302.101(c), should be excepted indefinitely or temporarily from the competitive service, the Office of Personnel Management will authorize placement of the position or group of positions into Schedule A, B, C, or D, as applicable. Unless otherwise specified in a particular appointing authority, an agency may make Schedule A, B, C, or D appointments on either a permanent or nonpermanent basis, with any appropriate work schedule (
i.e.,
full-time, part-time, seasonal, on-call, or intermittent).
(ii) When OPM establishes eligibility requirements (e.g., residence, family
income) for appointment under particular Schedule A, B, or D exceptions, an individual's eligibility for appointment must be determined before appointment and without regard to any conditions that will result from the appointment.
(c) For purposes of making any such determinations,
positions
includes:
(1) Those that are intended to be removed indefinitely from the competitive service because the nature of the position itself precludes it from being in the competitive service (e.g., because it is impracticable to examine for the knowledge, skills, and abilities required for the job); and
(2) Those that are intended to be removed temporarily from the competitive service to allow for targeted recruiting and hiring from among a particular class of persons, as defined by the Office of Personnel Management, with the opportunity for the persons selected for those positions to convert to the competitive service at a later date.

Agencies may make temporary appointments for a period not to exceed 1 year, unless the applicable Schedule A, B, C, or D authority specifies a shorter period. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, agencies may extend temporary appointments for no more than 1 additional year (24 months of total service). Appointment to a successor position (
i.e.,
a position that replaces and absorbs the original position) is considered to be an extension of the original appointment. Appointment to a position involving the same basic duties, in the same major subdivision of the agency, and in the same local commuting area is also considered to be an extension of the original appointment.
(2)
Restrictions on refilling positions under temporary appointments.
Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, an agency may not fill any position (or its successor) by a temporary appointment in Schedule A, B, C, or D if that position had previously been filled by temporary appointment(s) in either the competitive or excepted service for an aggregate of 2 years, or 24 months, within the preceding 3-year period. This limitation does not apply to programs established to provide for
systematic exchange between a Federal agency and non-Federal organizations.
(3)
Exceptions to the general limits.
The service limits and restrictions on refilling positions set out in this section do not apply when:
(i) Positions involve intermittent or seasonal work, and employment in the same or a successor position under one or more appointing authorities totals less than 6 months (1,040 hours), excluding overtime, in a service year. The service year is the calendar year that begins on the date of the employee's initial appointment in the agency. Should employment in a position filled under this exception total 6 months or more in any service year, the general limits set out in this section will apply to subsequent extension or reappointment unless OPM approves continued exception under this section. An individual may be employed for training for up to 120 days following initial appointment and up to 2 weeks a year thereafter without regard to the service year limitation.
(ii) Positions are filled under an authority established for the purpose of enabling the appointees to continue or enhance their education, or to meet academic or professional qualification requirements. These include the authorities set out in paragraphs (r) and (s) of § 213.3102 and paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of § 213.3402, and authorities granted to individual agencies for use in connection with internship, fellowship, residency, or student programs.
(iii) OPM approves extension of specific temporary appointments beyond 2 years (24 months total service) when necessitated by major reorganizations or base closings or other rare and unusual circumstances. Requests based on major reorganization, base closing, restructuring, or other unusual circumstances that apply agencywide must be made by an official at the headquarters level of the Department or agency. Requests involving extension of appointments to a specific position or project based on other unusual circumstances may be submitted by the employing office to the appropriate OPM service center.

# Schedule A
§ 213.3101
Positions other than those of a confidential or policy-determining character for which it is impracticable to examine.
Upon specific authorization by OPM, agencies may make appointments under this section to positions which are not of a confidential or policy-determining character, and which are not in the Senior Executive Service, for which it is not practicable to examine. Examining for this purpose means application of the qualification standards and requirements established for the competitive service. Positions filled under this authority are excepted from the competitive service and constitute Schedule A. For each authorization under this section, OPM shall assign an identifying number from 213.3102 through 213.3199 to be used by the appointing agency in recording appointments made under that authorization.

(f)-(h) [Reserved]
(i) Temporary and less-than-full time positions for which examining is impracticable. These are:
(1) Positions in remote/isolated locations where examination is impracticable. A remote/isolated location is outside the local commuting area of a population center from which an employee can reasonably be expected to travel on short notice under adverse weather and/or road conditions which are normal for the area. For this purpose, a population center is a town with housing, schools, health care, stores and other businesses in which the servicing examining office can schedule tests and/or reasonably expect to attract applicants. An individual appointed under this authority may not be employed in the same agency under a combination of this and any other appointment to positions involving related duties and requiring the same qualifications for more than 1,040 workings hour in a service year. Temporary appointments under this authority may be extended in 1-year increments, with no limit on the number of such extensions, as an exception to the service limits in § 213.104.
(2) Positions for which a critical hiring need exists. This includes both short-term positions and continuing positions that an agency must fill on an interim basis pending completion of competitive examining, clearances, or other procedures required for a longer appointment. Appointments under this authority may not exceed 30 days and may be extended for up to an additional 30 days if continued employment is essential to the agency's operations. The appointments may not be used to extend the service limit of any other appointing authority. An agency may not employ the same individual under this authority for more than 60 days in any 12-month period.
(3) Other positions for which OPM determines that examining is impracticable.

Position to which appointed.
Employees who are entitled to placement under § 353.110 will be appointed to a position that OPM determines is equivalent in pay and grade to the one the individual left, unless the individual elects to be placed in a position of lower grade or pay. National Guard Technicians whose eligibility is based upon a disability may be appointed at the same grade, or equivalent, as their National Guard Technician position or at any lower grade for which they are available.
(4)
Conditions of appointment.
(i) Individuals whose placement eligibility is based on an appointment without time limit will receive appointments without time limit under this authority. These appointees may be reassigned, promoted, or demoted to any position within the same agency for which they qualify.
(ii) Individuals who are eligible for placement under § 353.110 based on a time-limited appointment will be given
appointments for a time period equal to the unexpired portion of their previous appointment.

Permanent or time-limited employment options.
An agency may make permanent or time-limited appointments under this paragraph (u)(4) where an applicant supplies proof of disability as described in paragraph (u)(3) of this section and the agency determines that the individual is likely to succeed in the performance of the duties of the position for which he or she is applying. In determining whether the individual is likely to succeed in performing the duties of the position, the agency may rely upon the applicant's employment, educational, or other relevant experience, including but not limited to service under another type of appointment in the competitive or excepted services.
(5)
Temporary employment options.
An agency may make a temporary appointment when:
(i) The agency determines that it is necessary to observe the applicant on the job to determine whether the applicant is able or ready to perform the duties of the position.

§ 230.402
Agency authority to make emergency-indefinite appointments in a national emergency.
(a)
When a national emergency exists
—(1)
Definition.
A national emergency must meet
all
of the following conditions:
(i) It was declared by the President or Congress.
(ii) It involves a danger to the United States' safety, security, or stability that results from specified circumstances or conditions and that is national in scope.
(iii) It requires a national program specifically intended to combat the threat to national safety, security, or stability.

Termination of a national emergency.
A national emergency no longer exists if it is officially terminated by the President or Congress, or if the
specific
circumstances, conditions, or program cited in the original declaration are terminated or corrected.
(b)
Basic authority.
Agencies may make emergency-indefinite appointments without OPM approval during any national emergency as defined in paragraph (a) of this section. The head of an agency with a defense-related mission may request OPM's approval to make emergency-indefinite appointments without a declared national emergency when the President has authorized the call-up of some portion of the military reserves for some military purpose. The request must demonstrate that normal hiring procedures cannot meet surge employment requirements and that use of emergency-indefinite appointments is necessary for economy and efficiency. Except as provided by paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, agencies must make emergency-indefinite appointments from appropriate registers of eligibles as long as there are available eligibles.
(c)
Appointment under direct-hire authority.
An agency may make emergency-indefinite appointments under this section using the direct-hire procedures in part 337 of this chapter.
(d)
Appointment noncompetitively.
An agency may give emergency-indefinite appointments under this section to the following classes of persons without regard to registers of eligibles and the provisions in § 332.102 of this chapter:
(1) Persons who were recruited on a standby basis prior to the national emergency;
(2) Members of the National Defense Executive Reserve, designated in accordance with section 710(e) of the Defense Production Act of 1950, Executive Order 11179 of September 22, 1964, and applications issued by the agency authorized to implement the law and Executive Order; and
(3) Former Federal employees eligible for reinstatement.
(e)
Tenure of emergency-indefinite employees.
(1) Emergency-indefinite employees do not acquire a competitive status on the basis of their emergency-indefinite appointments.
(2) An emergency-indefinite appointment may be continued for the duration of the emergency for which it is made.
(f)
Trial period.
(1) The first year of service of an emergency-indefinite employee is a trial period.
(2) The agency may terminate the appointment of an emergency-indefinite employee at any time during the trial period. The employee is entitled to the procedures set forth in § 315.804 or § 315.805 of this chapter as appropriate.
(g)
Eligibility for within-grade increases.
An emergency-indefinite employee serving in a position subject to the General Schedule is eligible for within-grade increases in accordance with subpart D of part 531 of this chapter.
(h)
Applications of other regulations.
(1) The term
indefinite employee
includes an emergency-indefinite employee or an employee under an emergency appointment as used in the following: parts 351, 353 of this chapter, subpart G of part 550 of this chapter, and part 752 of this chapter.
(2) The selection procedures of part 337 of this chapter apply to emergency-indefinite appointments that use the direct-hire authority under paragraph (c) of this section.
(3) Despite the provisions in § 831.201(a)(11) of this chapter, an employee serving under an emergency-indefinite appointment under authority of this section is excluded from retirement coverage, except as provided in paragraph (b) of § 831.201 of this chapter.
(i)
Promotion, demotion, or reassignment.
An agency may promote, demote, or reassign an emergency-indefinite employee to any position for which it is making emergency-indefinite appointments.

§ 250.101
Standards and requirements for agency personnel actions.
When taking a personnel action authorized by this chapter, an agency must comply with qualification standards and regulations issued by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), the instructions OPM has published in the Guide to Processing Personnel Actions, and the provisions of any delegation agreement OPM has made with the agency. When taking a personnel action that results from a decision or order of OPM, the Merit Systems Protection Board, Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, or Federal Labor Relations Authority, as authorized by the rules and regulations of those agencies, or as the result of a court order, a judicial or administrative settlement agreement, or an arbitral award under a negotiated agreement, the agency must follow the instructions in the Guide to Processing Personnel Actions and comply with all other relevant substantive and documentary requirements, including those applicable to retirement, life insurance, health benefits, and other benefits provided under this chapter.
§ 250.102
Delegated authorities.
OPM may delegate its authority, including authority for competitive examinations, to agencies, under 5 U.S.C. 1104(a)(2), through a delegation agreement. The delegation agreement developed with the agency must specify the conditions for applying the delegated authorities. The agreement must also set minimum standards of performance and describe the system of oversight by which the agency and OPM will monitor the use of each delegated authority.
§ 250.103
Consequences of improper agency actions.
If OPM finds that an agency has taken an action contrary to a law, rule, regulation, or standard that OPM administers, OPM may require the agency to take corrective action. OPM may suspend or revoke a delegation agreement established under § 250.102 at any time if it determines that the
agency is not adhering to the provisions of the agreement. OPM may suspend or withdraw any authority granted under this chapter to an agency, including any authority granted by delegation agreement, when OPM finds that the agency has not complied with qualification standards OPM has issued, instructions OPM has published, or the regulations in this chapter. OPM also may suspend or withdraw these authorities when it determines that doing so is in the interest of the civil service for any other reason.

§ 250.201
Coverage and purpose.
Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 1103(c), this subpart defines a set of systems, including standards and metrics, for assessing the management of human capital by Federal agencies. These regulations apply to agencies covered by 31 U.S.C. 901(b) of the Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101-576), as well as 5 U.S.C. 1401 and support the performance planning and reporting that is required by sections 1115(a)(3) and (f) and 1116(d)(5) of title 31, United States Code.
[83 FR 55931, Nov. 9, 2018]
§ 250.202
Definitions.
Chief Human Capital Officer (CHCO)
is the agency's senior leader whose primary duty is to:
(1) Advise and assist the head of the agency and other agency officials in carrying out the agency's responsibilities for selecting, developing, training, and managing a high-quality, productive workforce in accordance with merit system principles; and
(2) Implement the rules and regulations of the President, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), and the laws governing the civil service within the agency.
CHCO agency
is an Executive agency, as defined by 5 U.S.C. 105, which is required by 5 U.S.C. 1401 and 31 U.S.C. 901(b)(1) to appoint a CHCO.
Director of OPM
is, among other things, the President's advisor on actions that may be taken to promote an efficient civil service and a systematic application of the merit system principles, including recommending policies relating to the selection, promotion, transfer, performance, pay, conditions of service, tenure, and separation of employees. The Director of OPM provides governmentwide leadership and direction in the strategic management of the Federal workforce.
Evaluation system
is an agency's overarching system for evaluating the results of all human capital planning and implementation of human capital strategies to inform the agency's continuous process improvement efforts. This system is also used for ensuring compliance with all applicable statutes, rules, regulations, and agency policies.
Federal Workforce Priorities Report (FWPR)
is a strategic human capital report, published by OPM by the first Monday in February of any year in which the term of the President commences. OPM may extend the date of publication if needed. The report communicates key Governmentwide human capital priorities and suggested strategies. The report also informs agency strategic and human capital planning.
Focus areas
are areas that agencies and human capital practitioners must focus on to achieve a system's standard.
HRStat
is a strategic human capital performance evaluation process that identifies, measures, and analyzes human capital data to inform the impact of an agency's human capital management on organizational results with the intent to improve human capital outcomes. HRStat, which is a quarterly review process, is a component of an agency's strategic planning and alignment and evaluation systems that are part of the Human Capital Framework.
Human Capital Evaluation Framework
underlies the three human capital evaluation mechanisms (
i.e.,
HRStat, Audits, and Human Capital Reviews) to create a central evaluation framework that integrates the outcomes from each to provide OPM and agencies with an understanding of how human capital policies and programs are supporting missions.
Human Capital Framework (HCF)
provides comprehensive guidance on the principles of strategic human capital management in the Federal Government. The framework, as described in § 250.203 below, provides direction on human capital planning, implementation, and evaluation in the Federal environment.
Human Capital Operating Plan (HCOP)
is an agency's human capital implementation document, which describes how an agency will execute the human capital elements stated within Agency Strategic Plan and Annual Performance Plan (APP). Program specific workforce investments and strategies (e.g., hiring, closing skill gaps, etc.) should be incorporated into the APPs as appropriate. The HCOP should clearly execute each of the four systems of the HCF. The HCOP should align with the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) Modernization Act of 2010, annual performance plans and timelines.
Human Capital Review (HCR)
is OPM's annual, evidence-based review of an agency's design and implementation of its HCOP, independent audit, and HRStat programs to support mission accomplishment and human capital outcomes.
Independent audit program
is a component of an agency's evaluation system designed to review all human capital management systems and select human resources transactions to ensure efficiency, effectiveness, and legal and regulatory compliance.
Skill gap
is a variance between the current and projected workforce size and skills needed to ensure an agency has a cadre of talent available to meet its mission and make progress towards achieving its goals and objectives now and into the future.
Standard
is a consistent practice within human capital management in which agencies strive towards in each of the four HCF systems. The standards ensure that an agency's human capital management strategies, plans, and practices:
(1) Are integrated with strategic plans, annual performance plans and goals, and other relevant budget, finance, and acquisition plans;
(2) Contain measurable and observable performance targets;
(3) Are communicated in an open and transparent manner to facilitate cross-agency collaboration to achieve mission objectives; and
(4) Inform the development of human capital management priority goals for the Federal Government.
§ 250.203
Strategic human capital management systems and standards.
Strategic human capital management systems, standards, and focus areas are defined within the Human Capital Framework (HCF). The four systems described below provide definitions and standards for human capital planning, implementation, and evaluation. The HCF systems and standards are:
(a)
Strategic planning and alignment.
A system that ensures agency human capital programs are aligned with agency mission, goals, and objectives through analysis, planning, investment, and measurement. The standards for the strategic planning and alignment system require an agency to ensure their human capital management strategies, plans, and practices—
(1) Integrate strategic plans, annual performance plans and goals, and other relevant budget, finance, and acquisition plans;
(2) Contain measurable and observable performance targets; and
(3) Communicate in an open and transparent manner to facilitate cross-agency collaboration to achieve mission objectives.
(b)
Talent management.
A system that promotes a high-performing workforce, identifies and closes skill gaps, and implements and maintains programs to attract, acquire, develop, promote, and retain quality and diverse talent. The standards for the talent management system require an agency to—
(1) Plan for and manage current and future workforce needs;
(2) Design, develop, and implement proven strategies and techniques and practices to attract, hire, develop, and retain talent; and
(3) Make progress toward closing any knowledge, skill, and competency gaps throughout the agency.
(c)
Performance culture.
A system that engages, develops, and inspires a diverse, high-performing workforce by creating, implementing, and maintaining effective performance management strategies, practices, and activities that support mission objectives. The standards for the performance culture system require an agency to have—
(1) Strategies and processes to foster a culture of engagement and collaboration;
(2) A diverse, results-oriented, high-performing workforce; and
(3) A performance management system that differentiates levels of performance of staff, provides regular feedback, and links individual performance to organizational goals.
(d)
Evaluation.
A system that contributes to agency performance by monitoring and evaluating outcomes of its human capital management strategies, policies, programs, and activities by meeting the following standards—
(1) Ensuring compliance with merit system principles; and
(2) Identifying, implementing, and monitoring process improvements.
§ 250.204
Agency roles and responsibilities.
(a) An agency must use the systems and standards established in this part, and any metrics that OPM subsequently provides in guidance, to plan, implement, evaluate and improve human capital policies and programs. These policies and programs must—
(1) Align with Executive branch policies and priorities, as well as with individual agency missions, goals, and strategic objectives. Agencies must align their human capital management strategies to support the Federal Workforce Priorities Report, agency strategic plan, agency performance plan, and agency budget;
(2) Be based on comprehensive workforce planning and analysis;
(3) Monitor and address skill gaps within governmentwide and agency-specific mission-critical occupations by using comprehensive data analytic methods and gap closure strategies;
(4) Recruit, hire, develop, and retain an effective workforce, especially in the agency's mission-critical occupations;
(5) Ensure leadership continuity by implementing and evaluating recruitment, development, and succession plans for leadership positions;
(6) Implement a knowledge management process to ensure continuity in knowledge sharing among employees at all levels within the organization;
(7) Sustain an agency culture that engages employees by defining, valuing, eliciting, and rewarding high performance; and
(8) Hold the agency head, executives, managers, human capital officers, and human capital staff accountable for efficient and effective strategic human capital management, in accordance with merit system principles.
(b) Each agency must meet the statutory requirements of the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) Modernization Act of 2010, by including within the Annual Performance Plan (APP) human capital practices that are aligned to the agency strategic plan. The human capital portion of the APP must include performance goals and indicators.
(c) An agency's Deputy Secretary, equivalent, or designee is responsible for ensuring that the agency's strategic plan includes a description of the operational processes, skills and technology, and human capital information required to achieve the agency's goals and objectives. Specifically, the Deputy Secretary, equivalent, or designee will—
(1) Allocate resources;
(2) Ensure the agency incorporates applicable priorities identified within the Federal Workforce Strategic Priorities Report and is working to close governmentwide and agency-specific skill gaps; and
(3) Remain informed about the progress of their agency's quarterly HRStat reviews, which are led by the CHCO, in collaboration with the PIO.

(ii) Based on OPM or independent audit findings, issue a report to its leadership and OPM containing the analysis, results, and corrective actions taken; and
(6) Improve strategic human capital management by adjusting strategies and practices, as appropriate, after assessing the results of performance goals, indicators, and business analytics.
(7) The agency's human capital policies and programs must support the implementation and monitoring of the Federal Workforce Priorities Report, which is published by OPM every four years, and—
(i) Improve strategic human capital management by using performance goals, indicators, and business analytics to assess results of the human capital management strategies planned and implemented;
(ii) Ensure human capital activities support merit system principles;
(iii) Adjust human capital management strategies and practices in response to outcomes identified during HRStat quarterly data-driven reviews of human capital performance to improve organizational processes; and
(iv) Use the governmentwide and agency-specific human capital strategies to inform resource requests (e.g., staff full-time equivalents, training, analytical software, etc.) into the agency's annual budget process.
§ 250.205
Human Capital Operating Plan (HCOP).
Each agency must develop a Human Capital Operating Plan (HCOP) that aligns with an agency's Strategic Plan and Annual Performance Plan. The HCOP is to be reviewed and approved annually, and updated as needed. The HCOP must demonstrate how an agency's human capital implementation strategies follow the principles and standards of the HCF while including an explanation of how human capital policies, initiatives, objectives, and resources will be used to achieve agencies' human capital goals. The HCOP will be made available to OPM upon request. The HCOP must—
(a) Be established by the CHCO, in collaboration with the agency's senior management team;
(b) Be used to support the execution of an agency's strategic plan, as an agency's human capital can affect whether or not a strategy or strategic goal is achieved;
(c) Explicitly describe the agency-specific skill and competency gaps that must be closed through the use of agency selected human capital strategies;
(d) Include annual human capital performance goals and measures that will support the evaluation of the agency's human capital strategies, through HRStat quarterly reviews, and that are aligned to support mission accomplishment;
(e) Reflect the systems and standards defined in § 250.203 above, consistent with their agency strategic plan and annual performance plan, to address strategic human capital priorities and goals; and
(f) Address the governmentwide priorities identified in the Federal Workforce Strategic Priorities Report.
§ 250.206
Human Capital Reviews.
Each agency must participate with OPM in a Human Capital Review (HCR). The HCR will be conducted during the evaluation phase and OPM will issue guidance about the HCR requirements.
§ 250.207
HRStat.
The Chief Human Capital Officer must design, implement and monitor agency human capital policies and programs that—
(a) Use the HRStat quarterly reviews, in coordination with the agency Performance Improvement Officer (PIO), to assess the agency's progress toward meeting its strategic and performance goals;

# Subpart A—General Provisions
§ 251.101
Introduction.
(a) The regulations in this part apply to all Federal executive branch departments and agencies and their officers and employees.
(b) This part provides a framework for consulting and communicating with
non-labor organizations representing Federal employees and with other organizations on matters related to agency operations and personnel management.
(c) The purposes of consultation and communication are: the improvement of agency operations, personnel management, and employee effectiveness; the exchange of information (e.g., ideas, opinions, and proposals); and the establishment of policies that best serve the public interest in accomplishing the mission of the agency.
(d) An agency's consultation and communication with organizations representing Federal employees and with other organizations under this part may not take on the character of negotiations or consultations regarding conditions of employment of bargaining unit employees, which is reserved exclusively to labor organizations as provided for in Chapter 71 of title 5 of the U.S. Code or comparable provisions of other laws. The regulations in this part do not authorize any actions inconsistent with Chapter 71 of the U.S. Code or comparable provisions of other laws.
(e) The head of a Federal agency may determine that it is in the interest of the agency to consult, from time to time, with organizations other than labor organizations and associations of management officials and/or supervisors to the extent permitted by law. Under section 7(d)(2) and (3) of Executive Order 11491, as amended, recognition of a labor organization does not preclude an agency from consulting or dealing with a veterans organization, or with a religious, social, fraternal, professional, or other lawful association, not qualified as a labor organization, with respect to matters or policies which involve individual members of the organization or association or are of particular applicability to it or its members.
(f) Federal employees, including management officials and supervisors, may communicate with any Federal agency, officer, or other Federal entity on the employee's own behalf. However, Federal employees should be aware that 18 U.S.C. 205, in pertinent part, restricts Federal employees from acting, other than in the proper discharge of their official duties, as agents or attorneys for any person or organization other than a labor organization, before any Federal agency or other Federal entity in connection with any matter in which the United States is a party or has a direct and substantial interest. An exception to the prohibition found in 18 U.S.C. 205 permits Federal employees to represent certain nonprofit organizations before the Government except in connection with specified matters. Agency officials and employees are therefore advised to consult with their designated agency ethics officials for guidance regarding any conflicts of interest that may arise.

# Subpart B—Relationships With Organizations Representing Federal Employees and Other Organizations
§ 251.201
Associations of management officials and/or supervisors.
(a) As part of agency management, supervisors and managers should be included in the decision-making process and notified of executive-level decisions on a timely basis. Each agency must establish and maintain a system for intra-management communication and consultation with its supervisors and managers. Agencies must also establish consultative relationships with associations whose membership is primarily composed of Federal supervisory and/or managerial personnel, provided that such associations are not affiliated with any labor organization and that they have sufficient agency membership to assure a worthwhile dialogue with executive management. Consultative relationships with other non-labor organizations representing Federal employees are discretionary.
(b) Consultations should have as their objectives the improvement of managerial effectiveness and the working conditions of supervisors and managers, as well as the identification and resolution of problems affecting agency operations and employees, including supervisors and managers.
(c) The system of communication and consultation should be designed so that individual supervisors and managers are able to participate if they are not affiliated with an association of management officials and/or supervisors. At the same time, the voluntary joining together of supervisory and management personnel in groups of associations shall not be precluded or discouraged.
§ 251.202
Agency support to organizations representing Federal employees and other organizations.
(a) An agency may provide support services to an organization when the agency determines that such action would benefit the agency's programs or would be warranted as a service to employees who are members of the organization and complies with applicable statutes and regulations. Examples of such support services are as follows:
(1) Permitting employees, in appropriate cases, to use agency equipment or administrative support services for preparing papers to be presented at conferences or symposia or published in journals;
(2) Using the authority under 5 U.S.C. 4109 and 4110, as implemented by 5 CFR part 410, to pay expenses of employees to attend professional organization meetings when such attendance is for the purpose of employee development or directly concerned with agency functions or activities and the agency can derive benefits from employee attendance at such meetings; and
(3) Following a liberal policy in authorizing excused absence for other employees who are willing to pay their own expenses to attend a meeting of a professional association or other organization from which an agency could derive some benefits.
(b) Agencies may provide Government resources support to organizations (such as space in Government facilities for meeting purposes and the use of agency bulletin boards, internal agency mail distribution systems, electronic bulletin boards and other means of informing agency employees about meetings and activities) in accordance with appropriate General Services Administration regulations contained in title 41 of the Code of Federal Regulations. The mere provision of such support to any organization is not to be
construed as Federal sponsorship, sanction, or endorsement of the organization or its activities.

# Subpart C—Dues Withholding
§ 251.301
Associations of management officials and/or supervisors.
Dues withholding for associations of management officials and/or supervisors is covered in 5 CFR 550.331.

# Subpart A—Basic Policies on Maintenance of Personnel Records
§ 293.101
Purpose and scope.
(a) This subpart sets forth basic policies governing the creation, development, maintenance, processing, use, dissemination, and safeguarding of personnel records which the Office of Personnel Management requires agencies to maintain in the personnel management or personnel policy setting process.
(b) Agencies in the Executive Branch of the Federal Government are subject to specific Office of Personnel Management recordkeeping requirements to varying degrees, pursuant to statute,
Office regulation, or formal agreements between the Office and agencies. This subpart applies to any department or independent establishment in the Executive Branch of the Federal Government, including a government corporation or Government controlled corporation, except those specifically excluded from Office recordkeeping requirements by statute, Office regulation, or formal agreement between the Office and that agency.
§ 293.102
Definitions.
In this part:
Agency
means any executive department, military department, Government corporation, Government controlled corporation, or other establishment in the Executive Branch of the Government (including the Executive Office of the President), or any independent regulatory agency;
Data subject
means the individual about whom the Office or agency is maintaining information in a system of records;
Individual
means a citizen of the United States or an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence;
Information
means papers, records, photographs, magnetic storage media, micro storage media, and other documentary materials regardless of physical form or characteristics, containing data about an individual and required by the Office in pursuance of law or in connection with the discharge of official business, as defined by statute, regulation, or administrative procedure;
Maintain
includes collect, use, or disseminate;
Office
means the Office of Personnel Management;
Personnel record
means any record concerning an individual which is maintained an used in the personnel management or personnel policysetting process. (For purposes of this part, this term is not limited just to those personnel records in a system of records and subject to the Privacy Act);
Record
means any item, collection, or grouping of information about an individual that is maintained by an agency, including, but not limited to, his or her education, financial transactions, medical history, criminal history, or employment history;
System of records
means a group of records under the control of any agency from which information is retrieved by the name of the individual or by some identifying number, symbol, or other identifying particular assigned to the individual.
§ 293.103
Recordkeeping standards.
(a) The head of each agency shall ensure that persons having access to or involved in the creation, development, processing, use, or maintenance of personnel records are informed of pertinent recordkeeping regulations and requirements of the Office of Personnel Management and the agency. Authority to maintain personnel records does not constitute authority to maintain information in the record merely because it may be useful; both Government-wide and internal agency personnel records shall contain only information concerning an individual that is relevant and necessary to accomplish the Federal personnel management purposes required by statute, Executive order, or Office regulation.
(b) The Office is responsible for establishing minimum standards of accuracy, relevancy, necessity, timeliness, and completeness for personnel records it requires agencies to maintain. These standards are discussed in appropriate chapters of the Guide to Personnel Recordkeeping. Before approval of any agency requests for changes in recordkeeping practices governed by the Guide to Personnel Recordkeeping, the Office will examine the proposal or request in the context of such standards set forth by the agency in support of the proposal and in light of the personnel program area that requires these records.
[44 FR 65033, Nov. 9, 1979, as amended at 66 FR 66709, Dec. 27, 2001]
§ 293.104
Collection of information.
(a) Any information in personnel records whether or not those records are in a system of records, used in whole or in part in making a determination about an individual's rights, benefits, or privileges under Federal personnel programs should, to the
greatest extent practicable, be collected directly from the individual concerned. Factors to be considered in determining whether to collect the data from the individual concerned or a third party are when:
(1) The nature of the information is such that it can only be obtained from another party;
(2) The cost of collecting the information directly from the individual is unreasonable when compared with the cost of collecting it from another party;
(3) There is virtually no risk that information collected from other parties, if inaccurate, could result in a determination adverse to the individual concerned;
(4) The information supplied by an individual must be verified by another party; or
(5) There are provisions made, to the greatest extent practicable, to vertify information collected from another party with the individual concerned.
§ 293.105
Restrictions on collection and use of information.
(a) First Amendment. Personnel records describing how individuals exercise rights guaranteed by the First Amendment are prohibited unless expressly authorized by statute, or by the individual concerned, or unless pertinent to and within the scope of an authorized law enforcement activity. These rights include, but are not limited to, free exercise of religious and political beliefs, freedom of speech and the press, and freedom to assemble and to petition the government.
(b) Social Security Number.
(1) Agencies may not require individuals to disclose their Social Security Number unless disclosure would be required;
(i) Under Federal statute; or
(ii) Under any statute, Executive order, or regulation that authorizes any Federal, State, or local agency maintaining a system of records that was in existence and operating prior to January 1, 1975, to request the Social Security Number as a necessary means of verifying the identity of an individual.
(2) Individuals asked to voluntarily (circumstances not covered by paragraph (b)(1) of this section) provide their Social Security Number shall suffer no penalty or denial of benefits for refusing to provide it.
§ 293.106
Safeguarding information about individuals.
(a) To ensure the security and confidentiality of personnel records, in whatever form, each agency shall establish administrative, technical, and physical controls to protect information in personnel records from unauthorized access, use, modification, destruction, or disclosure. As a minimum, these controls shall require that all persons whose official duties require access to and use of personnel records be responsible and accountable for safeguarding those records and for ensuring that the records are secured whenever they are not in use or under the direct control of authorized persons. Generally, personnel records should be held, processed, or stored only where facilities and conditions are adequate to prevent unauthorized access.
(b) Personnel records must be stored in metal filing cabinets which are locked when the records are not in use, or in a secured room. Alternative storage facilities may be employed provided they furnish an equivalent or greater degree of security than these methods. Except for access by the data subject, only employees whose official duties require access shall be allowed to handle and use personnel records, in whatever form or media the records might appear. To the extent feasible, entry into personnel record storage areas shall be similarly limited. Documentation of the removal of records from storage areas must be kept so that adequate control procedures can be established to assure that removed records are returned on a timely basis.
(c) Disposal and destruction of personnel records shall be in accordance with the General Record Schedule issued by the General Services Administration for the records or, alternatively, with Office or agency records control schedules approved by the National Archives and Records Service of the General Services Administration.
§ 293.107
Special safeguards for automated records.
(a) In addition to following the security requirements of § 293.106 of this part, managers of automated personnel records shall establish administrative, technical, physical, and security safeguards for data about individuals in automated records, including input and output documents, reports, punched cards, magnetic tapes, disks, and on-line computer storage. The safeguards must be in writing to comply with the standards on automated data processing physical security issued by the National Bureau of Standards, U.S. Department of Commerce, and, as a minimum, must be sufficient to:
(1) Prevent careless, accidental, or unintentional disclosure, modification, or destruction of identifiable personal data;
(2) Minimize the risk that skilled technicians or knowledgeable persons could improperly obtain access to, modify, or destroy identifiable personnel data;
(3) Prevent casual entry by unskilled persons who have no official reason for access to such data;
(4) Minimize the risk of an unauthorized disclosure where use is made of identifiable personal data in testing of computer programs;
(5) Control the flow of data into, through, and from agency computer operations;
(6) Adequately protect identifiable data from environmental hazards and unneccessary exposure; and
(7) Assure adequate internal audit procedures to comply with these procedures.
(b) The disposal of identifiable personal data in automated files is to be accomplished in such a manner as to make the data unobtainable to unauthorized personnel. Unneeded personal data stored on reusable media such as magnetic tapes and disks must be erased prior to release of the media for reuse.
§ 293.108
Rules of conduct.
(a)
Scope.
These rules of conduct apply to all Office and agency employees responsible for creation, development, maintenance, processing, use, dissemination, and safeguarding of personnel records. The Office and agencies shall require that such employees are familiar with these and appropriate supplemental agency internal regulations.
(b)
Standards of conduct.
Office and agency employees whose official duties involve personnel records shall be sensitive to individual rights to personal privacy and shall not disclose information from any personnel record unless disclosure is part of their official duties or required by executive order, regulation, or statute (e.g., required by the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552).
(c)
Improper uses of personnel information.
Any Office or agency employee who makes a disclosure of personnel records knowing that such disclosure is unauthorized, or otherwise knowingly violates these regulations, shall be subject to disciplinary action and may also be subject to criminal penalties where the records are subject to the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a). Employees are prohibited from using personnel information not available to the public, gained through official duties, for commercial solicitation or sale, or for personal gain.

# Subpart B—Personnel Records Subject to the Privacy Act
§ 293.201
Purpose.
The purpose of this subpart is to set forth the criteria to be used to determine when personnel records on individuals are subject both to the regulations contained in this part and to Office or agency regulations implementing the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a. When personnel records are maintained within a system of records, the records are deemed to be within the scope of both the regulations in this part and Office or agency regulations implementing the Privacy Act.
§ 293.202
Records subject to Office or agency Privacy Act regulations.
When the Office of Personnel Management publishes in the
Federal Register
a notice of system of records for personnel records which are maintained by the agencies or by the Office, that system of records will be subject to the regulations in this part and also
to the regulations in part 297 of this chapter. When agencies publish a notice of system of records for personnel records required by the Office that are not included in the Office's notices, those agency systems of records will be subject both to the regulations contained in this part and to agency promulgated regulations that implement the Privacy Act.
§ 293.203
Review of Office or agency practices.
Reviews of agency personnel management policies and practices will be conducted to insure compliance with Office regulations. The Office may direct agencies to take whatever corrective action is necessary. Office or agency officials who have knowledge of violations of these regulations shall take whatever corrective action is necessary. Agencies shall list officials of the Office of Personnel Management as a routine user for personnel records to assist the Office in its oversight responsibilities.

§ 293.301
Applicability of regulations.
Except for those agencies specifically excluded from Office of Personnel Management (OPM) recordkeeping requirements by statute, OPM regulation, or formal agreement between OPM and the agency, this subpart applies to—and within this subpart agency means—each executive department and independent establishment of the Federal Government; each corporation wholly owned or controlled by the United States; and, with respect to positions subject to civil service rules and regulations, the legislative and judicial branches of the Federal Government. OPM will list agencies to which this subpart does not apply in the Guide to Personnel Recordkeeping, and will amend the Guide from time to time to update that list.
[76 FR 52537, Aug. 23, 2011]
§ 293.302
Establishment of Official Personnel Folder.
Each agency shall establish an Official Personnel Folder (OPF) for each employee occupying a position subject to this part, except as provided in § 293.306. Except as provided in the Guide to Personnel Recordkeeping, there will be only one OPF maintained for each employee regardless of service in various agencies.
[50 FR 3309, Jan. 24, 1985, as amended at 66 FR 66709, Dec. 27, 2001]
§ 293.303
The roles and responsibilities of the Office, agencies, and custodians.
(a) The Official Personnel Folder (OPF) of each employee in a position subject to civil service rules and regulations and of each former employee who held such a position is part of the records of the Office of Personnel Management (Office).
(b) The Office has Government-wide responsibility for developing regulations, practices and procedures for the establishment, maintenance, and transfer of OPFs.
(c) Agencies shall be responsible for the following:
(1) The establishment of the OPF for a new appointee or a new employee for whom no OPF has previously been established; and
(2) The maintenance of a previously existing OPF during the period any new appointee or employee remains an agency's employee.
(d)(1) Custodian means the agency in physical possession of an OPF. In the case of an electronic OPF (eOPF), the custodian is the agency that has primary access to an eOPF contained within a document management system approved by the Office.
(2) A custodian shall be responsible for the maintenance and transfer of the OPF or eOPF, and the costs associated with these activities.
(3) An agency is the custodian of an OPF it requests from the National Personnel Records Center (NPRC), for any temporary use, from the date that the OPF is transmitted by the NPRC to the
agency until the date that the NPRC receives the OPF back from the agency.
(4) An agency is no longer the custodian of an OPF once the OPF has been transferred to and accepted by the NPRC.
(5) Once NPRC has approved the transfer, the Office is the custodian of the OPF until the destruction date established for the file pursuant to the National Archive and Records Administration's General Records Schedule, unless another agency requests the OPF from the NPRC in the interim.
(e) Agencies and custodians shall carry out their responsibilities with respect to the OPF or eOPF in accordance with this subpart and the Office's Guide to Personnel Recordkeeping.
[76 FR 52537, Aug. 23, 2011]
§ 293.304
Maintenance and content of folder.
The head of each agency shall maintain in the Official Personnel Folder the reports of selection and other personnel actions named in section 2951 of title 5, United States Code. The folder shall contain long-term records affecting the employee's status and service as required by OPM's instructions and as designated in the Guide to Personnel Recordkeeping.
[58 FR 65533, Dec. 15, 1993]
§ 293.305
Type of folder to be used.
Each agency shall use only OPFs from Office of Federal Supply and Services stock (Standard Form 66) for the folders required by this part.
§ 293.306
Use of existing folders upon transfer or reemployment.
When an agency hires a person who has served on or after April 1, 1947, in a position subject to this part, it shall request the transfer of the OPF pertaining to the person's employment. The folder so obtained shall be used in lieu of establishing a new OPF. In the event that the prior service occurred wholly before April 1, 1947, the agency shall request any files or records that may be located in the Federal records storage center. The request shall note that because of the dates of service there will likely be no OPF. Any such file or record found for this individual shall be incorporated into the OPF being established for the employee.
(a) When a person for whom an OPF has been established transfers from one agency to another, the last employing (losing) agency shall, on request, transfer the OPF to the new employing agency.
(b) Before transferring the Official Personnel Folder, the losing agency shall:
(1) Remove those records of a temporary nature filed on the left side of the folder, except for PMRS employees' performance ratings of record including the performance plan on which the most recent rating was based;
(2) Transfer performance ratings of record and the performance plan on which the most recent rating was based from the Employee Performance File of PMRS employees to their Official Personnel Folder, if the ratings and plans are not maintained by the agency in the Official Personnel Folder; and
(3) Ensure that all permanent documents of the folder are complete, correct, and present in the folder in accordance with the Guide to Personnel Recordkeeping.
[50 FR 3309, Jan. 24, 1985, as amended at 50 FR 35494, Aug. 30, 1985; 66 FR 66709, Dec. 27, 2001]
§ 293.307
Disposition of folders of former Federal employees.
(a) Folders of persons separated from Federal employment must be retained by the losing agency for 30 working days after separation, and may be retained for additional 60 days (90 days where administratively necessary, e.g., where an appeal or an allegation of discrimination is made or where an employee retires or dies in service). Thereafter, the OPF must be transferred to the General Services Administration, National Personnel Records Center (Civilian Personnel Records), 111 Winnebago Street, St. Louis, Missouri 63118.
(b) When a former Federal employee is reappointed in the Federal service, the National Personnel Records Center (Civilian Personnel Records) shall, upon request, transfer the OPF to the new employing agency.
(c) Agencies are responsible for all costs associated with the establishment and maintenance of OPFs and the transfer of OPFs to the National Personnel Records Center.
(d) Agencies are responsible for all costs associated with agency-initiated requests for OPFs or services from the National Personnel Records Center.
[50 FR 3309, Jan. 24, 1985; 50 FR 8993, Mar. 6, 1985, as amended at 76 FR 52537, Aug. 23, 2011]
§ 293.308
Removal of temporary records from OPFs.
The employing agency having possession of an OPF shall remove temporary records from the OPF before it is transferred to another agency. For these and also for temporary records of their current employees, maintenance of the records shall be in accordance with General Records Schedule 1, promulgated by the General Services Administration.
§ 293.309
Reconstruction of lost OPFs.
Agencies will take necessary precautions to safeguard all OPFs. In the event of a lost or destroyed OPF, the current (or last, in the case of a former Federal employee) employing agency shall take the necessary action to reconstruct the essential portions of the OPF as specified in the Guide to Personnel Recordkeeping or other Office instructions.
[50 FR 3309, Jan. 24, 1985, as amended at 66 FR 66709, Dec. 27, 2001]
§ 293.310
Response to requests for information.
The Office, or an agency in physical possession of an OPF in response to a third party Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request may disclose information as provided in this subpart. A current employee's request for access to his/her own OPF (also included are employee performance file system folders and files) that cites the FOIA, as with all stated Privacy Act requests made by current employees, shall be processed in accordance with agency Privacy Act procedures consistent with Office regulations in part 297 of this chapter. All requests for their OPFs from former employees, and FOIA requests for former employee OPFs, shall be referred to the Office's regional or area office nearest to the location of the requester.
§ 293.311
Availability of information.
(a) The following information from both the OPF and employee performance file system folders, their automated equivalent records, and from other personnel record files that constitute an agency record within the meaning of the FOIA and which are under the control of the Office, about most present and former Federal employees, is available to the public:
(1) Name;
(2) Present and past position titles and occupational series;
(3) Present and past grades;
(4) Present and past annual salary rates (including performance awards or bonuses, incentive awards, merit pay amount, Meritorious or Distinguished Executive Ranks, and allowances and differentials);
(5) Present and past duty stations (includes room numbers, shop designations, or other identifying information regarding buildings or places of employment); and
(6) Position descriptions, identification of job elements, and those performance standards (but not actual performance appraisals) that the release of which would not interfere with law enforcement programs or severely inhibit agency effectiveness. Performance elements and standards (or work expectations) may be withheld when they are so interwined with performance appraisals that their disclosure would reveal an individual's performance appraisal.
(b) The Office or agency will generally not disclose information where the data sought is a list of names, present or past position titles, grades, salaries, performance standards, and/or duty stations of Federal employees which, as determined by the official responsible for custody of the information:
(1) Is selected in such a way that would reveal more about the employee on whom information is sought than the six enumerated items, the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy; or
(2) Would otherwise be protected from mandatory disclosure under an exemption of the FOIA.
(c) In addition to the information described in paragraph (a) of this section, a Government official may provide other information from these records (or automated equivalents) of an employee, to others outside of the agency, under a summons, warrant, subpoena, or other legal process; as provided by the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a(b)(4) through (b)(11)), under those Privacy Act routine uses promulgated by the Office, and as required by the FOIA.

Within those agencies, the requirements of this subpart apply to all employees occupying positions subject to civil service rules and regulations, including Senior Executive Service positions as defined in 5 U.S.C. 3132(a)(2).
§ 293.402
Establishment of separate employee performance record system.
(a) Copies of employees' performance ratings of record, including the performance plans on which the ratings are based, must be placed in either the employee's Official Personnel Folder (OPF) or in the Employee Performance File (EPF). However, other performance-related documents may be retained in the OPF only when the agency prescribes the use of a separate envelope, temporarily located in the OPF, and removed whenever the OPF (except as required in § 293.404(b)) is transferred to another agency. Performance ratings of record, including the performance plans on which the ratings are based, shall be retained on the left (temporary) side of the OPF. No other performance-related record shall be retained on the left (temporary) or right (long term) side of the OPF or shall be transferred to the National Personnel Records Center (except as required by § 293.404(b)).
(b) Except for performance records maintained in the OPF consistent with paragraph (a) of this section, each agency having employees occupying a position described in § 293.401 shall provide for maintenance of performance-related records for such employees in this EPF system. The agency may elect to retain records in a separate file that is located in the same office with the OPF, or in an envelope kept in the OPF itself. If the agency determines that a separate EPF is cost-effective, such a file may be located in another designated agency office (as specified in the agency's performance appraisal plan) including with supervisors or managers (hereinafter referred to as rating officials) or with Performance Review Boards. Any supporting documents that the agency may prescribe as necessary for agency officials in performance of their duties shall be kept in these files.
(c)(1) Agencies shall provide their employees access to their performance files (automated and manual). Such a request for access shall be processed in accordance with established agency procedures, consistent with Office of Personnel Management regulations regarding access to records contained in part 297 of this chapter. Such access shall be provided to the employee or to the employee's designated representative, and such records may also be disclosed to other officials of the agency who have a need for the documents in the performance of their duties.
(2) All other requests for performance documents made to agency officials (e.g., Freedom of Information Act requests or requests made under the “routine use” provisions of the Privacy Act) shall be processed by the responsible agency official in accordance with
agency procedures consistent with Office of Personnel Management regulations regarding disclosures of such records contained in parts 293 and 297 of this chapter.
(3) Privacy Act requests for amendment of records maintained in this system shall be processed by the responsible agency official in accordance with agency procedures consistent with Office of Personnel Management regulations regarding amendment of records contained in part 297 of this chapter.
(d) Agencies maintaining the EPF in an automated or microform system shall issue instructions that contain necessary procedures to ensure that the same requirements as in paragraph (c) of this section, relating to all manual records, are met.
[47 FR 3080, Jan. 22, 1982, as amended at 51 FR 8410, Mar. 11, 1986]
§ 293.403
Contents of employee performance files.
(a) A decision on what constitutes a performance-related document within the meaning of this subpart rests with the agency. Agency implementing instructions, for both incumbents of the Senior Executive Service and other positions, shall provide specific written guidance of the description of what constitutes the agency's official performance-related forms and documents.
(b) Agency implementing instructions describing such records shall indicate where and for how long they are retained and how and when they are to be destroyed. Such instructions shall also describe what records are considered to be performance-related (as specifically as is feasible) and shall include all performance-related records maintained as a system of records within the meaning of the Privacy Act. Such records would generally include:
(1) Any form or other document which records the performance appraisal, including appraisals leading to merit pay determinations.
(2) Any form or other document used by rating officials to recommend a personnel action affecting an employee (including a request for personnel action document, but only when the action is not effected) when the basis for the action (e.g., removal, reassignment, demotion, promotion, or merit pay or other performance award) is performance-related.
(3) Recommendations for training that are performance-related.
(4) Any form or other document furnished in support of recommended actions such as those listed in paragraph (b)(2) of this section and the agency's final decision on the matter (e.g., a recommendation for merit pay or an agency decision to grant only one-half the comparability pay adjustment).
(5) Any form or other document which the rating official is required by the agency to keep during an appraisal period (e.g., quality control records, production records, or similar records used to track employee performance during the appraisal period.)
(6) Any form or other document regarding Performance Review Board decisions, including supporting documentation and any transcript of hearings or testimony from witnesses.
(7) Any form or other document regarding decisions or recommendations of agency Executive Resources Boards related to performance appraisal or actions resulting from performance appraisals.
(8) Appraisals of potential (e.g., in connection with an agency's merit promotion procedures) if agency implementing instructions specifically require or permit retention of a copy.
(9) Individual development plans.
(10) Copies of licenses, certificates of proficiency, or similar documents required of the position.
(c) General information about the employee,
i.e.,
identification data, information concerning Federal and non-Federal employment experience, and information about any training programs the employee participated in may, if an agency deems it appropriate, be retained in this system.
[47 FR 3080, Jan. 22, 1982, as amended at 63 FR 43867, Aug. 17, 1998]
§ 293.404
Retention schedule.
(a)(1) Except as provided in § 293.405(a), performance ratings or documents supporting them are generally
not permanent records and shall, except for appointees to the SES and including incumbents of executive positions not covered by SES, be retained as prescribed below:
(i) Performance ratings of record, including the performance plans on which they are based, shall be retained for 4 years;
(ii) Supporting documents shall be retained for as long as the agency deems appropriate (up to 4 years);
(iii) Performance records superseded (e.g., through an administrative or judicial procedure) and performance-related records pertaining to a former employee (except as prescribed in § 293.405(a)) need not be retained for a minimum of 4 years. Rather, in the former case they are to be destroyed and in the latter case agencies shall determine the retention schedule; and
(iv) Except where prohibited by law, retention of automated records longer than the maximum prescribed here is permitted for purposes of statistical analysis so long as the data are not used in any action affecting the employee when the manual record has been or should have been destroyed.
(2) When an employee is reassigned within the employing agency, disposition of records in this system, including transfer with the employee who changes positions, shall be as agencies prescribe and consistent with § 293.405(a).
(3) Appraisals of unacceptable performance, where a notice of proposed demotion or removal is issued but not effected, and all documents related thereto, manual and automated, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 4303(d) must be destroyed after the employee completes one year of acceptable performance from the date of the written advance notice of the proposed removal or reduction in grade notice. Under conditions specified by an agency, and earlier destruction date is permitted and destruction must be no later than 30 days after the year is up.
(b) Performance records for Senior Executive Service appointees, including those serving under a Presidential appointment under 5 U.S.C. 3392(c), are to be retained as follows:
(1) Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 4314(b) (3) and (4), Senior Executive Service appointees shall have their performance-related records maintained for five consecutive years (from the date the appraisal is issued) beginning with the effective date of appointment, including individuals receiving appointments pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 3593(b).
(2) When an appointee of the Senior Executive Service moves to another position in the Service, either with the same or a different agency, all appropriate performance-related documents five years old or less shall be forwarded in the Employee Performance File along with the individual's OPF.
(3) When an employee in the Senior Executive Service accepts a Presidential appointment pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 3392(c), the employee's performance file shall be retained as long as the employee remains employed under that Presidential appointment. When the appointment ends, and the individual does not return to the Senior Executive Service, the employee's performance file shall be destroyed in accordance with agency procedures.
(c) Where any performance-related document is needed in connection with an ongoing administrative, negotiated, quasi-judicial, or judicial proceeding, and it continues to be retained in this system rather than another system, it may be retained for as long as necessary beyond the retention schedules identified in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.
(d) Screening and purging of folders/envelopes and rating official's work files for the purpose of compliance with these retention schedules shall be through any agency process insuring consistency with the requirements.
[47 FR 3080, Jan. 22, 1982, as amended at 51 FR 8411, Mar. 11, 1986; 56 FR 65416, Dec. 17, 1991]
§ 293.405
Disposition of records.
(a) When the OPF of a non-SES employee is sent to another servicing office in the employing agency, to another agency, or to the National Personnel Records Center, the “losing” servicing office shall include in the OPF all performance ratings of record that are 4 years old or less, including the performance plan on which the most recent rating was based, and the
summary rating prepared when the employee changes positions, as prescribed in part 430 of this chapter. Also, the “losing” office will purge from the OPF all performance ratings and performance plans that are more than 4 years old, and other performance-related records, according to agency policy established under § 293.404(a)(2) and in accordance with the Guide to Personnel Recordkeeping.
(b) Consistent with transfer instructions pertaining to SES positions contained in this part, employee performance files shall be forwarded to gaining agencies at the same time as the OPF (5 CFR 293.207).
(c) Consistent with retention schedules promulgated in § 293.404, destruction of performance-related records shall be in accordance with agency procedures (e.g., by shredding or burning).
(d) If a former employee returns to an agency, a new employee performance file will be created unless the prior file for this employee is still available. The original file may be reactivated provided that, consistent with the retention schedules and destruction requirements promulgated in this subpart, the contents are properly disposed of.
(e)(1) It is the responsibility of the agency Personnel Director to insure the maintenance of employee performance files in accordance with this subpart and subparts A and B of this part, part 297 of this title, and with Office of Personnel Management guidance.
(2) This responsibility may be delegated in writing to other agency officials as appropriate. Implementing guidelines for agency performance appraisal systems shall provide written instructions for compliance with Office rules and procedures as well as descriptions of the documents and where they are retained, and shall ensure that records are retained in accordance with the provisions of § 293.402.
[47 FR 3080, Jan. 22, 1982, as amended at 51 FR 8411, Mar. 11, 1986; 56 FR 65416, Dec. 17, 1991; 66 FR 66709, Dec. 27, 2001]
§ 293.406
Disclosure of records.
Disclosure as used here means the furnishing of the record to someone other than the individual to whom the record pertains, his/her designated representative, or to an agency official who needs the information in the performance of official duties. Disclosure of information from this file system shall be made only as permitted by the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a(b)) and, with regard to the routine use provisions of that section, only under a routine use published by the Office for the system of records covering these records. However, to the extent that this system contains the data identified as being available to the public in § 293.311, for most Federal employees and under the same restrictions listed in that section, that information shall also be made available to the public from this system.

# Subpart E—Employee Medical File System Records

# Source:
51 FR 33235, Sept. 19, 1986, unless otherwise noted.
§ 293.501
Applicability of regulations.
The applicability of this subpart is identical to that described in § 293.301.
§ 293.502
Definitions.
For the purpose of this Subpart—
Employee
is defined at 5 U.S.C. 2105 and excludes student volunteers and contractor employees.
Employee Assistance and Counseling Record
means the record created when an employee participates in an agency assistance/counseling program (e.g., drug or alcohol abuse or personal counseling programs under Pub. L. 91-616, 92-255, and 79-658, respectively).
Employee Exposure Record
(which is to be interpreted consistent with the term as it is defined at 29 CFR 1910.20(c)(8)) means a record containing any of the following kinds of information concerning employee exposure to toxic substances or harmful physical agents (as defined at 29 CFR 1910.20(c)(11)):
(a) Environmental (workplace) monitoring or measuring, including personal, area, grab, wipe, or other form of sampling, as well as related collection and analytical methodologies, calculations, and other background data relevant to interpretation of the results obtained;
(b) Biological monitoring results which directly assess the absorption of
a substance or agent by body systems (e.g., the level of a chemical in the blood, urine, breath, hair, fingernails, etc.) but not including results which assess the biological effect of a substance or agent;
(c) Material safety data sheets; or
(d) Any other record, in the absence of the above, which reveals the identity (e.g., chemical, common, or trade name) of a toxic substance of harmful physical agent.
Employee Medical File System (EMFS)
means the agency's complete system (automated, microformed, and paper records) for employee occupational medical records.
Employee Medical Folder (EMF)
means a separate file folder (normally SF 66-D) established to contain all of the occupational medical records (both long-tern and short-term records) designated for retention, which will be maintained by the employing agency during the employee's Federal service.
Epidemiological Record
means a record maintained by an agency or subelement thereof as a result of an official medical research study conducted under the authority of the agency.
Implementing instructions
means any form of internal agency issuance that provides the guidance required in § 293.503 and any other guidance the agency deems appropriate.
Occupational Medical Record
means an occupation-related, chronological, cumulative record, regardless of the form or process by which it is maintained (e.g., paper document, microfiche, microfilm, or automatic data processing media), of information about health status developed on an employee, including personal and occupational health histories and the opinions and written evaluations generated in the course of diagnosis and/or employment-related treatment/examination by medical health care professionals and technicians. This definition includes the definition of medical records at 29 CFR 1910.20(c)(6); when the term “Occupational Medical Record” is used in these regulations, it includes “Employee Exposure Records” (as that term is defined in this section) and occupational illness, accident, and injury records.
Non-occupational/Patient Record
means a record of treatment or examination, created and maintained by a health care facility, when the person is admitted to or voluntarily seeks treatment at the health care facility for non-job-related reasons. Records maintained by an agency dispensary are patient records for the purposes of these regulations except when such records result as a condition of employment or relate to an on-the-job occurrence. In these cases, the records are “Occupational Medical Records” as defined herein.
Non-personal Record
means any agency aggregate or statistical record or report resulting from studies covering employees or resulting from studies or the work-site environment.
§ 293.503
Implementing instructions.
Agencies must issue written internal instructions describing how their EMFS is to be implemented. These instructions must—
(a) Describe overall operation of the system within the agency including the designation of the agency official who will be responsible for overall system management. When the agency has a medical officer, that individual must be named the system manager. The system manager may then designate others within the agency to handle the day-to-day management of the records, e.g., the custodian of the records at the site where they are maintained;
(b) Be prepared with joint participation by agency medical, health, and safety, and personnel officers;
(c) Describe where and under whose custody employee occupational medical records will be physically maintained;
(d) Designate which agency office(s) will be responsible for deciding when and what occupational medical records are to be disclosed either to other agency officials or outside the agency;
(e) Ensure proper records retention and security, and preserve confidentiality of doctor/patient relationships;
(f) Provide that when the agency is requesting an EMF from the National Personnel Records Center (NPRC), the request form will show the name, title, and address of that agency's system
manager or designee, who is the only official authorized to receive the EMF;
(g) Be consistent with Office regulations relating to personnel actions when medical evidence is a factor (5 CFR parts 339, 432, 630, 752, and 831);
(h) Provide guidance on how an accounting of any record disclosure, as required by the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a(c)), will be done in a way that ensures that the accounting will be available for the life of the EMF;
(i) When long-term occupational medical records exist, provide for the creation of an EMF for an employee transferring to another agency or leaving Government service, and whether an EMF is to be established at the time an employee is being reassigned within the agency;
(j) Ensure a right of access (consistent with any special Privacy Act handling procedures invoked) to the records, in whatever format they are maintained, by the employee or a designated representative;
(k) Ensure that a knowledgeable official determines that all appropriate long-term occupational medical records are in an EMF prior to its transfer to another agency, to the NPRC, or to another office within the same employing agency;
(l) Ensure that all long-term occupational medical records an agency receives in an EMF are maintained, whether in that same EMF or by some other agency procedure, and forwarded to a subsequent employing agency or to NPRC;
(m) Ensure that, if occupational medical records are to be physically located in the same office as the Official Personnel Folder (OPF), the records are maintained physically apart from each other;
(n) Sets forth a policy that distinguishes, particularly for purposes of records disclosure, records in the nature of physician treatment records (which are generally not appropriate for disclosure to non-medical officials) from other medical reports properly available to officials making management decisions concerning the employee;
(o) Provide guidance that distinguishes records properly subject to this part from those (e.g., Postal Service or Foreign Service employee medical records) subject to different rules, particularly in Privacy Act and Freedom of Information Act matters;
(p) Ensure that guidance regarding the processing of Privacy Act matters is consistent with Office regulations implementing the Privacy Act at 5 CFR parts 293 and 297; and
(q) Ensure that no security classification is assigned to an EMF by including therein any occupational medical record that has such a classification. In this regard, the agency creating the classified medical record is required to retain it separately from the EMF while placing a notice in the EMF of its existence and describing where requests for this record are to be submitted.
§ 293.504
Composition of, and access to, the Employee Medical File System.
(a) All employee occupational medical records (which exclude employee assistance/counseling, patient, non-personal, and epidemiological records) whether they are maintained in an automated, microform, or paper mode, and wherever located in the agency, are part of the EMFS. The records maintained in the EMFS are part of a Governmentwide Privacy Act system of records established by the Office. Agencies have the responsibility to ensure that such documents are maintained in accordance with the Office's Privacy Act regulations in part 297 of this chapter, with the agency's instructions implementing those regulations, and with the retention schedule for employee medical records stipulated in § 293.511. While non-occupational/patient records pertaining to an employee are not required to be included as a record within the EMFS, under certain conditions to be discussed in subsequent OPM guidance, copies of such records are occupationally-related and, in those cases, may be included in the system.
(b) Agencies must provide employees access to their own EMFS records consistent with Office regulations contained in § 297.204(c) of this chapter. When unexcepted access can be provided directly to the employee, such
unexcepted access must also be provided to any representative specifically designated in writing by the employee to receive the record. Disclosure of an employee's occupational medical records to agency officials (both medical and non-medical) will be granted only when the specific information sought is needed for the performance of official duties.
(c) Other agencies for employee occupational medical records made to the custodian of the records must be processed in accordance with the disclosure provisions of the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a(b)) and the Office's regulations at part 297 of this chapter.
(d) Processing of a Privacy Act request for amendment of any EMFS record must be consistent with the Office's regulations contained in part 297 of this chapter regarding amendment of records.
[51 FR 33235, Sept. 19, 1986, as amended at 66 FR 66709, Dec. 27, 2001]
§ 293.505
Establishment and protection of Employee Medical Folder.
(a) As required by these rules, agencies must establish an EMF when the employee leaves the employing agency and occupational medical records for that employee exist; agencies may also establish an EMF (if none presently exists) for active employees if the agency chooses. An agency must request the transfer of an existing EMF (and maintain that EMF as received) at the same time it requests the transfer of an employee's OPF using the procedures contained in § 293.306.
(b) Neither the original occupational medical record nor duplicates are to be retained in the OPF. Prior to the establishment of an EMF for a separating employee, when such records are created, they must be maintained physically apart from the OPF, although they may be kept in the same office.
(c) Records in an EMF, whether or not located in an office other than where the OPF is maintained, must be properly safeguarded using procedures ensuring equal or greater levels of protection as those in § 293.106. Disclosures must be made only to those authorized to receive them, as described in § 293.504(b), and employees must be able to ascertain from agency implementing instructions the location of all of their medical records. An EMF must be under the control of a specifically designated medical, health, safety, or personnel officer as prescribed in the agency's implementing internal procedures.
§ 293.506
Ownership of the Employee Medical Folder.
The EMF of each employee in a position subject to civil service rules and regulations is part of the records of the Office. When the EMF also contains occupational medical records created during employment in a position not subject to the civil service (e.g., with the Postal Service), the EMF is then part of the records of both the Office and the employing agency.
§ 293.507
Maintenance and content of the Employee Medical Folder.
The agency head must maintain all appropriate employee occupational medical records in the EMFS. When an EMF is established for an employee, as required in § 293.504, the agency's EMFS must be searched to obtain all records designated for retention in the EMF.
§ 293.508
Type of folder to be used.
Each agency must use a folder that (a) has been specifically identified as the EMF and issued through Federal Supply Service contracts (Standard Form 66 D); (b) has been authorized as an exception to this form by the Office for use by a specific agency; or (c) in the case of an EMF containing records under joint control of the Office and another agency, an exception to the use of this form that has been jointly authorized.
§ 293.509
Use of existing Employee Medical Folders upon transfer or reemployment.
The requirements of § 293.306, regarding the use of existing OPFs, apply to the use of existing EMFs upon the employee's transfer to or reemployment in a new employing agency.
§ 293.510
Disposition of Employee Medical Folders.
(a) When an employee transfers to another Federal agency, the EMF must be transferred to the gaining agency at
the same time as the employee's OPF. The EMF is to be addressed only to the gaining agency's designated manager (medical, health, safety, or personnel officer, or other designee) of the EMFS.
(b) When an employee is separated from the Federal service, the EMF must be forwarded to the NPRC with the OPF, using the instructions in § 293.307 of this part.
(c) When a former Federal employee is re-employed by an agency, and that agency believes that an EMF exists, either at the last employing agency or at the NPRC, the agency will request the EMF, but no sooner than 30 days after the date of the new appointment. No EMFs will be routinely retrieved during the initial review process (as is done with the OPF) except when authority exists for the agency to require a medical evaluation prior to reaching a decision on employability. EMFs are to be transferred by the NPRC only to the agency-designated manager (medical, health, safety, or personnel, or other designee) shown on the request form.
§ 293.511
Retention schedule.
(a) Temporary EMFS records must not be placed in a newly-created EMF for a separating employee and must be removed from an already existing EMF before its transfer to another agency or to the NPRC. Such records must be disposed of in accordance with General Records Schedule (GRS) 1, item 21, issued by the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA).
(b) Occupational Medical Records considered to be long-term records must be maintained for the duration of employment, plus 30 years or for as long as the OPF is maintained, whichever is longer. Therefore, upon separation, the records must be provided to the employee's new agency, or they must be transferred to the NPRC, which will dispose of them in accordance with GRS 1, item 21, issued by NARA.

§ 294.101
Purpose.
This subpart contains the regulations of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) implementing the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552. Except as provided by § 294.105, OPM will use the provisions of this subpart to process all requests for records.
§ 294.102
General definitions.
All of the terms defined in the Freedom of Information Act, and the definitions included in the “Uniform Freedom of Information Act Fee Schedule and Guidelines” issued by the Office of Management and Budget apply, regardless of whether they are defined in this subpart.
Direct costs
means the expenditures that an agency actually incurs in searching for, duplicating, and reviewing documents to respond to an FOIA request. Overhead expenses (such as the cost of space, and heating or lighting the facility in which the records are stored), are not included in direct costs.
Disclose or disclosure
means making records available, on request, for examination and copying, or furnishing a copy of records.
Duplication
means the process of making a copy of a document necessary to respond to an FOIA request. Among the forms that such copies can take are paper, microform, audiovisual materials, or machine readable documentation (e.g., magnetic tape or disk).
Records, information, document,
and
material
have the same meaning as the term
agency records
in section 552 of title 5, United States Code.
Review
means the process of initially examining documents located in response to a request to determine whether any portion of any document located may be withheld. It also includes processing documents for disclosure; e.g., doing all that is necessary to excise them and otherwise prepare them for release. Review does not include time spent resolving general legal and policy issues regarding the application of exemptions.
Search
means the time spent looking for material that is responsive to a request, including page-by-page or line-by-line identification of material within documents.
[54 FR 25094, June 13, 1989, as amended at 58 FR 32043, June 8, 1993]
§ 294.103
Definitions of categories and assignment of requests and requesters to categories.
OPM will apply the definitions and procedures contained in this section to assign requesters to categories. The four categories established by 5 U.S.C. 552(a) are requests for commercial use, requests for non-commercial use made by educational or non-commercial scientific institutions, requests for non-commercial use made by representatives of the news media, and all others.
(a)
Request for commercial use.
A “commercial use request” is from or on behalf of one who seeks information for a use or purpose that furthers the commercial, trade, or profit interests of the requester or the person or institution on whose behalf the request is made. In determining whether a request properly belongs in this category, OPM will look first to the intended use of the documents being requested.
(b)
Request for non-commercial use made by an educational or non-commercial scientific institution.
OPM will include requesters in one of the two categories described in paragraphs (b) (1) and (2) of this section when the request is being made as authorized by, and under the auspices of, a qualifying institution; and the records are sought, not for a commercial use, but in furtherance of scholarly or scientific research.
(1)
Educational institution
refers to any public or private, preschool, elementary, or secondary school, institution of undergraduate or graduate higher education, or institution of professional or vocational education, which operates a program or programs of scholarly or scientific research.
(2) A
non-commercial scientific institution
refers to an institution that is not operated on a
commercial
basis as that term is referenced in paragraph (a) of this section, and which is operated solely to conduct scientific or scholarly research, the results of which are not intended to promote any particular product or industry.
(c)
Request from a representative of the news media.
“Representative of the news media” refers to any person actively gathering news for an entity that is organized and operated to publish, broadcast, or otherwise disseminate news to the public. The term “news” means information that is about current events or that would be
of current interest to the public. Examples of news media entities include television or radio stations broadcasting to the public at large, and publishers of periodicals who make their products available for purchase or subscription by the general public. Free-lance journalists may be regarded as representatives of the news media if they demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication, or some other form of dissemination, through a particular organization even though they are not actually employed by it. OPM will assign news media officials to this category only when a request is not for commercial use. If a person meets the other qualifications for inclusion, OPM will not apply the term “commercial use” to his or her request for records in support of a news dissemination function.
(d)
Requests from others.
The category “all others,” consists of any requesters not covered by paragraphs (a), (b), or (c) of this section. However, as provided by § 294.105, OPM will use its Privacy Act regulations, rather than this subpart, when individuals ask for records about themselves that may be filed in OPM systems of records.
§ 294.104
Clarifying a requester's category.
(a)
Seeking clarification of a requester's category.
OPM may seek additional clarification before assigning a person to a specific category if—
(1) There is reasonable cause to doubt the requester's intended use of records; or
(2) The intended use is not clear from the request itself; or
(3) There is any other reasonable doubt about qualifications that may affect the fees applicable or the services rendered under § 294.109.
(b)
Prompt notification to requester.
When OPM seeks clarification as provided by paragraph (a) of this section, it will provide prompt notification either by telephone or in writing of the information or materials needed.
(c)
Effect of seeking clarification on time limits for responding.
When applying the time limits in section 552 of title 5, United States Code, OPM will not officially consider any request for records as being received until the official who is assigned responsibility for making a decision on releasing the records has received any additional clarification sought under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section; and has determined that the clarifying information is sufficient to correctly place the requester in one of the categories prescribed in this section. If the requested clarifying information is not received within a reasonable time, OPM will, based on the information available, determine a final category for the request and calculate applicable fees.
[54 FR 25094, June 13, 1989, as amended at 58 FR 32043, June 8, 1993]
§ 294.105
Access to the requester's own records.
When the subject of a record, or a duly authorized representative of the subject, requests his or her own records from a Privacy Act system of records, as defined by 5 U.S.C. 552a (a)(5), and the record is maintained so that it is retrieved by the subject's name or other personal identifier, OPM will process the request under the Privacy Act procedures in part 297 of this chapter.
§ 294.106
Handbook of Publications, Periodicals, and OPM Issuances.
(a)(1) Annually, OPM publishes OPM-AG-PSD-01, “Handbook of Publications, Periodicals, and Issuances,” and accompanying addendum. This handbook and addendum lists material published and offered for sale are available for public inspection or copying. Unless the material is published and offered for sale, OPM makes available for public inspection and copying:
(i) Final opinions made by OPM in the adjudication of cases;
(ii) OPM policy statements and interpretations adopted by OPM but not published in the
Federal Register
; and
(iii) OPM administrative staff manuals and instructions that affect a member of the public.
(2) To the extent required to prevent a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, OPM may delete identifying details when it makes available or publishes an opinion, statement of policy, interpretation, or staff manual or instruction.
(b) A copy of this handbook and addendum is available at no cost from the—Publishing Management Branch, Office of Personnel Management, room B464, 1900 E Street, NW., Washington, DC 20415-0001.
(c) OPM indexes material in this handbook and addendum format for the convenience of the public. Indexing does not constitute a determination that all of the material listed is within the category that is required to be indexed by 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(2). Most of OPM's publications may be found in OPM's Library in room 5H27 at the address listed in paragraph (b) of this section.
(d) As provided by 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(2), OPM has determined that it is unnecessary and impractical to publish the “Handbook of Publications, Periodicals, and Issuances” and addendum more frequently than annually because of the small number of revisions that occur.

(e)
When an organization does not have records in its custody.
When an OPM organization receives a Freedom of Information Act request for OPM records that it does not have in its possession, it will normally either—
(1) Retrieve the records from the organization that has possession of them; or
(2) Promptly forward the request to the appropriate organization. If a person has asked to be kept apprised of anything that will delay the official receipt of a request, OPM will provide notice of this forwarding action. Otherwise, OPM may, at its option, provide such notice.
(f)
Applying the time limits.
When applying the time limits in section 552 of title 5, United States Code, OPM will
not officially consider any request to be received until it arrives in the OPM organization that has responsibility for the records sought.
(g)
Records from other Government agencies.
When a person seeks records that originated in another Government agency, OPM may refer the request to the other agency for response. Ordinarily, OPM will provide notice of this type of referral.
(h)
Creating records.
If a person seeks information from OPM in a format that does not currently exist, OPM will not ordinarily compile the information for the purpose of creating a record to respond to the request. OPM will advise the individual that it does not have records in the format sought. If other existing records would reasonably respond to the request or portions of it, OPM may provide these. If fees as provided in § 294.109 apply to any alternative records, OPM will advise the requester before providing the records.
[54 FR 25094, June 13, 1989, as amended at 57 FR 32150, July 21, 1992; 58 FR 32044, June 8, 1993]
§ 294.108
Procedures for obtaining records.
(a)
Mailing or delivering a request.
Any person may ask for records under section 552 of title 5, United States Code, by directing a letter to one of the organizations listed in § 294.107, or by delivering a request in person at the addresses listed in that section during business hours on a regular business day.
(b)
Proper marking.
Each request for records should have a clear and prominent notation on the first page, such as “Freedom of Information Act Request.” In addition, if sent by mail or otherwise submitted in an envelope or other cover, mark the outside clearly and prominently with “FOIA Request” or “Freedom of Information Act Request.”
(c)
Contents of request letter.
A request must describe the records sought in sufficient detail to enable OPM personnel to locate the records with a reasonable amount of effort.
(1) OPM will regard a request for a specific category of records as fulfilling the requirements of this paragraph, if it enables responsive records to be identified by a technique or process that is not unreasonably burdensome or disruptive to OPM operations.
(2) Whenever possible, a request should include specific information about each record sought, such as the date, number, title or name, author, recipient, and subject matter of the record.
(3) If an OPM organization determines that a request does not reasonably describe the records sought, it will either provide notice of any additional information needed or otherwise state why the request is insufficient. OPM will also offer the record seeker an opportunity to confer, with the objective of reformulating the request so that it meets the requirements of this section.
(d)
Medical records.
OPM or another Government agency may disclose the medical records of an applicant, employee, or annuitant to the subject of the record, or to a representative designated in writing. However, medical records may contain information about an individual's mental or physical condition that a prudent physician would hesitate to give to the individual. Under such circumstances, OPM may disclose the records, including the exact nature and probable outcome of the condition, only to a licensed physician designated in writing for that purpose by the individual or his or her designated representative.
(e)
Publications.
If the subject matter of a request includes material published and offered for sale (e.g., by the Superintendent of Documents, Government Printing Office), OPM will explain where a person may review and/or purchase the publications.
(f)
Responses within 10 working days.
Except in unusual circumstances (as defined in 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(B)), OPM will determine whether to disclose or deny records within 10 working days after receipt of the request (excluding weekends and holidays) and will provide notice immediately of its determination and the reasons therefor, and of the right to appeal any adverse determination.
[54 FR 25094, June 13, 1989, as amended at 58 FR 32044, June 8, 1993]
§ 294.109
Fees.
(a)
Applicability of fees.
(1) OPM will furnish, without charge, reasonable quantities of material that it has available for free distribution to the public.
(2) OPM may furnish other materials, subject to payment of fees intended to recoup the full allowable direct costs of providing services. Fees for these materials may be waived if the request meets the requirements specified in paragraph (f) of this section.
(3) If a request does not include an acceptable agreement to pay fees and does not otherwise convey a willingness to pay fees, OPM will promptly provide notification of the estimated fees. This notice will offer an opportunity to confer with OPM staff to reformulate the request to meet the requester's needs at a lower cost. Upon agreement to pay the required fees, OPM will further process the request.
(4) As described in § 294.107, OPM ordinarily responds to FOIA requests in a decentralized manner. Because of this, OPM may at times refer a single request to two or more OPM entities to make separate direct responses. In such cases, each responding entity may assess fees as provided by this section, but only for direct costs associated with any response it has prepared.
(5) If fees for document search are authorized as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, OPM may assess charges for employee time spent searching for documents and other direct costs of a search, even if a search fails to locate records or if records located are determined to be exempt from disclosure. Searches should be conducted in the most efficient and least expensive manner so as to minimize the cost for both the agency and the requester, e.g., personnel should not engage in line-by-line search when photocopying an entire document would be a less expensive and quicker way to comply with a request.
(6) Services requested and performed but not required under the FOIA, such as formal certification of records as true copies, will be subject to charges under the Federal User Charge Statute (31 U.S.C. 483a) or other applicable statutes.
(b)
Rates used to compute fees.
The following rates form the basis for assessing reasonable, standard charges for document search, duplication, and review as required by 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4). The listing of rates below should be used in conjunction with the fee components listed in paragraph (c) of this section:
Service
Rate
Employee time
Salary rate plus 16% to cover benefits.
Photocopies (up to 8
1/2
″ × 14″)
$.013 per page.
Printed materials, per 25 pages or fraction thereof
$.025.
Computer time
Actual direct cost.
Supplies and other materials
Actual direct cost.
Other costs not identified above
Actual direct cost.
(c)
Assessing fees based on requester's category.
Rates are assessed differently for the different categories of requesters as defined in § 294.103. Requests have three cost components for the purpose of assessing fees: the cost of document search, the cost of duplication, and the cost of review. OPM will apply the rates in paragraph (b) of this section to the cost components that apply to the requester's category as follows:
Requester's category
Search
Review
Duplication
Commercial
Actual direct costs

First 100 pages of paper copies or reasonable equivalent, such as a microfiche containing the equivalent of 100 pages, are copied free.
2
First 2 hours of manual search time are free. If requested records are maintained in a computerized data base, OPM will use the following formula, suggested by OMB, to provide the equivalent of 2 hours manual search time free before charging for computer search time: The operator's hourly salary plus 16% will be added to the hourly cost of operating the central processing unit that contains the record information.
(d)
Payment of fees.
Fees are payable by check or money order to the Office of Personnel Management.
(1) If the total charge for fulfilling the request will be less than $25, no fee will be assessed (except as provided in paragraph (d)(3) of this section).
(2) If a request may reasonably result in a fee assessment of more than $25, OPM will not release the records unless the requester agrees in advance to pay the anticipated charges.
(3) OPM may aggregate requests and charge fees accordingly, when there is a reasonable belief that a requester, or a group of requesters acting in concert, is attempting to break down a request into a series of requests to evade the assessment of fees.
(i) If multiple requests of this type occur within a 30-day period, OPM may provide notice that it is aggregating the requests and that it will apply the fee provisions of this section, including any required agreement to pay fees and any advance payment.
(ii) Before aggregating requests of this type made over a period longer than 30 days, OPM will assure that it has a solid basis on which to conclude that the requesters are acting in concert and are acting specifically to avoid payment of fees.
(iii) OPM will not aggregate multiple requests on unrelated subjects from one person.
(e)
Payment of fees in advance.
If OPM estimates or determines that fees are likely to exceed $250, OPM may require the payment of applicable fees in advance.
(1) If an OPM official, who is authorized to make a decision on a particular request, determines that the requester has a history of prompt payment of FOIA fees, OPM will provide notice of the likely cost and obtain satisfactory assurance of full payment.
(2) When a person, or an organization that a person represents, has previously failed to pay assessed fees in a timely manner (
i.e.,
payment was not made within 30 days of the billing date), OPM will require full payment of all fees in advance.
(3) If a person, or an organization that a person represents, has not paid fees previously assessed, OPM will not begin to process any new request for records until the requester has paid the full amount owed plus any applicable interest, and made a full advance payment for the new request.
(f)
Waiver or reduction of fees.
OPM will furnish documents without any charge, or at a reduced charge, if disclosure of the information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the Government, and release of the material is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.
(1) In determining whether disclosure is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the Government, OPM shall consider the following factors:
(i) The subject of the request: Whether the subject of the requested records concerns “the operations or activities of the Government”;
(ii) The information value of the information to be disclosed: Whether the disclosure is “likely to contribute” to an understanding of Government operations or activities;
(iii) The contribution to an understanding of the subject by the general public likely to result from disclosure: Whether disclosure of the requested information will contribute to “public understanding”; and
(iv) The significance of the contribution to public understanding: Whether the disclosure is likely to contribute “significantly” to public understanding of Government operations or activities.
(2) In determining whether disclosure of the information is or is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester, OPM shall consider the following factors:
(i)
The existence and magnitude of a commercial interest.
Whether the requester has a commercial interest that would be furthered by the requested disclosure; and, if so—
(ii)
The primary interest in disclosure.
Whether the magnitude of the identified commercial interest of the requester is sufficiently large, in comparison with the public interest in disclosure, that disclosure is “primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.”
(3) In all cases the burden of proof shall be on the requester to present evidence or information in support of a request for a waiver or reduction of fees.
(g)
Denial of waiver request.
(1) An OPM official may deny a request for a full or partial waiver of fees without further consideration if the request does not include:
(i) A clear statement of the requester's interest in the requested information;
(ii) A clear statement of the use proposed for the information and whether the requester will derive income or other benefit from such use;
(iii) A clear statement of how the public will benefit from OPM's release of the requested information; and
(iv) If specialized use of the documents is contemplated, a clear statement of the requester's qualifications that are relevant to the specialized use.
(2) A requester may appeal the denial of a waiver request as provided by § 294.110 of this part.
(h)
Fees not paid; penalties; debt collection.
(1) If a request, which requires the advance payment of fees under the criteria specified in this section, is not accompanied by the required payment, OPM will promptly notify the requester that the required fee must be paid within 30 days, and that OPM will not further process the request until it receives payment.
(2) OPM may begin assessing interest charges on an unpaid bill starting on the 31st day following the date on which the bill was sent. Interest will be charged at the rate prescribed in 31 U.S.C. 3717, and will accrue from the date of the billing.
(3) To encourage the repayment of debts incurred under this subpart, OPM may use the procedures authorized by Public Law 97-365, the Debt Collection Act of 1982. This may include disclosure to consumer reporting agencies and the use of collection agencies.
[58 FR 32044, June 8, 1993]
§ 294.110
Appeals.
(a) When an OPM official denies records or a waiver of fees under the Freedom of Information Act, the requester may appeal to the—
Office of the General Counsel, Office of Personnel Management, Washington, DC 20415
(b) A person may appeal denial of a Freedom of Information Act request for information maintained by OPM's Office of the General Counsel to the—
Deputy Director, Office of Personnel Management Washington, DC 20415
(c) If an official of another agency denies a Freedom of Information Act request for records in one of OPM's Government-wide systems of records, the requester should consult that agency's regulations for any appeal rights that may apply. An agency may, at its discretion, direct these appeals to OPM's Office of the General Counsel.
(d) An appeal should include a copy of the initial request, a copy of the letter denying the request, and a statement explaining why the appellant believes the denying official erred.
(e) The appeals provided for in this section constitute the final levels of administrative review that are available. If a denial of information or a denial of a fee waiver is affirmed, the requester may seek judicial review in the district court of the United States in the district in which he or she resides, or has his or her principal place of business, or in which the agency records are situated, or in the District of Columbia.
§ 294.111
Custody of records; subpoenas.
(a) The Chief, Plans and Policies Division, Administration Group, OPM, has official custody of OPM records. A subpoena or other judicial order for an official record from OPM should be served on the—
Chief, Plans and Policies Division, Office of Personnel Management, 1900 E Street NW., Washington, DC 20415
(b) See 5 CFR part 297, subpart D—Disclosure of Records, of this title, for the steps other officials should take on receipt of a subpoena or other judicial order for an Office record.
[54 FR 25094, June 13, 1989, as amended at 57 FR 32150, July 21, 1992]
§ 294.112
Confidential commercial information.
(a) In general, OPM will not disclose confidential commercial information in response to a Freedom of Information Act request except in accordance with this section.
(b) The following definitions from Executive Order 12600, apply to this section:
(1)
Confidential commercial information
means records provided to the Government by a submitter that arguably contain material exempt from release under Exemption 4 of the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4), because disclosure could reasonably be expected to cause substantial competitive harm.
(2)
Submitter
means any person or entity who provides confidential commercial information, directly or indirectly, to OPM. The term includes, but is not limited to, corporations, state governments, and foreign governments.
(c) Submitters of information shall designate by appropriate markings, either at the time of submission or at a reasonable time thereafter, any portions of their submissions that they consider to be confidential commercial information. Such designations shall expire 10 years after the date of submission unless the submitter requests, and provides reasonable justification for, a designation period of greater duration.
(d) OPM shall, to the extent permitted by law, provide prompt written notice to an information submitter of Freedom of Information requests or administrative appeals if:
(1) The submitter has made a good faith designation that the requested material is confidential commercial information, or
(2) OPM has reason to believe that the requested material may be confidential commercial information.
(e) The written notice required in paragraph (d) of this section shall either describe the confidential commercial material requested or include as an attachment, copies or pertinent portions of the records.
(f) Whenever OPM provides the notification and opportunity to object required by paragraphs (d) and (h) of this section, it will advise the requester that notice and an opportunity to object are being provided to the submitter.
(g) The notice requirements of paragraph (d) of this section shall not apply if:
(1) OPM determines that the information should not be disclosed;
(2) The information has been lawfully published or officially made available to the public;
(3) Disclosure of the information is required by law (other than 5 U.S.C. 552);
(4) The information was submitted on or after August 20, 1992, and has not been designated by the submitter as exempt from disclosure in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section, unless OPM has substantial reason to believe that disclosure of the information would result in competitive harm; or
(5) The designation made by the submitter in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section appears obviously frivolous; except that, in such a case, OPM shall, within a reasonable number of days prior to a specified disclosure date, notify the submitter in writing of any final administrative decision to disclose the information.
(h) The notice described in paragraph (d) of this section shall give a submitter a reasonable period from the date of the notice to provide OPM with a detailed written statement of any objection to disclosure. The statement shall specify all grounds for withholding any of the material under any exemption of the Freedom of Information Act. When Exemption 4 of the FOIA is cited as the grounds for withholding, the specification shall demonstrate the basis for any contention that the material is a trade secret or commercial or financial information that is privileged or confidential. It must also include a specification of any claim of competitive harm, including the degree of such harm, that would result from disclosure. Information provided in response to this paragraph may itself be subject to disclosure under the FOIA. Information provided in response to this paragraph shall also be subject to the designation requirements of paragraph (c) of this section. Failure to object in a timely
manner shall be considered a statement of no objection by OPM, unless OPM extends the time for objection upon timely request from the submitter and for good cause shown. The provisions of this paragraph concerning opportunity to object shall not apply to notices of administrative appeals, when the submitter has been previously provided an opportunity to object at the time the request was initially considered.
(i) OPM shall consider carefully a submitter's objections and specific grounds for nondisclosure, when received within the period of time described in paragraph (h) of this section, prior to determining whether to disclose the information. Whenever OPM decides to disclose the information over the objection of a submitter, OPM shall forward to the submitter a written notice, which shall include:
(1) A statement of the reasons why the submitter's disclosure objections were not sustained;
(2) A description of the information to be disclosed; and
(3) A specified disclosure date.
(j) OPM will notify both the submitter and the requester of its intent to disclose material a reasonable number of days prior to the specified disclosure date.
(k) Whenever a requester brings suit seeking to compel disclosure of confidential commercial information, OPM shall promptly notify the submitter.

§ 294.201
Public information policy.
(a) In addition to the basic policies of the Office relative to the disclosure of information when requested by a member of the public, the Office has an independent public information policy for bringing to the attention of the public through news releases, publications of the Office, or other methods, information concerning the functions of the Office as a Federal agency, and the programs administered by the Office.
(b) The Assistant Director for Public Affairs carries out the public information policy of the Office. In addition, each employee of the Office shall cooperate in carrying out this policy.

§ 295.101

§ 295.202
Factors OPM will consider.
The General Counsel, in his or her sole discretion, may grant an employee permission to testify on matters relating to official information, or produce official records and information, in response to an appropriate demand or request. Among the relevant factors that the General Counsel may consider in making this decision are whether:

(e) Allowing such testimony or production of records would be in the best interest of OPM or the United States;
(f) The records or testimony can be obtained from other sources;
(g) The demand or request is unduly burdensome or otherwise inappropriate under the applicable rules of discovery or the rules of procedure governing the case or matter in which the demand or request arose;

(i) Disclosure would reveal confidential, sensitive, or privileged information, trade secrets or similar, confidential commercial or financial information, otherwise protected information,
or would otherwise be inappropriate for release;

(a) Your request must be in writing and must be submitted to the General Counsel.

(1) The caption of the legal proceeding, docket number, and name and address of the court or other authority involved.
(2) A copy of the complaint or equivalent document setting forth the assertions in the case and any other pleading or document necessary to show relevance;

(4) A statement as to how the need for the information outweighs the need to maintain any confidentiality of the information and outweighs the burden on OPM to produce the records or provide testimony;
(5) A statement indicating that the information sought is not available from another source, from other persons or entities, or from the testimony of someone other than an OPM employee, such as a retained expert;
(6) If testimony is requested, the intended use of the testimony, a general summary of the desired testimony, and a showing that no document could be provided and used in lieu of testimony;

(c) The Office of Personnel Management reserves the right to require additional information to complete your request where appropriate.
(d) Your request should be submitted at least 45 days before the date that records or testimony is required. Requests submitted in less than 45 days before records or testimony is required must be accompanied by a written explanation stating the reasons for the late request and the reasons for expedited processing.
(e) Failure to cooperate in good faith to enable the General Counsel to make an informed decision may serve as the basis for a determination not to comply with your request.
§ 295.204
Service of subpoenas or requests.
Subpoenas or requests for official records or information or testimony must be served on the General Counsel, U.S. Office of Personnel Management, 1900 E Street, NW., Washington, DC 20415.
§ 295.205
Processing demands or requests.
(a) After service of a demand or request to testify, the General Counsel will review the demand or request and, in accordance with the provisions of this subpart, determine whether, or under what conditions, to authorize the employee to testify on matters relating to official information and/or produce official records and information.

(c) The General Counsel may grant a waiver of any procedure described by this subpart where a waiver is considered necessary to promote a significant interest of OPM or the United States or for other good cause.
§ 295.206
Final determination.
The General Counsel makes the final determination on demands and requests to employees for production of official records and information or testimony. All final determinations are within the sole discretion of the General Counsel. The General Counsel will notify the requester and the court or other authority of the final determination, the reasons for the grant or denial of the demand or request, and any conditions that the General Counsel may impose on the release of records or information, or on the testimony of an OPM employee.
§ 295.207
Restrictions that apply to testimony.
(a) The General Counsel may impose conditions or restrictions on the testimony of OPM employees including, for example, limiting the areas of testimony or requiring the requester and other parties to the legal proceeding to agree that the transcript of the testimony will be kept under seal or will only be used or made available in the particular legal proceeding for which testimony was requested. The General Counsel may also require a copy of the transcript of testimony at the requester's expense.
(b) OPM may offer the employee's written declaration in lieu of testimony.
(c) If authorized to testify pursuant to this part, an employee may testify as to facts within his or her personal knowledge, but, unless specifically authorized to do so by the General Counsel, the employee shall not:

(2) Testify as to facts when the General Counsel determines such testimony would not be in the best interest of OPM or the United States; or
(3) For a current OPM employee, testify as an expert or opinion witness with regard to any matter arising out of the employee's official duties or the functions of OPM unless testimony is being given on behalf of the United States.
§ 295.208
Restrictions that apply to released records.
(a) The General Counsel may impose conditions or restrictions on the release of official records and information, including the requirement that parties to the proceeding obtain a protective order or execute a confidentiality agreement to limit access and any further disclosure. The terms of the protective order or of a confidentiality agreement must be acceptable to the General Counsel. In cases where protective orders or confidentiality agreements have already been executed, OPM may condition the release of official records and information on an amendment to the existing protective order or confidentiality agreement.
(b) If the General Counsel so determines, original OPM records may be presented for examination in response to a demand or request, but they are not to be presented as evidence or otherwise used in a manner by which they could lose their identify as official OPM records, and they are not to be marked or altered. In lieu of the original records, certified copies will be presented for evidentiary purposes (see 28 U.S.C. 1733).
§ 295.209
Procedure when a decision is not made prior to the time a response is required.
If a response to a demand or request is required before the General Counsel can make the determination referred to in Sec.295.206, the General Counsel, when necessary, will provide the court or other competent authority with a copy of this part, inform the court or other competent authority that the demand or request is being reviewed, and seek a stay of the demand or request pending a final determination.
§ 295.210
Procedure in the event of an adverse ruling.
If the court or other competent authority fails to stay the demand, the employee upon whom the demand or request is made, unless otherwise advised by the General Counsel, will appear at the stated time and place, produce a copy of this part, state that the employee has been advised by counsel not to provide the requested testimony or produce documents, and respectfully decline to comply with the demand, citing
United States ex rel. Touhy
v.
Ragen

(d)
Payment of fees.
You must pay witness fees for current OPM employees and any records certification fees by submitting to the General Counsel a check or money order for the appropriate amount made payable to the Treasury of the United States.

Certification (authentication) of copies of records.
The U.S. Office of Personnel Management may certify that records are true copies in order to facilitate their use as evidence.

You will be charged a certification fee of $15.00 for each document certified.
(f)
Waiver or reduction of fees.
The General Counsel, in his or her sole discretion, may, upon a showing of reasonable cause, waive or reduce any fees in connection with the testimony, production, or certification of records.

[53 FR 1998, Jan. 26, 1988, as amended at 89 FR 25750, Apr. 12, 2024]
§ 297.103
Designations of authority by system manager.
The responsible Office system manager having jurisdiction over a system of records may designate in writing an Office employee to evaluate and issue the Office's decision on Privacy Act matters relating to either internal, central, or Governmentwide systems of records.
§ 297.104
Types of records.
The Office manages three generic types of personnel records systems:
(a) Internal systems of records are under the Office's physical control and are established and maintained by the Office solely on its own employees and, when appropriate, on others in contact with the Office regarding matters within its authority.
(b) Centralized systems of personnel records are physically established and maintained by the Office with regard to most current and former Federal employees and some applicants for Federal employment.
(c) Governmentwide systems of personnel records are maintained by the Office, and through Office delegations of authority, by Federal agencies with regard to their own employees or applicants for employment. Although they are Office records, they are in the physical custody of those agencies. Though in the physical custody of agencies, the Office retains authority under its record management authority and under the Privacy Act to decide appeals of initial agency determinations regarding access to and amendment of material in these systems.
§ 297.105
Agency and Office responsibilities for systems of records and applicability of the regulations.
(a) These regulations apply to processing requests from both current and former Office employees for records contained in internal, central, and Governmentwide systems of records managed by the Office.
(b) Agencies are solely and totally responsible for processing requests regarding records maintained in their internal systems of records. Agency regulations, and not these Office regulations, govern the implementation of the Privacy Act for agency internal systems; there is no right of appeal to the Office from an agency's determination regarding its internal agency records.
(c) For records maintained in the Office's central systems of records, the data subject should contact the appropriate Office system manager concerning Privacy Act matters. These regulations will apply to inquiries regarding records located in the central systems of records.
(d) For records maintained within the Office's Governmentwide systems of records, each agency is responsible, unless specifically excepted by the Office, for responding to initial Privacy Act access and amendment requests from its own current employees. For records in Office Governmentwide systems, including those in Official Personnel Folders, Employee Performance Folders, and Employee Medical Folders, the Office is responsible for responding to initial Privacy Act access and amendment requests from former Federal employees.
(e) The procedures in this part apply to all such requests. The procedures in this part also apply to appeals from an agency initial determination regarding access to or amendment of records contained in the Office's Governmentwide systems of records.
(f) The Office follows the procedures in this part when—
(1) Processing initial requests regarding access to or amendment of records by its own employees and others that the Office is maintaining information on in its systems of records, including requests from former employees of an agency whose records properly reside in an Office Governmentwide system of records.
(2) Processing Privacy Act appeals regarding access to and amendment of records generated by another Federal agency, but which are contained in the Office's Governmentwide systems of records, after an agency has issued the initial decision.
(3) Processing initial requests and appeals concerning access to and amendment of records contained in the central systems of records.
(g) For requests concerning records and material of another agency that are in the custody of the Office, but not under its control or ownership, the Office reserves the right to either refer the request to the agency primarily responsible for the material or to notify the individual of the proper agency that should be contacted.
§ 297.106
Contact point for Privacy Act matters.
To determine what records the Office maintains in its system of records, requesters must write to the Assistant Director for Workforce Information, Personnel Systems and Oversight Group, Office of Personnel Management, 1900 E Street, NW., Washington, DC 20415. Using the Office's response, requesters can contact the particular system manager indicated in the Office's notices of its systems published in the
Federal Register
for further assistance in determining if the Office maintains information pertaining to them.

# Subpart B—Request for Access
§ 297.201
General provisions.
(a) Individual's requesting access to records pertaining to them that are maintained in a system of records should submit a written request to the appropriate system manager and state that the request is being made pursuant to the Privacy Act of 1974.
(b) The Office or agency will require proof of identity from a requester. The Office or agency reserves the right to determine the adequacy of any such proof. The general identifying items the Office will require a requester to provide when a request is made to the Office are—
(1) Full name, signature, and home address;
(2) Social security number (for systems of records that include this identifier);
(3) Current or last place and dates of Federal employment, when appropriate and,
(4) Date and place of birth.
(c) An individual may be represented by another when requesting access to records.
§ 297.202
Methods of access.
(a) The methods for allowing access to records, when such access has been granted by the Office or agency, are:
(1) Inspection in person in the designated office during the hours specified by the Office or agency; or
(2) Transfer of records at the option of the Office or agency to another more convenient Federal facility.
(b) Generally, Office of Personnel Management offices will not furnish certified copies of records. When copies are to be furnished, they may be provided as determined by the Office and may require payment of any fee levied in accordance with the Office's established fee schedule.
(c) When the requester seeks to obtain original documentation, the Office reserves the right to limit the request to copies of the original records. Original records should be made available for review only in the presence of the system manager or designee. An agency should consult with the Office when it receives a request for original documentation. Section 2701(a) of title 18 of the United States Code makes it a crime to conceal, mutilate, obliterate, or destroy any record filed in a public office, or to attempt to do so.
§ 297.203
Access by the parent of a minor or by the legal guardian of an individual declared to be incompetent.
(a) A parent, legal guardian, or custodian of a minor, upon presentation of suitable personal identification, may access on behalf of a minor any record pertaining to the minor in a system of records maintained by the Office.
(b) A legal guardian, upon presentation of documentation establishing guardianship, may access on behalf of an individual declared to be incompetent by a court of competent jurisdiction, any record pertaining to that individual in a system of records maintained by the Office.
(c) Minors are not precluded from exercising personally those rights provided them by the Privacy Act.
§ 297.204
Access by the representative of the data subject.
A record may be disclosed to a representative of the individual to whom the record pertains after the system manager receives written authorization from the individual who is the subject of the record.
§ 297.205
Access to medical records.
When a request for access involves medical or psychological records that the system manager believes requires special handling, the requester should be advised that the material will be provided only to a physician designated by the data subject. Upon receipt of the designation and upon verification of the physician's identity, the records will be made available to the physician, who will have full authority to disclose those records to the data subject when appropriate.
§ 297.206
Fees charged by the Office.
(a) No fees will be charged for search and review time expended by the Office to produce a record, or for making a photostatic copy of the record, or for having it personally reviewed by the data subject, when a record is retrieved from a system of records pertaining to that data subject. Additional copies provided may be charged under the Office's established fee schedule.
(b) When the fees chargeable under this section will amount to more than $25, the requester will be notified and payment of fees may be required before the records are provided.
(c) Remittance should be made by either a personal check, bank draft, or a money order that is made payable to the U.S. Office of Personnel Management and addressed to the appropriate system manager.
§ 297.207
Denials of access and appeals with respect to such denials.
(a) If an access request is denied, the Office or agency response will be in writing and will include a statement of the reasons for the denial and the procedures available to appeal the denial, including the name, position title, and address of the Office official responsible for the review.
(b) Nothing in this part should be construed to entitle a data subject the right to access any information compiled in reasonable anticipation of a civil action or proceeding.
(c) For denials of access made under this subpart, the following procedures apply:
(1) For initial denials made by an agency, when the record is maintained in an Office Governmentwide system of records, a request for adminstrative review should be made only to the Assistant Director for Workforce Information, Personnel Systems and Oversight Group, U.S. Office of Personnel Management, 1900 E Street NW., Washington, DC 20415.
(2) For denials initially made by an Office official, when a record is maintained in an internal or central system of records, a request for administrative review should be made to the Information and Privacy Appeals Counsel, Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Office of Personnel Management, 1900 E Street NW., Washington, DC 20415.
(3) Any administrative review decision that either partially or fully supports the initial decision and denies access to the material the individual originally sought should state the requester's right to seek judicial review of the final administrative decision.
§ 297.208
Judicial review.
Upon receipt of notification that the denial of access has been upheld on administrative review, the requester has
the right to judicial review of the decision for up to 2 years from the date on which the cause of action arose. Judicial review may be sought in the district court of the United States in the district in which—
(a) The requester resides;
(b) The requester has his or her principal place of business; or
(c) The agency records are situated; or it may be sought in the district court of the District of Columbia.

# Subpart C—Amendment of Records
§ 297.301
General provisions.
(a) Individuals may request, in writing, the amendment of their records maintained in an Office system of records by contacting the appropriate system manager.

The amendment procedures are also not designed to change opinions in records pertaining to the individual.
(b) The amendment procedures apply to situations when an occurrence that is documented was challenged through an established judicial, quasi-judicial, or administrative procedure and found to be inaccurately described; when the document is not identical to the individual's copy; or when the document is not created in accordance with the applicable recordkeeping requirements. (For example, the amendment provisions are not designed to allow a challenge to the merits of an agency adverse action that is documented in an individual's Official Personnel Folder.)
§ 297.304

§ 297.305
Denial of requests to amend records.
(a) If the Office or agency system manager decides not to amend the record in the manner sought, the requester should be notified in writing of the reasons for the denial.
(b) The decision letter should also include the requester's right to appeal the denial and the procedures for appealing the denial to the appropriate official.
§ 297.306
Appeal of a denial of a request to amend a record.
(a) An individual who disagrees with an initial denial to amend a record may file a written appeal of that denial to the appropriate official. In submitting an appeal, the individual should provide a copy of the original request for amendment, a copy of the initial denial decision, and a statement of the specific reasons why the initial denial is believed to be in error. Any appeal should be submitted to the official designated in the initial decision letter. The appeal should include the words “PRIVACY ACT APPEAL” in capital letters on the envelope and at the top of the letter of appeal.
(b) The reviewing official should complete the review and make a final determination in writing no later than 30 working days from the date on which the appeal is received. When circumstances warrant, this timeframe may be extended.
(c) If the Office grants the appeal, it will take the necessary steps either to amend the record itself or to require the originating agency to amend the record. When appropriate and possible, prior recipients of the record should be notified of the Office's action.
(d) The Office reserves the right to hold in abeyance any Privacy Act appeal concerning a record when an individual is involved in challenging an action involving that record in another administrative, judicial, or quasi-judicial forum. At the conclusion of such a challenge, the individual can resubmit the appeal.
(e) If the Office denies the appeal, it will include in the decision letter notification of the appellant's right to judicial review.
§ 297.307
Statement of disagreement.
(a) Upon receipt of a final administrative determination denying a request to amend a record, the requester may file a concise statement of disagreement. Such a statement should be filed with the appropriate system manager and should include the reasons why the requester believes the decision to be incorrect.
(b) The statement of disagreement should be maintained with the record to be amended and any disclosure of the record must include a copy of the statement of disagreement.
(c) When practicable and appropriate, the system manager should provide a copy of the statement of disagreement to any individual or agency to whom the record was previously disclosed as noted by the disclosure accounting.
§ 297.308

(a) The requester resides;
(b) The requester has his or her principal place of business; or
(c) The agency records are situated; or it may be sought in the district court of the District of Columbia.

(a) The Office may disclose, without prior consent of the data subject, specified information from a system of records whenever such disclosure is pursuant to an order signed by the appropriate official of a court of competent jurisdiction or quasi-judicial agency. In this subpart, a court of competent jurisdiction includes the judicial system of a state, territory, or possession of the United States.

(g) In all situations concerning an order, subpoena signed by a judge, or other demand for an employee of the Office to produce any material or testimony concerning the records that are subject to the order, that are contained in the Office's systems of records, and that are acquired as part of the employee's official duties, the employee shall not provide the information without the prior approval of the appropriate Office official.
(h) If it is determined that the information should not be provided, the individual ordered or subpoenaed to do so should respectfully decline to comply with the demand based on the instructions from the appropriate Office official.
(i) Notice of the issuance of the ex parte order or subpoena signed by a judge is not required if the system of records has been exempted from the notice requirement of 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(8) pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(j) by a Notice of Exemption published in the
Federal Register.
[53 FR 1998, Jan. 26, 1988, as amended at 57 FR 56732, Nov. 30, 1992]

[53 FR 1998, Jan. 26, 1988. Redesignated at 57 FR 56732, Nov. 30, 1992]

# Subpart E—Exempt Records
§ 297.501
Exemptions.
(a) Several of the Office's internal, central, and Governmentwide systems of records contain information for which exemptions appearing at 5 U.S.C. 552a(k) (1), (2), (3), (5), and (6) may be claimed. The systems of records for which the exemptions are claimed, the specific exemptions determined to be
necessary and proper with respect to these systems of records, the records exempted, the provisions of the act from which they are exempted, and the justifications for the exemptions are set forth below.
(b)
Specific exemptions
—(1)
Inspector General Investigations Case File Records (OPM/CENTRAL-4).
All information in these records that meets the criteria stated in 5 U.S.C. 552a(k) (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), and (7) is exempt from the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3) and (d). These provisions of the Privacy Act relate to making accountings of disclosures available to the data subject and access to and amendment of records. The specific applicability of the exemptions to this system and the reasons for the exemptions are as follows:
(i) Inspector General investigations may contain properly classified information that pertains to national defense and foreign policy obtained from other systems or another Federal agency. Application of exemption (k)(1) may be necessary to preclude the data subject's access to and amendment of such classified information under 5 U.S.C. 552a(d).
(ii) Inspector General investigations may contain investigatory material compiled for law enforcement purposes other than material within the scope of 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2); e.g., investigations into the administration of the merit system. Application of exemption (k)(2) may be necessary to preclude the data subject's access to or amendment of such records under 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(3) and (d).
(iii) Inspector General investigations may contain information obtained from another system or Federal agency that relates to providing protective services to the President of the United States or other individuals pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 3056. Application of exemption (k)(3) may be necessary to preclude the data subject's access to and amendment of such records under 5 U.S.C. 552a(d).
(iv) Inspector General case files may contain information that, by statute, is required to be maintained and used solely as a statistical record. Application of exemption (k)(4) may be necessary to ensure compliance with such a statutory mandate.
(v) All information about individuals in these records that meets the criteria stated in 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(5) is exempt from the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3) and (d). This exemption is claimed because this system contains investigatory material that if disclosed may reveal the identity of a source who furnished information to the Government under an express promise that the source's identity would be held in confidence or, prior to September 27, 1975, under an implied promise. The application of exemption (k)(5) will be required to honor promises of confidentiality should the data subject request access to or amendment of the records, or access to the accounting of disclosures of the record.
(vi) All information in these records that meets the criteria stated in 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(6) is exempt from the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 552a(d) relating to access to and amendment of records by the data subject. This exemption is claimed because portions of a case file record may relate to testing and examining material used solely to determine individual qualifications for appointment or promotion in the Federal service. Access to or amendment of this information by the data subject would compromise the objectivity and fairness of the testing or examining process.
(vii) Inspector General case files may contain evaluation material used to determine potential for promotion in the armed services. Application of exemption (k)(7) may be necessary, but only to the extent that the disclosure of the data would reveal the identity of a source who furnished information to the Government under an express promise that the identity of the source would be held in confidence, or, prior to September 27, 1975, under an implied promise that the identity of the source would be held in confidence.
(2)
Administrative Law Judge Applicant Records (OPM/CENTRAL-6).
(i) All information about individuals in these records that meets the criteria stated in 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(5) is exempt from the requirement of 5 U.S.C. 552(c)(3) and (d). The exemptions are claimed because this system contains investigatory material compiled solely for determining suitability, eligibility, and
qualifications for Federal civilian employment. To the extent that the disclosure of such material would reveal the identity of a source who furnished information to the Government under an express promise that the identity of the source would be held in confidence or, prior to September 27, 1975, under an implied promise that the identity of the source would be held in confidence, the application of exemption (k)(5) will be required to honor promises of confidentialty should the data subject request access to the accounting of disclosures of the record, or access to or amendment of the record.
(ii) All information in these records that meets the criteria stated in 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(6) is exempt from the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 552a(d), relating to access to and amendment of the records by the data subject. This exemption is claimed because portions of this system relate to testing and examining materials used solely to determine individual qualifications for appointment or promotion in the Federal service. Access to or amendment of this information by the data subject would compromise the objectivity and fairness of the testing or examing process.
(3)
Litigation and Claims Records (OPM/CENTRAL-7).
(i) When litigation or claim cases occur, information from other existing systems of records may be incorporated into the case file. This information may be material for which exemptions have been claimed by the Office in this section. To the extent that such exempt material is incorporated into a litigation or claim case file, the appropriate exemption (5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), or (7)) shall also apply to the material as it appears in this system. The exemptions will be only from those provisions of the Act that were claimed for the systems from which the records originated.
(ii) During the course of litigation or claims cases, it may be necessary to conduct investigations to develop information and evidence relevant to the case. These investigative records may include material meeting the criteria stated in 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), and (7). Such material is exempt from the requirement of 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3) and (d). These provisions of the Act relate to making accounting of disclosures available to the data subject and access to and amendment of records. The specific applicability of the exemptions to this system and the reasons for the exemptions are:
(A) Such investigations may contain properly classified information that pertains to national defense and foreign policy obtained from another Federal agency. Application of exemption (k)(1) may be necessary to preclude the data subject's access to and amendment of suh classified information under 5 U.S.C 552a(d).
(B) Such investigations may contain investigatory material compiled for law enforcement purposes othe than material within the scope of 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2), e.g., administration of the merit system, obtained from another Federal agency. All information about individuals in these records that meets the criteria of 5 U.S.C 552a(k)(2) is exempt from the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3) and (d). Application of exemption (k)(2) may be necessary to preclude the data subject's access to or amendment of those records.
(C) Such investigations may contain information obtained from another agency that relates to providing protective services to the President of the United States or other individuals pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 3056. All information about individuals in these records that meets the criteria of 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(3) is exempt from the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 552a(d), relating to access to or amendment of records by the data subject. Application of exemption (k)(3) may be necessary to preclude the data subject's access to and amendment of such records.
(D) Such investigations may contain information that, by statute, is required to be maintained and used solely as a statistical record. Application of exemption (k)(4) may be necessary to ensure compliance with such a statutory mandate.
(E) All information about individuals in these records that meets the criteria stated in 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(5) is exempt from the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 552a (c)(3) and (d). These exemptions are claimed because this system contains investigatory material compiled solely
for determining suitability, eligibility, and qualifications for Federal civilian employment. To the extent that the disclosure of such material would reveal the identity of a source who furnished information to the Government under an express promise that the identity of the source would be held in confidence, or, prior to September 27, 1975, under an implied promise that the identity of the source would be held in confidence, the application of exemption (k)(5) will be required to honor such a promise should the data subject request access to the accounting of disclosure, or access to or amendment of the record, that would reveal the identity of a confidential source.
(F) All information in these records that meets the criteria stated in 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(6) is exempt from the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 552a(d), relating to access to and amendment of the records by the data subject. This exemption is claimed because portions of this system relate to testing or examining materials used solely to determine individual qualifications for appointment or promotion in the Federal service. Access to or amendment by the data subject of this information would compromise the objectivity and fairness of the testing or examining process.
(G) Such investigations may contain evaluation material used to determine potential for promotion in the armed services. Application of exemption (k)(7) may be necessary, but only to the extent that the disclosure of the data would reveal the identity of a source who furnished information to the Government under an express promise that the identity of the source would be held in confidence, or, prior to September 27, 1975, under an implied promise that the identity of the source would be held in confidence.
(4)
Privacy Act/Freedom of Information Case Records (OPM/CENTRAL-8).
In this subpart, the Office has claimed exemptions for its other systems of records where it felt such exemptions are appropriate and necessary. These exemptions are claimed under 5 U.S.C. 552a(k) (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6) and (7). During the processing of a Privacy Act/Freedom of Information Act request (which may include access requests, amendment requests, and requests for review for initial denials of such requests) exempt materials from those other systems may in turn become part of the case record in this system. To the extent that copies of exempt records from those other systems are entered into this system, the Office hereby claims the same exemptions for the records from those other systems that are entered into this system, as claimed for the original primary system of which they are a part.
(5)
Personnel Investigations Records (OPM/CENTRAL-9).
All information in these records that meets the criteria stated in 5 U.S.C. 552a(k) (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), and (7) is exempt from the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 552a (c)(3) and (d). These provisions of the Privacy Act relate to making accountings of disclosures available to the data subject and access to and amendment of records. The specific applicability of the exemptions to this system and the reasons for the exemptions are as follows:
(i) Personnel investigations may contain properly classified information which pertains to national defense and foreign policy obtained from another Federal agency. Application of exemption (k)(1) may be necessary to preclude the data subject's access to and amendment of such classified information under 5 U.S.C. 552a(d).
(ii) Personnel investigations may contain investigatory material compiled for law enforcement purposes other than material within the scope of 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2); e.g., investigations into the administration of the merit system. Application of exemption (k)(2) may be necessary to preclude the data subject's access to or amended of such records under 5 U.S.C. 552a (c)(3) and (d).
(iii) Personnel investigations may contain information obtained from another Federal agency that relates to providing protective services to the President of the United States or other individuals pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 3056. Application of exemption (k)(3) may be necessary to preclude the data subject's access to and amendment of such records under 5 U.S.C. 552a(d).
(iv) Personnel investigations may contain information that, by statute, is required to be maintained and used
solely as a statistical record. Application of exemption (k)(4) may be necessary to ensure compliance with such a statutory mandate.
(v) All information about individuals in these records that meets the criteria stated in 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(5) is exempt from the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 552a (c)(3) and (d). These exemptions are claimed because this system contains investigatory material compiled solely for determining suitability, eligibility, and qualifications for Federal civilian employment. To the extent that the disclosure of material would reveal the identity of a source who furnished information to the Government under an express promise that the identity of the source would be held in confidence, or, prior to September 27, 1975, under an implied promise that the identity of the source would be held in confidence, the applicability of exemption (k)(5) will be required to honor promises of confidentiality should the data subject request access to or amendment of the record, or access to the accounting of disclosures of the record.
(vi) All information in these records that meets the criteria stated in 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(6) is exempt from the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 552a(d), relating to access to and amendment of records by the data subject. This exemption is claimed because portions of this system relate to testing or examining materials used solely to determine individual qualifications for appointment or promotion in the Federal service. Access to or amendment of this information by the data subject would compromise the objectivity and fairness of the testing or examining process.
(vii) Personnel Investigations may contain evaluation material used to determine potential for promotion in the armed services. Application of exemption (k)(7) may be necessary, but only to the extent that the disclosure of the data would reveal the identity of a source who furnished information to the Government under an express promise that the identity of the source would be held in confidence, or, prior to September 27, 1975, under an implied promise that the identity of the source would be held in confidence.
(6)
Presidential Management Fellows Program Records (OPM/CENTRAL-11).
All information in these records that meets the criteria stated in 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(6) is exempt from the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 552a(d), relating to access to and amendment of records by the data subject. This exemption is claimed because portions of this system relate to testing or examining materials used solely to determine individual qualifications for appointment or promotion in the Federal service and access to or amendment of this information by the data subject would compromise the objectivity and fairness of the testing or examining process.
(7)
Recruiting, Examining, and Placement Records (OPM/GOVT-5).
(i) All information about individuals in these records that meets the criteria stated in 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(5) is exempt from the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3) and (d). These provisions of the Privacy Act relate to making accountings of disclosures available to the data subject and access to and amendment of records. These exemptions are claimed because this system contains investigative material compiled solely for determining the appropriateness of a request for approval of an objection to an eligible's qualification for employment in the Federal service. To the extent that the disclosure of such material would reveal the identity of a source who furnished information to the Government under an express promise that the identity of the source would be held in confidence, or prior to September 27, 1975, under an implied promise that the identity of the source would be held in confidence, the application of exemption (k)(5) will be required to honor promises of confidentiality should the data subject request access to the accounting of disclosures of the record, or access to or amendment of the record.
(ii) All information in these records that meets the criteria stated in 5 U.S.C. 552a(K)(6) is exempt from the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 552a(d), relating to access to an amendment of records by the subject. This exemption is claimed because portions of this system relate to testing or examining materials used solely to determine individual qualifications for appointment or promotion in the Federal service
and access to or amendment of this information by the data subject would compromise the objectivity and fairness of the testing or examining process.
(8)
Personnel Research and Test Validation Records (OPM/GOVT-6).
(i) All information in these records that meets the criteria stated in 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(6) is exempt from the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 552a(d), relating to access to and amendment of the records by the data subject. This exemption is claimed because portions of this system relate to testing or examining materials used solely to determine individual qualifications for appointment or promotion in the Federal service. Access to or amendment of this information by the data subject would compromise the objectivity and fairness of the testing or examining process.
(ii) All information in these records that meets the criteria stated in 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(4) is exempt from the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 552a(d), relating to access to or amendment of the records by the data subject. This exemption is claimed because portions of this system relate to records required by statute to be maintained and used solely for statistical purposes. Access to or amendment of this information by the data subject would compromise the confidentiality of these records and their usefulness for statistical research purposes.
(c) The Office also reserves the right to assert exemptions for records received from another agency that could be properly claimed by that agency in responding to a request. The Office may refuse access to information compiled in reasonable anticipation of a civil action or proceeding.

# Subpart A—Employment Practices
§ 300.101
Purpose.
The purpose of this subpart is to establish principles to govern, as nearly as is administratively feasible and practical, the employment practices of the Federal Government generally, and of individual agencies, that affect the recruitment, measurement, ranking, and selection of individuals for initial appointment and competitive promotion in the competitive service or in positions in the government of the District of Columbia required to be filled in the same manner that positions in the competitive service are filled. For the purpose of this subpart, the term “employment practices” includes the development and use of examinations, qualification standards, tests, and other measurement instruments.
[36 FR 15447, Aug. 14, 1971]
§ 300.102
Policy.
This subpart is directed to implementation of the policy that competitive employment practices:
(a) Be practical in character and as far as possible relate to matters that fairly test the relative capacity and fitness of candidates for the jobs to be filled;
(b) Result in selection from among the best qualified candidates;
(c) Be developed and used without discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex (including pregnancy and gender identity), national origin, age (as defined by the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, as amended), disability, genetic information (including family medical history), marital status, political affiliation, sexual orientation, labor organization affiliation or nonaffiliation, status as a parent, or any other non-merit-based factor, or retaliation for exercising rights with respect to the categories enumerated above, where retaliation rights are available.
(d) Insure to the candidate opportunity for appeal or administrative review, as appropriate.
[40 FR 15379, Apr. 7, 1975, as amended at 79 FR 43922, July 29, 2014]
§ 300.103
Basic requirements.
(a)
Job analysis.
Each employment practice of the Federal Government generally, and of individual agencies, shall be based on a job analysis to identify:
(1) The basic duties and responsibilities;
(2) The knowledges, skills, and abilities required to perform the duties and responsibilities; and
(3) The factors that are important in evaluating candidates. The job analysis may cover a single position or group of positions, or an occupation or group of occupations, having common characteristics.
(b)
Relevance.
(1) There shall be a rational relationship between performance in the position to be filled (or in the target position in the case of an entry position) and the employment practice used. The demonstration of rational relationship shall include a showing that the employment practice was professionally developed. A minimum educational requirement may not be established except as authorized under section 3308 of title 5, United States Code.
(2) In the case of an entry position the required relevance may be based upon the target position when—
(i) The entry position is a training position or the first of a progressive series of established training and development positions leading to a target position at a higher level; and
(ii) New employees, within a reasonable period of time and in the great majority of cases, can expect to progress to a target position at a higher level.
(c)
Equal employment opportunity and prohibited forms of discrimination.
An employment practice must not discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, sex (including pregnancy and gender identity), national origin, age (as defined by the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, as amended), disability, genetic information (including family medical history), marital status, political affiliation, sexual orientation, labor organization affiliation or nonaffiliation, status as a parent, or any other non-merit-based factor, or retaliation for exercising rights with respect to the categories enumerated above, where retaliation rights are available. Employee selection procedures shall meet the standards established by the “Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures,” where applicable.
[40 FR 15380, Apr. 7, 1975, as amended at 43 FR 38310, Aug. 25, 1978; 79 FR 43922, July 29, 2014]
§ 300.104
Appeals, grievances and complaints.
(a)
Employment practices.
A candidate who believes that an employment practice which was applied to him or her by the Office of Personnel Management violates a basic requirement in § 300.103 is entitled to appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board under the provisions of its regulations.
(b)
Examination ratings.
A candidate may file an appeal with the Office from his or her examination rating or the rejection of his or her application, except that, where the Office has delegated examining authority to an agency, the candidate should appeal directly to that agency. The appeal and supporting documents shall be filed with the agency office that determined the rating.
(c)
Complaints and grievances to an agency.
(1) A candidate may file a complaint with an agency when he or she believes that an employment practice that was applied to him or her and that is administered by the agency discriminates against him or her on the basis of race, color, religion, sex (including pregnancy and gender identity), national origin, age (as defined by the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, as amended), disability, genetic information (including family medical history), or retaliation for exercising rights with respect to the categories enumerated above, where retaliation rights are available. The complaint must be filed and processed in accordance with the agency EEO procedures, as appropriate.
(2) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, an employee may file a grievance with an agency when he or she believes that an employment practice which was applied to him or her and which is administered or required by the agency violates a basic requirement in § 300.103. The grievance shall be filed and processed under an
agency grievance system, if applicable, or a negotiated grievance system as applicable.
[40 FR 15380, Apr. 7, 1975, as amended at 41 FR 51579, Nov. 23, 1976; 44 FR 48951, Aug. 21, 1979; 60 FR 3057, Jan. 13, 1995; 60 FR 47040, Sept. 11, 1995; 79 FR 43922, July 29, 2014]

# Subpart B—Examinations and Related Subjects
§ 300.201
Examinations.
(a) The Office makes available information that will assist members of the public in understanding the purpose of, and preparing for, civil service examinations. This includes the types of questions and the categories of knowledge or skill pertinent to a particular examination. The Office does not release the following: (1) Testing and examination materials used solely to determine individual qualifications, and (2) test material, including test plans, item analysis data, criterion instruments, and other material the disclosure of which would compromise the objectivity of the testing process.
(b) The Office maintains control over the security and release of testing and examination materials which it has developed and made available to agencies for initial competitive appointment or inservice use unless the materials were developed specifically for an agency through a reimbursable contractual agreement. These testing and examination materials include, and are subject to the same controls as, those described in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section.
(c) Each employee entrusted with test material has a positive duty to protect the confidentiality of that material and to assure release only as required to conduct an examination authorized by the Office.
(d) An applicant may review his or her own answers in a written test, but only in the presence of an employee of the Office or, for the convenience of the Office and requester, in the presence of an employee of another agency designated by OPM. The applicant may not review a test booklet in connection with this review.
(e) The Office will release information concerning the results of examinations only to the individual concerned, or to parties explicitly designated by the individual.
(f) The Office will not reveal the names of applicants for civil service positions or eligibles on civil service registers, certificates, employment lists, or other lists of eligibles, or their ratings or relative standings.

# Subpart C—Details of Employees
§ 300.301
Authority.
(a) In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 3341, an agency may detail an employee in the competitive service to a position in either the competitive or excepted service.
(b) In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 3341, an agency may detail an employee in the excepted service to a position in the excepted service and may also detail an excepted service employee serving under Schedule A, Schedule B, Schedule D, or a Veterans Recruitment Appointment to a position in the competitive service.
(c) Any other detail of an employee in the excepted service to a position in the competitive service may be made only with the prior approval of the Office of Personnel Management or under a delegated agreement between the agency and OPM.
[60 FR 3057, Jan. 13, 1995, as amended at 70 FR 72066, Dec. 1, 2005; 89 FR 25769, Apr. 12, 2024]

# Subpart D—Use of Commercial Recruiting Firms and Nonprofit Employment Services

# Source:
53 FR 51222, Dec. 21, 1988, unless otherwise noted.
§ 300.401
Definitions.
For purposes of this subpart:
(a) A
commercial recruiting firm
is a profit-making entity which, by contract, supplies individual candidates for consideration for specific Federal vacancies, in accordance with the requirements set by the Federal agency.
(b) A
nonprofit employment service
is one legally established as nonprofit under State law. It may be operated, for example, by professional societies,
organizations of college graduates, social agencies, or a State or local government. Federal agencies may not, however, use a nonprofit employment service sponsored by a partisan political organization. By contract, a nonprofit employment service supplies individual candidates for consideration for specific Federal vacancies, in accordance with the requirements set by the Federal agency.
§ 300.402
Coverage.
This part applies to filling positions in the competitive service; positions in the expected service under Schedules A, B, and C; and positions in the Senior Executive Service.
[57 FR 10124, Mar. 24, 1992]
§ 300.403
When commercial recruiting firms and nonprofit employment services may be used.
An agency may use a commercial recruiting firm and/or a nonprofit employment service in recruiting for vacancies when:
(a) The agency head or designee determines that such use is likely to provide well-qualified candidates who would otherwise not be available or that well-qualified candidates are in short supply;
(b) The agency has provided vacancy notices to appropriate State Employment Service and OPM offices; and
(c) The agency continues its own recruiting efforts.
§ 300.404
Use of fee-charging firms.
(a) Federal agencies are prohibited from using commercial recruiting firms and nonprofit employment services which charge fees to individuals referred to Federal positions. Federal agencies may not consider a candidate referred by a commercial recruiting firm or nonprofit employment service if the individual has paid or is expected to pay any fee to the firm or service.
(b) The prohibition in paragraph (a) of this section does not apply to registration fees paid by individuals to nonprofit employment services operated by professional organizations when the registration fee is imposed regardless of whether the registrant is referred for employment or placed.
§ 300.405
Requirement for contract.
(a) A written contract awarded in accordance with procedures stipulated in the Federal Acquisition Regulations is required between the Federal agency and a commercial recruiting firm or nonprofit employment service. The contract will satisfy the “written request” required by 18 U.S.C. 211. That statute prohibits the acceptance of payment for aiding an individual to obtain Federal employment
except
when an employment agency renders services pursuant to the written request of an executive department or agency.
(b) The contract must include the qualifications requirements for the position(s) to be filled and also provide that the firm or service will:
(1) Screen candidates only against the basic qualifications requirements for the position(s) specified by the Federal agency in the contract and refer to the agency all candidates who appear to meet those requirements;
(2) Refer to the Federal agency only those applicants from whom the firm or service has not accepted fees other than those permitted under § 300.404(b) of this part;
(3) Not imply that it is the sole or primary avenue for employment with the Federal Government or a specific Federal agency; and
(4) Recruit and refer candidates in accordance with applicable merit principles and equal opportunity laws.
§ 300.406
Agency responsibilities.
(a) The purpose of a commercial recruiting firm or nonprofit employment service is to serve as an additional source of applicants. Once recruited, applicants must be evaluated and appointed through regular civil service employment procedures.
(1) For a competitive service position, an individual must be appointed in accordance with the terms of applicable competitive service procedures.
(2) For an excepted service position, an individual must be appointed in accordance with the terms of the applicable appointing authority and the requirements set out in part 302 of this chapter.
(3) For a Senior Executive Service position filled by career appointment,
an individual must be appointed in accordance with the competitive process described in 5 U.S.C. 3393.
(b) In order to use commercial recruiting firms or nonprofit employment services, agencies are required to:
(1) Make known that applicants may apply directly to the Government and thus need not apply through the commercial recruiting firm or nonprofit employment service;
(2) Give the same consideration to candidates who have applied directly and candidates referred from the commercial recruiting firm or nonprofit employment service; and
(3) Follow all requirements for appointment, including veterans preference, where applicable.
§ 300.407
Documentation.
(a) Agencies are required to maintain records necessary to determine that using commercial recruiting firms or nonprofit employment services is cost effective and has not resulted in the violation of merit system principles or the commission of any prohibited personnel practice.
(b) When requested by OPM, agencies will provide reports on the use of commercial recruiting firms, based on the records required in paragraph (a) of this section.
[53 FR 51222, Dec. 21, 1988, as amended at 60 FR 3057, Jan. 13, 1995]
§ 300.408
Corrective action.
Upon evidence of failure to comply with these regulations, OPM may, pursuant to its authority, order the agency to take appropriate corrective action.

# Subpart E—Use of Private Sector Temporaries

# Source:
54 FR 3766, Jan. 25, 1989, unless otherwise noted.
§ 300.501
Definitions.
For purposes of this subpart:
(a) A
temporary help service firm
is a private sector entity which quickly provides other organizations with specific services performed by its pool of employees, possessing the appropriate work skills, for brief or intermittent periods. The firm is the legally responsible employer and maintains that relationship during the time its employees are assigned to a client. The firm, not the client organization, recruits, tests, hires, trains, assigns, pays, provides benefits and leave to, and as necessary, addresses performance problems, disciplines, and terminates its employees. Among other employer obligations, the firm is responsible for payroll deductions and payment of income taxes, social security (FICA), unemployment insurance, and workers' compensation, and shall provide required liability insurance and bonding.
(b)
Private sector temporaries
or
outside temporaries
are those employees of a temporary help service firm who are supervised and paid by that firm and whom that firm assigns to various client organizations who have contracted for the temporary use of their skills when required.
(c)
Parental and family responsibilities
are defined in OPM issuances and include situations such as absence for pregnancy, childbirth, child care, and care for elderly or infirm parents or other dependents.
(d) A
Federal supervisor
of Federal employees is defined in 5 U.S.C. 7103(a)(10) as
an individual employed by an agency having authority in the interest of the agency to hire, direct, assign, promote, reward, transfer, furlough, layoff, recall, suspend, discipline, or remove employees, to adjust their grievances, or to effectively recommend such action, if the exercise of the authority is not merely routine or clerical in nature but requires the consistent exercise of independent judgment * * *
(e) A
critical need
is a sudden or unexpected occurrence; an emergency; a pressing necessity; or an exigency. Such occasions are characterized by additional work or deadlines required by statute, Executive order, court order, regulation, or formal directive from the head of an agency or subordinate official authorized to take final action on behalf of the agency head. A recurring, cyclical peak workload, by itself, is not a critical need.
(f) A
local commuting area
is defined in part 351 of this chapter.
[54 FR 3766, Jan. 25, 1989, as amended at 66 FR 66710, Dec. 27, 2001]
§ 300.502
Coverage.
(a) These regulations apply to the competitive service and to Schedules A and B in the excepted service.
(b) Agencies may not use temporary help services for the Senior Executive Service or for the work of managerial or supervisory positions.
[61 FR 19510, May 2, 1996]
§ 300.503
Conditions for using private sector temporaries.
An agency may enter into a contract or other procurement arrangement with a temporary help service firm for the brief or intermittent use of the skills of private sector temporaries, when required, and may call for those services, subject to these conditions:
(a) One of the following short-term situations exists—
(1) An employee is absent for a temporary period because of a personal need including emergency, accident, illness, parental or family responsibilities, or mandatory jury service, but not including vacations or other circumstances which are not shown to be compelling in the judgment of the agency, or
(2) An agency must carry out work for a temporary period which cannot be delayed in the judgment of the agency because of a critical need.
(b) The need cannot be met with current employees or through the direct appointment of temporary employees within the time available by the date, and for the duration of time, help is needed. At minimum, this should include an agency determination that there are no qualified candidates on the applicant supply file and on the reemployment priority list (both of which must provide preference for veterans), and no qualified disabled veterans with a compensable service-connected disability of 30 percent or more under 5 U.S.C. 3112, who are immediately available for temporary appointment of the duration required, and that employees cannot be reassigned or detailed without causing undue delay in their regular work. In instances where a need is foreseeable, as when approval of employee absence is requested well in advance, an agency may have sufficient time to follow the temporary appointment recruiting requirements, including veterans' preference found in 5 CFR part 316 to determine whether qualified candidates are available by the date needed and for the length of service required.
(c) These services shall not be used:
(1) In lieu of the regular recruitment and hiring procedures under the civil service laws for permanent appointment in the competitive civil service, or
(2) To displace a Federal employee.
(3) To circumvent controls on employment levels.
(4) In lieu of appointing a surplus or displaced Federal employee as required by 5 CFR part 330, subpart F (Agency Career Transition Assistance Plan for Displaced Employees) and subpart G (Interagency Career Transition Assistance Plan for Displaced Employees.)
[54 FR 3766, Jan. 25, 1989, as amended at 61 FR 19510, May 2, 1996; 66 FR 66710, Dec. 27, 2001]
§ 300.504
Prohibition on employer-employee relationship.
No employer-employee relationship is created by an agency's use of private sector temporaries under these regulations. Services furnished by temporary help firms shall be performed by their employees who shall not be considered or treated as Federal employees for any purpose, shall not be regarded as performing a personal service, and shall not be eligible for civil service employee benefits, including retirement. Further, to avoid creating any appearance of such a relationship, agencies shall observe the following requirements:
(a)
Time limit on use of temporary help service firm.
An agency may use a temporary help service firm(s) in a single situation, as defined in § 300.503, initially for no more than 120 workdays. Provided the situation continues to exist beyond the initial 120 workdays, the agency may extend its use of temporary help services up to the maximum limit of 240 workdays.
(b)
Time limit on use of individual employee of a temporary help service firm.
(1) An individual employee of any temporary help firm may work at a major organizational element (headquarters or field) of an agency for up to 120
workdays in a 24-month period. The 24-month period begins on the first day of assignment.
(2) An agency may make an exception for an individual to work up to a maximum of 240 workdays only when the agency has determined that using the services of the same individual for the same situation will prevent significant delay.
(c) Individual employees of a temporary help firm providing temporary service to a Federal agency may be eligible for competitive civil service employment only if appropriate civil service hiring procedures are applied to them.
(d) Agencies shall train their employees in appropriate procedures for interaction with private sector temporaries to assure that the supervisory responsibilities identified in paragraph (a) of § 300.501 of this subpart are carried out by the temporary help service firm. At the same time, agencies must give technical, task-related instructions to private sector temporaries including orientation, assignment of tasks, and review of work products, in order that the temporaries may properly perform their services under the contract.
[54 FR 3766, Jan. 25, 1989, as amended at 61 FR 19511, May 2, 1996]
§ 300.505
Relationship of civil service procedures.
Agencies continue to have full authority to meet their temporary needs by various means, for example, redistributing work, authorizing overtime, using in-house pools, and making details or time-limited promotions of current employees. In addition, agencies may appoint individuals as civil service employees on various work schedules appropriate for the work to be performed.
[61 FR 19511, May 2, 1996]
§ 300.506
Requirements of procurement.
(a) Agencies must follow the Federal procurement laws and the Federal Acquisition Regulation, as applicable, in procuring services from the private sector.
(b) Agencies should make full use of the provisions of the Federal procurement system to make clear that the firm is the legally responsible employer and to specify the obligations the firm will have to meet to provide effective performance including such matters as the types and levels of skills to be provided, deadlines for providing service, liability insurance, and, when necessary, security requirements. The Federal procurement system also requires contractors to comply with affirmative action requirements to employ and advance in employment qualified disabled and Vietnam era veterans as provided in 41 CFR part 60-250, and with public policy programs including equal employment opportunity, handicapped employment, and small businesses.
§ 300.507
Documentation and oversight.
Agencies are required to maintain records and provide oversight to establish that their use of temporary help service firms is consistent with these regulations. As needed, OPM may require agencies to provide information on their use of temporary help service firms.
[61 FR 19511, May 2, 1996]

# Subpart F—Time-In-Grade Restrictions

# Source:
56 FR 23002, May 20, 1991, unless otherwise noted.
§ 300.601
Purpose.
The restrictions in this subpart are intended to prevent excessively rapid promotions in competitive service General Schedule positions and to protect competitive principles. They provide a budgetary control on promotion rates and help assure that appointments are made from appropriate registers. These restrictions are in addition to the eligibility requirements for promotion in part 335 of this chapter.
§ 300.602
Definitions.
In this subpart—
Advancement
means a promotion (including a temporary promotion) or any type of appointment resulting in a higher grade or higher rate of basic pay.
Competitive appointment
means an appointment based on selection from a competitive examination register of eligibles or under a direct hire authority.
Hardship to an agency
involves serious difficulty in filling a position, including when:
(a) The situation to be redressed results from circumstances beyond the organization's control and otherwise would require extensive corrective action; or
(b) A position at the next lower grade in the normal line of promotion does not exist and the resulting action is not a career ladder promotion; or
(c) There is a shortage of candidates for the position to be filled.
Inequity to an employee
involves situations where a position is upgraded without change in the employee's duties or responsibilities, or where discrimination or administrative error prevented an employee from reaching a higher grade.
Nontemporary appointment
means any appointment other than a temporary appointment pending establishment of a register (TAPER) or a temporary or excepted appointment not to exceed 1 year or less.
§ 300.603
Coverage.
(a)
Coverage.
This subpart applies to advancement to a General Schedule position in the competitive service by any individual who within the previous 52 weeks held a General Schedule position under nontemporary appointment in the competitive or excepted service in the executive branch, unless excluded by paragraph (b) of this section.
(b)
Exclusions.
The following actions may be taken without regard to this subpart but must be consistent with all other applicable requirements, such as qualification standards:
(1) Appointment based on selection from a competitive examination register of eligibles or under a direct hire authority.
(2) Noncompetitive appointment based on a special authority in law or Executive order (but not including transfer and reinstatement) made in accordance with all requirements applicable to new appointments under that authority.
(3) Advancement in accordance with part 335 of this chapter up to any General Schedule grade the employee previously held under nontemporary appointment in the competitive or excepted service.
(4) Advancement of an employee from a non-General Schedule position to a General Schedule position unless the employee held a General Schedule position under nontemporary appointment in the executive branch within the previous 52 weeks.
(5) Advancement of an individual whose General Schedule service during the previous 52 weeks has been totally under temporary appointment.
(6) Advancement of an employee under a training agreement established in accordance with OPM's operating manuals. However, an employee may not receive more than two promotions in any 52-week period solely on the basis of one or more training agreements. Also, only OPM may approve a training agreement that provides for consecutive promotions at rates that exceed those permitted by § 300.604 of this part.
(7) Advancement to avoid hardship to an agency or inequity to an employee in an individual meritorious case but only with the prior approval of the agency head or his or her designee. However, an employee may not be promoted more than three grades during any 52-week period on the basis of this paragraph.
(8) Advancement when OPM authorizes it to avoid hardship to an agency or inequity to an employee in individual meritorious situations not defined, but consistent with the definitions, in § 300.602 of this part.
[56 FR 23002, May 20, 1991, as amended at 66 FR 66710, Dec. 27, 2001]
§ 300.604
Restrictions.
The following time-in-grade restrictions must be met unless advancement is permitted by § 300.603(b) of this part:
(a)
Advancement to positions at GS-12 and above.
Candidates for advancement to a position at GS-12 and above must have completed a minimum of 52 weeks in positions no more than one grade lower (or equivalent) than the position to be filled.
(b)
Advancement to positions at GS-6 through GS-11.
Candidates for advancement to a position at GS-6 through GS-11 must have completed a minimum of 52 weeks in positions:
(1) No more than two grades lower (or equivalent) when the position to be filled is in a line of work properly classified at 2-grade intervals; or
(2) No more than one grade lower (or equivalent) when the position to be filled is in a line of work properly classified at 1-grade intervals; or
(3) No more than one or two grades lower (or equivalent), as determined by the agency, when the position to be filled is in a line of work properly classified at 1-grade intervals but has a mixed interval promotion pattern.
(c)
Advancement to positions up to GS-5.
Candidates may be advanced without time restriction to positions up to GS-5 if the position to be filled is no more than two grades above the lowest grade the employee held within the preceding 52 weeks under his or her latest nontemporary competitive appointment.
§ 300.605
Creditable service.
(a) All service at the required or higher grade (or equivalent) in positions to which appointed in the Federal civilian service is creditable towards the time periods required by § 300.604 of this part, except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section. Creditable service includes competitive and excepted service in positions under the General Schedule and other pay systems, including employment with a nonappropriated fund instrumentality. Service while on detail is credited at the grade of the employee's position of record, not the grade of the position to which detailed. Also creditable is service with the District of Columbia Government prior to January 1, 1980 (or prior to September 26, 1980, for those District employees who were converted to the District personnel system on January 1, 1980).
(b) Service in positions not subject to the General Schedule (GS) is credited at the equivalent GS grade by comparing the candidate's rate of basic pay with the representative rate (as defined in § 351.203 of this chapter) of the GS position in effect when the non-GS service was performed. The equivalent GS grade is the GS grade with a representative rate that equals the candidate's rate of basic pay. When the candidate's rate of basic pay falls between the representative rates of two GS grades, the non-GS service is credited at the higher grade.
(c) In applying the restrictions in § 300.604 of this part, prior service under temporary appointment at a level above that of a subsequent nontemporary competitive appointment is credited as if the service had been performed at the level of the nontemporary appointment. This provision applies until the employee has served in pay status for 52 weeks under nontemporary competitive appointment; thereafter, the service is credited at its actual grade level (or equivalent).

An agency may expand on these restrictions consistent with the intent of this subpart or may adopt similar policies to control promotion rates of employees not covered by this subpart.

# Subpart G—Statutory Bar to Appointment of Persons Who Fail To Register Under Selective Service Law

# Source:
52 FR 7400, Mar. 11, 1987, unless otherwise noted.
§ 300.701
Statutory requirement.
Section 3328 of title 5 of the United States Code provides that—
(a) An individual—
(1) Who was born after December 31, 1959, and is or was required to register under section 3 of the Military Selective Service Act (50 U.S.C. App. 453); and
(2) Who is not so registered or knowingly and willfully did not so register before the requirement terminated or became inapplicable to the individual, shall be ineligible for appointment to a position in an executive agency of the Federal Government.
(b) The Office of Personnel Management, in consultation with the Director of the Selective Service System, shall prescribe regulations to carry out this section. Such regulations shall include provisions prescribing procedures for the adjudication within the Office of determinations of whether a failure to register was knowing and willful. Such procedures shall require that such a determination may not be made if the individual
concerned shows by a preponderance of the evidence that the failure to register was neither knowing nor willful.
§ 300.702
Coverage.
Appointments in the competitive service, the excepted service, the Senior Executive Service, or any other civil service personnel management system in an executive agency are covered by these regulations.
§ 300.703
Definitions.
In this subpart—
Appointment
means any personnel action that brings onto the rolls of an executive agency as a civil service officer or employee as defined in 5 U.S.C. 2104 or 2105, respectively, a person who is not currently employed in that agency. It includes initial employment as well as transfer between agencies and subsequent employment after a break in service. Personnel actions that move an employee within an agency without a break in service are not covered. A break in service is a period of 4 or more calendar days during which an individual is no longer on the rolls of an executive agency.
Covered individual
means a male (a) whose application for appointment is under consideration by an executive agency or who is an employee of an executive agency; (b) who was born after December 31, 1959, and is at least 18 years of age or becomes 18 following appointment; (c) who is either a United States citizen or an alien (including parolees and refugees and those who are lawfully admitted to the United States for permanent residence and for asylum) residing in the United States; and (d) is or was required to register under section 3 of the Military Selective Service Act (50 U.S.C. App. 453). Nonimmigrant aliens admitted under section 101(a)(15) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S C. 1101), such as those admitted on visitor or student visas, and lawfully remaining in the United States, are exempt from registration.
Executive agency
means an agency of the Government of the United States as defined in 5 U.S.C. 105.
Exemptions
means those individuals determined by the Selective Service System to be excluded from the requirement to register under sections 3 and 6(a) of the Military Selective Service Act (50 U.S.C. App. 453 and 456(a)) or Presidential proclamation.
Preponderance of the evidence
means that degree of relevant evidence that a reasonable person, considering the record as a whole, would accept as sufficient to support a conclusion that the matter asserted is more likely to be true than not true.
Registrant
means an individual registered under Selective Service law.
Selective Service law
means the Military Selective Service Act, rules and regulations issued thereunder, and proclamations of the President under that Act.
Selective Service System
means the agency responsible for administering the registration system and for determining who is required to register and who is exempt.
§ 300.704
Considering individuals for appointment.
(a) An executive agency must request a written statement of Selective Service registration status from each covered individual at an appropriate time during the consideration process prior to appointment, and from each covered employee who becomes 18 after appointment. The individual must complete, sign, and date in ink the statement on a form provided by the agency unless the applicant furnishes other documentation as provided by paragraph (c) of this section.
(b)
Statement of Selective Service registration status.
Agencies should reproduce the following statement, which has been approved by the Office of Management and Budget for use through October 31, 1989, under OMB Control No. 3206-0166:

# Applicant's Statement of Selective Service Registration Status
If you are a male born after December 31, 1959, and are at least 18 years of age, civil service employment law (5 U.S.C. 3328) requires that you must be registered with the Selective Service System, unless you meet certain exemptions under Selective Service law. If you are required to register but knowingly and willfully fail to do so, you are ineligible for appointment by executive agencies of the Federal Government.

# Certification of Registration Status
Check one:
[ ] I certify I am registered with the Selective Service System.
[ ] I certify I have been determined by the Selective Service System to be exempt from the registration provisions of Selective Service law.
[ ] I certify I have not registered with the Selective Service System.
[ ] I certify I have not reached my 18th birthday and understand I am required by law to register at that time.

# Non-Registrants Under Age 26
If you are under age 26 and have not registered as required, you should register promptly at a United States Post Office, or consular office if you are outside the United States.

# Non-Registrants Age 26 or Over
If you were born in 1960 or later, are 26 years of age or older, and were required to register but did not do so, you can no longer register under Selective Service law. Accordingly, you are not eligible for appointment to an executive agency unless you can prove to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) that your failure to register was neither knowing nor willful. You may request an OPM decision through the agency that was considering you for employment by returning this statement with your written request for an OPM determination together with any explanation and documentation you wish to furnish to prove that your failure to register was neither knowing nor willful.

# Privacy Act Statement
Because information on your registration status is essential for determining whether you are in compliance with 5 U.S.C. 3328, failure to provide the information requested by this statement will prevent any further consideration of your application for appointment. This information is subject to verification with the Selective Service System and may be furnished to other Federal agencies for law enforcement or other authorized use in implementing this law.

# False Statement Notification
A false statement may be grounds for not hiring you, or for firing you if you have already begun work. Also, you may be punished by fine or imprisonment. (Section 1001 of title 18, United States Code.)
Legal signature of individual (please use ink)
Date signed (please use ink)
(c) At his option, a covered individual may submit, in lieu of the statement described above, a copy of his Acknowledgment Letter or other proof of registration or exemption issued by the Selective Service System. The individual must sign and date the document and add a note stating it is submitted as proof of Selective Service registration or exemption.
(d) An executive agency will give no further consideration for appointment to individuals who fail to provide the information requested above on registration status.
(e) An agency considering employment of a covered individual who is a current or former Federal employee is not required to request a statement when it determines that the individual's Official Personnel Folder contains evidence indicating the individual is registered or currently exempt from registration.
§ 300.705
Agency action following statement.
(a) Agencies must resolve conflicts of information and other questions concerning an individual's registration status prior to appointment. An agency may verify, at its discretion, an individual's registration status by requesting the individual to provide proof of registration or exemption issued by the Selective Service System and/or by contacting the Selective Service System at 888-655-1825.
(b) An agency may continue regular pre-employment consideration of individuals whose statements show they have registered or are exempt.
(c) An agency will take the following actions when a covered individual who is required to register has not done so, and is under age 26:
(1) Advise him to register promptly and, if he wishes further consideration, to submit a new statement immediately to the agency once he has registered. The agency will set a time limit for submitting the statement.
(2) Provide written notice to an individual who still does not register after being informed of the above requirements that he is ineligible for appointment according to 5 U.S.C. 3328 and will be given no further employment consideration.
(d) An agency will take the following actions when a covered individual who is age 26 or over, was required to register, and has not done so:
(1) Provide written notice to the individual that, in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 3328, he is ineligible for appointment unless his failure to register was neither knowing nor willful, and that OPM will decide whether his failure to register was knowing and willful if he submits a written request for such decision and an explanation of his failure to register.
(2) Submit the individual's application, the statement described in § 300.704(b), a copy of the written notice, his request for a decision and explanation of his failure to register, and any other papers pertinent to his registration status for determination to—Registration Review, Staffing Operations Division, Career Entry Group, room 6A12, U.S. Office of Personnel Management, 1900 E Street, NW., Washington, DC 20415.
(3) An agency is not required to keep a vacancy open for an individual who seeks an OPM determination.
(e) Individuals described in paragraph (c) of this section who do not submit a statement of registration or exemption are not eligible for employment consideration. Individuals described in paragraph (d) of this section are not eligible for employment consideration unless OPM finds that failure to register was neither knowing nor willful. Agencies are not required to follow the objections-to-eligibles procedures described in § 332.406 concerning such individuals who were certified or otherwise referred by an OPM examining office or other office delegated examining authority by OPM. Instead, an agency will provide, for information as part of its certification report to that office, a copy of its written notice to the individual.
[52 FR 7400, Mar. 11, 1987, as amended at 64 FR 28713, May 27, 1999]
§ 300.706
Office of Personnel Management adjudication.
(a) OPM will determine whether failure to register was knowing and willful when an individual has requested a decision and presented a written explanation, as described in § 300.705. The Associate Director for Career Entry or his or her designee will make the determination based on the written explanation provided by the individual. The burden of proof will be on the individual to show by a preponderance of the evidence that failure to register was neither knowing nor willful.
(b) OPM may consult with the Selective Service System in making determinations.
(c) The Associate Director for Career Entry or his or her designee will notify the individual and the agency in writing of the determination. The determination is final unless reconsidered at the discretion of the Associate Director. There is no further right to administrative review.
(d) The Director of OPM may reopen and reconsider a determination.
(e) The Director of OPM may, at his or her discretion, delegate to an executive agency the authority to make initial determinations. However, OPM may review any initial determination and make a final adjudication in any case. If a delegation is made under this paragraph, the notice in § 300.705(d)(1) will state that the individual may submit a written request that OPM review the agency's initial determination. The agency will forward to OPM copies of all documents relating to the individual's failure to register, including the individual's request for review and his explanation of his failure to register.
§ 300.707
Termination of employment.
A covered individual who is serving under an appointment made on or after November 8, 1985, and is not exempt from registration, will be terminated by his agency under the authority of the statute and these regulations if he has not registered as required, unless he registers or unless, if no longer eligible to register, OPM determines in response to his explanation that his failure to register was neither knowing nor willful.

# Subpart A—General Provisions
§ 302.101
Positions covered by regulations.
(a)
Positions covered.
With respect to the application of veteran preference, this part applies to each position in the Executive Branch of the Federal Government that is not in the competitive service and that is subject to the provisions of title 5, United States Code, or subject to a statutory requirement to follow the veteran preference provisions of title 5. With respect to restoration rights that are due to compensable injury and appeals therefrom, this part applies to those positions covered by 5 U.S.C. 8101(1) that are not in the competitive service.
(b)
Positions not covered.
This part does not apply to a position or appointment that is required by the Congress to be confirmed by, or made with the advice and consent of, the Senate.
(c)
Positions exempt from appointment procedures.
In view of the circumstances and conditions surrounding employment in the following classes of positions, an agency is not required to apply the appointment procedures of this part to them, but each agency shall follow the principle of veteran preference as far as administratively feasible and, on the request of a qualified and available preference eligible, shall furnish him/her with the reasons for his/her nonselection. Also, the exemption from the appointment procedures of this part does not relieve agencies of their obligation to accord persons entitled to priority consideration (see § 302.103) their rights under 5 U.S.C. 8151:
(1) Positions filled by persons appointed without pay or at pay of $1 a year;
(2) Positions outside the continental United States and outside the State of Hawaii and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico when filled by persons resident in the locality, and positions in the State of Hawaii and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico when paid in accordance with prevailing wage rates;
(3) Positions which the exigencies of the national defense program demand be filled immediately before lists of qualified applicants can be established or used, but appointments to these positions shall be temporary appointments not to exceed 1 year which may be renewed for 1 additional year at the discretion of the agency;
(4) Positions filled by appointees serving on an irregular or occasional basis whose hours or days of work are not based on a prearranged schedule and who are paid only for the time when actually employed or for services actually performed;
(5) Positions paid on a fee basis;
(6) Positions included in Schedule A (see subpart C of part 213 of this chapter) for which OPM agrees with the agency that the positions should be included hereunder and states in writing that an agency is not required to fill positions according to the procedures in this part.
(7) Positions included in Schedule C (see subpart C of part 213 of this chapter) and positions excepted by statute which are of a confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating character;
(8) Attorney positions; and
(9) Positions filled by reemployment of an individual in the same agency and commuting area, at the same or lower grade, and under the same appointing authority as the position last held;
Provided That,
there are no candidates eligible for the position on the agency's priority reemployment list established in accordance with § 302.303.
(10) Positions for which a critical hiring need exists when filled under § 213.3102(i)(2) of this chapter.
(11) Appointment of persons with intellectual disabilities, severe physical disabilities, or psychiatric disabilities
to positions filled under 5 CFR 213.3102(u).

§ 302.102
Method of filling positions and status of incumbent.
(a) To the extent permitted by statute and this chapter, each appointment, position change, and removal in the excepted service shall be made in accordance with any regulations or practices that the head of the agency concerned finds necessary.
(b) Except as authorized under paragraph (c) of this section, a person appointed to an excepted position does not acquire a competitive status by reason of the appointment. When an employee serving under a nontemporary appointment in the competitive service is selected for an excepted appointment, the agency must—
(1) Inform the employee that, because the position is in the excepted service, it may not be filled by a competitive appointment, and that acceptance of the proposed appointment will take him/her out of the competitive service while he/she occupies the position; and
(2) Obtain from the employee a written statement that he/she understands he/she is leaving the competitive service voluntarily to accept an appointment in the excepted service.
(c) Upon a finding by OPM that in a particular situation the action will be in the interest of good administration, OPM may authorize an agency to make appointments to specified positions in the excepted service in the same manner as to positions in the competitive service. Persons given career-conditional or career appointments pursuant to a specific authorization by OPM under this paragraph may acquire a competitive status as provided in part 315 of this chapter.

§ 302.104
Applicability of regulations to applicants and employees.
Each agency shall follow the provisions of this part relating to examination, rating, and selection for appointment of an applicant when a qualified preference eligible or person entitled to priority consideration applies for appointment to a position covered by this part. Each agency, in its discretion, may follow these provisions when no preference eligible or person entitled to priority consideration applies.
§ 302.105
Special agency plans.
An agency having a position subject to this part may establish a system which will result in granting to eligible persons the preference or priority consideration referred to in sections 1302(c) or 8151 of title 5, United States Code, but which does not conform to all the procedural requirements set forth in this part. The agency establishing such a system must ensure that all eligible applicants entitled to veteran preference or priority consideration receive at least as much advantage in referral as they would receive under the procedures set forth in this part.
§ 302.106
Vacancy announcements.
When an agency announces a vacancy in the excepted service, the announcement must contain a reasonable accommodation statement that complies with requirements in part 330, subpart A of this chapter.

§ 302.202
Qualification requirements.
Before making an appointment to a position covered by this part, each agency shall establish qualification standards such as those relating to experience and training, citizenship, minimum age, physical condition, etc., which shall relate to the duties to be performed. An agency may delegate the establishment of standards relating to a group of positions or a specific position to the appropriate administrative level or subdivision in accordance with the needs of the locality in which the position is located, but the agency shall determine that each standard established is in conformity with this part. Each agency shall make its standards a matter of record in the appropriate office of the agency, and shall furnish information concerning the standards for a position to an applicant on his/her request. Each agency shall apply the standards for a position uniformly to all applicants, except for such waivers as are provided in this part for a preference eligible. An agency shall not include a minimum educational requirement in qualification standards, except for a scientific, technical, or professional position the duties of which the agency decides cannot be performed by a person who does not have a prescribed minimum education. An agency shall not establish a maximum age requirement for any position. Each agency shall make a part of its records the reasons for its decision under this section and shall furnish those reasons to an applicant on his/her request. The qualification standards shall include:
(a) A provision for waiver by the agency of requirements as to age, height, and weight for each preference eligible when the requirements are not essential to the performance of the duties of the position; and
(b) A provision for waiver by the agency of physical requirements for each preference eligible when the agency, after giving due consideration to the recommendation of an accredited physician, finds that the applicant is physically able to discharge the duties of the position.

# Effective Date Note:
At 89 FR 102691, Dec. 18, 2024, § 302.203 was revised, effective Jan. 17, 2025. For the convenience of the user, the revised text is set forth as follows:
§ 302.203
Standard and criteria for determining fitness for employment in an Excepted Service position.
(a) The minimum standard and criteria for determining fitness for employment based on character and conduct are prescribed in part 731, subpart B, of this chapter.
(b) Agencies may prescribe additional factors to protect the integrity and promote the efficiency of the service when job-related and consistent with business necessity.

# Subpart C—Accepting, Rating, and Arranging Applications
§ 302.301
Receipt of applications.
(a) Each agency shall establish definite rules regarding the acceptance of applications for employment in positions covered by this part and shall make these rules a matter of record.
(b) Each agency shall apply its rules uniformly to all applicants who meet the conditions of the rules and shall furnish information concerning the rules to an applicant on his/her request.
§ 302.302
Examination of applicants.
(a)
Eligibility.
An evaluation of the qualifications of applicants for positions covered by this part may be conducted at any time before an appointment is made. The evaluation may involve only determination of eligibility or ineligibility or may include qualitative rating of candidates. If the evaluation involves only basic eligibility numerical scores will not be assigned and eligible candidates will be referred in accordance with the procedures described in paragraph (b)(5) of § 302.304. If qualitative ranking is desired, numerical scores may be assigned in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section. Each agency shall make a part of the records the reasons for its decision to use ranked or unranked referral and, for ranked actions, the quality ranking factors used. This information shall be made available to an applicant on his/her request.
(b)
Rating.
Numerical scores will be assigned on a scale of 100. Each applicant who meets the qualification requirements for the position established under § 302.202 will be assigned a rating of 70 or more and will be eligible for appointment. Candidates scoring 70 or more will receive additional points for veteran preference as provided in § 302.201. Numerical ratings are not required when all qualified applicants will be offered immediate appointment. When there is an excessive number of applicants, numerical ratings are required only for a sufficient number of the highest qualified applicants to meet the anticipated needs of the agency within a reasonable period of time. The agency must, however, adopt procedures to insure the consideration of preference eligibles in the order in which they would have been considered if all applicants had been assigned numerical ratings. An agency shall furnish a notice of the rating assigned to an applicant on his/her request.
(c)
Nonpreference applicants for certain positions.
An agency may not consider or rate an application for the position of elevator operator, messenger, guard, or custodian submitted by a nonpreference eligible as long as at least three qualified preference eligibles are available for the position.
(d)
Evaluating experience.
When experience is a factor in determining eligibility, an agency shall credit a preference eligible (1) with time spent in the military service of the United States if the position for which he/she
is applying is similar to the position which he/she held immediately before his/her entrance into the military service; and (2) with all valuable experience, including experience gained in religious, civic, welfare, service, and organizational activities, regardless of whether pay was received therefor.
§ 302.303
Maintenance of employment lists.
(a)
Establishment
—(1)
Agency's obligation.
An agency must establish a priority reemployment list whenever any applicants rated eligible under § 302.302 meet the conditions set out in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(3) of this section and must consider candidates from that list in accordance with § 302.304(a). All applicants not included on the priority reemployment list will be listed on the regular employment list unless the agency elects to establish a reemployment list as provided in paragraph (c) of this section.
(2)
Agency discretion.
In establishing its lists, an agency may, but is not required to: Afford priority consideration to non-preference eligibles who meet the conditions set out in paragraph (b)(4) of this section; afford priority consideration under paragraph (b) of this section for a longer time and/or in a broader geographic area than the minimum requirement; and/or provide reemployment consideration after the priority list is exhausted to additional current and former employees in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section. An agency may limit consideration granted at its discretion to applicants for specific positions or applicants who meet specific conditions, but must make those conditions a matter of record and must apply its policy uniformly to all eligible employees. Generally, full-time employees may be considered only for full-time positions and other-than-full-time employees only for other-than-full-time positions. However, full-time employees may be considered for other-than-full-time positions if there are no other-than-full-time employees on the appropriate priority or reemployment list; and other-than-full time employees may be considered for full-time positions if there are no full-time employees on the appropriate list.
(b)
Priority reemployment list.
Candidates are entered on the priority reemployment list in the geographic areas specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section and remain on the list for 2 years unless the agency elects to provide a longer period of eligibility. The priority reemployment list includes:
(1) The name of each former employee of the agency who is a preference eligible, has been furloughed or separated from a continuing appointment without delinquency or misconduct, and applies for reemployment. Candidates in this category are considered for positions in the commuting area where they were separated unless the agency elects to provide broader consideration.
(2) The name of each former employee of the agency who is a preference eligible and who, as the result of an appeal under part 752 of this chapter, is found by the Merit Systems Protection Board to have been unjustifiably dismissed from the agency, but who is not entitled to immediate restoration under the Board's decision. Candidates in this category are considered in the commuting area from which separated unless the Board's decision specifies a broader or different area or the agency elects to afford broader geographic consideration.
(3) The name of each former employee of the agency who has been furloughed or separated due to compensable injury sustained under the provisions of 5 U.S.C. chapter 81, subchapter I, who is not entitled to immediate restoration, and who is eligible for priority consideration under this part. Candidates in this category are considered in the commuting area where they last served and, if the agency determines that an appropriate vacancy is unlikely to occur in that area during the candidates' period of reemployment priority, in other locations for which they are available.
(4) At the agency's discretion, the name of each former employee of the agency who is not a preference eligible, has been furloughed or involuntarily separated from a continuing appointment without delinquency or misconduct, and applies for reemployment.
Candidates in this category are considered in the geographic area specified by the agency.
(c)
Reemployment list.
A reemployment list may be established at the agency's discretion to include the names of current employees of the agency and of former employees of the agency who are to be considered for future employment and who are not eligible for inclusion on the priority reemployment list. Employees may be entered on the reemployment list only for positions in which tenure and/or work schedule is no greater than that of the position previously held.
(d)
Order of entry.
An agency shall enter the names of all applicants rated eligible under § 302.302 on the appropriate list (priority reemployment, reemployment, or regular employment) in the following order:
(1)
When candidates have been rated only for basic eligibility under § 302.302(a).
(i) Preference eligibles having a compensable, service-connected disability of 10 percent or more (designated as “CP”) unless the list will be used to fill professional positions at the GS-9 level or above, or equivalent;
(ii) All other candidates eligible for 10-point veteran preference;
(iii) All candidates eligible for 5-point veteran preference;
(iv) All candidates eligible for sole survivorship preference and
(v) Qualified candidates not eligible for veteran preference.
(2)
When qualified candidates have been assigned numerical scores under § 302.302(b).
(i) Preference eligibles having a compensable, service-connected disability of 10 percent or more, in the order of their augmented ratings, unless the list will be used to fill professional positions at the GS-9 level or above, or equivalent;
(ii) All other qualified candidates in the order of their augmented ratings. At each score, qualified candidates eligible for 10-point preference will be entered first, followed, second, by 5-point preference eligibles, third, by sole survivorship preference eligibles, and last, by nonpreference eligibles.
[55 FR 9407, Mar. 14, 1990, as amended at 85 FR 63191, Oct. 7, 2020]
§ 302.304
Order of consideration.
(a)
Consideration of priority reemployment candidates.
An agency must consider all qualified candidates on its priority reemployment list before it may refer candidates from its reemployment list, if any, or regular employment list. When a qualified candidate is available on the priority list, the agency may appoint an individual who is not on the priority list or who has lower standing than others on that list
only
when necessary to obtain an employee for duties that cannot be taken over without undue interruption to the agency by an individual who is entitled to reemployment priority or has higher standing on the priority reemployment list than the one appointed. The agency must notify each individual on the priority reemployment list who is adversely affected by an appointment under this paragraph of the reasons for the exception and must further notify each such individual who is a preference eligible of his or her right of appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board.
(b)
Consideration of other candidates.
Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(4) and (b)(5) of this section, an agency shall consider applicants on the reemployment and/or regular employment list who have been assigned eligible ratings for a given position in Order A, Order B, or Order C, as described in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(3) of this section. Order A must be used when the agency has not established a reemployment list.
(1)
Order A.

(ii) The name of each other qualified applicant in the order of his/her numerical ranking.
(2)
Order B.
(i) The name of each qualified preference eligible who has a compensable, service-connected disability of 10 percent or more and is entitled to 10-point preference under section 3309 of title 5, United States Code,

An agency shall consider applicants who have been assigned eligible ratings for professional and scientific positions at the GS-9 level and above, or equivalent, in the following order:
(i)
Applicants on the agency's reemployment list, if any.
If numerical scores have been assigned, the applicants will be considered in the order of their augmented scores. If numerical scores have not been assigned, all preference eligibles will be considered together regardless of the type of preference, followed by all other priority reemployment candidates.
(ii)
Applicants on the agency's regular employment list.
If numerical scores have been assigned, the applicants will be considered in the order of their augmented scores. If numerical scores have not been assigned, all preference eligibles will be considered together regardless of the type of preference, followed by all other candidates.
(5)
Unranked order.
When numerical scores are not assigned, the agency may consider applicants who have received eligible ratings for positions not covered by paragraph (b)(4) of this section in either of the following orders:
(i)
By preference status.
Under this method, preference eligibles having a compensable service-connected disability of 10 percent or more are considered first, followed, second, by other 10-point preference eligibles, third, by 5-point preference eligibles, fourth by sole survivorship preference eligibles, and last, by nonpreference eligibles.

# Subpart D—Selection and Appointment; Reappointment; and Qualifications for Promotion
§ 302.401
Selection and appointment.
(a)
Selection.
When making an appointment from a priority reemployment, reemployment, or regular list on which candidates have not received numerical scores, an agency must make
its selection from the highest available preference category, as long as at least three candidates remain in that group. When fewer than three candidates remain in the highest category, consideration may be expanded to include the next category. When making an appointment from a list on which candidates have received numerical scores, the agency must make its selection for each vacancy from not more than the highest three names available for appointment in the order provided in § 302.304. Under either method, an agency is not required to—
(1) Accord an applicant on its priority reemployment or reemployment list the preference consideration required by § 302.304 if the list on which the applicant's name appears does not contain the names of at least three preference eligibles; or
(2) Consider an applicant who has previously been considered three times or a preference eligible if consideration of his/her name has been discontinued for the position as provided in paragraph (b) of this section.
(b)
Passing over a preference applicant.
When an agency, in making an appointment as provided in paragraph (a) of this section, passes over the name of a preference eligible, it shall follow the procedures in 5 U.S.C. 3318(c) and 3319(c) as described in the
Delegated Examining Operations Handbook.
An agency may discontinue consideration of the name of a preference eligible for a position as described in 5 U.S.C. 3318(c).
[55 FR 9407, Mar. 14, 1990, as amended at 85 FR 63191, Oct. 7, 2020]
§ 302.402
Reappointment.
An agency may reappoint a current or former nontemporary employee of the executive branch of the Federal Government who is a preference eligible to a position covered by this part without regard to the names of qualified applicants on the agency's priority reemployment, reemployment, or regular employment list.
§ 302.403
Qualifications for promotion.
In determining qualifications for promotion with respect to an employee who is a preference eligible, an agency shall waive:
(a) Requirements as to age, height, and weight unless the requirement is essential to the performance of the duties of the position; and
(b) Physical requirements if, in the opinion of the agency, after considering the recommendation of an accredited physician, the preference eligible is physically able to perform efficiently the duties of the position for which the promotion is proposed.

# Subpart E—Appeals
§ 302.501
Entitlement.
An individual who is covered by 5 U.S.C. 8101(1) and is entitled to priority consideration under this part (see § 302.103) may appeal a violation of his/her restoration rights to the Merit Systems Protection Board under the provisions of the Board's regulations by presenting factual information that he or she was denied restoration rights because of the employment of another person.

# Subpart F—Moving Employees and Positions into and Within the Excepted Service

# Source:
89 FR 25046, April 9, 2024, unless otherwise noted.
§ 302.601
Scope.
(a) This subpart applies to any situation where an agency moves:
(1) A position from the competitive service to the excepted service, or between excepted services, whether pursuant to statute, Executive Order, or an OPM issuance, to the extent that this subpart is not inconsistent with applicable statutory provisions; or
(2) An employee who has accrued status and civil service protections under 5 U.S.C. chapter 75, subchapter II, involuntarily to any position that is not covered by that chapter or subchapter.
(b) This subpart also applies in situations where a position previously governed by title 5, United States Code will be governed by another title of the United States Code going forward, unless the statute governing the exception provides otherwise.
§ 302.602
Basic requirements.
(a) In the event the President, Congress, OPM, or their designees direct agencies to move positions from the competitive service into the excepted service under Schedule A, B, or C, or any schedule in the excepted service created after May 9, 2024, or to move positions from a schedule in the excepted service to a different schedule in the excepted service, the following requirements must be met, as relevant:
(1) If the directive explicitly delineates the specific positions that are covered, the agency need only list the positions moved in accordance with that directive, and their location within the organization and provide the list to OPM.
(2) If the directive requires the agency to select the positions to be moved pursuant to criteria articulated in the directive, then the agency must provide OPM with a list of the positions to be moved in accordance with those criteria, denote their location in the organization, and explain, upon request from OPM, why the agency believes the positions met those criteria.
(3) If the directive confers discretion on the agency to establish objective criteria for identifying the positions to be covered, or which specific slots of a particular type of position the agency intends to move, then the agency must, in addition to supplying a list of the identified positions or specific slots of particular types of position, supply OPM with the locations in the organization, the objective criteria to be used, and an explanation of how these criteria are relevant.
(b) An agency is also required to—
(1) Identify the types, numbers, and locations of positions that the agency proposes to move into the excepted service.
(2) Document the basis for its determination that movement of the positions is consistent with the standards set forth by the President, Congress, OPM, or their designees as applicable.
(3) Obtain certification from the agency's Chief Human Capital Officer (CHCO) that the documentation is sufficient and movement of the positions is both consistent with the standards set forth by the directive, as applicable, and with merit system principles.
(4) Submit the CHCO certification and supporting documentation to OPM (to include the types, numbers, and locations of positions) in advance of using the excepted service authority, which OPM will then review.
(5) For exceptions effectuated by the President or OPM, list positions to the appropriate schedule of the excepted service only after obtaining written approval from the OPM Director to do so. For exceptions effectuated by Congress, inform OPM of the positions excepted either before the effective date of the provision, if the statutory provisions are not immediately effective, or within 30 days thereafter.
(6) For exceptions created by the President or OPM, initiate any hiring actions under the excepted service authority only after OPM publishes any such authorizations in the
Federal Register,
to include the types, numbers, and locations of the positions moved to the excepted service.
(c) In accordance with the requirements provided in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section—
(1) An agency that seeks to move an encumbered position from the competitive service to the excepted service, or from one excepted service schedule to another, must—
(i) Provide written notification to the incumbent employee of the intent to move the position 30 days prior to the effective date of the position being moved.
(ii) In the written notification required by paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, if the movement was involuntary, inform the employee that the employee retains any competitive status or procedural and appeal rights previously accrued under chapter 75, subchapter II, or section 4303 of title 5, United States Code, notwithstanding the movement of the position, and inform the employee of appeal rights conferred under § 302.603 and the timing for exercising such appeal rights.
(d) In addition to applying to the movement of positions, the requirements of this section apply to the involuntary movement of competitive service or excepted service employees with respect to any earned competitive status, any accrued procedural rights, or depending on the action involved,
any appeal rights under chapter 75, subchapter II, or section 4303 of title 5, United States Code, even when moved to the new positions.
(e) Notwithstanding the use of the plural words “positions,” “employees,” “individuals,” and “personnel actions,” this section also applies if the directive of the President, Congress, OPM, or a designee thereof affects only one position or one individual.
§ 302.603
Appeals.
(a) A competitive service employee whose position is placed into the excepted service or who is otherwise moved involuntarily to the excepted service, or an excepted service employee whose position is placed into a different schedule of the excepted service or who is otherwise involuntarily moved to a position in a different schedule of the excepted service, may directly appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board, as provided in paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section. The appeal rights conferred in this section are in addition to, and not in derogation of, any right the individual would otherwise have to appeal a subsequent personnel action undertaken without following appropriate procedures under chapter 75, subchapter II, or section 4303 of title 5, United States Code.
(b) Where the agency, notwithstanding the requirements of section 302.602 of this part, asserts that the move of the original position or any subsequent position to which the individual is involuntarily moved thereafter will eliminate competitive status or any procedural and appeal rights that had previously accrued, the affected individual may appeal from that determination and request an order directing the agency:
(1) To correct the notice to provide that any previously accrued status or procedural and appeal rights under those provisions continue to apply; and
(2) To comply with the requirements of either chapter 75, subchapter II or section 4303, title 5, United States Code, in pursuing any action available under those provisions, except to the extent that any such order would be inconsistent with an applicable statute.
(c) Where the agency fails to comply with § 302.602(c)(1) of this part and fails to provide the individual with the requisite notice, the affected individual may appeal the failure to provide the requisite notice and request an order directing the agency to comply with that provision.
(d) An individual may appeal under this part on the basis that:
(1) A facially voluntary move was coerced or otherwise involuntary; or
(2) A facially voluntary move to a new position would require the individual to relinquish their competitive status or any civil service protections and the move was coerced or otherwise involuntary.

§ 304.101
Coverage.
These regulations apply to the appointment of experts and consultants as Federal employees under 5 U.S.C. 3109. They do not apply to the appointments of experts and consultants under other employment authorities or to the procurement of services by contracts under the procurement laws.
§ 304.102
Definitions.
For purposes of this part:
(a) An
agency
is an executive department, a military department, or an independent agency.
(b) A
consultant
is a person who can provide valuable and pertinent advice generally drawn from a high degree of broad administrative, professional, or technical knowledge or experience. When an agency requires public advisory participation, a consultant also may be a person who is affected by a
particular program and can provide useful views from personal experience.
(c) A
consultant position
is one that requires providing advice, views, opinions, alternatives, or recommendations on a temporary and/or intermittent basis on issues, problems, or questions presented by a Federal official.
(d) An
expert
is a person who is specially qualified by education and experience to perform difficult and challenging tasks in a particular field beyond the usual range of achievement of competent persons in that field. An expert is regarded by other persons in the field as an authority or practitioner of unusual competence and skill in a professional, scientific, technical or other activity.
(e) An
expert position
is one that requires the services of a specialist with skills superior to those of others in the same profession, occupation, or activity to perform work on a temporary and/or intermittent basis assigned by a Federal official. For example, a microbial contamination specialist may apply new test methods to identify bacteria on products, a computer scientist may adapt advanced methods to develop a complex software system, or a plate maker may engrave a novel design.
(f)
Intemittent employment,
as defined in part 340, subpart D, of this chapter, means employment without a regularly scheduled tour of duty.
(g)
Temporary employment
means employment not to exceed 1 year. An expert or consultant serving under a temporary appointment may have a full-time, part-time, seasonal, or intermittent work schedule.
(h) Employment
without compensation
means unpaid service that is provided at the agency's request and is to perform duties that are unclassified. It is not volunteer service.
§ 304.103
Authority.
(a)
Basic authority.
(1) When authorized by an appropriation or other statute to use 5 U.S.C. 3109, an agency may appoint a qualified expert or consultant to an expert or consultant position that requires only intermittent and/or temporary employment. Such an appointment is excepted from competitive examination, position classification, and the General Schedule pay rates.
(2) An expert or consultant who works on a strictly intermittent basis may be appointed under this authority without time limit or for any period determined by the agency. All other experts and consultants must receive temporary appointments. Temporary experts and consultants may be reappointed in the same agency only as provided in paragraph (c) of this section.
(b)
Inappropriate use.
An agency must not use 5 U.S.C. 3109 to appoint an expert or consultant:
(1) To a position requiring Presidential appointment. However, subject to the conditions of this part, an agency may appoint an individual awaiting final action on a Presidential appointment to an expert or consultant position.
(2) To a Senior Executive Service position (including an FBI or DEA Senior Executive Service position).
(3) To perform managerial or supervisory work (although an expert may act as team leader or director of the specific project for which he/she is hired), to make final decisions on substantive policies, or to otherwise function in the agency chain of command (e.g., to approve financial transactions, personnel actions, etc.).
(4) To do work performed by the agency's regular employees.
(5) To fill in during staff shortages.
(6) Solely in anticipation of giving that individual a career appointment. However, subject to the conditions of this part, an agency may appoint an individual to an expert or consultant position pending Schedule C appointment or noncareer appointment in the Senior Executive Service.
(c)
Reappointment.
An agency may reemploy an expert or consultant to perform demonstrably different duties without regard to the length of that individual's previous expert or consultant service with the agency. Reappointment to perform substantially the same duties is subject to the following limits:
(1) An agency may employ an expert or consultant who works on a full-time basis for a maximum of 2 years—
i.e.,
on an initial appointment not to exceed 1
year and a reappointment not to exceed 1 additional year.
(2) An agency may reappoint an expert or consultant who works on a part-time or intermittent schedule in accordance with one of the following options. The agency must determine which option it will use in advance of any reappointment and must base its determination on objective criteria (e.g., nature of duties, pay level, whether or not work is regularly scheduled). Option 1 must be applied to reappointments of experts and consultants appointed without compensation.
(i)
Option 1—Annual service.
An agency may reappoint an expert or consultant, with no limit on the number of reappointments, as long as the individual is paid for no more than 6 months (130 days or 1,040 hours) of work, or works for no more than that amount of time without compensation, in a service year. (The service year is the calendar year that begins on the date of the individual's initial appointment in the agency.) An expert or consultant who exceeds this limit in his/her first service year may be reappointed for 1 additional year. An expert or consultant who exceeds the limit during any subsequent service year may not be reappointed thereafter.
(ii)
Option 2—Cumulative earnings.
Each expert or consultant will have a lifetime limit of twice the maximum annual rate payable under the annualized basic pay limitations of section 304.105. The agency may adjust this limit to reflect statutory increases in basic pay rates. The agency may reappoint an expert or consultant until his/her total earnings from expert or consultant employment with the agency reach the lifetime maximum, as determined by using the applicable maximum salary rate. At that point, the employment must be terminated.
(3) OPM may authorize reappointment of an expert or consultant as an exception to the limits in the section when necessitated by unforeseen and unusual circumstances.
§ 304.104
Determining rate of pay.
(a) The rate of basic pay for experts and consultants is set by administrative action. The head of an agency, or his or her designee, must determine the appropriate rate of basic pay on an hourly or daily basis, subject to the limitations described in section 304.105.
(b) The head of an agency, or his or her designee, shall consider the following factors in setting the initial rate of basic pay for an expert or consultant:
(1) The level and difficulty of the work to be performed;
(2) The qualifications of the expert or consultant;
(3) The pay rates of comparable individuals performing similar work in Federal or non-Federal sectors; and
(4) The availability of qualified candidates.
(c) An expert or consultant appointed under 5 U.S.C. 3109 may be employed without pay, provided the individual agrees in advance in writing to waive any claim for compensation for those services.
§ 304.105
Daily and biweekly basic pay limitations.
(a) Unless specifically authorized by an appropriation or other statute, agencies subject to chapter 51 and subchapter III of chapter 53 of title 5, United States Code, may not pay for any 1 day an aggregate amount of pay (including basic pay, locality pay under subpart F of part 531 of this chapter, and premium pay under subpart A of part 550 of this chapter) that exceeds the daily equivalent of the highest rate payable under 5 U.S.C. 5332—that is, the daily rate for GS-15, step 10, under the General Schedule (excluding locality pay or any other additional pay). The daily rate is computed by dividing the annual GS-15, step 10, rate by 2,087 hours to find the hourly rate of pay and by multiplying the hourly rate of pay by 8 hours.
(b) Unless specifically authorized by an appropriation or other statute, an expert or consultant shall not be paid for any biweekly pay period an aggregate amount of pay (including basic pay, locality pay under subpart F of part 531 of this chapter, and premium pay under subpart A of part 550 of this chapter) in excess of the biweekly rate of pay for GS-15, step 10, under the General Schedule (excluding locality pay or any other additional pay). The biweekly rate is computed by dividing
the annual GS-15, step 10, rate by 2,087 hours to find the hourly rate of pay and by multiplying the hourly rate of pay by 80 hours.
§ 304.106
Pay and leave administration.
(a) The employing agency has the authority to adjust the pay of experts and consultants after initial appointment and to establish appropriate policies governing the amount and timing of any such adjustments, subject to the limitations of § 304.105. In addition to the factors listed in § 304.104(b), the agency may consider factors such as job performance, contributions to agency mission, and the general pay increases granted to other Federal employees. Experts and consultants are not entitled to receive automatic adjustments in their rates of basic pay at the time of general pay increases under 5 U.S.C. 5303 unless specifically provided for in the official appointing document. In the absence of such automatic entitlement, any pay adjustments are at the agency's discretion.
(b) Experts and consultants paid on a daily rate basis are not entitled to overtime pay under section 5542 of title 5, United States Code. Otherwise, experts and consultants qualify for premium pay under subchapter V of chapter 55 of title 5, United States Code, if they meet the applicable eligibility requirements (including the requirement that an employee have a regularly scheduled tour of duty, where applicable).
(c) Experts and consultants may be entitled to overtime pay under the Fair Labor Standards Act if they are nonexempt under OPM regulations implementing that Act for Federal employees. (See 5 CFR part 551).
(d) An expert or consultant may be paid for service on an intermittent basis in more than one expert or consultant position, provided the pay is not received for the same period of time (5 U.S.C. 5533(d)(1)).
(e) Experts and consultants are subject to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 8344 and 8468 on reduction of basic pay by the amount of annuity received.
(f) Experts and consultants are subject to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 5532 on reduction of retired military pay.
(g) Experts and consultants with a regularly scheduled tour of duty (
i.e.,
not intermittent) are entitled to sick and annual leave in accordance with chapter 63 of title 5, United States Code, and to pay for any holiday occurring on a workday on which they perform no work, provided that workday is part of the basic workweek. Those employed on an intermittent basis do not earn leave and are not entitled to paid holidays.
§ 304.107
Reports.
As required by 5 U.S.C. 3109(e), each agency shall report to the Office of Personnel Management on an annual basis:
(a) The number of days the agency employed each paid expert or consultant; and
(b) The total amount the agency paid each expert or consultant so employed. (Do not include payments for travel and related expenses.)
§ 304.108
Compliance.
(a) Each agency using 5 U.S.C. 3109 must establish and maintain a system of controls and oversight necessary to assure compliance with 5 U.S.C. 3109 and these regulations. The system must include—
(1) Appropriate training and information procedures to ensure that officials and employees using the authority understand the statutory and regulatory requirements; and
(2) Appropriate provision for review of expert and consultant appointments.
(b) OPM will, as necessary—
(1) Review agency employment of experts and consultants and agency controls and oversight to determine compliance; and
(2) Issue instructions and guidance to agencies on employing experts and consultants and on reporting procedures.

§ 307.101
Purpose.
This part implements 38 U.S.C. 4214 and Executive Order 11521, which authorizes agencies to appoint
qualified covered veterans
to positions in the competitive service under Veterans Recruitment Appointments (VRAs) without regard to the competitive examining system.
§ 307.102
Definitions.
For purposes of this part—
Agency
, as defined in 38 U.S.C. 4211(5), means any agency of the Federal Government or the District of Columbia, including any Executive agency as defined in section 105 of title 5, and the United States Postal Service and Postal Rate Commission.
Covered veterans
, as defined in 38 U.S.C. 4212(a)(3), means any of the following:
(1) Disabled veterans;
(2) Veterans who served on active duty in the Armed Forces during a war or in a campaign or expedition for which a campaign badge has been authorized;
(3) Veterans who, while serving on active duty with the Armed Forces, participated in a United States military operation for which an Armed Forces Service Medal (AFSM) was awarded pursuant to Executive Order 12985 (61 FR 1209); and
(4) Recently separated veterans.
Disabled veteran
, as defined in 38 U.S.C. 4211 means:
(1) A veteran who is entitled to compensation (or who, but for the receipt of military retired pay, would be entitled to compensation) under laws administered by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs; or
(2) A person who was discharged or released from active duty because of a service-connected disability.
Qualified
, as defined in 38 U.S.C. 4212(a)(3) with respect to employment in a position, means having the ability to perform the essential functions of the position with or without reasonable accommodation for an individual with a disability.
Recently separated veteran
, as defined in 38 U.S.C. 4211(6), means any veteran during the three-year period beginning on the date of such veteran's discharge or release from active duty.
Substantially continuous service
is defined in 5 CFR 315.201(b)(3).
War
means any armed conflict declared by Congress as such.
§ 307.103
Nature of VRAs.
VRAs are excepted appointments, made without competition, to positions otherwise in the competitive service. The veterans' preference procedures of part 302 of this chapter apply when there are preference eligible candidates being considered for a VRA.
Qualified covered veterans
who were separated
under honorable conditions
may be appointed to any position in the competitive service at grade levels up to and including GS-11 or equivalent, provided they meet the qualification standards for the position. To be eligible for a VRA as a
covered veteran
under paragraph (2) or (3) of the definition of that term in § 307.102, the veteran must be in receipt of the appropriate campaign badge, expeditionary medal, or AFSM. For purposes of a VRA, any military service is qualifying at the GS-3 level or equivalent. Upon satisfactory completion of 2 years of substantially continuous service, the incumbent's VRA must be converted to a career or career conditional appointment. An individual may receive more than one VRA appointment as long as the individual meets the definition of a
covered veteran
at the time of appointment.
§ 307.104
Treatment of individuals serving under VRAs.
(a) Because VRAs are made to positions otherwise in the competitive service, the incumbents, like competitive service employees, may be reassigned, promoted, demoted, or transferred in accordance with the provisions of part 335 of this chapter.
(b) A veteran with less than 15 years of education must receive training or education prescribed by the agency.
(c) Appointments are subject to investigation by OPM. A law, Executive
order, or regulation that disqualifies a person for appointment in the competitive service also disqualifies a person for a VRA.
(d) The Veterans Recruitment Appointment date for a
recently separated veteran
must occur before the end of the 3-year eligibility period and may not be extended.
§ 307.105
Appeal rights.
Individuals serving under VRAs have the same appeal rights as excepted service employees under parts 432 and 752 of this chapter. In addition, as established in § 315.806 of this chapter, any individual serving under a VRA, whose employment under the appointment is terminated within 1 year after the date of such appointment, has the same right to appeal that termination as a career or career-conditional employee has during the first year of employment.

§ 308.101
Definitions.
In this part:
Student
is an individual who is enrolled not less than half-time in a high school, trade school, technical or vocational institute, junior college, college, university or other accredited educational institution.

Volunteer Service
under the Act is limited to services performed by a student, with the permission of the institution at which the student is enrolled, as part of an agency program established for the purpose of providing educational experience for the student. Such service is to be uncompensated and will not be used to displace any employee or to staff a position which is a normal part of the agency's work force.
§ 308.102
Eligibility and status.
(a)
Minimum Age.
The selection of students to participate under the program should be in conformance with either Federal, State, or local laws and standards governing the employment of minors.
(b)
Status.

This regulation sets forth exceptions to the restrictions. When necessary to meet urgent needs resulting from an emergency posing an immediate threat to life or property, or a national emergency as defined in § 230.402(a)(1) of this title, a public official may employ relatives to meet those needs without regard to the restrictions on the employment of relatives in 5 U.S.C. 3110. Such appointments are temporary and may not exceed 30 days, but the agency may extend such an appointment for one additional 30-day period if the emergency need still exists at the time of the extension.

If the employee is restored to duty at a date later than the original adverse action, credit for intervening periods of nonpay status is given in accordance with other provisions of this subsection.

(1)

(2)

A person appointed under this section acquires competitive status automatically upon completion of probation.
(b)
Creditable overseas service.
For purposes of this section only, creditable service is service in an appropriated fund position(s) performed by a family member under a local hire appointment(s) overseas during the time the family member was accompanying a sponsor officially assigned to an overseas area and for which the family member received a fully successful or better (or equivalent) performance rating. Creditable overseas service is computed in accordance with the procedures in the OPM Guide to Processing Personnel Actions. Creditable service may have been under more than one appointment and need not be continuous. Leave without pay taken during the time an individual is in the overseas area is credited on the same basis as time worked.
(c)
Service waiver.
Up to 26 weeks of the 52-week service requirement is waived when the head of an agency (or designee) that employed the family member overseas certifies that the family member's expected 52 weeks of employment were cut short because of a nonpersonal situation that necessitated the relocation of the family member from the overseas area. The certification must include the number of weeks waived. For this purpose, a nonpersonal situation includes disaster, conflict, terrorism or the threat of terrorism, and those situations when
a family member is forced to return to the United States because of military deployment, drawdowns, or other management-initiated actions. A nonpersonal situation does not include circumstances that specifically relate to a particular individual, for example, ill health or personal interest in relocating.

# Subpart H—Probation on Initial Appointment to a Competitive Position
§ 315.801
Probationary period; when required.
(a) The first year of service of an employee who is given a career or career-conditional appointment under this part is a probationary period when the employee:
(1) Was appointed from a competitive list of eligibles established under subpart C of this part;
(2) Was reinstated under subpart D of this part unless during any period of service which affords a current basis for reinstatement, the employee completed a probationary period or served with competitive status under an appointment which did not require a probationary period.
(b) A person who is:
(1) Transferred under § 315.501; or
(2) Promoted, demoted, or reassigned; before he completed probation is required to complete the probationary period in the new position.
(c) A person who is reinstated from the Reemployment Priority List to a position in the same agency and the same commuting area does not have to serve a new probationary period, but, if separated during probation, is required to complete the probationary period in the new position.
(d) Upon noncompetitive appointment to the competitive service under the Postal Reorganization Act (39 U.S.C. 101
et seq.
), an employee of the Postal Career Service (including substitute and part-time flexible) who has not completed 1 year of Postal service, must serve the remainder of a 1-year probationary period in the new agency.
(e) A person who is appointed to the competitive service either by special appointing authority or by conversion under subparts F or G of this part serves a 1-year probationary period unless specifically exempt from probation by the authority itself.
[33 FR 12418, Sept. 4, 1968, as amended at 39 FR 962, Jan. 4, 1974; 45 FR 43365, June 27, 1980; 60 FR 54504, Oct. 16, 1995; 65 FR 14432, Mar. 17, 2000]
§ 315.802
Length of probationary period; crediting service.
(a) The probationary period required by § 315.801 is 1 year and may not be extended.
(b) Prior Federal civilian service (including nonappropriated fund service) counts toward completion of probation when the prior service:
(1) Is in the same agency, e.g., Department of the Army;
(2) Is in the same line of work (determined by the employee's actual duties and responsibilities); and
(3) Contains or is followed by no more than a single break in service that does not exceed 30 calendar days.
(c) Periods of absence while in a pay status count toward completion of probation. Absence in nonpay status while on the rolls (other than for compensable injury or military duty) is creditable up to a total of 22 workdays. Absence (whether on or off the rolls) due to compensable injury or military duty is creditable in full upon restoration to Federal service. Nonpay time in excess of 22 workdays extends the probationary period by an equal amount. An employee serving probation who leaves Federal service to become a volunteer with the Peace Corps or the Corporation for National and Community Service serves the remainder of the probationary period upon reinstatement provided the employee is reinstated within 90 days of termination of service as a volunteer or training for such service.
(d) The probationary period for part-time employees is computed on the basis of calendar time, in the same manner as for full-time employees. For intermittent employees,
i.e.,
those who do not have regularly scheduled tours of duty, each day or part of a day in pay status counts as 1 day of credit toward the 260 days in a pay status required for completion of probation. (However, the probationary period cannot be completed in less than 1 year of calendar time.)
[60 FR 53504, Oct. 16, 1995]
§ 315.803
Agency action during probationary period (general).
(a) The agency shall utilize the probationary period as fully as possible to determine the fitness of the employee and shall terminate his or her services during this period if the employee fails to demonstrate fully his or her qualifications for continued employment.
(b) Termination of an individual serving a probationary period must be taken in accordance with subpart D of part 752 of this chapter if the individual has completed one year of current continuous service under other than a temporary appointment limited to 1 year or less and is not otherwise excluded by the provisions of that subpart.
[73 FR 7187, Feb. 7, 2008, as amended at 85 FR 65982, Oct. 16, 2020; 87 FR 67782, Nov. 10, 2022]
§ 315.804
Termination of probationers for unsatisfactory performance or conduct.
(a) Subject to § 315.803(b), when an agency decides to terminate an employee serving a probationary or trial period because his work performance or conduct during this period fails to demonstrate his fitness or his qualifications for continued employment, it shall terminate his services by notifying him in writing as to why he is being separated and the effective date of the action. The information in the notice as to why the employee is being terminated shall, as a minimum, consist of the agency's conclusions as to the inadequacies of his performance or conduct.
(b) Probation ends when the employee completes his or her scheduled tour of duty on the day before the anniversary date of the employee's appointment. For example, when the last workday is a Friday and the anniversary date is the following Monday, the probationer must be separated before the end of the tour of duty on Friday since Friday would be the last day the employee actually has to demonstrate fitness for further employment.
[33 FR 12418, Sept. 4, 1988, as amended at 60 FR 53505, Oct. 16, 1995; 73 FR 7188, Feb. 7, 2008]
§ 315.805
Termination of probationers for conditions arising before appointment.
Subject to § 315.803(b), when an agency proposes to terminate an employee serving a probationary or trial period for reasons based in whole or in part on conditions arising before his appointment, the employee is entitled to the following:
(a)
Notice of proposed adverse action.
The employee is entitled to an advance written notice stating the reasons, specifically and in detail, for the proposed action.
(b)
Employee's answer.
The employee is entitled to a reasonable time for filing a written answer to the notice of proposed adverse action and for furnishing affidavits in support of his answer. If the employee answers, the agency shall consider the answer in reaching its decision.
(c)
Notice of adverse decision.
The employee is entitled to be notified of the agency's decision at the earliest practicable date. The agency shall deliver the decision to the employee at or before the time the action will be made effective. The notice shall be in writing, inform the employee of the reasons for the action, inform the employee of his right of appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB), and inform him of the time limit within which the appeal must be submitted as provided in § 315.806(d).
[33 FR 12418, Sept. 4, 1968, as amended at 73 FR 7188, Feb. 7, 2008]
§ 315.806
Appeal rights to the Merit Systems Protection Board.
(a)
Right of appeal.
An employee may appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board in writing an agency's decision to terminate him under § 315.804 or
§ 315.805 only as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section. The Merit Systems Protection Board review is confined to the issues stated in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.
(b)
On discrimination.
An employee may appeal under this paragraph a termination not required by statute which he or she alleges was based on partisan political reasons or marital status.
(c)
On improper procedure.
A probationer whose termination is subject to § 315.805 may appeal on the ground that his termination was not effected in accordance with the procedural requirements of that section.
(d) An employee may appeal to the Board under this section a termination that the employee alleges was based on discrimination because of race, color, religion, sex (including pregnancy and gender identity), national origin, age (as defined by the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, as amended), or disability. An appeal alleging a discriminatory termination may be filed under this subsection only if such discrimination is raised in addition to one of the issues stated in paragraph (b) or (c) of this section.

# Subpart I—Probation on Initial Appointment to a Supervisory or Managerial Position

# Source:
44 FR 44811, July 31, 1979, unless otherwise noted.
§ 315.901
Statutory requirement.
5 U.S.C. 3321 provides for “a period of probation . . . before initial appointment as a supervisor or manager becomes final.” It also says that a supervisor or manager “who does not satisfactorily complete the probationary period . . . shall be returned to a position of no lower grade and pay than the position from which the individual was transferred, assigned or promoted.” This subpart contains OPM regulations implementing those requirements of law.
§ 315.902
Definitions.
In this subpart
supervisory position
and
managerial position
have the meaning given them by the General Schedule Supervisory Guide.
[60 FR 53505, Oct. 16, 1995]
§ 315.903
Coverage.
This subpart applies to appointments and positions without time limitation in the competitive civil service. Agencies may, at their option, apply these provisions to time-limited appointments and positions. This subpart does not apply to appointments or positions in the Senior Executive Service.
§ 315.904
Basic requirement.
(a) An employee is required to serve a probationary period prescribed by the agency upon initial appointment to a supervisory and/or managerial position.
(b) An employee is required to complete a single probationary period in a supervisory position and a single probationary period in a managerial position, regardless of the number of agencies, occupations, or positions in which the employee serves. However, an agency may by regulation provide for exceptions to the probationary period for managers who have satisfactorily completed a probationary period for supervisors when justified on the basis of performance and experience.
(c) Employees who, as of the date this requirement is effective, are serving or have served in Federal civilian supervisory or managerial positions without time limitation, or in time-limited supervisory or managerial positions under an official assignment exceeding 120 days, are exempt from its provisions, except that supervisors who are assigned to managerial positions may, according to agency regulations, be required to serve a probationary period for managers.
§ 315.905
Length of the probationary period.
The authority to determine the length of the probationary period is delegated to the head of each agency, provided that it be of reasonable fixed duration, appropriate to the position, and uniformly applied. An agency may
establish different probationary periods for different occupations or a single one for all agency employees.
§ 315.906
Crediting service toward completion of the probationary period.
(a) An employee who is reassigned, transferred, or promoted to another supervisory or managerial position while serving a probationary period under this subpart is subject to the probationary period prescribed for the new position. Service in the former position counts toward completion of the probationary period in the new position. If the former position was supervisory and the new position managerial, service counts in the manner prescribed by agency regulation.
(b) Service on detail, temporary promotion, or reassignment to another supervisory or managerial position while serving probation is creditable toward completion of probation. Service in a nonsupervisory or nonmanagerial position is not creditable.
(c) Absence in nonpay status while on the rolls (other than for compensable injury or military duty) is creditable up to a total of 22 workdays. Absence (whether on or off the rolls) due to compensable injury or military duty is creditable in full upon restoration to Federal service. Nonpay time in excess of 22 workdays extends the probationary period by an equal amount.
(d) Service during a probationary period from which an employee was separated or demoted for performance or conduct reasons does not count toward completion of probation required under a subsequent appointment. In other situations in which an employee does not complete probation, service is creditable as determined by agency policy.
(e) Temporary service in a supervisory or managerial position under temporary appointment, promotion, or reassignment
prior to probation
is creditable as determined by agency policy. Prior service under a detail may be credited only when a detail to a supervisory or managerial position is made permanent without a break in service.
[44 FR 44811, July 31, 1979, as amended at 60 FR 53505, Oct. 16, 1995]
§ 315.907
Failure to complete the probationary period.
(a) Satisfactory completion of the prescribed probationary period is a prerequisite to continued service in the position. An employee who, for reasons of supervisory or managerial performance, does not satisfactorily complete the probationary period is entitled to be assigned, except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, to a position in the agency of no lower grade and pay than the one the employee left to accept the supervisory or managerial position.
(b) A nonsupervisory or nonmanagerial employee who is demoted into a position in which probation under § 315.904 is required and who, for reasons of supervisory or managerial performance, does not satisfactorily complete the probationary period is entitled to be assigned to a position at the same grade and pay as the position in which he or she was serving probation. The employee is eligible for repromotion in accordance with agency promotion policy.
(c) The agency must notify the employee in writing that he or she is being assigned in accordance with this section.
[49 FR 39287, Oct. 5, 1984, as amended at 60 FR 53505, Oct. 16, 1995]
§ 315.908
Appeals.
(a) An employee who, in accordance with the provisions of this subpart, is assigned to a nonmanagerial or nonsupervisory position, has no appeal right.
(b) An employee who alleges that an agency action under this subpart was based on partisan political affiliation or marital status, may appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board.
§ 315.909
Relationship to other actions.
(a) If an employee is required to concurrently serve both a probationary period under this subpart and a probationary period under subpart H of this part, the latter takes precedence and completion of the probationary period for competitive appointment and fulfills the requirements of this subpart.
(b) An action which demotes an employee to a lower grade than the one
the employee left to accept the supervisory or managerial position, and an action against an employee for reasons other than supervisory or managerial performance, is governed by part 432 or part 752 procedures, whichever is applicable. If the employee believes an action under this subpart was based on improper discrimination or other prohibited practices under 5 U.S.C. 2302, he or she may appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board or the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, as appropriate.

§ 316.301
Purpose and duration.
(a) An agency may make a term appointment for a period of more than 1 year but not more than 4 years to positions where the need for an employee's services is not permanent. Reasons for making a term appointment include, but are not limited to: project work, extraordinary workload, scheduled abolishment, reorganization, contracting out of the function, uncertainty of future funding, or the need to maintain permanent positions for placement of employees who would otherwise be displaced from other parts of the organization.

# Subpart D—Temporary Limited Employment

# Editorial Note:
Nomenclature changes to subpart D of part 316 appear at 70 FR 72067, Dec. 1, 2005.
§ 316.401
Purpose and duration.
(a)
Appropriate use.
An agency may make a temporary limited appointment—
(1) To fill a short-term position (
i.e.,
one that is not expected to last longer than 1 year);
(2) To meet an employment need that is scheduled to be terminated within the timeframe set out in paragraph (c) of this section for such reasons as abolishment, reorganization, or contracting of the function, anticipated reduction in funding, or completion of a specific project or peak workload; or
(3) To fill positions on a temporary basis when the positions are expected to be needed for placement of permanent employees who would otherwise be displaced from other parts of the organization.
(b)
Certification of appropriate use.
The supervisor of each position filled by temporary appointment must certify that the employment need is truly temporary and that the proposed appointment meets the regulatory time limits. This certification may constitute appropriate documentation of compliance with the limits set out in paragraph (c) of this section. The reason(s) for making a temporary limited appointment must be stated on the form documenting each such appointment.
(c)
Time limits—general.
(1) An agency may make a temporary appointment for a specified period not to exceed 1 year. The appointment may be extended up to a maximum of 1 additional year (24 months of total service). Appointment to a successor position (
i.e.,
to a position that replaces and absorbs the position to which an individual was originally appointed) is considered to be an extension of the original appointment. Appointment to a position involving the same basic duties and in the same major subdivision of the agency and same local commuting area as the original appointment is also considered to be an extension of the original appointment.
(2) An agency may not fill a position by temporary appointment if that position has previously been filled by temporary appointment(s) for an aggregate of 2 years, or 24 months, within the preceding 3-year period.
(d)
Exceptions to general time limits.
(1) Agencies may make and extend temporary appointments to positions involving intermittent or seasonal work
without regard to the requirements in paragraph (c) of this section,
provided
that:
(i) Appointments and extensions are made in increments of 1 year or less.
(ii) Employment in the same or a successor position under this and any other appointing authority totals less than 6 months (1,040 hours), excluding overtime, in a service year. The service year is the calendar year that begins on the date of the employee's initial appointment in the agency. Should employment in a position filled under this exception total 6 months or more in any service year, the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section will apply to subsequent extension or reappointment unless OPM approves continued exception under this section. An individual may be employed for training for up to 120 days following initial appointment and up to 2 weeks a year thereafter without regard to the service year limitation.
(2) OPM will authorize exceptions to the limits set out in paragraph (c) of this section only when necessitated by major reorganizations or base closings or other unusual circumstances. Requests based on major reorganization, base closing, restructuring, or other unusual circumstances that apply agencywide must be made by an official at the headquarters level of the Department or agency. Requests involving extension of appointments to a specific position or project based on other unusual circumstances may be submitted by the employing office to the appropriate OPM service center.

(b)
Noncompetitive temporary appointments.
In accordance with the time limits in § 316.401, an agency may give a noncompetitive temporary appointment, without regard to the requirements of parts 332 and 333 of this chapter, to an individual who is qualified for the position and who is eligible for:
(1) Reinstatement under § 315.401 of this chapter;
(2) Veterans recruitment appointment under § 307.103 of this chapter. Temporary limited appointments under this section are permitted only at the grade levels authorized for VRA appointments. Such appointments are not VRA appointments and do not lead to conversion to career-conditional appointment;
(3) Career-conditional appointment under § 315.601, 315.604, 315.605, 315.606, 315.607, 315.608, 315.609, 315.612, 315.703, or 315.711 of this chapter;
(4) Appointment under 5 U.S.C. 3112 (veterans with compensable service-connected disability of 30 percent of more). The disability must be documented by a notice of retirement or discharge due to service-connected disability from active military service dated at any time, or by a notice of compensable disability rating from the Department of Veterans Affairs, dated 1991 or later;
(5) Appointment under 31 U.S.C. 732(g) for current and former employees of the General Accounting Office;
(6) Appointment under 28 U.S.C. 602 for current and former employees of the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts;
(7) Reappointment on the basis of being a former temporary employee of the agency who was originally appointed from a certificate of eligibles or under the provisions of part 333 of this chapter. An agency may not reappoint a former temporary employee if the individual has already served the maximum time allowed in § 316.401 or if the position has been filled under temporary appointment for the maximum time allowed in § 316.401. Reappointment must be to the same position or another position appropriate for temporary appointment with the same qualification requirements;
(8) Reappointment on the basis of being a former temporary employee who was originally appointed from a certificate of eligibles or under the provisions of part 333 of this chapter and who sustained a compensable injury while serving on the temporary appointment. Reappointment must be to
the same position or another position appropriate for temporary appointment with the same qualification requirements. If the compensable injury disqualifies the former individual from performing such a position, reappointment may be to any position for which the individual is qualified. Reappointment must be for a minimum of 120 days.
(c)
Extension of temporary appointments.
An individual who receives a valid temporary appointment will be eligible for an extension in accordance with § 316.401 even if his or her eligibility for noncompetitive appointment expires or is lost during the authorized period of temporary employment.

Designation of provisional appointments.
(a)
Conditions for designation.

(1) Noncompetitive temporary appointments of disabled veterans under § 316.402(b)(5), when the appointments are intended to afford eligibility for conversion in accordance with § 315.707 of this chapter and section 3112 of title 5, United States Code;
(2) Temporary appointments of nurses in the Department of Veterans Affairs, when the appointments are made under the provisions of section 4114 of title 38, United States Code, with the intention of converting the appointees to continuing appointments as soon as the appointees obtain required State certification or registration and/or the agency completes necessary verification of references;

# Source:
86 FR 46107, Aug. 18, 2021, unless otherwise noted.
§ 316.901
Appointment authority.
In accordance with the provisions of this section, an agency may make a time-limited appointment of an eligible and qualified post-secondary student, to any position in the competitive service, at the General Schedule (GS) 11 level or below (or equivalent), without regard to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 3309 through 3319 and 3330. An agency may appoint an individual for an initial period not to exceed 1 year, or for an initial period expected to last more than 1 year but less than 4 years, in accordance with §§ 316.401(c)(1) and 316.301(a) and (b), respectively, to coincide with the individual's academic curriculum. In either case an agency may extend or seek extension from OPM, as appropriate in accordance with this part, of an initial appointment for a period that will allow the post-secondary student to complete his or her academic requirements leading to the awarding of a degree or certificate, as appropriate.
§ 316.902
Eligibility.
A post-secondary student means an individual who:
(a) Is enrolled or accepted for enrollment in an institution of higher education as defined by the Higher Education Act of 1965, in a section codified at 20 U.S.C.1001(a); and
(b) Is pursuing a baccalaureate or graduate degree on at least a part-time basis, as determined by the institution of higher education; and
(c) Meets the minimum qualification standards prescribed or approved by OPM for the position to which the individual is being appointed.

Qualifications.
Agencies must evaluate eligible post-secondary students using the government-wide OPM prescribed minimum qualification standard or an OPM-approved agency-specific qualification standard for the position being filled.
§ 316.904
Classification.
Post-secondary student positions under the General Schedule or appropriate pay plan must be classified to the -99 series of the appropriate occupational group. Federal Wage System positions filled under the authority in this subpart must be classified to the -01 series of the appropriate occupational group.

§ 316.905
Public notification.
An agency must adhere to merit system principles and thus must provide public notification in a manner that recruits qualified individuals from appropriate sources in an endeavor to draw from all segments of society, before filling a position under the authority in this subpart. An agency may, but is not required to, use USAJOBS for this purpose. If the agency does not use USAJOBS to meet the requirements in this section, it must, at a minimum, publicly display information about the position to be filled on its public facing home page. An agency may, alternatively, provide an actual job announcement on its public facing home page or provide a link to the job announcement on its public facing home page. The agency should consider whether additional recruitment and advertisement activities are necessary or appropriate to further merit system principles. A job announcement must include, at a minimum, the following information:
(a) The position title, series, grade level;
(b) The geographic location where the position will be filled;
(c) The starting salary of the position;
(d) The minimum qualifications of the position;
(e) Whether the individual in the position will be eligible for promotion to higher grade levels;
(f) The time-limit applicable to the position, and in the case of a term appointment the vacancy announcement must state that the agency has the option of extending the term appointment up to the 4-year limit (if applicable);
(g) The potential for conversion to the agency's permanent workforce;
(h) Any other relevant information about the position such as telework opportunities, recruitment incentives, etc.; and
(i) Specific information instructing applicants on how to apply for the position.
§ 316.906
Acquisition of competitive status.
Time spent on a time-limited appointment under this part may count toward fulfillment of a probation period in accordance with § 315.802(b) of this chapter. A student appointed under § 316.901 acquires competitive status only upon completion of probationary period after any conversion, in accordance with the provisions of 5 CFR part 315, subpart H.
§ 316.907
Tenure upon appointment.
An individual appointed under § 316.901 becomes a career-conditional employee upon completion of academic requirements and noncompetitive conversion to a permanent appointment in accordance with § 316.910, unless the individual has already satisfied the requirements for career tenure or is exempt from the service requirement pursuant to § 315.201 of this chapter.
§ 316.908
Breaks in program.
A break in program is defined as a period of time when a student is working for the agency but is unable to go to school, or is neither attending classes nor working for the agency. An agency may use its discretion in either approving or denying a request for a break in program.
§ 316.909
Promotion.
An agency may promote a student appointed for an initial period expected to last more than 1 year but less than 4 years provided the student meets the qualification requirements for the higher graded position, time in grade requirements in 5 CFR part 300, subpart F, and the public notification for the position filled by the student stated the potential for promotion and specified a career ladder.
§ 316.910
Conversion.
An agency may convert a student serving in an appointment under the authority in this subpart, prior to the expiration date of the appointment, to a permanent position in the competitive service within the agency without further competition if the student:

§ 316.911
Reduction in force.
(a)
Reduction in force.
Post-secondary students are covered by part 351 of this chapter for purposes of reduction in force (RIF).
(1) Students whose initial appointment was for a period of 1 year or less are not assigned a tenure group and do not compete with other employees in a RIF.
(2) Students whose initial appointment was for a period expected to last more than 1 year are placed in Tenure Group III for purposes of part 351 of this chapter.
(b) [Reserved]
§ 316.912
Termination.
(a) Any appointment made under the authority in this subpart expires on the not-to-exceed date of that appointment unless the agency extends the appointment prior to expiration.
(b) An agency must terminate any student without regard to any provision of 5 U.S.C. chapter 35 or 75, who:
(1) Does not maintain eligibility in accordance with §§ 316.902 and 316.910; or
(2) Is not converted in accordance with § 316.910.
§ 316.913
Numerical limit on the number of appointments.
(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the total number of students that an agency may appoint under this section during a fiscal year may not exceed the number equal to 15 percent of the number of students the agency head appointed during the previous fiscal year to a position at the GS-11 level or below (or equivalent). An appointing agency may not count appointments made using direct hire authorities, non-competitive authorities, excepted service authorities other than Pathways Internship Program appointments under § 213.3402(a) of this chapter and 5 CFR part 362, subpart B, or selections under merit promotion authorities, when establishing the limit for a given fiscal year.
(b) OPM may establish a lower limitation on the number of students that may be appointed by an agency under paragraph (a) of this section during a fiscal year based on any factor OPM considers appropriate. OPM shall notify agencies via the OPM website and other venues (such as the Chief Human Capital Officer's Council) of any changes to the numerical limitation, applicable governmentwide. Changes to the numerical limit for an individual agency will be communicated directly to the agency.
§ 316.914

Except as otherwise provided by law, the Office of Personnel Management shall determine the date on which conversions under this authority shall become effective. Generally, this will be no later than six months following the effective date of the statutory action extending coverage under 5 U.S.C. 3132(a)(1).

(c)
Employees excluded.
The following employees are excluded from coverage of this subpart and are not entitled to conversion to the Senior Executive Service.
(1) An employee in a position designated as Senior Executive Service who is serving under a time limited appointment which will terminate before the operational date of the Senior Executive Service.

§ 317.401
General.
(a) The head of each agency is responsible for establishing qualifications standards for Senior Executive Service (SES) positions in accordance with the procedures described in this subpart.
(b) A written qualification standard must be established for a position before any appointment is made to the position. If a position is being filled competitively, the standard must be established before the position is announced.
[54 FR 9758, Mar. 8, 1989, as amended at 60 FR 6385, Feb. 2, 1995]
§ 317.402
Career reserved positions.
(a) The qualifications standard must be in writing and identify the breadth and depth of the professional/technical and executive/managerial knowledges, skills, and abilities, or other qualifications, required for successful performance in the position.
(b) The standard must be specific enough to enable applicants to be rated and ranked according to their degree of qualifications when the position is being filled on a competitive basis.
(c) Each qualifications criterion in the standard must be job related. The standard may not emphasize agency-related experience, however, to the extent that it precludes otherwise well-qualified candidates from outside the agency from appointment consideration.
(d) The standard may not include—
(1) A minimum length of experience requirement beyond that authorized for similar positions in the General Schedule;
(2) A minimum education requirement beyond that authorized for similar positions in the General Schedule; or
(3) Any criterion prohibited by law or regulation.
§ 317.403

§ 317.404
Retention of qualifications standards.
If a qualifications standard is changed, or a position is cancelled, the former standard shall be retained for 2 years.

# Subpart E—Career Appointments

# Source:
54 FR 9758, Mar. 8, 1989, unless otherwise noted.
§ 317.501
Recruitment and selection for initial SES career appointment be achieved from the brightest and most diverse pool possible.
(a)
Executive Resources Board (ERB).
The head of each agency shall appoint one or more ERBs from among employees of the agency or commissioned officers of the uniformed services serving on active duty in the agency. The ERB shall, in accordance with the requirements of this section, conduct the merit staffing process for initial SES career appointment.
(b)
Recruitment.
(1) As a minimum, the source of recruitment to fill a SES position by career appointment must include all groups of qualified individuals within the civil service (as defined by 5 U.S.C. 2101). It may also include qualified individuals outside the civil service.
(2) Before an agency can fill an SES vacancy by career appointment, it must post a vacancy announcement in USAJOBS for at least 14 calendar days, including the date of publication. Each agency's SES vacancy announcement must comply with criteria in § 330.707 of subpart G of this chapter.
(c)
Merit staffing requirements.
As a minimum, agencies must—
(1) Provide that competition be fair and open, that all candidates compete and be rated and ranked on the same basis, and that selection be based solely on qualifications and not on political or other non-job-related factors. If a candidate is a current SES career appointee or an SES reinstatement eligible, an agency may consider the candidate either competitively or noncompetitively.
(2) Provide that the ERB consider the executive and technical qualifications of each candidate, other than those found ineligible because they do not meet the requirements of the vacancy announcement. Preliminary qualifications screening, rating, and ranking of candidates may be delegated by the ERB.
(3) Provide that the rating procedures sufficiently differentiate among eligible candidates on the basis of the knowledges, skills, abilities, and other job-related factors in the qualifications standard for the position so as to enable the relative ranking of the candidates. For this purpose, eligible candidates may be grouped into broad categories, such as highly qualified, well qualified, and qualified. Numerical rating and ranking are not required.
(4) Provide that the record be adequately documented to show the basis of qualifications, rating, and ranking determinations.
(5) Provide that the ERB make written recommendations to the appointing authority on the eligible candidates and identify the best qualified candidates. Rating sheets may be used to satisfy the written recommendation requirement for individual candidates, but the ERB must certify in writing the list of candidates to the appointing authority.
(6) Provide that the appointing authority select from among the candidates identified as best qualified by the ERB and certify the candidate's executive and technical qualifications.
(7) Provide that the appointing authority or the ERB certify in writing that appropriate merit staffing procedures were followed.
(d)
Retention of documentation.
Agencies must keep such documentation as OPM prescribes for 2 years to permit reconstruction of merit staffing actions.
(e)
Applicant inquiries and appeals.
Individuals are entitled to obtain information from an agency regarding the process used to recruit and select candidates for career appointment to SES positions. Upon request, applicants must be told whether they were considered qualified for the position and whether they were referred for appointment consideration. Also, they may have access to questionnaires or other written material regarding their own qualifications, except for material that would identify a confidential source. There is no right of appeal by applicants to OPM on SES staffing actions taken by ERBs, Qualifications Review Boards, or appointing authorities.
(f)
OPM review.
OPM may review proposed career appointments to ensure that they comply with all merit staffing requirements and are free of any impropriety. An agency shall take such action as OPM may require to correct an action contrary to any law, rule, or regulation.
[54 FR 9758, Mar. 8, 1989, as amended at 58 FR 58261, Nov. 1, 1993; 60 FR 6385, Feb. 2, 1995; 65 FR 33740, May 25, 2000; 66 FR 63906, Dec. 11, 2001]
§ 317.502
Qualifications Review Board certification.
(a) A Qualification Review Board (QRB) convened by OPM must certify the executive/managerial qualifications of a candidate before initial career appointment may be made to an SES position. More than one-half of the members of a QRB must be SES career appointees.
(b) Agency requests for certification of a candidate by a QRB must contain such information as prescribed by OPM, including evidence that merit staffing procedures were followed and that the appointing authority has certified the candidate's qualifications for the position.
(c) Qualifications Review Board certification of executive qualifications must be based on demonstrated executive experience; successful completion of an OPM-approved candidate development program; or possession of special or unique qualities that indicate a likelihood of executive success. Any existing time limit on a previously approved certification is removed.
(d) OPM may determine the disposition of agency QRB requests where the QRB has not yet acted if the agency head leaves office or announces an intention to leave office, if the President has nominated a new agency head, or if there is a Presidential transition.
(e) An action to convert a “noncareer-type” employee to a career SES appointment in the employee's current position or a successor to that position will not be forwarded to a QRB. A “noncareer-type” employee includes a noncareer SES appointee, a Schedule C appointee, or equivalent.
(f) A new QRB certification is required for an individual to be reappointed as an SES career appointee following separation of the individual from an SES career appointment if:
(1) The individual was removed during the SES probationary period for performance or disciplinary reasons; or
(2) The individual completed an SES probationary period, or did not have to serve one, and was removed for a reason that made the individual ineligible for reinstatement to the SES under subpart G of this part.
[54 FR 9758, Mar. 8, 1989, as amended at 56 FR 170, Jan. 3, 1991; 60 FR 6385, Feb. 2, 1995; 61 FR 46533, Sept. 4, 1996; 65 FR 33740, May 25, 2000]
§ 317.503
Probationary period.
(a) An individual's initial appointment as an SES career appointee becomes final only after the individual has served a 1-year probationary period as a career appointee; there has been an assessment of the appointee's performance during the probationary period; and the appointing authority, or his or her designee, has certified that the appointee performed at the level of
excellence expected of a senior executive during the probationary period.
(b) When a career appointee's executive qualification have been certified by a Qualifications Review Board on the basis of special or unique qualities, as described in § 317.502(c), the probationary assessment must address any executive development activities the agency identified in support of the request for QRB certification.
(c) The probationary period begins on the effective date of the personnel action initially appointing the individual to the SES as a career appointee and ends one calendar year later.
(d) The following conditions apply to crediting service towards completion of the probationary period.
(1) Time on leave with pay while in an SES position is credited. Earned leave for which the employee is compensated by lump-sum payment upon separation is not credited.
(2) Time in a nonpay status while in an SES position is credited up to a total of 30 calendar days (or 22 workdays). After 30 calendar days, the probationary period is extended by adding to it time equal to that served in a nonpay status.
(3) Time absent on military duty or due to compensable injury is credited upon restoration to the SES when no other break in SES service has occurred.
(4) Time following transfer to an SES position in another agency is credited,
i.e.,
the individual does not have to start a new probationary period.
(e) Removal of a career appointee during the probationary period is covered by subpart D of part 359 of this chapter.
(f) A career appointee who resigns or is removed from the SES before completion of the probationary period may not receive another SES career appointment unless selected under SES merit staffing procedures. The individual, however, need not be recertified by a QRB unless the individual was removed for performance or disciplinary reasons.
(g) An individual who separated from the SES during the probationary period and who has been out of the SES more than 30 calendar days must serve a new 1-year probationary period upon reappointment and may not credit previous time in a probationary period. In the following situations, however, there is an exception and the individual is only required to complete the remainder of the previously served probationary period.
(1) The individual left the SES without a break in service for a Presidential appointment and is exercising reinstatement rights under 5 U.S.C. 3593(b).

As provided for in §§ 317.702 and 317.703, an agency may reinstate a former SES career appointee without regard to the merit staffing requirements established by OPM in § 317.501(c).
§ 317.702
General reinstatement: SES career appointees.

Eligibility for general reinstatement.
A former SES career appointee who meets the following conditions is eligible for reinstatement under this section:
(1) The individual completed an SES probationary period under a previous SES career appointment or was exempted from that requirement; and
(2) The individual's separation from his or her last SES career appointment was not a removal under subpart C of part 359 of this chapter for failure to be recertified as a senior executive; or a removal under subpart E of part 359 of this chapter for less than fully successful executive performance; or under 5 U.S.C. 1207 by order of the Merit Systems Protection Board as a result of a disciplinary action initiated by the Special Counsel under 5 U.S.C. 1206; or under 5 U.S.C. 7532 (National Security); or under subpart F of part 752 of this chapter for misconduct, neglect of duty, or malfeasance; or a resignation after receipt of a notice proposing or directing removal under any of the above conditions. Removal for failure to accept a directed reassignment to another commuting area, or to accompany a position in a transfer of function to another commuting area, does not preclude reinstatement to the SES unless the appointment to the original position included acceptance of a written nationwide mobility agreement or policy.
(b)
Applying for reinstatement; time limit.
Application for reinstatement under this section shall be made directly to the agency in which SES employment is sought. There is no time limit for reinstatement under this section.
(c)

(2) If an individual is serving under a Presidential appointment with reinstatement entitlement and receives another Presidential appointment without a break in service between the two appointments, the individual continues to be entitled to be reinstated to the SES following termination of the second appointment. If there is an interim period between the two Presidential appointments, the individual must be reinstated as an SES career appointee before the effective date of the second appointment to preserve reinstatement entitlement following termination of the second appointment.
(b)
Applying for reinstatement; time limit.
Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, an application in writing for reinstatement under this section must be made to OPM within 90
days after separation from the Presidential appointment. An application may be submitted as soon as the Presidential appointee's resignation is requested or submitted.

Directing reinstatement.
(1) To the extent practicable, OPM will direct reinstatement within 45 days of the date of receipt by OPM of the application for reinstatement or the date of separation from the Presidential appointment, whichever is later.

(ii) The successor agency to the one in which the individual last served as an SES career appointee;
(iii) The agency or agencies in which the individual served as a Presidential appointee; or
(iv) Any other agency in the Executive branch with positions under the SES.

(4) When directing the reinstatement of a Presidential appointee, OPM may, as appropriate, allocate an additional SES space authority to the agency.
(5) When a Presidential appointee tenders his or her resignation, voluntarily or upon request, the agency in which the Presidential appointment was held, upon approval by OPM, may place the appointee as an interim measure on an SES limited term or limited emergency appointment as appropriate, pending reinstatement, to preclude a break in service after the Presidential appointment has terminated.
(6) To preserve reinstatement rights under this section, an individual who has been serving in a presidential appointment, if selected by the President for another appointment in the same or a new agency, must be reinstated to an appropriate position as an SES career appointee before the effective date of the new Presidential appointment, unless service as a Presidential appointee would be continuous.
(d)
Reinstatement following direct negotiations with an agency.
(1) A Presidential appointee who qualifies under paragraph (a) of this section may initiate direct negotiations with an agency regarding reinstatement under this section.
(2) An agency may voluntarily reinstate a former Presidential appointee without an order from OPM directing such action.
(3) The agency is responsible for assigning the individual to a position for which he or she meets the qualification requirements.
(4) Direct negotiations with an agency do not extend the time limit stated in paragraph (b) of this section for making application to OPM.
(5) OPM may, when appropriate and upon request by the agency, allocate an additional SES space authority to an agency that voluntarily reinstates a former Presidential appointee under this paragraph.
(6) An individual who is reinstated under this paragraph because of direct negotiations with an agency is not entitled to further assistance by OPM.

Tenure upon reinstatement.
(1) An individual reinstated under § 317.703 becomes an SES career appointee.
(2) An individual reinstated under § 317.703 who was serving an SES probationary period at the time of his or her Presidential appointment is required to complete the 1-year SES probationary period upon reinstatement.
(f)
Compliance.
(1) An agency must comply with an order to reinstate issued by OPM under this section as promptly as possible, but not more than 30 calendar days from the date of the order.
(2) The agency will notify OPM of a reinstatement action taken under this section within 5 workdays of the effective date of the reinstatement.
(3) An individual who declines a reinstatement ordered by OPM is not entitled to further placement assistance by OPM under this section.

# Subpart I—Reassignments, Transfers, and Details

# Source:
54 FR 9760, Mar. 8, 1989, unless otherwise noted.
§ 317.901
Reassignments.
(a) In this section,
reassignment
means a permanent assignment to another SES position within the employing executive agency or military department. (See 5 U.S.C. 105 for a definition of “executive agency” and 5 U.S.C. 102 for a definition of “military department.”)
(b) A career appointee may be reassigned to any SES position for which qualified in accordance with the following conditions:
(1)
Reassignment within a commuting area.
For reassignment within a commuting area, the appointee must receive a written notice at least 15 days before the effective date of the reassignment. This notice requirement may be waived only when the appointee consents in writing.
(2)
Reassignment outside of a commuting area.
For reassignment outside of a commuting area, (i) the agency must consult with the appointee on the reasons for, and the appointee's preferences with respect to, the proposed reassignment; and (ii) following such consultation, the agency must provide the appointee a written notice, including the reasons for the reassignment, at least 60 days before the effective date of the reassignment. This notice requirement may be waived only when the appointee consents in writing.
(c) A career appointee may not be involuntarily reassigned within 120 days after the appointment of the head of an agency, or within 120 days after the appointment of the career appointee's most immediate supervisor who is a noncareer appointee and who has the authority to make an initial appraisal of the career appointee's performance under subpart C of part 430 of this chapter.
(1) In this paragraph—
(i)
Head of an agency
means the head of an executive or military department or the head of an independent establishment.
(ii)
Noncareer appointee

(2) These restrictions do not apply to the involuntary reassignment of a career appointee under 5 U.S.C. 4314(b)(3) based on a final performance rating of “Unsatisfactory” that was issued before the appointment of a new agency head or a new noncareer supervisor as defined in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. If a moratorium is already underway at the time the final rating is issued, then that moratorium must be completed before the reassignment action can be effected.
(3) A voluntary reassignment during the 120-day period is permitted, but the appointee must agree in writing before the reassignment.
(4) For the purpose of calculating the 120-day period, any days, not to exceed a total of 60, during which the career appointee is serving on a detail or other temporary assignment apart from the appointee's regular position shall not be counted. Any days in excess of 60 days on one or more details or other temporary assignments shall be counted.
(5) The prohibition in this paragraph on involuntary reassignments may be applied by an agency, at its discretion, in the case of a detail of an individual as the head of an agency or of a noncareer appointee as a supervisor, or when a noncareer appointee in a deputy position is acting as the agency head or in a vacant supervisory position. If the individual later receives a permanent appointment to the position without a break in service, the 120-day moratorium initiated by the permanent appointment shall include any days spent in the position on an acting basis.
(d) A 15 or 60-day advance notice described in paragraph (b) of this section may be issued during the 120-day moratorium on the involuntary reassignment of a career appointee described in paragraph (c) of this section, but an involuntary reassignment may not be effected until the moratorium has ended.

In this section,
detail
means the temporary assignment of an SES member to another position (within or outside of the SES) or the temporary assignment of a non-SES member to an SES position, with the expectation that the employee will return to the official position of record upon expiration of the detail. For purposes of pay and benefits, the employee continues to encumber the position from which detailed. The provisions of this section cover details within or outside of the employing agency.

(i) A non-SES employee to an SES position that supervises other SES positions; or
(ii) An SES employee to a position at the GS-15 or equivalent level or below.
(c)
SES career reserved positions.

# Subpart B—Reemployment Priority List (RPL)
§ 330.201
Purpose.
(a) The Reemployment Priority List (RPL) is a required component of an agency's placement programs to assist its current and former competitive service employees who will be or were separated by reduction in force (RIF) under part 351 of this chapter, or who have recovered from a compensable work-related injury after more than 1 year, as required by part 353 of this chapter. In filling vacancies, an agency must give its RPL registrants placement priority for most competitive service vacancies before hiring someone from outside its own permanent competitive service workforce. An agency may choose to consider RPL placement priority candidates before other agency permanent competitive service employees under its Career Transition Assistance Plan (CTAP) established under subpart F of this part, after fulfilling agency obligations to its CTAP selection priority candidates.
(b) Agencies must use an RPL to give placement priority to their:
(1) Current competitive service employees with a specific notice of RIF separation or a Certification of Expected Separation issued under part 351 of this chapter;
(2) Former competitive service employees separated by RIF under part 351 of this chapter; and
(3) Former competitive service employees fully recovered from a compensable injury (as defined in part 353 of this chapter) after more than 1 year.
(c) All agency components within the local commuting area use a single RPL and are responsible for giving placement priority to the agency's RPL registrants.
(d) With prior OPM approval, an agency may operate an alternate placement program which satisfies the basic requirements of this subpart, including veterans' preference, as an exception to the RPL regulations under this subpart. This provision is limited to reemployment priority because of RIF separation and allows agencies to adopt different placement strategies that are effective for their programs and satisfy employee entitlements to reemployment priority.
§ 330.202
Definitions.

§ 330.203
RPL Eligibility.
An employee must meet the conditions in either paragraph (a) or (b) of this section to be an RPL eligible.
(a) For eligibility based on part 351 of this chapter, the employee:
(1) Must be serving in an appointment in the competitive service in tenure group I or II;
(2) Must have received either a specific notice of separation or a Certification of Expected Separation under part 351 of this chapter that has not been cancelled, rescinded, or modified so that the employee is no longer under notice of separation;
(3) Must have received a rating of record of at least fully successful (Level 3) or equivalent as the most recent performance rating of record; and
(4) Must not have declined an offer under part 351, subpart G, of this chapter of a position with the same type of work schedule and with a representative rate at least as high as that of the position from which the employee will be separated.

(1) Must be serving in, or separated from, an appointment in the competitive service in tenure group I or II;
(2) Must either have accepted a position at a lower grade or pay level in lieu of separation or have been separated because of a compensable injury or disability.

(3) Must have fully recovered more than 1 year after compensation began; and
(4) Must have received notification from the Office of Workers' Compensation Programs, Department of Labor, that injury compensation benefits have ceased or will cease.
§ 330.204
Agency requirements and responsibilities.
(a) An agency must establish policies and maintain an RPL for each local commuting area in which the agency has RPL eligibles.
(b) An agency must give each RPL eligible information about its RPL program, including Merit Systems Protection Board appeal rights under § 330.214, when:
(1) The agency issues a RIF separation notice or a Certification of Expected Separation under part 351 of this chapter; or
(2) The employee accepts a position at a lower grade or pay level or is separated from the agency because of a compensable work-related injury.
(c) An agency must register an RPL eligible on the appropriate RPL no later than 10 calendar days after receiving the eligible's written application.
(d) Agencies must include in their RPL policies established under this subpart how they will assist RPL eligibles who:
(1) Request an RPL application;
(2) Request help in completing the RPL application; and
(3) Request help in identifying and listing on the RPL application those positions within the agency for which they are qualified and interested.
(e) An agency must give RPL registrants placement priority for personnel actions as described in § 330.210.
(f) An agency must not remove an individual from the RPL under § 330.209(a)(1), (b)(1), or (b)(2) without evidence (such as a Postal Service return receipt signed by addressee only) showing that the offer, inquiry, or scheduled interview was made in writing. The written offer, inquiry, or scheduled interview must clearly state that failure to respond will result in removal from the RPL for positions at that grade or pay level and for positions at lower grades and pay levels for which registered.
§ 330.205
Agency RPL applications.
Agencies may develop their own application format which must, at a minimum:
(a) Allow an RPL eligible to register for positions at the same representative rate and work schedule (full-time, part-time, seasonal, or intermittent) as the position from which the RPL eligible was, or will be, separated; and
(b) Allow an RPL eligible to specify the conditions under which he or she will accept a position, including grades or pay levels, appointment type (permanent or time-limited), occupations (e.g., position classification series or career groups), and minimum number of hours of work per week, as applicable.
§ 330.206
RPL registration timeframe and positions.
(a) To register, an RPL eligible must:
(1) Meet the eligibility conditions under § 330.203(a) or (b);
(2) Complete an RPL application prescribed by the current or former agency and keep the agency informed of any significant changes in the information provided; and
(3) Submit the RPL application on or before the RIF separation date or, if an RPL eligible under § 330.203(b), within 30 calendar days after the:
(i) Date injury compensation benefits cease; or
(ii) Date the Department of Labor denies an appeal for continuation of injury compensation benefits.
(b) RPL eligibles may register and receive placement priority for positions for which they are qualified and that:
(1) Have a representative rate no higher than the position from which they were, or will be, separated unless the eligible was demoted as a tenure group I or II employee in a previous RIF. If the eligible was so demoted, the eligible can register for positions with a representative rate up to the representative rate of the position held on a permanent appointment immediately before the RIF demotion was effective;
(2) Have no greater promotion potential than the position from which they were, or will be, separated; and
(3) Have the same type of work schedule as the position from which they were, or will be, separated.
§ 330.207
Registration area.
(a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section, RPL registration is limited to the local commuting area in which the eligible was, or will be, separated.
(b) If the agency has, or will have, no competitive service positions remaining in the local commuting area from which the RPL eligible will be separated under part 351 of this chapter, the agency may designate a different local commuting area where there are continuing positions for the RPL eligible to exercise placement priority. The
agency has sole discretion over whether to offer this option and which local commuting area to designate, taking into consideration the size and locations of its workforce, available vacancies, and available funds.
(c) If the RPL eligible agreed to transfer with his or her function under part 351 of this chapter but will be separated by RIF from the gaining competitive area, registration is limited to the RPL covering the gaining competitive area's local commuting area.
(d) For an individual who is eligible under § 330.203(b), registration is initially limited to the RPL covering the local commuting area of the position from which the employee was separated. The agency must establish a fair and consistent policy that permits RPL eligibles to expand their registration to available local commuting areas mutually acceptable to the RPL eligible and the agency, up to agency-wide as required by 5 U.S.C. 8151. (For example, an agency could consider the number and location(s) of its positions and funding availability when establishing its policies on expanding consideration.) In lieu of expanded registration, the agency policy may provide for the RPL eligible to elect to receive placement priority for the next best available position in the former local commuting area.
(e) If the RPL eligible was, or will be, separated from an overseas position (
see
part 301 of this chapter), RPL registration is limited to the local commuting area in which the eligible was, or will be, separated, unless:
(1) The agency approves a written request by the RPL eligible for registration in the local commuting area from which employed for overseas service, or in another area within the United States that is mutually acceptable to the eligible and the agency; or
(2) The agency has a formal program for rotating employees between overseas areas and the United States, and the RPL eligible's preceding and prospective overseas service would exceed the maximum duration of an overseas duty tour in the rotation program. In this case, the eligible may register for a local commuting area within the United States that is mutually acceptable to the eligible and the agency.
§ 330.208
Duration of RPL registration.
(a) RPL registration expires 2 years from the date of reduction in force separation under part 351 of this chapter, or 2 years from the date the agency registers the RPL eligible because of recovery from a compensable work injury under § 330.206(a)(3)(i) or (ii). An RPL eligible remains registered for the full 2-year period unless the registrant is removed from the RPL for a reason specified in § 330.209.
(b)(1) OPM may extend the registration period when an RPL eligible does not receive a full 2 years of placement priority, for example, because of an agency's administrative or procedural error.
(2) Either the agency or the RPL eligible may request OPM to extend the registration period under paragraph (b)(1) of this section. The request must describe the administrative or procedural error that caused the RPL eligible to be registered for less than the full 2-year period. OPM may request additional information either from the agency or the RPL eligible in connection with any such request. OPM will notify both the agency and the RPL eligible of the decision to approve or deny an extension request. OPM's decision regarding an extension request is not subject to appeal under § 330.214.
§ 330.209
Removal from an RPL.
(a) An RPL registrant is removed from the RPL at all registered grades or pay levels if the registrant:
(1) Declines or fails to reply to the agency's inquiry about an RPL offer of a career, career-conditional, or excepted appointment without time limit for a position having the same type of work schedule and a representative rate at least as high as the position from which the registrant was, or will be, separated;
(2) Receives a written cancellation, rescission, or modification to:
(i) The RIF separation notice or Certification of Expected Separation so that the employee no longer meets the conditions for RPL eligibility in § 330.203(a); or
(ii) The notification of cessation of injury compensation benefits so that injury compensation benefits continue;
(3) Separates from the agency for any other reason (such as retirement, resignation, or transfer) before the RIF separation effective date. Registration continues if the RPL registrant retires on or after the RIF separation effective date. This paragraph does not apply to an RPL registrant under § 330.203(b);
(4) Requests the agency to remove his or her name from the RPL;
(5) Is placed in a position without time limit at any grade or pay level within the agency;
(6) Is placed in a position under a career, career-conditional, or excepted appointment without time limit at any grade or pay level in any agency; or
(7) Leaves the area covered by an overseas RPL (see 5 CFR part 301) or is ineligible for continued overseas employment because of previous service or residence.
(b) An RPL registrant is removed from the RPL at registered grades or pay levels with a representative rate at and below the representative rate of a position offered by the agency if the offered position is below the last grade or pay level held and the registrant:
(1) Declines or fails to reply to the agency's inquiry about an RPL offer of a career, career-conditional, or excepted appointment without time limit for a position meeting the acceptable conditions shown on the RPL registrant's application; or
(2) Declines or fails to appear for a scheduled interview.
(c) An RPL registrant removed from the RPL under paragraph (b) of this section at lower grades or pay levels than the last grade or pay level held remains on the RPL for positions with a representative rate higher than the offered position up to the grade or pay level last held, unless registration expires or otherwise terminates.
(d) Declination of time-limited employment does not affect RPL eligibility.
§ 330.210
Applying RPL placement priority.
(a) RPL placement priority applies to:
(1) Permanent and time-limited positions to be filled by competitive service appointment; and
(2) The grade or pay level at which the agency fills the position. If a position is available at multiple grades or pay levels, placement priority applies at the grade or pay level at which the position is ultimately filled.
(b) An agency must not effect a permanent or time-limited competitive service appointment of another individual if there is an RPL placement priority candidate registered for the vacancy, unless the action is listed as an exception in § 330.211.
(c) An agency must document that there are no RPL placement priority candidates for the vacancy when requesting a competitive certificate of eligibles under part 332 of this chapter. Similarly, an agency must offer the vacancy to any RPL placement priority candidate(s) before effecting an appointment under a noncompetitive appointing authority, such as under part 315 of this chapter.
(d) Once an agency has ensured there are no RPL placement priority candidates for a particular vacancy and documents in writing an employment offer that is accepted by another individual, the agency may fulfill that employment offer to that individual.
§ 330.211
Exceptions to RPL placement priority.
An agency may effect the following personnel actions as exceptions to § 330.210:
(a) Fill a vacancy with an employee of the agency's current permanent competitive service workforce through detail or position change, subject to the requirements of subpart F of this part;
(b) Appoint a 10-point preference eligible through an appropriate appointing authority;
(c) Appoint a current or former employee exercising restoration rights under part 353 of this chapter based on return from military service or recovery from a compensable injury or disability within 1 year;
(d) Appoint a current or former employee exercising other statutory or regulatory reemployment rights;
(e) Fill a specific position when all RPL placement priority candidates decline an offer of the position or fail to
respond to a written agency inquiry about their availability;
(f) Convert an employee serving under an appointment that provides noncompetitive conversion eligibility to a competitive service appointment, including from:
(1) A Veterans Recruitment Appointment under part 307 of this chapter;
(2) An appointment under 5 U.S.C. 3112 and part 316 of this chapter of a veteran with a compensable service-connected disability of 30 percent or more; and
(3) An excepted service appointment under part 213 of this chapter;
(g) Reappoint without a break in service to the same position currently held by an employee serving under a temporary appointment of 1 year or less (only to another temporary appointment not to exceed 1 year or less);
(h) Extend an employee's temporary or term appointment up to the maximum permitted by the appointment authority or as authorized by OPM; or
(i) Appoint an individual under an excepted service appointing authority.
[75 FR 67593, Nov. 3, 2010, as amended at 77 FR 28215, May 11, 2012]
§ 330.212
Agency flexibilities.
An agency may provide the following flexibilities within its written RPL policies established under this subpart:
(a) Allow RPL eligibles to register only for certain sub-areas of a local commuting area when the agency has components dispersed throughout a large commuting area. However, an agency cannot deny registration throughout the local commuting area if the RPL eligible requests it.
(b) Suspend an RPL registration for all positions, permanent and time-limited, if the agency is unable, through documented written means, to contact the RPL registrant; however, the agency must reactivate an RPL registration when the registrant submits an updated application or otherwise requests reactivation in writing. Registration suspension and reactivation do not change the expiration date of the original registration period set in § 330.208.
(c)(1) Modify the OPM or OPM-approved qualification standard used to determine if an RPL eligible is qualified for a position, provided the:
(i) Exception is applied consistently and equitably in filling a position;
(ii) RPL registrant meets any minimum educational requirements for the position; and
(iii) RPL registrant has the capacity, adaptability, and special skills needed to satisfactorily perform the duties and responsibilities of the position, as determined by the agency.
(2) Any modification to the qualification standard under paragraph (c)(1) of this section does not authorize a waiver of the selection order required under § 330.213.
(d) Permit RPL eligibles to register for positions with work schedules different from the work schedule of the position from which they were, or will be, separated.
(e) Permit RPL registrants to update their qualifications or conditions for accepting positions during the RPL registration period. If an agency provides this flexibility in its RPL policies, the agency must update the RPL registrant's registration information within 10 calendar days of receipt of the registrant's written request. The updated registration information would apply only to those vacancies becoming available after the agency updates the RPL registrant's registration.
§ 330.213
Selection from an RPL.
(a)
Methods.
An agency must adopt one of the selection methods in paragraphs (b), (c), or (d) of this section for a single RPL. The agency may adopt the same method for each RPL it establishes or may vary the method by location, but it must adopt a written policy for each RPL it establishes and maintains. While an agency may not vary the method used for an individual vacancy, it may at any time change the selection method for all positions covered by a single RPL.
(b)
Retention standing order.
For each vacancy to be filled, the agency places qualified RPL placement priority candidates in tenure group and subgroup order in accordance with part 351 of this chapter. In making a selection, an agency may not pass over a candidate in tenure group I to select from tenure
group II and, within a tenure group, may not pass over a candidate in a higher subgroup to select from a lower subgroup. Within a subgroup, an agency may select any candidate without regard to order of retention standing.
(c)
Numerical scoring.
(1) For each vacancy to be filled, the agency rates RPL placement priority candidates according to their job experience and education. The agency must use job-related evaluation criteria for the position to be filled that can distinguish differences in qualifications measured and must apply the criteria in a fair and consistent manner. The agency assigns the candidates a numerical score of at least 70 on a scale of 100, based on the evaluation criteria developed under this paragraph. The agency must grant 5 additional points to veterans' preference eligibles under 5 U.S.C. 2108(3)(A) and (B), and 10 additional points to veterans' preference eligibles under 5 U.S.C. 2108(3) (C) through (G).
(2) RPL placement priority candidates with an eligible numerical score are ranked in the following order:
(i) Veterans' preference eligibles having a compensable service-connected disability of 10 percent or more in the order of their augmented ratings, unless the position to be filled is a professional or scientific position at or above the GS-9 level, or equivalent; and
(ii) All other candidates in the order of their augmented ratings. At each score, candidates entitled to 10-point veterans' preference will be entered ahead of all other candidates, and those entitled to 5-point veterans' preference will be entered ahead of those candidates not entitled to veterans' preference.
(3) The agency must make its selection from among the highest three candidates available and may not pass over a veterans' preference eligible to select a nonpreference eligible.
(d)
Alternative rating and selection.
(1) For each vacancy to be filled, the agency may use alternative rating and selection procedures (also called category rating) as described in 5 U.S.C. 3319 and part 337 of this chapter. The agency assesses RPL placement priority candidates against job-related evaluation criteria and then places them into two or more pre-defined quality categories.
(2) To use this method, the agency must:
(i) Establish a system for evaluating RPL placement priority candidates that provides for two or more quality categories;
(ii) Define each quality category through job analysis conducted in accordance with the “Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures” at 29 CFR part 1607 and part 300 of this chapter. Each quality category must have a clear definition that distinguishes it from other quality categories; and
(iii) Place candidates into the appropriate quality categories based upon their job-related competencies, knowledge, skills, and abilities.
(3) Veterans' preference must be applied as prescribed in 5 U.S.C. 3319(b) and (c)(2). Veterans' preference points as prescribed in paragraph (c)(1) of this section are not applied under this method.
(4) The agency must make its selection from the highest quality category in accordance with its category rating policy established under part 337 of this chapter.
(e)
Application-based procedure.
(1) An agency may adopt an application-based procedure which allows RPL registrants to apply directly for RPL placement priority under an advertised vacancy announcement. Before using this procedure, the agency must establish policies and procedures for:
(i) Informing RPL registrants of available vacancies;
(ii) Informing RPL registrants of acceptable application formats, including how to permanently change initial registration information and how to apply changes only to the specific vacancy announcement for which the application is made;
(iii) Determining the method under which the RPL registrant will be rated and ranked (paragraph (b), (c), or (d) of this section); and
(iv) Informing each RPL registrant who applies under this method whether he or she was determined to be an RPL placement priority candidate and the outcome of the selection process, if the candidate was referred for selection.
(2) RPL registrants may not be removed from the RPL for failure to apply for a vacancy under this paragraph. Registration continues until it expires or the registrant is removed from the RPL under § 330.209.
§ 330.214
Appeal rights.
An RPL registrant who believes the agency violated his or her reemployment rights under this subpart by employing another person who otherwise could not have been appointed properly may appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board under the Board's regulations in part 1200 of this chapter.
Subpart C [Reserved]

# Subpart D—Positions Restricted to Preference Eligibles
§ 330.401
Restricted positions.
Under 5 U.S.C. 3310, competitive examinations for the positions of custodian, elevator operator, guard, and messenger (referred to in this subpart as
restricted positions
) are restricted to preference eligibles as long as a preference eligible is available. For more information on these restricted positions, refer to the OPM Delegated Examining Operations Handbook.
§ 330.402
Exceptions to restriction.
(a) An agency may fill a restricted position with a nonpreference eligible under the following circumstances:
(1) By competitive examination when no preference eligible applies;
(2) By position change (promotion, demotion, or reassignment) to a position in the organizational entity (
i.e.,
the part of an agency from which selections are normally made for promotion or reassignment to the position in question) in which the nonpreference eligible is employed;
(3) By reemployment in the agency where the nonpreference eligible was formerly employed when he or she is being appointed from the Reemployment Priority List under subpart B of this part;
(4) By reinstatement in the agency where the nonpreference eligible was formerly employed when he or she was last separated because of disability retirement; or
(5) By reappointment of certain temporary employees as provided for in part 316 of this chapter.
(b) Except as indicated in paragraph (a) of this section, OPM must authorize any other agency noncompetitive action (e.g., under an authority specified in part 315 of this chapter) to fill a restricted position with a nonpreference eligible.
§ 330.403
Positions brought into the competitive service.
An agency may convert the appointment of a nonpreference eligible whose restricted position was brought into the competitive service under part 316 of this chapter, and who meets the requirements for conversion under part 315 of this chapter, to career or career conditional appointment.
§ 330.404
Displacement of preference eligibles occupying restricted positions in contracting out situations.
An individual agency and OPM both have additional responsibilities when the agency decides, in accordance with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-76, to contract out the work of a preference eligible who holds a restricted position. These additional responsibilities as described in §§ 330.405 and 330.406 are applicable if a preference eligible holds a competitive service position (other than in the Government Printing Office) that is:
(a) A restricted position as designated in 5 U.S.C. 3310 and § 330.401; and
(b) In tenure group I or II, as defined in § 351.501(b)(1) and (2) of this chapter.
§ 330.405
Agency placement assistance.
An agency that separates a preference eligible from a restricted position by reduction in force under part 351 of this chapter because of a contracting out situation covered in § 330.404 must, consistent with § 330.603, advise the employee of the opportunity to participate in available career transition programs. The agency is also responsible for:
(a) Applying OMB's policy directives on the preference eligible's right of
first refusal for positions that are contracted out to the private sector; and
(b) Cooperating with State units as designated or created under title I of the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 to retrain displaced preference eligibles for other continuing positions.
§ 330.406
OPM placement assistance.
OPM's responsibilities include:
(a) Assisting agencies in operating positive placement programs, such as the Career Transition Assistance Plan, which is authorized by subpart F of this part;
(b) Providing interagency selection priority through the Interagency Career Transition Assistance Plan, which is authorized by subpart G of this part; and
(c) Encouraging cooperation between local Federal activities to assist these displaced preference eligibles in applying for other Federal positions, including positions with the U.S. Postal Service.
§ 330.407
Eligibility for the Interagency Career Transition Assistance Plan.
(a) A preference eligible who is separated from a restricted position by reduction in force under part 351 of this chapter because of a contracting out situation covered in § 330.404 has interagency selection priority under the Interagency Career Transition Assistance Plan, which is authorized by subpart G of this part.
(b) A preference eligible covered by this subpart is eligible for the Interagency Career Transition Assistance Plan for 2 years following separation by reduction in force from a restricted position.

# Subpart E—Restrictions To Protect Competitive Principles
§ 330.501
Purpose.
The restrictions in this subpart are designed to prevent circumvention of the open competitive examination system defined in Civil Service Rule 1.3 (5 CFR 1.3). These restrictions limit an appointee's immediate movement to another position after appointment from a competitive certificate of eligibles.
§ 330.502
General restriction on movement after competitive appointment.
(a) An agency must wait at least 90 days after an employee's latest nontemporary competitive appointment before the agency may take the following actions:
(1) Promote an employee;
(2) Transfer, reinstate, reassign, or detail an employee to a different position; or
(3) Transfer, reinstate, reassign, or detail an employee to a different geographical area.
(b) Upon written request from an agency, OPM may waive the restriction against movement to a different geographical area when moving such an employee is consistent with open competition principles.
§ 330.503
Ensuring agency compliance with the principles of open competition.
OPM will review appointments made from competitive examinations and subsequent position changes to determine if agencies are complying with open competition principles. The fact that an agency waited 90 days to make the changes, as required under this subpart, is not an absolute protection. If OPM finds that an agency has not complied with these principles, either in an individual instance or on a program-wide basis, OPM will order an agency to correct the situation.
§ 330.504
Exception to the general restriction.
The restrictions in this subpart do not apply to a person who is eligible for a competitive appointment from a certificate of eligibles under part 332 of this chapter.

# Subpart F—Agency Career Transition Assistance Plan (CTAP) for Local Surplus and Displaced Employees
§ 330.601
Purpose.
(a) An agency's Career Transition Assistance Plan (CTAP) provides intra-
agency selection priority for the agency's eligible surplus and displaced employees. This subpart sets forth minimum requirements for agency plans and establishes requirements for CTAP selection priority.
(b) Consistent with these regulations and at their discretion, an agency may supplement these requirements to expand career transition opportunities to its surplus and displaced workers.
(c) With prior OPM approval, an agency may operate an alternate placement program that satisfies the basic requirements of this subpart as an exception to CTAP selection priority under this subpart. This provision allows agencies to adopt different placement strategies that are effective for their programs while satisfying employee entitlements to selection priority.
§ 330.602
Definitions.
For purposes of this subpart:
Agency
means an Executive agency as defined in 5 U.S.C. 105.
CTAP eligible

(ii) Received a RIF notice of separation under part 351 of this chapter or a notice of proposed removal under part 752 of this chapter for declining a directed geographic relocation outside the local commuting area (e.g., a directed reassignment or a change in duty station).
Vacancy
means a vacant competitive service position at grade GS-15 (or equivalent) or below to be filled for a total of 121 days or more, including all extensions, regardless of whether the agency issues a specific vacancy announcement.
§ 330.603

(a) An agency must define what constitutes a well-qualified candidate for its specific vacancies, consistent with this subpart, and uniformly apply that definition to all CTAP eligibles being considered for the vacancy.
(b) An agency must conduct an independent second review and document the specific job-related reasons whenever a CTAP eligible is determined to
be not well-qualified under the agency's definition. The agency must give the CTAP eligible the written results of this review as required by § 330.608(e).
§ 330.606
Minimum criteria for agency definition of “well-qualified”.
(a) At a minimum, the agency must define “well-qualified” as having knowledge, skills, abilities, and/or competencies clearly exceeding the minimum qualification requirements for the vacancy. The agency definition may or may not equate to the highly or best qualified assessment criteria established for the vacancy; however, the agency definition of “well-qualified” must satisfy the criteria in paragraph (b) of this section.
(b) Under an agency's definition of “well-qualified,” the agency must be able to determine whether a CTAP eligible:
(1) Meets the basic eligibility requirements (including employment suitability requirements under part 731 of this chapter and any medical qualifications requirements), qualification standards (including minimum educational and experience requirements), and any applicable selective factors;

§ 330.607
Applying CTAP selection priority.
(a) An agency must not place any other candidate from within or outside the agency into a vacancy if there is an available CTAP selection priority candidate, unless the personnel action to be effected is an exception under § 330.609.
(b) In accordance with the conditions of part 300, subpart E, of this chapter, an agency may not procure temporary help services under that subpart until a determination is made that no CTAP eligible is available.
(c) CTAP selection priority applies to a vacancy that:
(1) Is at a grade or pay level with a representative rate no higher than the representative rate of the grade or pay level of the CTAP eligible's permanent position of record;
(2) Has no greater promotion potential than the CTAP eligible's permanent position of record;
(3) Is in the same local commuting area as the CTAP eligible's permanent position of record;
(4) Is filled during the CTAP eligible's eligibility period; and, if applicable,
(5) Is filled under the same excepted appointing authority as the CTAP eligible's permanent position of record if the CTAP eligible is an excepted service employee and the agency CTAP provides selection priority in the excepted service.
(d) An agency may take actions under § 335.102 of this chapter to place a permanent competitive service employee into a vacancy if there are no CTAP eligible employees in the local commuting area or if no CTAP eligibles apply for the vacancy.
(e) An agency component may place a component employee within the local commuting area in the vacancy after the component applies CTAP selection priority to its employees.
(f) If there are two or more CTAP selection priority candidates for a vacancy, the agency may place any of them. An agency may decide the specific order of selection among CTAP selection priority candidates. For example, an agency may:
(1) Provide a displaced candidate higher priority than a surplus candidate; or
(2) Provide an internal component candidate higher priority than another component's candidate.
(g) After an agency makes the vacancy available to its CTAP eligibles and meets its obligation to any CTAP selection priority candidates, the agency may place into the vacancy any other permanent competitive service candidate from within its workforce, under appropriate staffing procedures.
(h) An agency may provide CTAP selection priority to eligible employees from another commuting area after fulfilling its obligation to CTAP selection priority candidates in the local commuting area.
(i) An agency may deny a CTAP eligible future selection priority if the eligible:
(1) Declines an offer of a permanent appointment at any grade or pay level in the competitive or excepted service; or
(2) Fails to respond within a reasonable period of time, as defined by the agency, to an offer of a permanent appointment at any grade or pay level in the competitive or excepted service.
(j) Before appointing an individual from outside the agency's permanent competitive service workforce, the agency must follow the requirements of subparts B and G of this part.
§ 330.608
Other agency CTAP responsibilities.
(a) An agency must make a career transition orientation session available to all agency surplus and displaced employees with information on selection priority under this subpart and subparts B and G. Such orientation sessions may be in person or web-based through an agency automated training system or intranet.
(b) An agency must give each agency CTAP eligible written information on selection priority under its plan, explaining how to locate and apply for agency vacancies and request selection priority. The agency may meet this requirement by providing a copy of its CTAP established under § 330.603.
(c) An agency must take reasonable steps to ensure that agency CTAP eligibles have access to information on all vacancies, including how CTAP eligibles can apply, what proof of eligibility is required, and the agency definition of “well-qualified” for the vacancy.

# Subpart G—Interagency Career Transition Assistance Plan (ICTAP) for Displaced Employees
§ 330.701
Purpose.
The Interagency Career Transition Assistance Program (ICTAP) provides eligible displaced Federal employees with interagency selection priority for vacancies in agencies that are filling positions from outside their respective permanent competitive service workforces. The ICTAP selection priority does not apply in the ICTAP eligible's current or former agency and it does not prohibit movement of permanent competitive service employees within an agency, as permitted by subpart F of this part. This subpart establishes requirements for ICTAP selection priority.
§ 330.702
Definitions.
In this subpart:
Agency
means an Executive agency as defined in 5 U.S.C. 105.
Displaced
describes an individual in one of the following categories:
(1) A current career or career-conditional (tenure group I or II) competitive service employee of any agency at grade GS-15 (or equivalent) or below whose current performance rating of record is at least fully successful (Level 3) or equivalent and who:
(i) Received a reduction in force (RIF) separation notice under part 351
of this chapter and has not declined an offer under part 351, subpart G, of this chapter of a position with the same type of work schedule and a representative rate at least as high as that of the position from which the employee will be separated; or
(ii) Received a notice of proposed removal under part 752 of this chapter for declining a directed geographic relocation outside the local commuting area (e.g., a directed reassignment or a change in duty station).
(2) A former career or career-conditional (tenure group I or II) competitive service employee of any agency at grade GS-15 (or equivalent) or below whose last performance rating of record was at least fully successful (Level 3) or equivalent who was either:
(i) Separated by RIF under part 351 of this chapter and did not decline an offer under part 351, subpart G, of this chapter of a position with the same type of work schedule and a representative rate at least as high as that of the position from which the employee was separated; or
(ii) Removed under part 752 of this chapter for declining a directed geographic relocation outside the local commuting area (e.g., a directed reassignment or a change in duty station).

ICTAP eligible
means an individual who meets the definition of
displaced.
As used in this subpart, “ICTAP eligible” and “eligible” are synonymous.
ICTAP selection priority candidate
means an ICTAP eligible who applied for a vacancy, was determined by the agency to be well-qualified for that vacancy, and who the agency must select over any other candidate from outside the agency's current competitive service workforce for the vacancy, unless the action to be taken is listed as an exception under § 330.707.
Vacancy
means a vacant competitive service position at grade GS-15 (or equivalent) or below to be filled for 121 days or more, including extensions.
§ 330.703
Agency responsibilities for deciding who is well-qualified.
(a) Agencies must define “well-qualified” for their specific vacancies, consistent with this subpart, and uniformly apply that definition to all ICTAP eligibles being considered for the vacancy.
(b) Agencies must conduct an independent second review and document the specific job-related reasons whenever an ICTAP eligible is determined to be not well-qualified for the vacancy under the agency's definition. An agency must give the ICTAP eligible the written results of this review as required by § 330.706(d).
§ 330.704
Minimum criteria for agency definition of “well-qualified”.
(a) At a minimum, agencies must define “well-qualified” as having knowledge, skills, abilities, and/or competencies clearly exceeding the minimum qualification requirements for the vacancy. The agency definition may or may not equate to the highly or best qualified assessment criteria established for the vacancy; however, the agency definition of “well-qualified” must satisfy the criteria in paragraph (b) of this section.
(b) Under an agency's definition of “well-qualified,” the agency must be able to determine whether an ICTAP eligible:
(1) Meets the basic eligibility requirements (including employment suitability requirements under part 731 of this chapter and any medical qualification requirements), qualification standards (including minimum educational and experience requirements), and any applicable selective factors;
(2) Is physically qualified, with or without reasonable accommodation, to perform the essential duties of the position;
(3) Meets any special qualifying conditions of the position;
(4) Is able to satisfactorily perform the duties of the position upon entry; and
(5) At agency discretion, either:
(i) Rates at or above specified level(s) on all quality ranking factors; or
(ii) Rates above minimally qualified in the agency's rating and ranking process.
§ 330.705
Applying ICTAP selection priority.
(a) An agency must not appoint any candidate from outside its permanent competitive service workforce if there is an ICTAP selection priority candidate available for the vacancy, unless the personnel action to be effected is an exception under § 330.707.
(b) ICTAP selection priority applies to a vacancy that:
(1) Is at a grade or pay level with a representative rate no higher than the representative rate of the grade or pay level of the ICTAP eligible's current or last permanent position of record;
(2) Has no greater promotion potential than the ICTAP eligible's current or last permanent position of record;
(3) Is in the same local commuting area as the ICTAP eligible's current or last permanent position of record; and
(4) Is filled during the ICTAP eligible's eligibility period.
(c) An agency may appoint any ICTAP selection priority candidate for a vacancy.
(d)(1) After an agency announces the vacancy and meets its obligation to any ICTAP selection priority candidates, the agency may appoint any other candidate from outside its current permanent competitive service workforce, under appropriate staffing procedures.
(2) An agency may make additional selections or reissue selection certificates in accordance with its merit promotion program without readvertising for ICTAP eligibles only if the additional selections are made from the applicant pool established by the original vacancy announcement, including readvertisements for the same vacancy, under which ICTAP eligibles had an opportunity to apply.
(e) An agency may deny an ICTAP eligible future selection priority for vacancies in that agency if the ICTAP eligible:
(1) Declines an offer of a permanent appointment at any grade or pay level in the competitive or excepted service; or
(2) Fails to respond within a reasonable period of time, as defined by the agency, to an offer or official inquiry of availability for a permanent appointment at any grade or pay level in the competitive or excepted service.
(f) An agency may deny an ICTAP eligible future selection priority for a position previously obtained through ICTAP if the eligible was terminated or removed from that position under part 432 or 752 of this chapter.
§ 330.706
Other agency ICTAP responsibilities.
(a) Before appointing any other candidate from outside the agency's permanent competitive service workforce,
the agency must first fulfill its obligation to any employees entitled to selection priority under subparts B and F of this part.
(b) In accordance with the conditions of part 300, subpart E, of this chapter, an agency may not procure temporary help services under that subpart until a determination is made that no ICTAP eligible is available.
(c) An agency must announce all vacancies it intends to fill from outside its permanent competitive service workforce. Vacancy announcements must meet the requirements of subpart A of this part.
(d) An agency must provide an ICTAP eligible who applied for a specific vacancy written notice of the final status of his or her application, including whether the eligible was determined to be well-qualified. The agency notice must include the results of the independent second review under § 330.703(b), if applicable; whether another ICTAP selection priority candidate was hired; whether the position was filled under an exception listed in § 330.707; and whether the recruitment was cancelled.
§ 330.707

(f) ICTAP eligibility for a former Military Reserve Technician or National Guard Technician described in § 330.702 ends when the Technician no longer receives the special disability retirement annuity under 5 U.S.C. 8337(h) or 8456.
§ 330.709
Establishing ICTAP selection priority.
ICTAP selection priority for a specific vacancy begins when:
(a) The ICTAP eligible submits all required application materials, including proof of eligibility, within agency-established timeframes; and
(b) The agency determines the eligible is well-qualified for the vacancy.
§ 330.710
Proof of eligibility.
(a) The ICTAP eligible must submit a copy of one of the documents listed under paragraphs (1) or (3) through (6) of the definition of
displaced

# Subpart J—Prohibited Practices
§ 330.1001
Withdrawal from competition.
An applicant for competitive examination, an eligible on a register, and an officer or employee in the executive branch of the Government may not persuade, induce, or coerce, or attempt to persuade, induce, or coerce, directly or indirectly, a prospective applicant to withhold filing application, or an applicant or eligible to withdraw from competition or eligibility, for a position in the competitive service, for the purpose of improving or injuring the prospects of an applicant or eligible for appointment. OPM will cancel the application or eligibility of an applicant or eligible who violates this section, and will impose such other penalty as it considers appropriate.
Subparts K-L [Reserved]

# Subpart M—Timing of Background Investigations

# Source:
88 FR 60329, Sept. 1, 2023, unless otherwise noted.
§ 330.1300
Timing of suitability inquiries in competitive hiring.
(a) A hiring agency may not make specific inquiries concerning an applicant's credit background of the sort asked on the OF-306, Declaration for Federal Employment, or other forms used to conduct suitability investigations for Federal employment (
i.e.,
inquiries into an applicant's adverse credit history) unless the hiring agency has made a conditional offer of employment to the applicant. Agencies may make inquiries into an applicant's Selective Service registration, military service, citizenship status, where applicable, or previous work history, prior to making a conditional offer of employment to an applicant.
(b) However, in certain situations, agencies may have a business need to obtain information about the credit background of applicants earlier in the hiring process to determine if they meet the qualifications requirements or are suitable for the position being filled. If so, agencies must request an exception from the Office of Personnel Management in order to determine an applicant's ability to meet qualifications or suitability for Federal employment prior to making a conditional offer of employment to the applicant(s). OPM will grant exceptions only when the agency demonstrates specific job-related reasons why the agency needs to evaluate an applicant's adverse credit history earlier in the process. OPM will consider such factors as, but not limited to, the nature of the position being filled and whether a clean credit history record would be essential to the ability to perform one of the duties of the position effectively. OPM may also consider positions for which the expense of completing the examination makes it appropriate to review an applicant's credit background at the outset of the process (e.g., a position that requires that an applicant complete a rigorous training regimen and pass an examination based
upon the training before the applicant's selection can be finalized). A hiring agency must request and receive an OPM-approved exception prior to issuing public notice for a position for which the agency will collect credit background information prior to completion of the assessment process and the making of a conditional offer of employment.
§ 330.1301
Suitability inquiries regarding criminal history.
Agency inquiries regarding criminal history must be done in accordance with the requirements under chapter 92 of title 5, U.S. Code and part 920 of this chapter.

§ 332.314
[Reserved]

# Restoration of Eligibility
§ 332.321
Preference eligibles who resigned from competitive positions.
A qualified preference eligible who resigned without delinquency or misconduct from career or career-conditional employment is entitled to have his name reentered on each register on which his name formerly appeared (or on a successor register) if he applies within 90 days after separation.
§ 332.322
Persons who lost eligibility because of military service.
(a) A person who lost a period of eligibility on a register because he has served on active military duty since June 30, 1950, is entitled to have his name restored to that register or a successor register when he meets the following conditions:
(1) He has not served more than four years following the date of his entrance on active military duty, exclusive of any additional service imposed pursuant to law. The date of entrance on duty means the first date between June 30, 1950, and July 1, 1971, on which he began a new period of active military duty, whether it was by original entry, reentry or extension.
(2) He is honorably separated from active military duty.
(3) He applies for restoration of eligibility within 90 days after discharge from active military duty or from hospitalization continuing for 1 year or less following separation from active military duty.
(4) He is still qualified to perform the duties of the position for which the register is used.
(b) When a person is entitled to have his name restored to a register under paragraph (a) of this section, OPM shall enter his name at the top of the appropriate group on the register if another eligible standing lower on the register on which his name formerly appeared was given a career or career-conditional appointment from that register. For professional and scientific positions in GS-9 and above and in comparable pay levels under other pay-fixing authorities, all eligibles are in one group. For all other positions, preference eligibles with a compensable service-connected disability of 10 percent or more are in one group and all other eligibles in another.
(c) When there is no appropriate existing register, OPM may establish special registers containing the names of persons entitled to priority of certification under paragraph (b) of this section, together with the names of eligibles described in § 332.311, and use these registers for certification to fill appropriate vacancies.

# Subpart D—Consideration for Appointment
§ 332.401
Order on registers.
Subject to apportionment, residence, and other requirements of law and this chapter, OPM shall enter the names of eligibles on the appropriate register in accordance with their numerical ratings, except that the names of:
(a) Preference eligibles shall be entered in accordance with their augmented ratings and ahead of others having the same rating; and
(b) Preference eligibles who have a compensable service-connected disability of 10 percent or more shall be entered at the top of the register in the order of their ratings unless the register is for professional or scientific positions in GS-9 and above and in comparable pay levels under other pay-fixing authorities.
§ 332.402
Referring candidates for appointment.
OPM or a Delegated Examining Unit (DEU) will refer candidates for consideration by simultaneously listing a candidate on all certificates for which the candidate is interested, eligible, and within reach, except that, when it is deemed in the interest of good administration and candidates have been so notified, OPM or a DEU may choose to refer candidates for only one vacancy at a time. Selecting officials will receive sufficient names, when available, to allow them to consider at least 3 candidates for each vacancy.
[67 FR 7056, Feb. 15, 2002]
§ 332.403
Selective certification.
When there is no register appropriate as a whole for the certification of eligibles for a particular position, OPM may prepare a certificate from the most nearly appropriate existing register by the selective certification of eligibles qualified for the particular position in the order of their ranking on the register. Special overseas selection factors may also be used as a basis for selective certification from a register used for filling overseas positions.
When appropriate, OPM may rerate the eligibles on the register on the basis of the particular requirements of the position.
§ 332.404
Order of selection from certificates.
An appointing officer, with sole regard to merit and fitness, shall select an eligible for:
(a) The first vacancy from the highest three eligibles on the certificate who are available for appointment; and
(b) The second and each succeding vacancy from the highest three eligibles on the certificate who are unselected and available for appointment.
§ 332.405
Three considerations for appointment.
An appointing officer is not required to consider an eligible who has been considered by him for three separate appointments from the same or different certificates for the same position.
§ 332.406
Objections to eligibles.
(a)
Delegated authority.
Except as specified in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section, OPM has delegated to agencies the authority to adjudicate objections to eligibles, including pass over requests.
(1) OPM retains exclusive authority to approve the sufficiency of an agency's request to pass over preference eligibles who are thirty percent (30%) or more compensably disabled. Such persons have the right, in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 3318, to respond to the pass over request before OPM makes a final decision.
(2) OPM also retains the exclusive authority to approve the sufficiency of an agency's reasons to medically disqualify or medically pass over a preference eligible or disabled veteran in certain circumstances, in accordance with part 339 of this chapter.
(3) An agency must refer any objection (including a pass over request) that is based on material, intentional false statement or deception or fraud in examination or appointment to OPM for a suitability action where warranted, under part 731 of this chapter.
(b)
Standard for objections.
An agency is not required to consider an individual for a position when an objection to (including a request to pass over) the particular individual is sustained or granted. An objection, including a pass over request, may be sustained only if it is based on a proper and adequate reason. The reasons set forth for disqualification by OPM in part 339 of this chapter constitute proper and adequate reasons to sustain an objection. Similarly, the criteria for making suitability determinations in part 731 of this chapter constitute proper and adequate reasons to sustain an objection. In addition, reasons published by OPM in the Delegated Examining Operations Handbook constitute proper and adequate reasons to sustain an objection.
(c)
Sufficiency of the reasons for a pass over.
Subject to the exception set forth in paragraph (e) of this section, an agency may not pass over a preference eligible to select a non-preference eligible unless OPM or an agency with delegated authority also makes a determination that the sufficiency of the reasons is supported by the evidence submitted for the pass over request.
(d)
Agency's obligation while request for objection is pending.
Subject to the exception set forth in paragraph (e) of this section, if an agency makes an objection against an applicant for a position (including seeking to pass over the applicant), and the individual that the agency wishes to select would be within reach of selection only if the objection is sustained, or the pass over granted, that agency may not make a selection for the position until a final ruling is made.
(e)
Applicability of paragraphs (c) and (d).
Paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section do not apply if the agency has more than one position to fill from the same certificate and holds open (in the event the objection is not sustained or the pass over request is denied) a position that could be filled by the individual against whom an objection or a pass over request has been filed.
(f)
Procedures for objections and pass overs.
Agencies must follow the procedures for objecting to or requesting to pass over an eligible that are published by OPM in the
Delegated Examining Operations Handbook.
(g)
No appeal rights to Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB).
An individual
may not appeal to the MSPB a decision by OPM or an agency with delegated authority to sustain an objection pursuant to this part, including a decision to grant a pass over request, irrespective of the reason for the decision.
[74 FR 30461, June 26, 2009]
§ 332.407
Restriction of consideration to one sex.
An appointing officer may not restrict his consideration of eligibles or employees for competitive appointment or appointment by noncompetitive action to a position in the competitive service to one sex, except in unusual circumstances when OPM finds the action justified.

(1) A hiring agency may share a competitive service certificate issued under its delegated examining authority with one or more hiring agencies for a position(s) to be filled on a permanent or term basis. Positions filled on a term basis are subject to the provisions of 5 CFR part 316, subpart C. Positions may be full-time or other than full-time (
i.e.,
part-time, seasonal, on-call, and intermittent).
(2) Another Federal agency may make a selection from a certificate shared with it under paragraph (b) of this section only after it has considered individuals it is required to consider when filling positions from within its own workforce and other internal applicants under paragraph (c) of this section.
(3) All actions taken on a shared certificate must be made within the 240-day period beginning on the date the original hiring agency issued the certificate of eligibles. This period cannot be extended.
(4) The original hiring agency and any receiving agency using a shared certificate must each maintain case file documentation sufficient for each agency to reconstruct its own use of the certificate in accordance with the
Delegated Examining Operations Handbook,
and must safeguard testing and examination materials, examination results, and the names of applicants from disclosure to other persons in accordance with § 300.201 of this chapter.
(5) All actions taken on competitive certificates must be done in accordance with the
Delegated Examining Operations Handbook
and all applicable regulations in this part and part 337 of this chapter.
(6) Agencies sharing certificates must keep records of the instances of sharing certificates and/or using shared certificates.
(b)
Requirements for the original hiring agency.
(1) A hiring agency may share a competitive certificate it has issued under § 332.402 (for traditional rating and ranking) or under 5 CFR 337.303 (for category rating) with one or more hiring agencies for use in filling a position(s) if:
(i) The original hiring agency intends to use the certificate for its own hiring;
(ii) The original hiring agency has provided notice within the job opportunity announcement for the original vacancy that the resulting list of eligible candidates may be used by one or more hiring agencies;
(iii) The original hiring agency has provided an opportunity for applicants to opt-in to have their applications and other personal information shared with one or more hiring agencies;

(2) When sharing a certificate of eligibles, the original hiring agency must share all documentation pertaining to the creation of that certificate, including but not limited to the job analysis, testing and examination materials, the
job opportunity announcement, and applications, as relevant, and must safeguard any personally identifiable information not needed for effective use of the certificate by the receiving agency. The original hiring agency must share the certificate of eligibles in its original form in order to retain the original ordering of the certificate; must safeguard any personally identifiable information from unauthorized access during the transmission process; and must redact the names of applicants who did not opt-in to the shared certificate, and who therefore may not be considered by the receiving agency.
(3) The original hiring agency may share a certificate of eligibles with one or more agencies.
(4) If the original hiring agency determines that it has made an error that may affect selections by a receiving agency or agencies, it must notify each affected receiving agency.
(c)
Requirements for the receiving agency
—(1)
Vacancies that may be filled.
A receiving agency may use a shared certificate to fill a vacancy in the same occupational series, at the same grade level (or a corresponding rate or level of pay for a position excluded from the General Schedule), with the same full performance level, and in the same duty location as was listed on the original hiring agency's certificate. If the original hiring agency's certificate is for an interdisciplinary position as described in the
Delegated Examining Operations Handbook,
the receiving agency may use it to fill an interdisciplinary position. The receiving agency must verify through its job analysis that the minimum qualification requirements (including use of any selective placement factors) and the competencies, or knowledge, skills, and abilities, that were used for the original position are appropriate for the position to be filled.
(2)
Notification to individuals who applied to the original vacancy.
Before using a shared certificate, a receiving agency must notify the list of candidates of its receipt of their names and application materials and its intention of considering them for a position. The receiving agency must also inform these individuals of its requirement to consider its own employees as well as other individuals the agency is required to consider before consideration of anyone on the shared certificate. At a minimum, the notification must include the agency, position title, series, grade level or equivalent, and duty location.
(3)

(i) This notice and opportunity for internal candidates to apply is subject to applicable collective bargaining obligations (to the extent consistent with law). Nothing in this paragraph affects agencies' right to fill a position from any appropriate source under §§ 330.102 and 335.103 of this chapter.
(ii) Agencies are prohibited from providing an application period any longer than 10 days for internal candidates. This time limit cannot be waived or extended.

(6)
Limit on further sharing by the receiving agency.
The receiving agency may not share or distribute the shared certificate to another Federal agency.

(c) Promote, demote, or reassign an employee serving under an overseas limited appointment of indefinite duration or an overseas limited term appointment to another position to which an initial appointment under § 301.201, § 301.202, or § 301.203 of this chapter is authorized;

§ 335.103
Agency promotion programs.
(a)
Merit promotion plans.
Except as otherwise specifically authorized by OPM, an agency may make promotions under § 335.102 of this part only to positions for which the agency has adopted and is administering a program designed to insure a systematic means of selection for promotion according to merit. These programs shall conform to the requirements of this section.
(b)
Merit promotion requirements
—(1)
Requirement 1.
Each agency must establish procedures for promoting employees that are based on merit and are available in writing to candidates. Agencies must list appropriate exceptions, including those required by law or regulation, as specified in paragraph (c) of this section. Actions under a promotion plan—whether identification, qualification, evaluation, or selection of candidates—must be made without regard to race, color, religion, sex (including pregnancy and gender identity), national origin, age (as defined by the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, as amended), disability, genetic information (including family medical history), marital status, political affiliation, sexual orientation, labor organization affiliation or nonaffiliation, status as a parent, or any other non-merit-based factor, unless specifically designated by statute as a factor that must be taken into
consideration when awarding such benefits, or retaliation for exercising rights with respect to the categories enumerated above, where retaliation rights are available, and must be based solely on job-related criteria.
(2)
Requirement 2.
Areas of consideration must be sufficiently broad to ensure the availability of high quality candidates, taking into account the nature and level of the positions covered. Agencies must also ensure that employees within the area of consideration who are absent for legitimate reason, e.g., on detail, on leave, at training courses, in the military service, or serving in public international organizations or on Intergovernmental Personnel Act assignments, receive appropriate consideration for promotion.
(3)
Requirement 3.
To be eligible for promotion or placement, candidates must meet the minimum qualification standards prescribed by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). Methods of evaluation for promotion and placement, and selection for training which leads to promotion, must be consistent with instructions in part 300, subpart A, of this chapter. Due weight shall be given to performance appraisals and incentive awards.
(4)
Requirement 4.
Selection procedures will provide for management's right to select or not select from among a group of best qualified candidates. They will also provide for management's right to select from other appropriate sources, such as reemployment priority lists, reinstatement, transfer, handicapped, or Veteran Recruitment Act eligibles or those within reach on an appropriate OPM certificate. In deciding which source or sources to use, agencies have an obligation to determine which is most likely to best meet the agency mission objectives, contribute fresh ideas and new viewpoints, and meet the agency's affirmative action goals.
(5)
Requirement 5.
Administration of the promotion system will include recordkeeping and the provision of necessary information to employees and the public, ensuring that individuals' rights to privacy are protected. Each agency must maintain a temporary record of each promotion sufficient to allow reconstruction of the promotion action, including documentation on how candidates were rated and ranked. These records may be destroyed after 2 years or after the program has been formally evaluated by OPM (whichever comes first) if the time limit for grievance has lapsed before the anniversary date.
(c)
Covered personnel actions
—(1)
Competitive actions.
Except as provided in paragraphs (c)(2) and (3) of this section, competitive procedures in agency promotion plans apply to all promotions under § 335.102 of this part and to the following actions:
(i) Time-limited promotions under § 335.102(f) of this part for more than 120 days to higher graded positions (prior service during the preceding 12 months under noncompetitive time-limited promotions and noncompetitive details to higher graded positions counts toward the 120-day total). A temporary promotion may be made permanent without further competition provided the temporary promotion was originally made under competitive procedures and the fact that might lead to a permanent promotion was made known to all potential candidates;
(ii) Details for more than 120 days to a higher grade position or to a position with higher promotion potential (prior service during the preceding 12 months under noncompetitive details to higher graded positions and noncompetitive time-limited promotions counts toward the 120-day total);
(iii) Selection for training which is part of an authorized training agreement, part of a promotion program, or required before an employee may be considered for a promotion as specified in § 410.302 of this chapter;
(iv) Reassignment or demotion to a position with more promotion potential than a position previously held on a permanent basis in the competitive service (except as permitted by reduction-in-force regulations);
(v) Transfer to a position at a higher grade or with more promotion potential than a position previously held on a permanent basis in the competitive service; and
(vi) Reinstatement to a permanent or temporary position at a higher grade or with more promotion potential than
a position previously held on a permanent basis in the competitive service if the individual did not wait 1 year or more after separating from Federal employment before applying for reinstatement, or did not receive a rating of record for his or her most recent career or career-conditional position of at least Fully Successful (or equivalent).
(2)
Noncompetitive actions.
Competitive procedures do not apply to:
(i) A promotion resulting from the upgrading of a position without significant change in the duties and responsibilities due to issuance of a new classification standard or the correction of an initial classification error;
(ii) A position change permitted by reduction-in-force procedures in part 351 of this chapter; and
(iii) A retroactive temporary promotion to a higher-graded position pursuant to a determination by an appropriate authority as defined in 5 CFR 550.803.
(3)
Discretionary actions.
Agencies may at their discretion except the following actions from competitive procedures of this section:
(i) A promotion without current competition of an employee who was appointed in the competitive from a civil service register, by direct hire, by noncompetitive appointment or noncompetitive conversion, or under competitive promotion procedures for an assignment intended to prepare the employee for the position being filled (the intent must be made a matter of record and career ladders must be documented in the promotion plan);
(ii) A promotion resulting from an employee's position being classified at a higher grade because of additional duties and responsibilies;
(iii) A temporary promotion, or detail to a higher grade position or a position with known promotion potential, of 120 days or less;
(iv) Promotion to a grade previously held on a permanent basis in the competitive service (or in another merit system with which OPM has an interchange agreement approved under § 6.7 of this chapter) from which an employee was separated or demoted for other than performance or conduct reasons;
(v) Promotion, reassignment, demotion, transfer, reinstatement, or detail to a position having promotion potential no greater than the potential of a position an employee currently holds or previously held on a permanent basis in the competitive service (or in another merit system with which OPM has an interchange agreement approved under § 6.7 of this chapter) and did not lose because of performance or conduct reasons; and
(vi) Consideration of a candidate not given proper consideration in a competitive promotion action.
(vii) Appointments of career SES appointees with competitive service reinstatement eligibility to any position for which they qualify in the competitive service at any grade or salary level, including Senior-Level positions established under 5 CFR Part 319—Employment in Senior-Level and Scientific and Professional positions.
(viii) Reinstatement in accordance with 5 CFR part 315 to any position in the competitive service for which the individual is qualified at a higher grade level or with more promotion potential than a career or career-conditional position previously held by the individual; provided: The individual has been separated for at least one year before applying for reinstatement, and the individual must have received a rating of record for his or her most recent career or career-conditional position of at least Fully Successful (or equivalent).
(d)
Grievances.
Employees have the right to file a complaint relating to a promotion action. Such complaints shall be resolved under appropriate grievance procedures. The standards for adjudicating complaints are set forth in part 300, subpart A, of this chapter. While the procedures used by an agency to identify and rank qualified candidates may be proper subjects for formal complaints or grievances, nonselection from among a group of properly ranked and certified candidates is not an appropriate basis for a formal complaint or grievance. There is no right of appeal of OPM, but OPM
may conduct investigations of substantial violations of OPM requirements.

# Subpart A—General Provisions
§ 337.101
Rating applicants.
(a) OPM shall prescribe the relative weights to be given subjects in an examination, and shall assign numerical ratings on a scale of 100. Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each applicant who meets the minimum requirements for entrance to an examination and is rated 70 or more in the examination is eligible for appointment.
(b) OPM shall add to the earned numerical ratings of applicants who make a passing grade:
(1) Five points for applicants who are preference eligibles under section 2108(3)(A) and (B) of title 5, United States Code; and
(2) Ten points for applicants who are preference eligibles under section 2108(3)(C)-(G) of that title.
(c) When experience is a factor in determining eligibility, OPM shall credit a preference eligible with:
(1) Time spent in the military service (i) as an extension of time spent in the position in which he was employed immediately before his entrance into the military service, or (ii) on the basis of actual duties performed in the military service, or (iii) as a combination of both methods. OPM shall credit time spent in the military service according to the method that will be of most benefit to the preference eligible.
(2) All valuable experience, including experience gained in religious, civic, welfare, service, and organizational activities, regardless of whether pay was received therefor.
[33 FR 12423, Sept. 4, 1968, as amended at 72 FR 12954, Mar. 20, 2007]
§ 337.102
Evaluating qualifications for employees who are in a retained grade.
(a) Employees who are in a retained grade must have the experience they gain subsequent to the downgrading action that placed them in a retained grade considered in the following manner. For placements during the period the employee is in a retained grade, agencies must consider the experience subsequent to the downgrading action to be either:
(1) At the level of the retained grade and in the series of the position which he or she occupied at the time of the downgrading; or
(2) At the grade and in the series of the position to which the employee is downgraded.
(b) Agencies must determine which experience to consider on the basis of which will most likely result in placement. For placements or promotions after the retained grade period, the experience is considered only at the grade level and in the series of the position to which the employee was downgraded.
[45 FR 18365, Mar. 21, 1980]

# Subpart B—Direct-Hire Authority

# Source:
69 FR 33275, June 15, 2004, unless otherwise noted.
§ 337.201
Coverage and purpose.
OPM will permit an agency with delegated examining authority under 5 U.S.C. 1104(a)(2) to use direct-hire authority under 5 U.S.C. 3304(a)(3) for a permanent or nonpermanent position or group of positions in the competitive service at GS-15 (or equivalent) and below, if OPM determines that there is either a severe shortage of candidates or a critical hiring need for such positions. It is not required that this direct-hire authority be exercised by a delegated examining unit. Requests for direct-hire authority must be submitted by the agency's Chief Human Capital Officer (or equivalent) at the agency headquarters level. OPM will determine the length of the direct-hire authority based on the justification.
§ 337.202
Definitions.
In this subpart:
(a) A
direct-hire authority
permits hiring without regard to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 3309 through 3318; part 211 of this chapter; and subpart A of part 337 of this chapter.
(b) A
severe shortage of candidates
for a particular position or group of positions means that an agency is having difficulty identifying candidates possessing the competencies or the knowledge, skills, and abilities required to
perform the job requirements despite extensive recruitment, extended announcement periods, and the use, as applicable, of hiring flexibilities such as recruitment or relocation incentives or special salary rates.
(c) A
critical hiring need
for a particular position or group of positions means that an agency has a need to fill the position(s) to meet mission requirements brought about by circumstances such as, but not limited to, a national emergency, threat, potential threat, environmental disaster, or unanticipated or unusual event or mission requirement, or to conform to the requirements of law, a Presidential directive or Administration initiative.
§ 337.203
Public notice requirements.
Agencies must comply with public notice requirements as prescribed in 5 U.S.C. 3327 and 3330, and subpart A of part 330 of this chapter with respect to any position that an agency seeks to fill using direct-hire authority.
[69 FR 33275, June 15, 2004, as amended at 75 FR 67605, Nov. 3, 2010]
§ 337.204
Severe shortage of candidates.
(a) OPM will determine when a severe shortage of candidates exists for particular occupations, grades (or equivalent), and/or geographic locations. OPM may decide independently that such a shortage exists, or may make this decision in response to a written request from an agency.
(b) An agency when requesting direct-hire authority under this section, or OPM when deciding independently, must identify the position or positions that are difficult to fill and must provide supporting evidence that demonstrates the existence of a severe shortage of candidates with respect to the position(s). The evidence should include, as applicable, information about:
(1) The results of workforce planning and analysis;
(2) Employment trends including the local or national labor market;
(3) The existence of nationwide or geographic skills shortages;
(4) Agency efforts, including recruitment initiatives, use of other appointing authorities (e.g., schedule A, schedule B) and flexibilities, training and development programs tailored to the position(s), and an explanation of why these recruitment and training efforts have not been sufficient;
(5) The availability and quality of candidates;
(6) The desirability of the geographic location of the position(s);
(7) The desirability of the duties and/or work environment associated with the position(s); and
(8) Other pertinent information such as selective placement factors or other special requirements of the position, as well as agency use of hiring flexibilities such as recruitment or retention allowances or special salary rates.
(c) A department or agency head (other than the Secretary of Defense) may determine, pursuant to section 1413(a) of Public Law 108-136, as amended by section 853 of Public Law 110-181, that a shortage of highly qualified candidates exists for certain Federal acquisition positions (covered under section 433(g)(1)(A) of title 41, United States Code). To make such a determination, the deciding agency official must use the supporting evidence prescribed in 5 CFR 337.204(b)(1)-(8) and must maintain a file of the supporting evidence for documentation and reporting purposes.
(d)
Information Technology (IT) positions.
(1) The head of a covered agency, as defined in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, may determine whether a severe shortage of candidates exists at that agency for any position in the information technology management series, general schedule (GS)-2210 or equivalent. In making such a determination, a covered agency must adhere to and use the supporting evidence prescribed in 5 CFR 337.204(b)(1)-(8). For purposes of paragraph (b)(5) of this section, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) need only determine whether a severe shortage of highly-qualified candidates exists. In addition, a covered agency must maintain a file of the supporting evidence for documentation and reporting purposes. Upon determination of such a finding, an agency head may approve a direct hire authority for covered positions within the agency.
(2)
Covered agency.
A covered agency is an entity listed in 31 U.S.C. 901(b) (except the Department of Defense), or an independent regulatory agency defined in 44 U.S.C. 3502(5).
(3)
Notification to the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM).
Once the head of a covered agency affirmatively determines the presence of a severe shortage and the direct hire authority is approved by the agency head, he or she must notify OPM within 10 business days. Such notification must include a description of the supporting evidence relied upon in making the determination.
(4)
Using this authority.
A covered agency must adhere to all provisions of subpart B of this part.
(5)
Length of appointments.
A covered agency may use this authority to appoint individuals for a period of more than 1 year, but not more than 4 years.
(i) A covered agency may extend any appointment under this authority for up to 4 additional years, if the direct hire authority remains in effect.
(ii) No individual may serve more than 8 years on an appointment made under these provisions for information technology positions.
(iii) No individual hired under these provisions may be transferred to positions that are not IT positions.
[69 FR 33275, June 15, 2004, as amended at 70 FR 44847, Aug. 4, 2005; 74 FR 61263, Nov. 24, 2009; 84 FR 12875, Apr. 3, 2019]
§ 337.205
Critical hiring needs.
(a) OPM will determine when there is a critical hiring need for particular occupations, grades (or equivalent) and/or geographic locations. OPM may decide independently that such a need exists or may make this decision in response to a written request from an agency.
(b) An agency when requesting direct-hire authority under this section, or OPM when deciding on its own, must:
(1) Identify the position(s) that must be filled;
(2) Describe the event or circumstance that has created the need to fill the position(s);
(3) Specify the duration for which the critical need is expected to exist; and
(4) Include supporting evidence that demonstrates why the use of other hiring authorities is impracticable or ineffective.
(c)
Information Technology (IT) positions.
(1) The head of a covered agency, as defined in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, may determine whether a critical hiring need exists for any position in the information technology management series, general schedule (GS)-2210 or equivalent. In making such a determination, a covered agency must adhere to and use the supporting evidence criteria prescribed in paragraphs (b)(1) through (4) of this section. In addition, a covered agency must maintain a file of the supporting evidence for documentation and reporting purposes. Upon determination of such a finding, an agency head may approve a direct hire authority for covered positions within the agency.
(2)
Covered agency.
A covered agency is an entity listed in 31 U.S.C. 901(b) (excluding the Department of Defense), or an independent regulatory agency defined in 44 U.S.C. 3502(5).
(3)
Notification to the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM).
Once the head of a covered agency affirmatively determines the presence of a critical hiring need and the direct hire authority is approved by the agency head, he or she must notify OPM within 10 business days. Such notification must include a description of the supporting evidence relied upon in making the determination.
(4)
Using this authority.
A covered agency must adhere to all provisions of subpart B of this part.
(5)
Length of appointments.
A covered agency may use this authority to appoint individuals for a period of more than 1 year, but not more than 4 years, if the direct hire authority remains in effect.
(i) A covered agency may extend an appointment under this authority for up to 4 additional years.
(ii) No individual may serve more than 8 years on an appointment made under these provisions for information technology positions.
(iii) No individual hired under these provisions may be transferred to positions that are not IT positions.
[69 FR 33275, June 15, 2004, as amended at 84 FR 12875, Apr. 3, 2019]
§ 337.206
Terminations, modifications, extensions, and reporting.
(a)
Termination and modification.
On a periodic basis, for each direct-hire authority, OPM will review agency use of the authority to ensure proper administration and to determine if continued use of the authority is supportable. OPM will terminate or modify a direct-hire authority if it determines that there is no longer a severe shortage of candidates or a critical hiring need. Likewise, when an agency finds there are adequate numbers of qualified candidates for positions previously filled under direct-hire authorities, based on severe shortage of candidates, the agency is required to report this change of events to OPM. OPM may also terminate an agency's authority when the agency has used an authority improperly.
(b)
Extension.
OPM may extend direct-hire authority if OPM determines, based on relevant, recent, and supportable data, that there is or will continue to be a severe shortage of candidates or a critical hiring need for particular positions as of the date the authority is due to expire. In their requests for extensions of direct-hire authorities, agencies must include an update of the supporting evidence that demonstrated the need for the original authority.
(c)
Reporting requirement.
On a periodic basis, OPM may request information from agencies regarding their use of these direct-hire authorities. The requested information may include numbers of positions, title, series, and grade of positions advertised under the direct-hire authority, the number of qualified applicants, the specific qualification criteria, and the number of applicants appointed under the authority.
(d) No new appointments may be made under the provisions of section 1413 of Public Law 108-136 after September 30, 2012.
[69 FR 33275, June 15, 2004, as amended at 70 FR 44847, Aug. 4, 2005; 74 FR 61263, Nov. 24, 2009]

# Subpart C—Alternative Rating and Selection Procedures

# Source:
69 FR 33276, June 15, 2004, unless otherwise noted.
§ 337.301
Coverage and purpose.
This subpart implements the category rating and selection procedures at 5 U.S.C. 3319. This law authorizes agencies with delegated examining authority under 5 U.S.C. 1104(a)(2) to develop a category rating method as an alternative process to assess applicants for jobs filled through competitive examining.
§ 337.302
Definitions.
In this subpart:
(a)
Category rating
is synonymous with alternative rating as described at 5 U.S.C. 3319, and is a process of evaluating qualified eligibles by quality categories rather than by assigning individual numeric scores. The agency assesses candidates against job-related criteria and then places them into two or more pre-defined categories.
(b)
Quality categories
are groupings of individuals with similar levels of job-related competencies or similar levels of knowledge, skills, and abilities.
§ 337.303
Agency responsibilities.
To use a category rating procedure, agencies must:
(a) Establish a system for evaluating applicants that provides for two or more quality categories;
(b) Define each quality category through job analysis conducted in accordance with the
“Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures”
at 29 CFR part 1607 and part 300 of this chapter. Each category must have a clear definition that distinguishes it from other categories;
(c) Describe each quality category in the job announcement and apply the provisions of part 330, subparts B, F, and G of this chapter;
(d) Place applicants into categories based upon their job-related competencies or their knowledge, skills, and abilities; and
(e) Establish documentation and record keeping procedures for reconstruction purposes.
§ 337.304
Veterans' preference.
In this subpart:
(a) Veterans' preference must be applied as prescribed in 5 U.S.C. 3319(b) and (c)(7);
(b) Veterans' preference points as prescribed in § 337.101 are not applied in category rating; and
(c) Sections 3319(b) and 3319(c)(7) of title 5 U.S.C. constitute veterans' preference requirements for purposes of 5 U.S.C. 2302(b)(11)(A) and (B).

§ 339.101
Coverage.
This part applies to—
(a) Applicants for and employees in competitive service positions; and
(b) Applicants for and employees in positions excepted from the competitive service when medical issues arise in connection with an OPM regulation that governs a particular personnel action, such as removal of a preference eligible employee in the excepted service under part 752.
§ 339.102
Purpose and effect.
(a) This part defines the circumstances under which OPM permits medical documentation to be required and examinations and/or evaluations conducted to determine the nature of a medical condition that affects safe and efficient performance.
(b) Personnel decisions based wholly or in part on the review of medical documentation, as defined below, and the results of medical examinations and evaluations must be made in accordance with appropriate sections of this part.
(c) Failure to meet medical (which may include psychological) standards and/or physical requirements established under this part means that the applicant or employee is not qualified for the position, unless reasonable accommodation or a waiver is appropriate, in accordance with §§ 339.103 and 339.204. An employee's refusal to be examined or provide medical documentation, as defined below, in accordance with a proper agency order authorized under this part, constitutes a basis for appropriate disciplinary or adverse action. After a tentative job offer of employment conditioned on completion of a medical examination, an applicant's refusal to be examined or provide medical documentation, as defined below, may result in the applicant's removal from further consideration for the position.
§ 339.103
Compliance with disability laws.
(a) The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990, as amended by the Amendments Act of 2008 (collectively the ADA), establishes prohibitions against discrimination and the requirements for reasonable accommodation that apply to the Federal Government through the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, 29 U.S.C. 791(f). Consequently, actions under this part must comply with the non-discrimination provisions of the Rehabilitation Act, the non-discrimination provisions of the ADA, and their implementing regulations.
(b) Use of the term “qualified” in this part must comply with the Rehabilitation Act, as amended, and the ADA, as amended. Specifically, a “qualified individual with a disability” means that the individual possess the requisite skill, experience, education, and other job-related requirements of an employment position that the individual holds or seeks, and can perform the essential functions of the position with or without reasonable accommodation.
§ 339.104
Definitions.
For purposes of this part—
Accommodation
means
reasonable accommodation
as described in the ADA.
Arduous or hazardous positions
means positions that are dangerous or physically demanding to such a degree that an employee's medical and/or physical condition is necessarily an important consideration in determining ability to perform safely and efficiently.
Medical condition
means a health impairment which results from birth, injury or disease, including mental disorder.
Medical documentation
or
documentation of a medical condition
means a copy of a dated, written and signed statement, or a dated copy of actual medical office or hospital records, from a licensed physician or other licensed health practitioner, as these terms are defined below, that contains necessary and relevant information to enable the agency to make an employment decision. To be acceptable, the diagnosis or clinical impression must be justified according to established diagnostic criteria and the conclusions and recommendations must be consistent with generally accepted professional standards. The determination that the diagnosis meets these criteria is made by or in coordination with a licensed physician or, if appropriate, a practitioner of the same discipline as the one who issued the documentation. An acceptable diagnosis must include the information identified by the agency as necessary and relevant to its employment decision. This information may include, but is not limited to, the following:
(1) The history of the medical condition(s), including references to findings from previous examinations, treatment, and responses to treatment;
(2) Clinical findings from the most recent medical evaluation, including any of the following: Findings of physical examination; results of laboratory tests; X-rays; EKGs and/or other special evaluations or diagnostic procedures; and, in the case of psychiatric examination or psychological assessment, the findings of a mental status examination and/or the results of psychological tests, if appropriate;
(3) Diagnosis, including the current clinical status;
(4) Prognosis, including plans for future treatment and an estimate of the expected date of full or partial recovery;
(5) An explanation of the impact of the medical condition(s) on overall health and activities, including the basis for any conclusion as to whether restrictions or accommodations are necessary and, if determined to be necessary, an explanation supporting that determination; and, either of the following:
(6) An explanation of the medical basis for any conclusion that indicates the likelihood that the applicant or employee will suffer sudden incapacitation or subtle incapacitation by carrying out, with or without accommodation, the tasks or duties of a specific position; or
(7) Narrative explanation of the medical basis for any conclusion that the medical condition has or has not become static or well-stabilized and the likelihood that the applicant or employee may experience sudden incapacitation or subtle incapacitation as a result of the medical condition. In this context, “static or well-stabilized” medical condition means a medical condition which is not likely to change as a consequence of the natural progression of the condition, such as a result of the normal aging process, or in response to the work environment or the work itself.
Medical evaluation program
means a program of recurring medical examinations or tests established by written agency policy or directive, to safeguard the health of employees whose work may subject them or others to significant health or safety risks due to occupational or environmental exposure or demands. For example, an agency policy or directive may include medical clearances and medical surveillance to test for occupational exposure to biological, chemical, and/or radiological hazardous agents, occupational diseases, and occupational risk.
Medical restriction
is a medical determination that an applicant or employee is limited, or prevented from performing a certain type or duration of work or activity (e.g., standing and/or ability to concentrate) or motion (e.g., bending, lifting, pulling), because of a particular medical condition or physical limitation. The purpose of a medical restriction is to try to prevent aggravation, acceleration, exacerbation, or permanent worsening of the medical condition or physical limitation.
Medical standard
is a written description of the minimum medical requirements necessary for an applicant or
employee to perform essential job duties as a condition of employment.
Medical surveillance
is the on-going systematic collection and analysis of health data to improve and protect the health and safety of employees in the workplace, and to monitor for health trends both in individual workers and in population of workers. Medical surveillance can include the tracking of occupational injuries, illnesses, hazards, and exposures, as well as laboratory and examination-based medical data, in order to identify findings that could provide an early warning of, or indicate the risk for, an occupational disease. Medical surveillance also is part of compliance with those Federal and state regulations that require medical monitoring when employees use or are exposed to certain hazardous materials.
Physical requirement
is a written description of job-related physical abilities that are essential for performance of the duties of a specific position.
Physician
means a licensed Doctor of Medicine or Doctor of Osteopathy, or a physician who is serving on active duty in the uniformed services and is designated by the uniformed service to conduct examinations under this part.
Practitioner
means a person providing health services who is not a medical doctor, but who is certified by a national organization, licensed by a State, and/or registered as a health professional to provide the health service in question.
Subtle incapacitation
means gradual, initially imperceptible impairment of physical or mental function, whether reversible or not, which is likely to result in safety, performance and/or conduct issues that may undermine the agency's commitment to maintaining a safe working environment for all employees and others.
Sudden incapacitation
means abrupt onset of loss of control of physical or mental function(s), whether reversible or not, which is likely to result in safety, performance or conduct issues that may undermine the agency's commitment to maintaining a safe working environment for all employees and others.

# Subpart B—Medical Standards, Physical Requirements, and Medical Evaluation Programs
§ 339.201
Disqualification by OPM.
OPM must review and decide upon an agency's request to pass over a candidate, who is a preference eligible, on medical grounds pursuant to § 339.306. OPM may deny an applicant employment by reason of physical or mental unfitness for the position for which he or she has applied. An OPM decision under this section or § 339.306 is separate and distinct from a determination of disability pursuant to statutory provisions for disability retirement under the Civil Service Retirement System and the Federal Employees' Retirement System.
§ 339.202
Medical standards.
OPM may establish and/or approve medical standards for a Governmentwide occupation (
i.e.,
an occupation common to more than one agency) or approve revisions to its established medical standards. An individual agency may establish medical standards for positions that predominate in that agency (
i.e.,
where the agency has 50 percent or more of the positions in a particular occupation). Such standards must be justified on the basis that the duties of the positions are arduous or hazardous, or require a certain level of health status for successful performance when the nature of the positions involves a high degree of responsibility toward the public or sensitive national security concerns. The rationale for establishing the standard must be documented and supported by a study(ies) or evaluation(s) establishing the medical standard is job-related to the occupation(s). Medical standards established by agencies must be approved by OPM prior to implementation. Standards established by OPM or an agency must be:
(a) Established by written directive and uniformly applied, and
(b) Directly related to the actual performance and requirements necessary for the performance of the duties of the position.
§ 339.203
Physical requirements.
(a) An agency may establish physical requirements for individual positions without OPM approval when such requirements are considered essential for performance of the duties of a specific position. Physical requirements must be clearly supported by the actual duties of the position, documented in the position description, and supported by a study(ies) or evaluation(s) establishing physical requirement(s) is job-related to the occupation(s).
(b) An applicant or employee may not be disqualified arbitrarily on the basis of physical requirements or other criteria that do not relate specifically to performance of the duties of a specific position.
§ 339.204
Waiver of standards and requirements and medical review boards.
(a) An agency must waive a medical standard or physical requirement established under this part when an applicant or employee, unable to meet that standard or requirement, presents sufficient evidence that the applicant or employee, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential duties of the position without endangering the health and safety of the applicant or employee or others. Additional information obtained by the agency may be considered in determining whether a waiver is appropriate. An agency may establish timeframes, in writing, for submission of initial or additional information for consideration, with allowance for reasonable extensions.
(b) Agencies may, but are not required to, establish medical review boards to help the agency provide a case-by-case, fact-based, individualized assessment whenever an individual is found to not meet agency medical standards or physical requirements. An agency may also use a medical review board as a forum for a higher level of review within the agency when medical questions or issues arise. If established, the Board is expected to recommend administrative actions that are consistent with applicable law, as well as applicable and current medical practice standards of care, through the combined expertise of its members.
(c) The use and composition of a medical review board will be determined by the agency. Upon request, an agency will provide to OPM information regarding the composition and use of medical review boards. OPM may issue guidance from time to time as to best practices with respect to the composition and use of such boards.
§ 339.205
Medical evaluation programs.
Agencies may establish periodic medical examinations, medical surveillance, or immunization programs by written policies or directives to safeguard the health of employees whose work may expose them or others to significant health or safety risks due to occupational or environmental exposure or demands. This may include the requirement to undergo vaccination with products approved by the Food and Drug Administration (e.g., for national security reasons or in order to fulfill the duties of a position designated as national security sensitive). The need for a medical evaluation program must be clearly supported by the nature of the work. The specific positions covered must be identified and the applicants or employees notified in writing of the reasons for including the positions in the program.
§ 339.206
Disqualification on the basis of medical history.
An employee or applicant may not be disqualified for any position solely on the basis of medical history. For positions subject to medical standards and/or physical requirements, and for positions under medical evaluation programs, a history of a particular medical condition may result in medical disqualification only if the condition at issue is itself disqualifying, recurrence of the condition is based on reasonable medical judgment, and the duties of the position are such that a recurrence of the condition would pose a significant risk of substantial harm to the health and safety of the applicant or employee or others that cannot be eliminated or reduced by reasonable accommodation or any other agency efforts to mitigate risk.

# Subpart C—Medical Examinations
§ 339.301
Authority to require an examination.
(a) A routine pre-employment medical examination is appropriate only for a position with specific medical standards and/or physical requirements, or that is covered by a medical evaluation program established under this part.
(b) Subject to § 339.103, an agency may require an applicant or employee who has applied for or occupies a position that has medical standards and/or physical requirements, or is covered by a medical evaluation program established under this part, to report for a medical examination:
(1) Subsequent to a tentative offer of employment or reemployment (including return to work from medically based absence on the basis of a medical condition);
(2) On a regularly recurring, periodic basis after appointment in accordance with § 339.205; or
(3) Whenever the agency has a reasonable belief, based on objective evidence, that there is a question about an employee's continued capacity to meet the medical standards or physical requirements of a position.
(c) An agency may require an employee who has applied for or is receiving continuation of pay or compensation as a result of an injury or disease covered under the provisions of the Federal Employees' Compensation Act to report for an examination to determine medical limitations that may affect job placement decisions.
(d) An agency may require an employee who is released from his or her competitive level in a reduction in force under part 351 of this chapter to undergo a relevant medical evaluation if the position to which the employee has assignment rights has medical standards and/or physical requirements, that are different from those required in the employee's current position.
(e)(1) An agency may order a psychiatric examination (including a psychological assessment) only when:
(i) The result of a current general medical examination that the agency has the authority to order under this section indicates no physical explanation for behavior or actions that may affect the safe and efficient performance of the applicant or employee, the safety of others, and/or the vulnerability of business operation and information systems to potential threats, or
(ii) A psychiatric examination or psychological assessment is part of the medical standards for a position having medical standards or required under a medical evaluation program established under this part.
(2) A psychiatric examination or psychological assessment authorized under paragraphs (e)(1) of this section must be conducted in accordance with accepted professional standards by a licensed physician certified in psychiatry by the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology or the American Osteopathic Board of Psychiatry and Neurology, or by a licensed psychologist or clinical neuropsychologist, and may only be used to make inquiry into a person's mental fitness as it directly relates to successfully performing the duties of the position without significant risk to the applicant or employee or others, and/or to the vulnerability of business operation and information systems to potential threats.
§ 339.302
Authority to offer examinations.
An agency may, at its option, offer a medical examination (including a psychiatric examination or psychological assessment) in situations where the agency needs additional medical documentation to make an informed management decision. This may include situations where an employee requests, for medical reasons, a change in duty status, assignment, working conditions, or any other different treatment (including reasonable accommodation or return to work on the basis of full or partial recovery from a medical condition) or where the employee has a performance or conduct problem that may require agency action. Reasons for offering an examination must be documented. When an offer of an examination has been made by an agency and the offer has been accepted by the applicant or employee, the examination must be carried out in accordance with the authorities cited in § 339.103. The
results of the examination must also be used in accordance with the authorities cited in § 339.103.
§ 339.303
Medical examination procedures.
(a) When an agency requires or offers a medical or psychiatric examination or psychological assessment under this subpart, it must inform the applicant or employee in writing of its reasons for doing so, the consequences of failure to cooperate, and the right to submit medical information from his or her private physician or practitioner. A single written notification is sufficient to cover a series of regularly recurring or periodic examinations ordered under this subpart. An agency may establish timeframes, in writing, for submission of medical documentation, with allowances for reasonable extensions.
(1) Refusal or failure to report for a medical examination ordered by the agency may be a basis for a determination that the applicant or employee is not qualified for the position. In addition, an employee may be subject to adverse action.
(2) Refusal or failure on the part of an applicant or the employee to authorize release of any results from an agency ordered or offered medical examination issued in accordance with §§ 339.301 or 339.302, or the results of any previous medical treatments or evaluations relative to the identified medical issue, to authorized agency representatives, including the agency physician or medical review officer and/or independent medical specialists, may be a basis for disqualification for the position by the hiring agency. In addition, an employee may be subject to adverse action.
(b) The agency designates the examining physician or other appropriate practitioner, but must offer the applicant or employee an opportunity to submit medical documentation from his or her private physician or practitioner for consideration in the medical examination process. The agency must review and consider all such documentation supplied by the private physician or practitioner. The applicant or employee must authorize release of this documentation to all authorized agency representatives. In situations where the medical documentation of the applicant or employee's private physician or practitioner is contradictory and cannot be resolved by the examining physician or the agency physician or medical review officer, the agency may, at its option, pursue another opinion from an appropriate specialist at agency expense. An applicant or employee also may, at his or her option, pursue another opinion from an appropriate specialist at his or her expense in the event of conflicting or contradictory medical documentation.
§ 339.304
Payment for examination.
(a) An agency must pay for all medical and/or psychological and/or psychiatric examinations required or offered by the agency under this subpart, whether conducted by the agency's physician or medical review officer, an independent medical evaluation specialist (e.g., occupational audiologist) identified by the agency, or a licensed physician or practitioner chosen by the applicant or employee. This includes special evaluations or diagnostic procedures required by an agency.
(b) Following conclusion of the initial medical, psychological, and/or psychiatric examination, the agency physician or medical review officer will render a final medical determination. In certain final medical ineligibility determinations, the agency physician or medical review officer may reference supplemental medical examination, testing or documentation, which the applicant or employee may submit to the agency for consideration and further review relative to potential medical eligibility. Under these circumstances, the applicant or employee is responsible for payment of this further examination, testing and documentation.
(c) An applicant or employee must pay to obtain all relevant medical documentation from his or her private licensed physician or required practitioners in instances where no medical examination is required or offered by the agency, but where the agency requests the applicant or employee to provide medical documentation relative to an identified medical or physical condition in question or where the agency needs medical documentation
to render an informed management decision.
(d) An applicant or employee must pay for a medical examination conducted by his or her private licensed physician or practitioner where the purpose of the examination is to secure a change sought by an applicant (e.g., new employment) or by an employee (e.g., a request for change in duty status, reasonable accommodation, and/or job modification).
§ 339.305
Records and reports.
(a) Agencies will receive and maintain all medical documentation and records of examinations obtained under this part in accordance with part 293, subpart E, of this chapter.
(b) The report of an examination conducted under this subpart must be made available to the applicant or employee under the provisions of part 297 of this chapter.
(c) Agencies must forward to the Office of Workers' Compensation Programs (OWCP), Employment Standards Administration, Department of Labor, a copy of all medical documentation and reports of examinations of employees who are receiving or have applied for injury compensation benefits under 5 U.S.C. chapter 81, including continuation of pay. The agency must also report to OWCP the failure of such employees to report for examinations that the agency orders under this subpart. When the employee has applied for disability retirement, this information and any medical documentation or reports of examination must be forwarded to OPM.
§ 339.306
Processing medical eligibility determinations.
(a) In accordance with the provisions of this part, agencies are authorized to medically disqualify a nonpreference eligible. A nonpreference eligible so disqualified has a right to a higher level review of the determination within the agency.
(b) OPM must approve the sufficiency of the agency's reasons to:
(1) Medically disqualify or pass over a preference eligible in order to select a nonpreference eligible for:
(i) A competitive service position under part 332 of this chapter; or
(ii) An excepted service position in the executive branch subject to title 5, U.S. Code;
(2) Medically disqualify or pass over a 30 percent or more compensably disabled veteran for a position in the U.S. Postal Service in favor of a nonpreference eligible;
(3) Medically disqualify a 30 percent or more compensably disabled veteran for assignment to another position in a reduction in force under § 351.702(d) of this chapter; or
(4) Medically disqualify a 30 percent or more disabled veteran for noncompetitive appointment, for example, under § 316.302(b)(4) of this chapter.

# Congressional Findings and Purpose
Sec. 2.
(a) The Congress finds that—
(1) many individuals in our society possess great productive potential which goes unused because they cannot meet the requirements of a standard workweek; and

# Source:
44 FR 57380, Oct. 5, 1979; 49 FR 17722, Apr. 25, 1984, unless otherwise noted.
§ 340.201
Regulatory requirements.
This subpart contains the regulations of the Office of Personnel Management which implement the above sections of chapter 34 (as set out in § 340.101).
§ 340.202
General.
(a)
Definitions. Part-time career employment
means regularly scheduled work of from 16 to 32 hours per week performed by an employee of an agency as defined in 5 U.S.C. 3401 (a) through (f), who has an appointment in tenure group I or II and who becomes employed on such part-time basis on or after April 8, 1979.
Tenure group I
applies to employees in the competitive service under career appointments who are not serving probation and permanent employees in the excepted service whose appointments carry no restrictions or conditions.
Tenure group II
applies to employees in the competitive service serving probation, career-conditional employees, and career employees in obligated positions. It also includes employees in the excepted service serving trial periods, whose tenure is indefinite solely because they occupy obligated positions; or whose tenure is equivalent to career-conditional in the competitive service.
(b)
Agency Exceptions.
As an exception to the general definition of part-time employment in § 340.202(a) and under the authority provided in 5 U.S.C. 3402(a)(3), an agency may permit an employee who has an appointment in tenure group I or II to perform regularly scheduled work of from 1 to 15 hours per week.
(c)
Mixed Tours of Duty.
The provisions of this subpart and the term “part-time career employment” do not apply to employees with appointments in tenure groups I or II who work under mixed tours of duty. For this purpose, a mixed tour of duty consists of annually recurring periods of full-time, part-time, or intermittent service as long as the employee does not work part-time more than 6 pay periods per calendar year.
[44 FR 57380, Oct. 5, 1979, as amended at 49 FR 17722, Apr. 25, 1984; 60 FR 3061, Jan. 13, 1995]
§ 340.203
Technical assistance.
(a) The Office of Personnel Management shall provide, within available resources, consultation and technical advice and assistance to agencies to aid them in expanding career part-time
employment opportunities. This assistance shall include but not be limited to:
(1) Help in developing part-time career employment programs;
(2) Information on public and private sector part-time employment practices;
(3) Development of special recruitment and selection techniques for filling part-time positions;
(4) Interpretations of part-time employment law, regulations and policy;
(5) Guidance on job sharing and position restructuring.
(b) Request for information and assistance should be directed to the Associate Director for Staffing Services, Office of Personnel Management, 1900 E Street, NW., Washington, DC 20415, or the nearest OPM regional office.
§ 340.204
Agency reporting.
(a) Agency reports required under 5 U.S.C. 3407 shall be based on data as of March 31 and September 30 each year and shall be provided to the Office of Personnel Management no later than May 15 and November 15 respectively.
(b) Each agency shall include with such reports a copy of any agencywide part-time career employment program regulations and instructions issued during the 6-month period preceding the report date.
(c) Reports should be sent to the Associate Director for Staffing Services, Office of Personnel Management, 1900 E Street, NW., Washington, DC 20415.
Subpart C [Reserved]

# Subpart D—Seasonal and intermittent Employment

# Source:
60 FR 3061, Jan. 13, 1995, unless otherwise noted.
§ 340.401
Definitions.
(a)
Seasonal employment
means annually recurring periods of work of less than 12 months each year. Seasonal employees are permanent employees who are placed in nonduty/nonpay status and recalled to duty in accordance with preestablished conditions of employment.
(b)
Intermittent employment
means employment without a regularly scheduled tour of duty.
§ 340.402
Seasonal employment.
(a)
Appropriate use.
Seasonal employment allows an agency to develop an experienced cadre of employees under career appointment to perform work which recurs predictably year-to-year. Consistent with the career nature of the appointments, seasonal employees receive the full benefits authorized to attract and retain a stable workforce. As a result, seasonal employment is appropriate when the work is expected to last at least 6 months during a calendar year. Recurring work that lasts less than 6 months each year is normally best performed by temporary employees. Seasonal employment may not be used as a substitute for full-time employment or as a buffer for the full-time workforce.
(b)
Length of the season.
Agencies determine the length of the season, subject to the condition that it be clearly tied to nature of the work. The season must be defined as closely as practicable so that an employee will have a reasonably clear idea of how much work he or she can expect during the year. To minimize the adverse impact of seasonal layoffs, an agency may assign seasonal employees to other work during the projected layoff period. While in nonpay status, a seasonal employee may accept other employment, Federal or non-Federal, subject to the regulations on political activity (part 733 of this title) and on employee responsibilities and conduct (part 735), as well as applicable agency policies. Subject to the limitation on pay from more than one position (5 U.S.C. 5533), a seasonal employee may hold more than one appointment.
(c)
Employment agreement.
An employment agreement must be executed between the agency and the seasonal employee prior to the employee's entering on duty. At a minimum, the agreement must inform the employee:
(1) That he or she is subject to periodic release and recall as a condition of employment,
(2) The minimum and maximum period the employee can expect to work,
(3) The basis on which release and recall procedures will be effected, and
(4) The benefits to which the employee will be entitled while in a nonpay status.
(d)
Release and recall procedures.
A seasonal employee is released to nonpay status at the end of a season and recalled to duty the next season. Release and recall procedures must be established in advance and uniformly applied. They may be based on performance, seniority, veterans' preference, other appropriate indices, or a combination of factors. A seasonal layoff is not subject to the procedures for furlough prescribed in parts 351 and 752 of this title. Reduction in force or adverse action procedures, as applicable, are required for a seasonal layoff that is not in accordance with the employment agreement, for example, if an agency intends to have an employee work less than the minimum amount of time specified in the employment agreement. However, an agency may develop a new employment agreement to reflect changing circumstances.
(e)
Noncompetitive movement.
Seasonal employees serving under career appointment may move to other positions in the same way as other regular career employees.
§ 340.403
Intermittent employment.
(a)
Appropriate use.
An intermittent work schedule is appropriate only when the nature of the work is sporadic and unpredictable so that a tour of duty cannot be regularly scheduled in advance. When an agency is able to schedule work in advance on a regular basis, it has an obligation to document the change in work schedule from intermittent to part-time or full-time to ensure proper service credit.
(b)
Noncompetitive movement.
Intermittent employees serving under career appointment may move to other positions in the same way as other regular career employees.

# Subpart B—General Provisions
§ 351.201
Use of regulations.
(a)(1) Each agency is responsible for determining the categories within which positions are required, where they are to be located, and when they are to be filled, abolished, or vacated. This includes determining when there is a surplus of employees at a particular location in a particular line of work.
(2) Each agency shall follow this part when it releases a competing employee from his or her competitive level by furlough for more than 30 days, separation, demotion, or reassignment requiring displacement, when the release is required because of lack of work; shortage of funds; insufficient personnel ceiling; reorganization; the exercise of reemployment rights or restoration rights; or reclassification of an employee's position die to erosion of duties when such action will take effect after an agency has formally announced a reduction in force in the employee's competitive area and when the reduction in force will take effect within 180 days.
(b) This part does not require an agency to fill a vacant position. However, when an agency, at its discretion, chooses to fill a vacancy by an employee who has been reached for release from a competitive level for one of the reasons in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, this part shall be followed.
(c) Each agency is responsible for assuring that the provisions in this part are uniformly and consistently applied in any one reduction in force.
(d) An agency authorized to administer foreign national employee programs under section 408 of the Foreign Service Act of 1980 (22 U.S.C. 3968) may include special plans for reduction in force in its foreign national employee programs. In these special plans an agency may give effect to the labor laws and practices of the locality of employment by supplementing the selection factors in subparts D and E of this part to the extent consistent with the public interest. Subpart I of this part does not apply to actions taken under the special plans authorized by this paragraph.
§ 351.202
Coverage.
(a)
Employees covered.
Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, this part applies to each civilian employee in:
(1) The executive branch of the Federal Government; and
(2) Those parts of the Federal Government outside the executive branch which are subject by statute to competitive service requirements or are determined by the appropriate legislative or judicial administrative body to be covered hereunder. Coverage includes administrative law judges except as modified by part 930 of this chapter.
(b)
Employees excluded.
This part does not apply to an employee:
(1) In a position in the Senior Executive Service; or
(2) Whose appointment is required by Congress to be confirmed by, or made with the advice and consent of, the United States Senate, except a postmaster.
(c)
Actions excluded.
This part does not apply to:
(1) The termination of a temporary or term promotion or the return of an employee to the position held before the temporary or term promotion or to one of equivalent grade and pay.
(2) A change to lower grade based on the reclassification of an employee's position due to the application of new classification standards or the correction of a classification error.
(3) A change to lower grade based on reclassification of an employee's position due to erosion of duties, except that this exclusion does not apply to such reclassification actions that will take effect after an agency has formally announced a reduction in force in the employee's competitive area and when the reduction in force will take effect within 180 days. This exception
ends at the completion of the reduction in force.
(4) The change of an employee from regular to substitute in the same pay level in the U.S. Postal Service field service.
(5) The release from a competitive level of a National Guard technician under section 709 of title 32, United States Code.
(6) Placement of an employee serving on an intermittent, part-time, on-call, or seasonal basis in a nonpay and nonduty status in accordance with conditions established at time of appointment.
(7) A change in an employee's work schedule from other-than-full-time to full-time. (A change from full-time to other than full-time for a reason covered in § 351.201(A)(2) is covered by this part.)
[51 FR 319, Jan. 3, 1986, as amended at 60 FR 3062, Jan. 13, 1995]
§ 351.203
Definitions.
In this part:
Competing employee
means an employee in tenure group I, II, or III.
Current rating of record
is the rating of record for the most recently completed appraisal period as provided in § 351.504(b)(3).
Days
means calendar days.
Function
means all or a clearly identifiable segment of an agency's mission (including all integral parts of that mission), regardless of how it is performed.
Furlough
under this part means the placement of an employee in a temporary nonduty and nonpay status for more than 30 consecutive calendar days, or more than 22 workdays if done on a discontinuous basis, but not more than 1 year.
Local commuting area
means the geographic area that usually constitutes one area for employment purposes. It includes any population center (or two or more neighboring ones) and the surrounding localities in which people live and can reasonably be expected to travel back and forth daily to their usual employment.
Modal rating
is the summary rating level assigned most frequently among the actual ratings of record that are:
(1) Assigned under the summary level pattern that applies to the employee's position of record on the date of the reduction in force;
(2) Given within the same competitive area, or at the agency's option within a larger subdivision of the agency or agencywide; and
(3) On record for the most recently completed appraisal period prior to the date of issuance of reduction in force notices or the cutoff date the agency specifies prior to the issuance of reduction in force notices after which no new ratings will be put on record.
Rating of record
has the meaning given that term in § 430.203 of this chapter. For an employee not subject to 5 U.S.C. Chapter 43, or part 430 of this chapter, it means the officially designated performance rating, as provided for in the agency's appraisal system, that is considered to be an equivalent rating of record under the provisions of § 430.201(c) of this chapter.
Reorganization
means the planned elimination, addition, or redistribution of functions or duties in an organization.
Representative rate
means:
(1) The fourth step of the grade for a position covered by the General Schedule, using the locality rate authorized by 5 U.S.C. 5304 and subpart F of part 531 of this chapter for General Schedule positions;
(2) The prevailing rate for a position covered by a wage-board or similar wage-determining procedure, such as provided in the definition of representative rate for Federal Wage System positions in 5 CFR 532.401 of this chapter;
(3) For positions in a pay band, the rate (or rates) the agency designates as representative of that pay band or competitive levels within the pay band, including (as appropriate) any applicable locality payment authorized by 5 U.S.C. 5304 and subpart F of part 531 of this chapter (or equivalent payment under other legal authority); and
(4) For other positions (e.g., positions in an unclassified pay system), the rate the agency designates as representative of the position, including (as appropriate) any applicable locality payment authorized by subpart F of part 531 (or equivalent payment under other legal authority).
Transfer of function
means the transfer of the performance of a continuing function from one competitive area and its addition to one or more other competitive areas, except when the function involved is virtually identical to functions already being performed in the other competitive area(s) affected; or the movement of the competitive area in which the function is performed to another commuting area.
Undue interruption
means a degree of interruption that would prevent the completion of required work by the employee 90 days after the employee has been placed in a different position under this part. The 90-day standard should be considered within the allowable limits of time and quality, taking into account the pressures of priorities, deadlines, and other demands. However, a work program would generally not be unduly interrupted even if an employee needed more than 90 days after the reduction in force to perform the optimum quality or quantity of work. The 90-day standard may be extended if placement is made under this part to a low priority program or to a vacant position.
[51 FR 319, Jan. 3, 1986, as amended at 58 FR 65533, Dec. 15, 1993; 60 FR 3062, Jan. 13, 1995; 62 FR 62500, Nov. 24, 1997; 73 FR 29388, May 21, 2008]
§ 351.204
Responsibility of agency.
Each agency covered by this part is responsible for following and applying the regulations in this part when the agency determines that a reduction force is necessary.
§ 351.205
Authority of OPM.
The Office of Personnel Management may establish further guidance and instructions for the planning, preparation, conduct, and review of reductions in force. OPM may examine an agency's preparations for reduction in force at any stage. When OPM finds that an agency's preparations are contrary to the express provisions or to the spirit and intent of these regulations or that they would result in violation of employee rights or equities, OPM may require appropriate corrective action.

# Subpart C—Transfer of Function

# Source:
52 FR 10024, Mar. 30, 1987, unless otherwise noted.
§ 351.301
Applicability.
(a) This subpart is applicable when the work of one or more employees is moved from one competitive area to another as a transfer of function regardless of whether or not the movement is made under authority of a statute, Executive order, reorganization plan, or other authority.
(b) In a transfer of function, the function must cease in the losing competitive area and continue in an identical form in the gaining competitive area (
i.e.,
in the gaining competitive area, the function continues to be carried out by competing employees rather than by noncompeting employees).
[52 FR 10024, Mar. 30, 1987, as amended at 60 FR 3062, Jan. 13, 1995]
§ 351.302
Transfer of employees.
(a) Before a reduction in force is made in connection with the transfer of any or all of the functions of a competitive area to another continuing competitive area, each competing employee in a position identified with the transferring function or functions shall be transferred to the continuing competitive area without any change in the tenure of his or her employment.
(b) An employee whose position is transferred under this subpart solely for liquidation, and who is not identified with an operating function specifically authorized at the time of transfer to continue in operation more than 60 days, is not a competing employee for other positions in the competitive area gaining the function.
(c) Regardless of an employee's personal preference, an employee has no right to transfer with his or her function, unless the alternative in the competitive area losing the function is separation or demotion.
(d) Except as permitted in paragraph (e) of this section, the losing competitive area must use the adverse action procedures found in 5 CFR part 752 if it chooses to separate an employee who declines to transfer with his or her function.
(e) The losing competitive area may, at its discretion, include employees who decline to transfer with their function as part of a concurrent reduction in force.
(f) An agency may not separate an employee who declines to transfer with the function any sooner than it transfers employees who chose to transfer with the function to the gaining competitive area.
(g) Agencies may ask employees in a canvass letter whether the employee wishes to transfer with the function when the function transfers to a different local commuting area. The canvass letter must give the employee information concerning entitlements available to the employee if the employee accepts the offer to transfer, and if the employee declines the offer to transfer. An employee may later change and initial acceptance offer without penalty. However, an employee may not later change an initial declination of the offer to transfer.
[52 FR 10024, Mar. 30, 1987, as amended at 60 FR 3062, Jan. 13, 1995]
§ 351.303
Identification of positions with a transferring function.
(a) The competitive area losing the function is responsible for identifying the positions of competing employees with the transferring function. A competing employee is identified with the transferring function on the basis of the employee's official position. Two methods are provided to identify employees with the transferring function:
(1) Identification Method One; and
(2) Identification Method Two.
(b) Identification Method One must be used to identify each position to which it is applicable. Identification Method Two is used only to identify positions to which Identification Method One is not applicable.
(c) Under Identification Method One, a competing employee is identified with a transferring function if—
(1) The employee performs the function during at least half of his or her work time; or
(2) Regardless of the amount of time the employee performs the function during his or her work time, the function performed by the employee includes the duties controlling his or her grade or rate of pay.
(3) In determining what percentage of time an employee performs a function in the employee's official position, the agency may supplement the employee's official position description by the use of appropriate records (e.g., work reports, organizational time logs, work schedules, etc.).
(d) Identification Method Two is applicable to employees who perform the function during less than half of their work time and are not otherwise covered by Identification Method One. Under Identification Method Two, the losing competitive area must identify the number of positions it needed to perform the transferring function. To determine which employees are identified for transfer, the losing competitive area must establish a retention register in accordance with this part that includes the name of each competing employee who performed the function. Competing employees listed on the retention register are identified for transfer in the inverse order of their retention standing. If for any retention register this procedure would result in the separation or demotion by reduction in force at the losing competitive area of any employee with higher retention standing, the losing competitive area must identify competing employees on that register for transfer in the order of their retention standing.
(e)(1) The competitive area losing the function may permit other employees to volunteer for transfer with the function in place of employees identified under Identification Method One or Identification Method Two. However, the competitive area may permit these other employees to volunteer for transfer only if no competing employee who is identified for transfer under Identification Method One or Identification Method Two is separated or demoted solely because a volunteer transferred in place of him or her to the competitive area that is gaining the function.
(2) If the total number of employees who volunteer for transfer exceeds the total number of employees required to perform the function in the competitive area that is gaining the function, the losing competitive area may give preference to the volunteers with the
highest retention standing, or make selections based on other appropriate criteria.
[52 FR 10024, Mar. 30, 1987, as amended at 60 FR 3062, Jan. 13, 1995]

# Subpart D—Scope of Competition
§ 351.401
Determining retention standing.
Each agency shall determine the retention standing of each competing employee on the basis of the factors in this subpart and in subpart E of this part.
§ 351.402
Competitive area.
(a) Each agency shall establish competitive areas in which employees compete for retention under this part.
(b) A competitive area must be defined solely in terms of the agency's organizational unit(s) and geographical location and, except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, it must include all employees within the competitive area so defined. A competitive area may consist of all or part of an agency. The minimum competitive area is a subdivision of the agency under separate administration within the local commuting area.
(c) When a competitive area will be in effect less than 90 days prior to the effective date of a reduction in force, a description of the competitive area shall be submitted to the OPM for approval in advance of the reduction in force. Descriptions of all competitive areas must be made readily available for review.
(d) Each agency shall establish a separate competitive area for each Inspector General activity established under authority of the Inspector General Act of 1978, Public Law 95-452, as amended, in which only employees of that office shall compete for retention under this part.
(e) When an agency finds that a competitive area defined under paragraph (b) of this section includes pay band positions and positions not covered by a pay band, the agency may, at its discretion, define a separate (and additional) competitive area, otherwise consistent with paragraph (b) of this section, to include only pay band positions. The original competitive area would then include only the remaining positions (
i.e.
, those positions not covered by a pay band).
[51 FR 319 Jan. 3, 1986, as amended at 56 FR 65416, Dec. 17, 1991; 62 FR 62500, Nov. 24, 1997; 73 FR 46532, Aug. 11, 2008]
§ 351.403
Competitive level.
(a)(1) Each agency shall establish competitive levels consisting of all positions in a competitive area which are in the same grade (or occupational level) and classification series, and which are similar enough in duties, qualification requirements, pay schedules, and working conditions so that an agency may reassign the incumbent of one position to any of the other positions in the level without undue interruption.
(2)(i) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section for pay band positions, competitive level determinations are based on each employee's official position of record (including the official position description), not the employee's personal qualifications.
(ii) To establish a competitive level comprised of pay band positions, an agency may supplement an employee's official position of record with other applicable records that document the employee's actual duties and responsibilities.
(3) Sex may not be the basis for a competitive level determination, except for a position OPM designates that certification of eligibles by sex is justified.
(4) A probationary period required by subpart I of part 315 of this chapter for initial appointment to a supervisory or managerial position is not a basis for establishing a separate competitive level.
(5) If a competitive area includes positions in one or more pay bands, each set of interchangeable positions in the pay band under paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section is a separate competitive level (e.g., with interchangeable positions under paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section, each pay band is one competitive level; if the positions are not interchangeable under paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section, the pay band may include multiple competitive levels).
(b) Each agency shall establish separate competitive levels according to the following categories:
(1)
By service.
Separate levels shall be established for positions in the competitive service and in the excepted service.
(2)
By appointment authority.
Separate levels shall be established for excepted service positions filled under different appointment authorities.
(3)
By pay schedule.
Separate levels shall be established for positions under different pay schedules.
(4)
By work schedule.
Separate levels shall be established for positions filled on a full-time, part-time, intermittent, seasonal, or on-call basis. No distinction may be made among employees in the competitive level on the basis of the number of hours or weeks scheduled to be worked.
(5)
By trainee status.
Separate levels shall be established for positions filled by an employee in a formally designated trainee or developmental program having all of the characteristics covered in § 351.702(e)(1) through (e)(4) of this part.
(c) An agency may not establish a competitive level based solely upon:
(1) A difference in the number of hours or weeks scheduled to be worked by other-than-full-time employees who would otherwise be in the same competitive level;
(2) A requirement to work changing shifts;
(3) The grade promotion potential of the position; or
(4) A difference in the local wage areas when a competitive area includes positions covered by more than one wage-board or similar wage-determining procedure;
(5) A difference in locality payments under 5 U.S.C. 5304 and subpart F of part 531 of this chapter when a competitive level includes more than one locality pay area listed in § 531.603 of this chapter; or
(6) Representative rates in different local commuting areas when a competitive area includes General Schedule (GS) and Federal Wage System (FWS) positions in multiple GS locality pay areas, and/or FWS local wage areas.
[51 FR 319, Jan. 3, 1986, as amended at 60 FR 3062, Jan. 13, 1995; 62 FR 62500, Nov. 24, 1997; 73 FR 29388, May 21, 2008; 73 FR 46532, Aug. 11, 2008]
§ 351.404
Retention register.
(a) When a competing employee is to be released from a competitive level under this part, the agency shall establish a separate retention register for that competitive level. The retention register is prepared from the current retention records of employees. Upon displacing another employee under this part, an employee retains the same status and tenure in the new position. Except for an employee on military duty with a restoration right, the agency shall enter on the retention register, in the order of retention standing, the name of each competing employee who is:
(1) In the competitive level;
(2) Temporarily promoted from the competitive level by temporary or term promotion; or
(3) Detailed from the competitive level under 5 U.S.C. 3341 or other appropriate authority.
(b)(1) The name of each employee serving under a time limited appointment or promotion to a position in a competitive level shall be entered on a list apart from the retention register for that competitive level, along with the expiration date of the action.
(2) The agency shall list, at the bottom of the list prepared under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the name of each employee in the competitive level with a written decision of removal under part 432 or 752 of this chapter.
[51 FR 319, Jan. 3, 1986, as amended at 62 FR 62500, Nov. 24, 1997]
§ 351.405
Demoted employees.
An employee who has received a written decision under part 432 or 752 of this chapter to demote him or her competes under this part from the position to which he or she will be or has been demoted.
[62 FR 62500, Nov. 24, 1997]

# Subpart E—Retention Standing
§ 351.501
Order of retention—competitive service.
(a) Competing employees shall be classified on a retention register on the basis of their tenure of employment, veteran preference, length of service, and performance in descending order as follows:
(1) By tenure group I, group II, group III; and
(2) Within each group by veteran preference subgroup AD, subgroup A, subgroup B; and
(3) Within each subgroup by years of service as augmented by credit for performance under § 351.504, beginning with the earliest service date.
(b) Groups are defined as follows:
(1) Group I includes each career employee who is not serving a probationary period. (A supervisory or managerial employee serving a probationary period required by subpart I of part 315 of this title is in group I if the employee is otherwise eligible to be included in this group.) The following employees are in group I as soon as the employee completes any required probationary period for initial appointment:
(i) An employee for whom substantial evidence exists of eligibility to immediately acquire status and career tenure, and whose case is pending final resolution by OPM (including cases under Executive Order 10826 to correct certain administrative errors);
(ii) An employee who acquires competitive status and satisfies the service requirement for career tenure when the employee's position is brought into the competitive service;
(iii) An administrative law judge;
(iv) An employee appointed under 5 U.S.C. 3104, which provides for the employment of specially qualified scientific or professional personnel, or a similar authority; and
(v) An employee who acquires status under 5 U.S.C. 3304(c) on transfer to the competitive service from the legislative or judicial branches of the Federal Government.
