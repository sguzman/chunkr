# Explanation
The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.
Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:
Title 1 through Title 16
as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27
as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41
as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50
as of October 1
The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.

# LEGAL STATUS
The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

# HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS
The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, July 1, 2025), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

# EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES
Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.

# OMB CONTROL NUMBERS
The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request.
Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.

# PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE
Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.

# “[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY
The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not dropped in error.

# INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE
What is incorporation by reference?
Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.
What is a proper incorporation by reference?
The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:
(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.
(b) The matter incorporated is adequately summarized in the preamble of the final rule and is available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.
(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?
If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or email fr.inspection@nara.gov.

# CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES
A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR
Index and Finding Aids.
This volume contains the Parallel Table of Authorities and Rules. A list of CFR titles, chapters, subchapters, and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in this volume.
An index to the text of “Title 3—The President” is carried within that volume.
The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. This index is based on a consolidation of the “Contents” entries in the daily Federal Register.
A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

# REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL
There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing in the Code of Federal Regulations.

# Subpart A—General Provisions
§ 500.0
Introduction.
(a) The Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act (MSPA), hereinafter referred to as MSPA or the Act, repeals and replaces the Farm Labor Contractor Registration Act of 1963, as amended, hereinafter referred to as FLCRA or the Farm Labor Contractor Registration Act. Prior judgments and final orders obtained under FLCRA continue in effect as stated in § 500.4.
(b) These regulations include provisions necessitated by the Immigration Reform and Control Act's (IRCA) amendment to the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). IRCA amended MSPA to remove section 106 thereof prohibiting the employment of illegal aliens. Matters concerning certificate actions or the assessment of civil money penalties, for a violation of section 106 of MSPA which occurred prior to June 1, 1987, continue through final administrative determination as stated in § 500.147.
[48 FR 36741, Aug. 12, 1983, as amended at 54 FR 13328, Mar. 31, 1989]
§ 500.1
Purpose and scope.
(a) Congress stated, in enacting the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act that “[I]t is the purpose of this Act to remove the restraints on commerce caused by activities detrimental to migrant and seasonal agricultural workers; to require farm labor contractors to register under this Act; and to assure necessary protections for migrant and seasonal agricultural workers, agricultural associations, and agricultural employers.” It authorized the Secretary to issue such rules and regulations as are necessary to carry out the Act consistent with the requirements of chapter 5 of title 5, United States Code.
(b) These regulations implement this purpose and policy. The regulations contained in this part are issued in accordance with section 511 of the Act and establish the rules and regulations necessary to carry out the Act.
(c) Any farm labor contractor, as defined in the Act, is required to obtain a Certificate of Registration issued pursuant to the Act from the Department of Labor or from a State agency authorized to issue such certificates on behalf of the Department of Labor. Such a farm labor contractor must ensure that any individual whom he employs to perform any farm labor contracting activities also obtains a Certificate of Registration. The farm labor contractor is responsible, as well, for any violation of the Act or these regulations by any such employee whether or not the employee obtains a certificate. In addition to registering, farm labor contractors must comply with all other applicable provisions of the Act when they recruit, solicit, hire, employ, furnish or transport or, in the case of migrant agricultural workers, provide housing.
(d) Agricultural employers and agricultural associations which are subject to the Act must comply with all of the worker protections which are applicable under the Act to migrant or seasonal agricultural workers whom they recruit, solicit, hire, employ, furnish, or transport or, in the case of migrant agricultural workers, provide housing. The obligations will vary, depending on the types of activities affecting migrant or seasonal agricultural workers. Agricultural employers and agricultural associations and their employees need not obtain Certificates of Registration in order to engage in these activities, even if the workers they obtain are utilized by other persons or on the premises of another.
(e) The Act empowers the Secretary of Labor to enforce the Act, conduct investigations, issue subpenas and, in the case of designated violations of the Act, impose sanctions. As provided in the Act, the Secretary is empowered, among other things, to impose an assessment and to collect a civil money
penalty of not more than $3,126 for each violation, to seek a temporary or permanent restraining order in a U.S. District Court, and to seek the imposition of criminal penalties on persons who willfully and knowingly violate the Act or any regulation under the Act. In accordance with the Act and with these regulations, the Secretary may refuse to issue or to renew, or may suspend or revoke a certificate of registration issued to a farm labor contractor or to a person who engages in farm labor contracting as an employee of a farm labor contractor.
(f) The facilities and services of the U.S. Employment Service, including State agencies, authorized by the Wagner-Peyser Act may be denied to any person found by a final determination by an appropriate enforcement agency to have violated any employment-related laws including MSPA when notification of this final determination has been provided to the Job Service by that enforcement agency. See 20 CFR 658.501(a)(4). The facilities and services of the U.S. Employment Service shall be restored immediately upon compliance with 20 CFR 658.502(a)(4).
(g) Subparts A through E set forth the substantive regulations relating to farm labor contractors, agricultural employers and agricultural associations. These subparts cover the applicability of the Act, registration requirements applicable to farm labor contractors, the obligations of persons who hold Certificates of Registration, the worker protections which must be complied with by all who are subject to the Act, and the enforcement authority of the Secretary.
(h) Subpart F sets forth the rules of practice for administrative hearings relating to actions involving Certificates of Registration. It also outlines the procedure to be followed for filing a challenge to a proposed administrative action relating to violations and summarizes the methods provided for collection and recovery of a civil money penalty.
(i)(1) The Act requires that farm labor contractors obtain a certificate of registration from the Department of Labor prior to engaging in farm labor contracting activities. The Act also requires registration by individuals who will perform farm labor contracting activities for a farm labor contractor. Form WH-510 and WH-512 are the applications used to obtain Farm Labor Contractor and Farm Labor Contractor Employee Certificates of Registration. These forms have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under control numbers 1215-0038 (WH-510) and 1215-0037 (WH-512). Forms WH-514 and WH-514a are used when applying for transportation authorization to furnish proof of compliance with vehicle safety requirements. These forms have been jointly cleared by OMB under control number 1215-0036.
(2) The Act further requires disclosure to migrant and seasonal agricultural workers regarding wages, hours and other working conditions and housing when provided to migrant workers. The Department of Labor has developed optional forms for use in making the required disclosure. OMB has approved the following: Worker Information (WH-516) 1215-0145 and Housing Terms and Conditions (WH-521) 1215-0146.
(3) The Act also requires that farm labor contractors, agricultural employers and agricultural associations make, keep, preserve and disclose certain payroll records. Forms WH-501 and WH-501a (Spanish version) are provided to assist in carrying out this requirement. In addition, farm labor contractors who are applying for housing authorization must submit information which identifies the housing to be used along with proof of compliance with housing safety and health requirements. There has been no form developed for this purpose. The Act further requires disclosure by the insurance industry of certain information pertaining to cancellation of vehicle liability insurance policies. The requirements concerning recordkeeping, housing and insurance have been cleared by OMB under control number 1215-0148.
(4) The Act provides that no farm labor contractor shall knowingly employ or utilize the services of aliens not lawfully admitted for permanent residence or who have not been authorized by the Attorney General to accept employment. Form WH-509 is an optional form which may be used to self-certify that the applicant is a citizen of the
U.S. This form has been cleared by OMB under control number 1215-0091. (See § 500.59(a)(11)).

§ 500.20
Definitions.

(d)
Agricultural employer
means any person who owns or operates a farm, ranch, processing establishment, cannery, gin, packing shed or nursery, or who produces or conditions seed, and who either recruits, solicits, hires, employs, furnishes, or transports any migrant or seasonal agricultural worker.
Produces seed

Conditions seed
means the in-plant work done after seed production including the drying and aerating of seed.
(e)
Agricultural employment
means employment in any service or activity included within the provisions of section 3(f) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 203(f)), or section 3121(g) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (26 U.S.C. 3121(g)) and the handling, planting, drying, packing, packaging, processing, freezing, or grading prior to delivery for storage of any agricultural or horticultural commodity in its unmanufactured state.

means that a final judgment of guilty has been rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction from which no opportunity for appeal remains.
(g)
Day-haul operation
means the assembly of workers at a pick-up point waiting to be hired and employed, transportation of such workers to agricultural employment, and the return of such workers to a drop-off point on the same day. This term does not include transportation provided by an employer for individuals who are already employees at the time they are picked up nor does it include carpooling arrangements by such employees which are not specifically directed or requested by the employer, farm labor contractor or agent thereof.
(h)(1) The term
employ
has the meaning given such term under section 3(g) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 203(g)) for the purposes of implementing the requirements of that Act. As so defined,
employ
includes to suffer or permit to work.
(2) The term

Employer
under section 3(d) of that Act includes any person acting directly or indirectly in the interest of an employer in relation to an employee.
(3) The term

(4) The definition of the term
employ
may include consideration of whether or not an
independent contractor
or
employment
relationship exists under the Fair Labor Standards Act. Under MSPA, questions will arise whether or not a farm labor contractor engaged by an agricultural employer/association is a bona fide independent contractor or an employee. Questions also arise whether or not the worker is a bona fide independent contractor or an employee of the farm labor contractor and/or the agricultural employer/association. These questions should be resolved in accordance with the factors set out below and the principles articulated by the federal courts in
Rutherford Food Corp.
v.
McComb,
331 U.S. 722 (1947),
Real
v.
Driscoll Strawberry Associates, Inc.,
603 F.2d 748 (9th Cir. 1979),
Sec'y of Labor, U.S. Dept. of Labor
v.
Lauritzen,
835 F.2d 1529 (7th Cir. 1987),
cert.
denied, 488 U.S. 898 (1988);
Beliz
v.
McLeod,
765 F.2d 1317 (5th Cir. 1985), and
Castillo
v.
Givens,
704 F.2d 181 (5th Cir.),
cert. denied,
464 U.S. 850 (1983). If it is determined that the farm labor contractor is an
employee
of the agricultural employer/association, the agricultural workers in the farm labor contractor's crew who perform work for the agricultural employer/association are deemed to be employees of the agricultural employer/association and an inquiry into joint employment is not necessary or appropriate. In determining if the farm labor contractor or worker is an employee or an independent contractor, the ultimate question is the economic reality of the relationship—whether there is economic dependence upon the agricultural employer/association or farm labor contractor, as appropriate.
Lauritzen
at 1538;
Beliz
at 1329;
Castillo
at 192;
Real
at 756. This determination is based upon an evaluation of all of the circumstances, including the following:
(i) The nature and degree of the putative employer's control as to the manner in which the work is performed;
(ii) The putative employee's opportunity for profit or loss depending upon his/her managerial skill;
(iii) The putative employee's investment in equipment or materials required for the task, or the putative employee's employment of other workers;
(iv) Whether the services rendered by the putative employee require special skill;
(v) The degree of permanency and duration of the working relationship;
(vi) The extent to which the services rendered by the putative employee are an integral part of the putative employer's business.
(5) The definition of the term
employ
includes the
joint employment
principles applicable under the Fair Labor Standards Act. The term
joint employment
means a condition in which a single individual stands in the relation of an employee to two or more persons at the same time. A determination of whether the employment is to be considered joint employment depends upon all the facts in the particular case. If the facts establish that two or more persons are completely disassociated with respect to the employment of a particular employee, a joint employment situation does not exist. When the putative employers share responsibility for activities set out in the following factors or in other relevant facts, this is an indication that the putative employers are not completely disassociated with respect to the employment and that the agricultural worker may be economically dependent on both persons:
(i) If it is determined that a farm labor contractor is an independent contractor, it still must be determined whether or not the employees of the farm labor contractor are also jointly employed by the agricultural employer/association.
Joint employment
under the Fair Labor Standards Act is joint employment under the MSPA.
Such joint employment
relationships, which are common in agriculture, have been addressed both in the legislative history and by the courts.
(ii) The legislative history of the Act (H. Rep. No. 97-885, 97th Cong., 2d Sess., 1982) states that the legislative purpose in enacting MSPA was “to reverse the historical pattern of abuse and exploitation of migrant and seasonal farm workers * * *,” which would only be accomplished by “advanc[ing] * * * a completely new approach” (Rept. at 3). Congress's incorporation of the FLSA term
employ
was undertaken with the deliberate intent of adopting the FLSA
joint employer
doctrine as the “central foundation” of MSPA and “the best means by which to insure that the purposes of this MSPA would be fulfilled” (Rept. at 6). Further, Congress intended that the
joint employer
test under MSPA be the formulation as set forth in
Hodgson
v.
Griffin
Brand of McAllen, Inc.
471 F.2d 235 (5th Cir.),
cert. denied,
414 U.S. 819 (1973) (Rept. at 7). In endorsing
Griffin
Brand,
Congress stated that this formulation should be controlling in situations “where an agricultural employer * * * asserts that the agricultural workers in question are the
sole
employees of an independent contractor/crewleader,” and that the “decision makes clear that even if a farm labor contractor is found to be a bona fide independent contractor, * * * this status does not as a matter of law negate the possibility that an agricultural employer may be a joint employer * * * of the harvest workers” together with the farm labor contractor. Further, regarding the
joint employer
doctrine and the
Griffin
Brand
formulation, Congress stated that “the absence of evidence on any of the criteria listed does not preclude a finding that an agricultural association or agricultural employer was a joint employer along with the crewleader”, and that “it is expected that the special aspects of agricultural employment be kept in mind” when applying the tests and criteria set forth in the case law and legislative history (Rept. at 8).
(iii) In determining whether or not an employment relationship exists between the agricultural employer/association and the agricultural worker, the ultimate question to be determined is the economic reality—whether the worker is so economically dependent upon the agricultural employer/association as to be considered its employee.
(iv) The factors set forth in paragraphs (h)(5)(iv)(A) through (G) of this section are analytical tools to be used in determining the ultimate question of economic dependency. The consideration of each factor, as well as the determination of the ultimate question of economic dependency, is a qualitative rather than quantitative analysis. The factors are not to be applied as a
checklist. No one factor will be dispositive of the ultimate question; nor must a majority or particular combination of factors be found for an employment relationship to exist. The analysis as to the existence of an employment relationship is not a strict liability or
per se
determination under which any agricultural employer/association would be found to be an employer merely by retaining or benefiting from the services of a farm labor contractor. The factors set forth in paragraphs (h)(5)(iv)(A) through (G) of this section are illustrative only and are not intended to be exhaustive; other factors may be significant and, if so, should be considered, depending upon the specific circumstances of the relationship among the parties. How the factors are weighed depends upon all of the facts and circumstances. Among the factors to be considered in determining whether or not an employment relationship exists are:
(A) Whether the agricultural employer/association has the power, either alone or through control of the farm labor contractor to direct, control, or supervise the worker(s) or the work performed (such control may be either direct or indirect, taking into account the nature of the work performed and a reasonable degree of contract performance oversight and coordination with third parties);
(B) Whether the agricultural employer/association has the power, either alone or in addition to another employer, directly or indirectly, to hire or fire, modify the employment conditions, or determine the pay rates or the methods of wage payment for the worker(s);
(C) The degree of permanency and duration of the relationship of the parties, in the context of the agricultural activity at issue;
(D) The extent to which the services rendered by the worker(s) are repetitive, rote tasks requiring skills which are acquired with relatively little training;
(E) Whether the activities performed by the worker(s) are an integral part of the overall business operation of the agricultural employer/association;
(F) Whether the work is performed on the agricultural employer/association's premises, rather than on premises owned or controlled by another business entity; and
(G) Whether the agricultural employer/association undertakes responsibilities in relation to the worker(s) which are commonly performed by employers, such as preparing and/or making payroll records, preparing and/or issuing pay checks, paying FICA taxes, providing workers' compensation insurance, providing field sanitation facilities, housing or transportation, or providing tools and equipment or materials required for the job (taking into account the amount of the investment).
(i)
Farm labor contracting activity
means recruiting, soliciting, hiring, employing, furnishing, or transporting any migrant or seasonal agricultural worker.
(j)
Farm labor contractor
means any person—other than an agricultural employer, an agricultural association, or an employee of an agricultural employer or agricultural association—who, for any money or other valuable consideration paid or promised to be paid, performs any farm labor contracting activity.
(k)

# Applicability of the Act: Exemptions
§ 500.30
Persons not subject to the Act.
(a)
Family business exemption.
Any individual who engages in a farm labor contracting activity on behalf of a farm, processing establishment, seed conditioning establishment, cannery, gin, packing shed, or nursery, which is owned or operated exclusively by such individual or an immediate family member of such individual, if such activities are performed only for such operation and exclusively by such individual or an immediate family member, but without regard to whether such individual has incorporated or otherwise organized for business purposes.
(b)
Small business exemption.
Any person, other than a farm labor contractor, for whom the man-days exemption for agricultural labor provided under section 13(a)(6)(A) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 213(a)(6)(A)) is applicable. That exemption applies to an agricultural employer who did not, during any calendar quarter of the preceding calendar year, use more man-days of agricultural labor than the limit specified under that statute.
(1) Currently the limit for exemption is 500 man-days.
(2) A
man-day
means any day during which an employee performs agricultural labor for not less than one (1) hour. Agricultural labor performed by an employer's parent, spouse, child, or other member of his immediate family, i.e., step-children, foster children, step-parents and foster parents, brothers, and sisters is not counted as man-days.
(3) The man-days of agricultural labor rendered in a joint employment relationship are counted toward the man-days of such labor of each employer for purposes of the man-day test of this exemption.
(c)
Common carriers.
Any common carrier which would be a farm labor contractor solely because the carrier is engaged in the farm labor contracting activity of transporting any migrant or seasonal agricultural worker. A “common carrier” by motor vehicle is one which holds itself out to the general public to engage in transportation of passengers for hire, whether over regular or irregular routes, and which holds a valid certificate of authorization for such purposes from an appropriate local, State or Federal agency.
(d)
Labor organizations.
Any labor organization, as defined in section 2(5) of the Labor Management Relations Act (29 U.S.C. 152(5)) (without regard to the exclusion of agricultural employees in that Act) or as defined under applicable State labor relations law.
(e)
Nonprofit charitable organizations.
Any nonprofit charitable organization or public or private nonprofit educational institution.
(f)
Local short-term contracting activity.
Any person who engages in any farm labor contracting activity solely within a twenty-five mile intrastate radius of such person's permanent place of residence and for not more than thirteen weeks per year.
(1)
Twenty-five mile intrastate radius
as used in section 4(a)(3)(D) of the Act means that engagement in a farm labor contracting activity may not go beyond a twenty-five mile intrastate geographical radius. Once this limit is transcended, the exemption no longer applies and the person becomes subject to the requirements of the Act. If, for example, a person or his employee solicits workers from a distance greater than twenty-five miles from his permanent residence or from across a State line, then the person has engaged in a named activity outside of the permitted scope of the exemption, and is subject to the requirements of the Act. A person who uses lines of communication (such as U.S. Mail, telephone, or advertising) to recruit, solicit, hire, or furnish workers over a distance greater than twenty-five miles from his permanent residence or from across a State line for agricultural employment is also engaged in a named activity beyond the specified limit of the exemption and is subject to the Act. In the case of a corporation its permanent place of residence for these purposes shall be a single designated location.
(2)
For not more than thirteen weeks per year
as used in section 4(a)(3)(D) of the Act means that farm labor contracting activities may not be engaged in for more than thirteen weeks in a year. This does not mean, however,
that persons who engage in intrastate and short-range farm labor contracting activities are exempt for the first thirteen weeks of their farm labor contracting activities each year. The number of weeks of contracting activity during the prior year is also a factor. When the limit of weeks for the exemption is exceeded in a calendar year, the person is subject immediately to the Act and is also presumed subject to the Act in the next calendar year, unless it can be shown that the tests of section 4(a)(3)(D) are met.
(g)
Custom combine.
Any custom combine, hay harvesting, or sheep shearing operation.
Custom combine, hay harvesting, and sheep shearing operation
means the agricultural services and activities involved in combining grain, harvesting hay and shearing sheep which are provided to a farmer on a contract basis by a person who provides the necessary equipment and labor and who specializes on providing such services and activities.
(h)
Custom poultry operations.
Any custom poultry harvesting, breeding, debeaking, desexing, or health service operation, provided the employees of the operation are not regularly required to be away from their permanent place of residence other than during their normal working hours.
(i)
Seed production exemption.
(1) Any person whose principal occupation or business is not agricultural employment, when supplying full-time students or other individuals whose principal occupation is not agricultural employment to detassel, rogue, or otherwise engage in the production of seed and to engage in related and incidental agricultural employment, unless such full-time students or other individuals are required to be away from their permanent place of residence overnight or there are individuals under eighteen years of age who are providing transportation on behalf of such person.
(2) Any person to the extent he is supplied with students or other individuals for agricultural employment in accordance with paragraph (i)(1) of this section by a person who is exempt thereunder.
(j)
Shade grown tobacco.
(1) Any person whose principal occupation or business is not agricultural employment, when supplying full-time students or other individuals whose principal occupation is not agricultural employment to string or harvest shade grown tobacco and to engage in related and incidental agricultural employment, unless there are individuals under eighteen years of age who are providing transportation on behalf of such person.
(2) Any person to the extent he is supplied with students or other individuals for agricultural employment is accordance with paragraph (j)(1) of this section by a person who is exempt thereunder.
(k)
Employees of exempt employers.
Any employee of any person described in paragraphs (c) through (j) of this section when performing farm labor contracting activities within the scope of such exemptions and exclusively for such person.

# Subpart B—Registration of Farm Labor Contractors and Employees of Farm Labor Contractors Engaged in Farm Labor Contracting Activities

# Registration Requirements; General
§ 500.40
Registration in general.
Any person who desires to engage in any activity as a farm labor contractor, as defined in the Act and these regulations, and is not exempt, is required first to obtain a Certificate of Registration authorizing each such activity. Any employee of a registered farm labor contractor who performs farm labor contracting activities solely on behalf of such contractor, and who is not an independent contractor, must obtain a Farm Labor Contractor Employee Certificate of Registration authorizing each such activity. The employee's certificate must show the name of the farm labor contractor for whom the activities are to be performed. The contractor whose name appears on the employee's certificate must hold a valid Certificate of Registration covering the entire period shown on the employee's certificate.
§ 500.41
Farm labor contractor is responsible for actions of his farm labor contractor employee.
(a) A farm labor contractor is responsible for assuring that every employee who is performing farm labor contracting activities on behalf of such contractor has obtained either a Farm Labor Contractor Employee Certificate of Registration or a Certificate of Registration as an independent farm labor contractor, as required by the Act and these regulations, prior to such employee's engagement in any activity enumerated in section 3(6) of the Act. A farm labor contractor who utilizes the services of another farm labor contractor who is not his employee must also comply with the provisions of § 500.71. The farm labor contractor is responsible for any violations of the Act or these regulations committed by his employee, whether or not the employee has registered as required by the Act.
(b) Farm Labor Contractor Employee Certificate of Registration is valid only
during the period in which the holder is an employee of the registered farm labor contractor named on the Farm Labor Contractor Employee Certificate. If prior to the expiration of the Employee Certificate, the holder through a change in employment, should become an employee of a different registered farm labor contractor, a replacements Employee Certificate which names the new employer may be obtained by submitting to the regional office that issued the original employee certificate or to any regional office of the Wage and Hour Division, a written statement that includes the date of the change in employment status and the name, the permanent place of residence and certificate registration number of the new employer. Any such change should be reported immediately.

§ 500.43
Effect of failure to produce certificate.
The facilities and the services authorized by the Wagner-Peyser Act shall be denied to any farm labor contractor upon refusal or failure to produce, when asked, a Certificate of Registration. Services shall be provided upon presentation of a valid Certificate of Registration.

§ 500.47
Place for filing application.
Application forms may be filed in any State Employment Service Office or in any office of the Wage and Hour Division, U.S. Department of Labor.

# Action on Application
§ 500.48
Issuance of certificate.
The Administrator or authorized representative shall:
(a) Review each application received and determine whether such application is complete and properly executed;
(b) When appropriate, notify the applicant in writing of any incompleteness or error in the application and return the application for correction and completion;
(c) Determine, after appropriate investigation, whether the applicant has complied with the requirements of the Act and these regulations, and if appropriate, issue a Certificate of
Registration or a Farm Labor Contractor Employee Certificate of Registration authorizing the performance of one or more activities permitted under the Act;
(d) Authorize the activity of transporting a migrant or seasonal agricultural worker, subject to the maximum number of workers authorized to be transported under the vehicle liability policy and as indicated on the face of the Certificate of Registration, only upon receipt of:
(1) A statement in the manner prescribed by the Secretary identifying each vehicle to be used, or caused to be used, by the applicant for the transportation of any migrant or seasonal agricultural worker during the period for which registration is sought;
(2) Written proof that every such vehicle which is under the applicant's ownership or control, is in compliance with the vehicle safety requirements of the Act and these regulations; and
(3) Written proof that every such vehicle is in compliance with the insurance requirements of the Act and these regulations;
(e) Authorize the activity of driving a vehicle to transport a migrant or seasonal agricultural worker only upon receipt of (1) A doctor's certificate on the prescribed form, with an initial application for a Certificate of Registration or a Farm Labor Contractor Employee Certificate, and, when applying for a renewal, a new completed doctor's certificate if the previous doctor's certificate is more than three years old; and (2) evidence of a valid and appropriate license, as provided by State law, to operate the vehicle; and
(f) Authorize the activity of housing a migrant agricultural worker only upon receipt of (1) A statement identifying each facility or real property to be used for housing a migrant agricultural worker during the period for which registration is sought; and (2) if the facility or real property is or will be owned or controlled by the applicant, written proof that the facility or real property complies with the applicable Federal and State standards of health and safety. Such written proof may be either a certification issued by a State or local health authority or other appropriate agency, or a copy of a written request for the inspection of a facility or real property made to the appropriate State or local agency at least forty-five days prior to the date on which the facility or real property is to be occupied by migrant agricultural workers, dated and signed by the applicant or other person who owns or controls the facility or real property. If housing authorization is issued based on a written request for inspection and the housing facility or real property is subsequently inspected and does not meet the appropriate standards, the housing authorization is null and void. Should the required written proof for housing authorization be unavailable at the time of filing an application, the applicant must attest in writing that the applicant will not house any migrant agricultural worker in any facility or real property owned or controlled by the applicant, until such applicant shall have submitted all necessary written proof and obtained a Farm Labor Contractor Certificate of Registration showing that housing in
the facility or real property is authorized by the Secretary of Labor. In such event, if otherwise eligible, the applicant will be issued a Certificate of Registration without a housing authorization. This certificate may be amended to include an authorization to house at such time as the required proof is forthcoming.

[82 FR 2227, Jan. 9, 2017]

# Additional Obligations of Farm Labor Contractors and Farm Labor Contractor Employees
§ 500.60
Farm labor contractors' recruitment, contractual and general obligations.
The Act imposes certain specific recruitment, contractual and general obligations on farm labor contractors and farm labor contractor employees. The contractor is responsible for any violations under the Act committed by his employee. Each of the following obligations applies to both farm labor contractors and farm labor contractor employees.
(a) Each farm labor contractor shall provide to any other farm labor contractor and to any agricultural employer and agricultural association to which such farm labor contractor has furnished any migrant or seasonal agricultural worker, copies of all records for that place of employment which such farm labor contractor is required to retain for each worker furnished or supplied. The recipient of these records shall keep them for a period of three years.
(b) Each farm labor contractor, without regard to any other provisions of this Act, shall obtain at each place of employment and make available for inspection to every worker he furnishes for employment, a written statement of the conditions of such employment as described in sections 201(b) and 301(b) of the Act and §§ 500.75 and 500.76 of these regulations. As with the written disclosure statements under §§ 500.76 and 500.77, these statements must be provided to the workers in English or, as necessary and reasonable, in Spanish or another language common to migrant or seasonal agricultural workers who are not fluent in English.
(c)(1) No farm labor contractor shall violate, without justification, the terms of any written agreements made with an agricultural employer or an agricultural association pertaining to any contracting activity or worker protection under the Act. Normally, “without justification” would not include situations in which failure to comply with the terms of any written agreements was directly attributable to Acts of God, due to conditions beyond the control of the person or to conditions which he could not reasonably foresee.
(2) Written agreements do not relieve a farm labor contractor of any responsibility that such contractor would otherwise have under the Act and these regulations.
(d) All payroll records made by the farm labor contractor must be retained by him for a period of three years.
§ 500.61
Farm labor contractors must comply with all worker protections and all other statutory provisions.
Every farm labor contractor must comply with all of the provisions of titles I through V of the Act and all of the subparts of these regulations, unless subject to a specific statutory exemption. In addition to complying with all of the standards stated in subparts A and B of these regulations, every farm labor contractor must comply with each provision stated in subpart C and the motor vehicle safety and insurance and housing standards stated in subpart D.
§ 500.62
Obligations of a person holding a valid Farm Labor Contractor Employee Certificate of Registration.
Any person holding a valid Farm Labor Contractor Employee Certificate of Registration in accordance with the Act and these regulations is required to comply with the Act and these regulations to the same extent as if said person had been required to obtain a Certificate of Registration in such person's own name as a farm labor contractor.

# Subpart C—Worker Protections

# General
§ 500.70
Scope of worker protections.
(a)
General.
The Act provides protections for migrant and seasonal agricultural workers irrespective of whether they are employed by a farm labor contractor, an agricultural employer or an agricultural association, or, in the case where there is joint responsibility, by more than one of these persons. The Act's provisions include standards relating to vehicle safety, housing safety and health, disclosure of wages, hours and other conditions of employment, and recordkeeping. When any person not otherwise exempt from the Act recruits, solicits, hires, employs, furnishes or transports workers, that person is required to comply with the applicable protective provisions of the Act. In addition, any person not specifically exempt from coverage of the Act (irrespective of whether that person is an agricultural employer, an agricultural association or farm labor contractor) who owns or controls a facility or real property which is used as housing for any migrant agricultural workers must ensure that the facility or real property complies with all substantive Federal and State safety and health standards made applicable to that type of housing. (See § 500.132)
(b)
Wage related protections.
Joint employment under the Fair Labor Standards Act, which establishes responsibility for the maintenance of payroll records, payment of wages and posting of notices under that law, is joint employment under MSPA for establishing responsibility for the maintenance of records, payment of wages and the posting of required posters under MSPA. In such joint employment situations the responsibility for assuring these MSPA protections may be carried out by one of the joint employers. While under a joint employment relationship all joint employers are equally responsible for assuring that the appropriate protections are provided, the creation of such a joint employment relationship does not also require unnecessary duplication of effort as, for example, in relation to the posting of posters (see §§ 500.75(e) and 500.76(e)) or the provision of an itemized written statement of the worker's pay (see § 500.80(d)). Failure to provide protections coming within the joint employment relationship, however, will result in all joint employers being responsible for that failure.
(c)
Transportation related protections.
Responsibility for compliance with the motor vehicle safety and insurance provisions of section 401 of the Act and §§ 500.100 through 500.128 of these regulations is imposed upon the person or persons using or causing to be used, any vehicle for transportation of migrant or seasonal agricultural workers. As stated in these regulations, the transportation safety provisions do not include certain car pooling arrangements. Additionally, these regulations do not impose responsibility on an agricultural employer or agricultural association for a farm labor contractor's failure to adhere to the safety provisions provided in these regulations when the farm labor contractor is providing the vehicles and directing their use. However, when an agricultural employer or agricultural association specifically directs or requests a farm labor contractor to use the contractor's vehicle to carry out a task for the agricultural employer or agricultural association, such direction constitutes causing the vehicle to be used and the agricultural employer or agricultural association is jointly responsible with the farm labor contractor for assuring that the vehicle meets the insurance, and safety and health provisions of these regulations. In all cases a person using a farm labor contractor is required to take reasonable steps to determine that the vehicle used by the
farm labor contractor is authorized to be used for transportation as prescribed in section 402 of the Act and § 500.71 of these regulations.
(d)
Housing related protections.
Responsibility for compliance with the housing safety and health provisions of section 203 of the Act and §§ 500.130 through 500.135 of these regulations is imposed upon the person (or persons) who owns or controls a facility or real property used as housing for migrant agricultural workers. Any agricultural employer or agricultural association which has a farm labor contractor operate housing which it owns or controls is responsible, as well as the farm labor contractor, for insuring compliance with the housing safety and health provisions of these regulations. When the owner or operator of the housing is not an agricultural employer, agricultural association or farm labor contractor, the owner is responsible for that housing meeting the safety and health provisions under the Act and these regulations. This is subject to the exclusion stated in § 500.131 of these regulations which provides that the housing safety and health requirements do not apply to any person who, in the ordinary course of that person's business, regularly provides housing on a commercial basis to the general public and who provides housing to any migrant agricultural worker of the same character and on the same or comparable terms and conditions as provided to the general public.
§ 500.71
Utilization of only registered farm labor contractors.
The Act prohibits any person from utilizing the services of a farm labor contractor to supply migrant or seasonal agricultural workers without first taking reasonable steps to determine that the farm labor contractor possesses a valid Certificate of Registration, issued pursuant to the Act, which authorizes the activity for which the contractor is to be utilized. This prohibition also applies to a farm labor contractor who wishes to utilize the services of another farm labor contractor (see § 500.41). In making the determination about a contractor's registration status, a person may rely upon the contractor's possession of a Certificate of Registration which on its face is valid and which authorizes the activity for which the contractor is utilized. A person has the alternative to confirm the contractor's registration through the central registry maintained by the United States Department of Labor.
§ 500.72
Agreements with workers.
(a) The Act prohibits farm labor contractors, agricultural employers and agricultural associations from violating, without justification, the terms of any working arrangements they have made with migrant or seasonal agricultural workers. Normally, “without justification” would not include situations in which failure to comply with the terms of any working arrangements was directly attributable to acts of God, due to conditions beyond the control of the person or to conditions which he could not reasonably foresee.
(b) Written agreements do not relieve any person of any responsibility that the person would otherwise have under the Act or these regulations.
§ 500.73
Required purchase of goods or services solely from any person prohibited.
The Act prohibits a farm labor contractor, agricultural employer or agricultural association from requiring a migrant or seasonal agricultural worker to purchase goods or services solely from such farm labor contractor, agricultural employer, or agricultural association, or any other person acting as an agent for any person subject to this prohibition.

# Recruiting, Hiring and Providing Information to Migrant Agricultural Workers
§ 500.75
Disclosure of information.
(a) Where disclosure is required, Department of Labor optional forms may be used to satisfy the requirements of disclosure under the Act.
(b) Each farm labor contractor, agricultural employer, and agricultural association which recruits any migrant agricultural worker shall ascertain to the best of his ability and disclose, in
writing to the extent that he has obtained such information, to such worker at the time of recruitment, the following information:
(1) The place of employment (with as much specificity as practical, such as the name and address of the employer or the association);
(2) The wage rates (including piece rates) to be paid;
(3) The crops and kinds of activities on which the worker may be employed;
(4) The period of employment;
(5) The transportation, housing, and any other employee benefits to be provided, if any, and any costs to be charged for each of them;
(6) Whether state workers' compensation or state unemployment insurance is provided:
(i) If workers' compensation is provided, the required disclosure must include the name of the workers' compensation insurance carrier, the name(s) of the policyholder(s), the name and telephone number of each person who must be notified of an injury or death, and the time period within which such notice must be given.
(ii) The information requirement in paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section may be satisfied by giving the worker a photocopy of any workers' compensation notice required by State law;.
(7) The existence of any strike or other concerted work stoppage, slowdown, or interruption of operations by employees at the place of employment; and
(8) The existence of any arrangements with any owner or agent of any establishment in the area of employment under which the farm labor contractor, the agricultural employer, or the agricultural association is to receive a commission or any other benefit resulting from any sales by such establishment to the workers.
(c) Each farm labor contractor, agricultural employer and agricultural association which employs any migrant agricultural worker shall post (and maintain) in a conspicuous place at the place of employment a poster provided by the Secretary of Labor, which sets out the rights and protections for workers required under the Act.
(d) The employer (other than a farm labor contractor) of any migrant agricultural worker, shall provide at the place of employment on request of the worker, a written statement of the conditions of employment. A farm labor contractor shall provide such information in accordance with § 500.60(b) of these regulations.
(e) In a joint employment situation, each employer is equally responsible for displaying and maintaining the poster and for responding to worker requests for written statements of the conditions of employment which are made during the course of employment. This joint responsibility, however, does not require needless duplication, such as would occur if each employer posted the same poster or provided the same written statement with respect to the same employment conditions. Failure to provide the information required by a joint employment relationship, however, will result in all joint employers being responsible for that failure.
(f) Each farm labor contractor, agricultural employer and agricultural association which provides housing for any migrant agricultural worker shall post in a conspicuous place (at the site of the housing) or present in the form of a written statement to the worker the following information on the terms and conditions of occupancy of such housing, if any:
(1) The name and address of the farm labor contractor, agricultural employer
or agricultural association providing the housing;
(2) The name and address of the individual in charge of the housing;
(3) The mailing address and phone number where persons living in the housing facility may be reached;
(4) Who may live at the housing facility;
(5) The charges to be made for housing;
(6) The meals to be provided and the charges to be made for them;
(7) The charges for utilities; and
(8) Any other charges or conditions of occupancy.
(g) If the terms and conditions of occupancy are posted, the poster shall be displayed and maintained during the entire period of occupancy. If the terms

# Hiring and Providing Information to Seasonal Agricultural Workers
§ 500.76
Disclosure of information.
(a) Where disclosure is required, Department of Labor optional forms may be used to satisfy the requirements of disclosure under the Act.
(b) Each farm labor contractor, agricultural employer and agricultural association, which recruits any seasonal agricultural worker for employment on a farm or ranch to perform field work related to planting, cultivating or harvesting operations, shall ascertain and, upon request, disclose in writing the following information to such worker when an offer of employment is made:
(1) The place of employment (with as much specificity as practical, such as the name and address of the employer or the association);
(2) The wage rates (including piece rates) to be paid;
(3) The crops and kinds of activities on which the worker may be employed;
(4) The period of employment;
(5) The transportation and any other employee benefits to be provided, if any, and any costs to be charged for each of them;
(6) Whether state workers' compensation or state unemployment insurance is provided:
(i) If workers' compensation is provided, the required disclosure must include the name of the workers' compensation insurance carrier, the name(s) of the policyholder(s), the name and telephone number of each person who must be notified of an injury or death, and the time period within which such notice must be given.
(ii) The information requirement in paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section may satisfied giving the worker a photocopy of any workers' compensation notice required by State law;
(7) The existence of any strike or other concerted work stoppage, slowdown, or interruption of operations by employees at the place of employment; and
(8) The existence of any arrangements with any owner or agent of any establishment in the area of employment under which the farm labor contractor, the agricultural employer, or the agricultural association is to receive a commission or any other benefit resulting from any sales by such establishment to the workers.
(c) Each farm labor contractor, agricultural employer and agricultural association which recruits any seasonal agricultural worker for employment through the use of day-haul operation in canning, packing, ginning, seed conditioning or related research, or processing operations, shall ascertain and disclose in writing to the worker at the time of recruitment the information on employment conditions set out in paragraph (b) of this section.
(d)(1) Each farm labor contractor, agricultural employer and agricultural association which employs any seasonal agricultural worker shall post (and maintain) at the place of employment in a conspicuous place readily accessible to the worker a poster provided by the Secretary of Labor which sets out the rights and protections for such worker required under the Act.
(2) Such employer shall provide, on request of the worker, a written statement of the information described in paragraph (b) of this section.
(e) In a joint employment situation, each employer is equally responsible for displaying and maintaining the poster and for responding to worker requests for written statements of the conditions of employment which are made during the course of employment. This joint responsibility, however, does not require needless duplication, such as would occur if each employer posted the same poster or provided the same written statement with respect to the same employment conditions.

General obligations.
Each farm labor contractor, agricultural employer and agricultural association which uses, or causes to be used, any vehicle to transport a migrant or seasonal agricultural worker shall ensure that such vehicle conforms to vehicle safety standards prescribed by the Secretary of Labor under the Act and with other applicable Federal and State safety standards. Each farm labor contractor, agricultural employer and agricultural association shall also ensure that each driver of any such vehicle has a currently valid motor vehicle operator's permit or license, as provided by applicable State law, to operate the vehicle.
(b)
Proof of compliance with vehicle safety standards.
Prima facie evidence that safety standards have been met will be shown by the presence of a current State vehicle inspection sticker. Such sticker will not, however, relieve the farm labor contractor, agricultural employer or agricultural association from responsibility for maintaining the vehicle in accordance with § 500.104 or § 500.105, as applicable.
(c)
Uses or causes to be used.
The term “uses or causes to be used” as set forth in paragraph (a) of this section does not include carpooling arrangements made by the workers themselves, using one of the workers' own vehicles. However, carpooling does not include any transportation arrangement in which a farm labor contractor participates or which is specifically directed or requested by an agricultural employer or an agricultural association.
§ 500.101
Promulgation and adoption of vehicle standards.

Any violation of the standards promulgated by the Secretary in § 500.104 or adopted by the Secretary in § 500.105 shall be a violation of the Act and these regulations.
(c)
Development of Department of Labor Standards.
In developing the regulations in § 500.104, the Secretary has considered among other factors: (1) The type of vehicle used, (2) the passenger capacity of the vehicle, (3) the distance which such workers will be carried in the vehicle, (4) the type of roads and highways on which such workers will be carried in the vehicle, and (5) the extent to which a proposed standard would cause an undue burden on agricultural employers, agricultural associations, or farm labor contractors.
(d)
Adoption of Department of Transportation (DOT) Standards.
In accordance with section 401(b)(2)(C) of the Act, the Secretary has adopted in § 500.105 of these regulations, the DOT standards, without regard to the mileage and boundary limitations established in 49 U.S.C. 3102(c).
§ 500.102
Applicability of vehicle safety standards.
(a) Any passenger automobile or station wagon used or caused to be used by any farm labor contractor, agricultural employer or agricultural association to transport any migrant or seasonal agricultural worker shall meet the vehicle safety standards prescribed in § 500.104.

(c) Any vehicle, other than a passenger automobile or station wagon, which has been or is being used or caused to be used for any trip of a distance greater than 75 miles by a farm labor contractor, agricultural employer or agricultural association to transport any migrant or seasonal agricultural worker, shall be subject to
the safety standards prescribed under § 500.105. One trip may have numerous intermediate stops.
(d) Any vehicle, other than a passenger automobile or station wagon, used or caused to be used by any farm labor contractor, agricultural employer or agricultural association to transport any migrant or seasonal agricultural worker in any manner not addressed by paragraphs (a), (b), or (c) of this section shall meet the vehicle safety standards prescribed in § 500.104.
(e) The use or intended use of a vehicle, other than a passenger automobile or station wagon, for transportation of the type identified in § 500.102(b) or § 500.102(c) will make the vehicle subject to the standards prescribed under § 500.105, so long as the vehicle is used for transportation subject to the Act and these regulations.
(f) Any pickup truck used only for transportation subject to § 500.104 when transporting passengers only within the cab shall be treated as a station wagon.
(g) Pursuant to section 401(b)(2)(C) of the Act, standards prescribed by the Secretary shall be in addition to, and shall not supersede nor modify, any standards prescribed under part II of the Interstate Commerce Act and any successor provision of subtitle IV of title 49, U.S. Code or the regulations issued thereunder which is independently applicable to transportation to which this section applies. A violation of any such standard shall also constitute a violation of the Act and these regulations.

# Insurance
§ 500.120
Insurance policy or liability bond is required for each vehicle used to transport any migrant or seasonal agricultural worker.
A farm labor contractor, agricultural employer or agricultural association shall not transport any migrant or seasonal agricultural worker or his property in any vehicle such contractor, employer or association owns, operates, controls, or causes to be operated unless he has an insurance policy or liability bond in effect which insures against liability for damage to persons or property arising from the ownership, operation, or causing to be operated of such vehicle. Generally, the owner or lessor of the vehicle will be responsible for providing the required insurance. The insurance requirements do not apply to vehicles involved in carpooling arrangements made by the workers themselves, using one of the workers' own vehicles and not specifically directed or requested by an agricultural employer or agricultural association. However, carpooling does not include any transportation arrangement in which a farm labor contractor participates. Activities exempt from transportation safety standards are also exempt from insurance requirements. (See also § 500.103.)
§ 500.121
Coverage and level of insurance required.
(a) Except where a liability bond pursuant to § 500.124 of this part has been approved by the Secretary, a farm labor contractor, agricultural employer or agricultural association shall, in order to meet the insurance requirements in § 500.120, obtain a policy of vehicle liability insurance.
(b) The amount of vehicle liability insurance shall not be less than $100,000 for each seat in the vehicle, but in no event is the total insurance required to be more than $5,000,000 for any one vehicle. The number of seats in the vehicle shall be determined by reference to § 500.105(b)(3)(vi). See § 500.122 regarding insurance requirements where State workers' compensation coverage is provided.
(c) The insurance to be obtained under paragraph (a) of this section
shall be issued by an insurance carrier licensed or otherwise authorized to do business in the State in which the insurance is obtained.
(d) The vehicle liability insurance to be obtained under paragraph (a) of this section shall be endorsed to insure against liability for personal injury to employees whose transportation is not covered by workers' compensation insurance, and to persons who are not employees; and for property damage as specified in (b) of this section.
(e) An agricultural employer or agricultural association may evidence the purchase of liability insurance which covers the workers while being transported, as required under paragraph (a) by obtaining and making available upon request to the Department of Labor a completed liability certificate of insurance showing that insurance conforming to the limits required by paragraph (b) and the coverage required by paragraph (d) of this section is in effect. A farm labor contractor must obtain such a certificate and provide a copy to the Administrator when applying for authorization to transport migrant or seasonal agricultural workers.
(f) With respect to an agricultural employer or agricultural association, in the absence of the insurance certificate referred to under paragraph (e) of this section, the Department of Labor will look to the actual policy of insurance in determining compliance with the insurance requirements.
[48 FR 36741, Aug. 12, 1983, as amended at 57 FR 3905, Jan. 31, 1992; 61 FR 24866, May 16, 1996]
§ 500.122
Adjustments in insurance requirements when workers' compensation coverage is provided under State law.
(a) If a farm labor contractor, agricultural employer or agricultural association referred to in § 500.120 is the employer of a migrant or seasonal agricultural worker for purposes of a State workers' compensation law and such employer provides workers' compensation coverage for such worker in the case of bodily injury or death as provided by such State law, the following adjustments in the insurance requirements relating to having an insurance policy or liability bond apply:
(1) Except as provided in § 500.123, no vehicle liability insurance policy or liability bond shall be required of the employer, if such worker is transported only under circumstances for which there is coverage under such State law.
(2) A liability insurance policy or liability bond shall be required of the employer for circumstances under which coverage for the transportation of such worker is not provided under such State law.
(b) [Reserved]
(c) A farm labor contractor, agricultural employer or agricultural association who is the employer of a migrant or seasonal agricultural worker may evidence the issuance of workers' compensation insurance and passenger insurance under paragraph (a) of this section by obtaining and making available upon request to the Department of Labor:
(1) A workers' compensation coverage policy of insurance; and
(2) A certificate of liability insurance covering transportation of all passengers who are not employees and of workers whose transportation by the employer is not covered by workers' compensation insurance. See § 500.121.
(d) In the absence of the insurance certificate referred to under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the Department of Labor will look to the actual policy of insurance or liability bond in determining compliance with the Act and these regulations.
[48 FR 36741, Aug. 12, 1983, as amended at 56 FR 30327, July 2, 1991; 61 FR 24866, May 16, 1996]
§ 500.123
Property damage insurance required.
(a) When a person who is an employer of a migrant or seasonal agricultural worker provides workers' compensation insurance which protects such worker in the event of bodily injury or death while the worker is being transported, such person must also obtain insurance providing a minimum of $50,000 for loss or damage in any one accident to the property of others (excluding cargo), or evidence of a general liability insurance policy that provides the same protection.
(b) Such person may evidence the purchase of motor carrier insurance or other appropriate insurance providing such property damage protection by obtaining and making available upon request to the Department of Labor a vehicle or other liability certificate of insurance showing that such person has obtained the property damage insurance required under paragraph (a) of this section.
(c) In the absence of the insurance certificate referred to in paragraph (b) of this section, the Department of Labor will look to the actual policy of insurance in determining compliance with paragraph (a) of this section.
§ 500.124
Liability bond in lieu of insurance policy.
Financial responsibility in lieu of insurance may be evidenced by a liability bond executed as the “principal” by the person who will be transporting a migrant or seasonal agricultural worker, together with a third party identified in the instrument as the “surety”, to assure payment of any liability up to $500,000 for damages to persons or property arising out of such person's ownership of, operation of, or causing to be operated any vehicle for the transportation of such worker in connection with the person's business, activities, or operations. The “surety” shall be one which appears on the list contained in Treasury Department Circular 570, or which has been approved by the Secretary under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (Pub. L. 93-406). Treasury Department Circular 570 may be obtained from the U.S. Treasury Department, Audit Staff, Bureau of Government Financial Operations, Washington, DC 20226.
§ 500.125
Qualifications and eligibility of insurance carrier or surety.
A policy of insurance or liability bond does not satisfy the financial responsibility of requirements of the Act and these regulations unless the insurer or surety furnishing the policy or bond to any farm labor contractor, agricultural employer or agricultural association is:
(a) Legally authorized to issue such policies or bonds in the State in which the transportation occurs; or
(b) Legally authorized to issue such policies or bonds in the State in which the farm labor contractor, agricultural employer or agricultural association has its principal place of business or permanent residence and is willing to designate a person upon whom process, issued by or under the authority of any court having jurisdiction of the subject matter, may be served in any proceeding at law or equity brought in any State in which the transportation occurs; or
(c) Legally authorized to issue such policies or bonds in any State of the United States and eligible as an excess or surplus lines insurer in any State in which business is written and is willing to designate a person upon whom process, issued by or under the authority of any court having jurisdiction of the subject matter, may be served in any proceeding at law or equity brought in any State in which the transportation occurs.
§ 500.126
Duration of insurance or liability bond.
Any insurance policy or liability bond which is obtained pursuant to the Act shall provide the required coverage for the full period during which the person shall be engaged in transporting any migrant or seasonal agricultural worker within the meaning of the Act.
§ 500.127
Limitations on cancellation of insurance or liability bond of registered farm labor contractors.
Any insurance policy or liability bond obtained by a farm labor contractor who is required to register with the Department of Labor shall provide that it shall not be cancelled, rescinded, or suspended, nor become void for any reason whatsoever during such period in which the insurance or liability bond is required by the Act to be effective, except upon the expiration of the term for which it is written; or unless the parties desiring to cancel shall have first given thirty (30) days notice to the Administrator. The notice will include a statement setting forth the reason for cancellation, rescission, suspension, or any other termination of
such policy or bond. The notice shall be in writing and forwarded via certified or registered mail, addressed to the Administrator of the Wage and Hour Division, U.S. Department of Labor, Washington, DC 20210. Said thirty (30) days notice shall commence to run from the date notice is actually received by the Administrator.
§ 500.128
Cancellation of insurance policy or liability bond not relief from insurance requirements.
Cancellation, rescission, suspension, or any other termination of any insurance policy or liability bond required by the Act does not relieve a person who transports or causes to be transported any migrant or seasonal agricultural worker in any vehicle under
his ownership or control of the responsibility to comply with the insurance requirements specified in §§ 500.121, 500.122 and 500.123.

# Housing Safety and Health
§ 500.130
Application and scope of safety and health requirement.
(a) Each person who owns or controls a facility or real property which is used as housing for any migrant agricultural worker must ensure that the facility or real property complies with all substantive Federal and State safety and health standards applicable to such housing. If more than one person is involved in providing the housing for any migrant agricultural worker (for example, when an agricultural employer owns it and a farm labor contractor or any other person operates it), both persons are responsible for ensuring that the facility or real property meets the applicable Federal and State housing standards.
(b) A farm labor contractor, agricultural employer, agricultural association or any other person is deemed an “owner” of a housing facility or real property if said person has a legal or equitable interest in such facility or real property.
(c) A farm labor contractor, agricultural employer, agricultural association or any other person is in “control” of a housing facility or real property, regardless of the location of such facility, if said person is in charge of or has the power or authority to oversee, manage, superintend or administer the housing facility or real property either personally or through an authorized agent or employee, irrespective of whether compensation is paid for engaging in any of the aforesaid capacities.
(d) The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is the agency of the U.S. Department of Labor which administers the Occupational Safety and Health Act (29 U.S.C. 651
et seq.
) which provides for the establishment of safety and health standards generally.
(e) The Employment and Training Administration (ETA) is the agency of the U.S. Department of Labor which administers the U.S. Employment Service pursuant to the Wagner-Peyser Act (29 U.S.C. 49
et seq.
) including the interstate clearance order system.
§ 500.131
Exclusion from housing safety and health requirement.
The housing safety and health requirements do not apply to any person who, in the ordinary course of that person's business, regularly provides housing on a commercial basis to the general public and who provides housing to any migrant agricultural worker of the same character and on the same or comparable terms and conditions as provided to the general public. Migrant labor housing shall not be brought within this exception simply by offering lodging to the general public.
§ 500.132
Applicable Federal standards: ETA and OSHA housing standards.
(a) The Secretary has determined that the applicable Federal housing standards are the standards promulgated by the Employment and Training Administration, at 20 CFR 654.404
et seq.
and the standards promulgated by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, at 29 CFR 1910.142. Except as provided in § 500.131, all migrant housing is subject to either the ETA standards or the OSHA standards, as follows:
(1) A person who owns or controls a facility or real property to be used for housing any migrant agricultural worker, the construction of which was
begun on or after April 3, 1980, and which was not under a contract for construction as of March 4, 1980, shall comply with the substantive Federal safety and health standards promulgated by OSHA at 29 CFR 1910.142. These OSHA standards are enforceable under MSPA, irrespective of whether housing is, at any particular point in time, subject to inspection under the Occupational Safety and Health Act.
(2) A person who owns or controls a facility or real property to be used for housing any migrant agricultural worker which was completed or under construction prior to April 3, 1980, or which was under a contract for construction prior to March 4, 1980, may elect to comply with either the substantive Federal safety and health standards promulgated by OSHA at 29 CFR 1910.142 or the standards promulgated by ETA at 20 CFR 654.404
et seq.
The ETA standards were established to provide housing requirements for migrant housing used by an employer obtaining migrant workers through the U.S. Employment Service. The owner or operator of such housing may continue to rely on those standards, rather than OSHA standards, even if the housing is not currently being provided pursuant to a USES job placement program.
§ 500.133
Substantive Federal and State safety and health standards defined.
Substantive safety and health standards include, but are not limited to, those that provide fire prevention, an adequate and sanitary supply of water,
plumbing maintenance, structurally sound construction of buildings, effective maintenance of those buildings, provision of adequate heat as weather conditions require, and reasonable protections for inhabitants from insects and rodents. Substantive housing standards do not include technical or procedural violations of safety and health standards.
§ 500.134
Compliance with State standards.
Compliance with the substantive Federal housing safety and health standards shall not excuse noncompliance with applicable substantive State housing safety and health standards.
§ 500.135
Certificate of housing inspection.
(a) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, a facility or real property to be used for housing a migrant agricultural worker shall not be occupied by any migrant agricultural worker unless either a State or local health authority or other appropriate agency, including a Federal agency, has certified that the facility or real property meets applicable safety and health standards.
(b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, the person who owns or controls a facility or real property shall not permit it to be occupied by any migrant agricultural worker unless a copy of a certificate of occupancy from the State, local or Federal agency which conducted the housing safety and health inspection is posted at the site of the facility or real property. The original of such certificate of occupancy shall be retained by such person for three years and made available for inspection in accordance with section 512 of the Act.
(c) If a request for an inspection of a facility or real property is made to the appropriate State, local or Federal agency at least forty-five (45) days prior to the date on which it is to be occupied by a migrant agricultural worker but the agency has not conducted an inspection by such date, the facility or property may be occupied by migrant agricultural workers unless prohibited by State law.
(d) Receipt and posting of a certificate of occupancy as provided under paragraph (b) of this section, or the failure of an agency to inspect a facility or property within the forty-five (45) day time period, shall not relieve the person who owns or controls a facility or property from the responsibility of ensuring that such facility or property meets the applicable State and Federal safety and health standards. Once such facility or property is occupied, such person shall supervise and continually maintain such facility or property so as to ensure that it remains in compliance with the applicable safety and health standards.

# Source:
87 FR 61822, Oct. 12, 2022, unless otherwise noted.

# Subpart A—General Provisions
§ 501.0
Introduction.
The regulations in this part cover the enforcement of all contractual obligations, including requirements under 8 U.S.C. 1188 and 20 CFR part 655, subpart B, applicable to the employment of H-2A workers and workers in corresponding employment, including obligations to offer employment to eligible United States (U.S.) workers and to not lay off or displace U.S. workers in a manner prohibited by the regulations in this part or 20 CFR part 655, subpart B.
§ 501.1
Purpose and scope.
(a)
Statutory standards.
The standard in 8 U.S.C. 1188 provides that:
(1) An H-2A Petition to import an H-2A worker, as defined at 8 U.S.C. 1188, may not be approved by the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) unless the petitioner has applied for and received a temporary agricultural labor certification from the Secretary of Labor (Secretary). The temporary agricultural labor certification establishes that:
(i) There are not sufficient workers who are able, willing, and qualified, and who will be available at the time and place needed, to perform the labor or services involved in the H-2A Petition; and
(ii) The employment of the H-2A worker in such labor or services will not adversely affect the wages and working conditions of workers in the United States similarly employed.
(2) The Secretary is authorized to take actions that assure compliance with the terms and conditions of employment under 8 U.S.C. 1188, the regulations at 20 CFR part 655, subpart B, or the regulations in this part, including imposing appropriate penalties, and seeking injunctive relief and specific performance of contractual obligations.
See
8 U.S.C. 1188(g)(2).
(b)
Authority and role of the Office of Foreign Labor Certification.
The Secretary has delegated authority to the Assistant Secretary for the Employment and Training Administration (ETA), who in turn has delegated that authority to the Office of Foreign Labor Certification (OFLC), to issue certifications and carry out other statutory responsibilities as required by 8 U.S.C. 1188. Determinations on an
Application for Temporary Employment Certification
are made by the OFLC Administrator who, in turn, may delegate this responsibility to designated staff, e.g., a Certifying Officer (CO).
(c)
Authority of the Wage and Hour Division.
The Secretary has delegated authority to the Wage and Hour Division (WHD) to conduct certain investigatory and enforcement functions with respect to terms and conditions of employment under 8 U.S.C. 1188, 20 CFR part 655, subpart B, and this part (“the H-2A program”), and to carry out other statutory responsibilities required by 8 U.S.C. 1188. Certain investigatory, inspection, and law enforcement functions to carry out the provisions under 8 U.S.C. 1188 have been delegated by the Secretary to the WHD. In general, matters concerning the obligations under a work contract between an employer of H-2A workers and the H-2A workers and workers in corresponding employment are enforced by WHD, including whether employment was offered to U.S. workers as required under 8 U.S.C. 1188 or 20 CFR part 655, subpart B, or whether U.S. workers were laid off or displaced in violation of program
requirements under 8 U.S.C. 1188, 20 CFR part 655, subpart B, or this part. Included within the enforcement responsibility of WHD are such matters as the payment of required wages, transportation, meals, and housing provided during the employment. WHD has the responsibility to carry out investigations, inspections, and law enforcement functions and in appropriate instances to impose penalties, to debar from future certifications, to recommend revocation of existing certification(s), and to seek injunctive relief and specific performance of contractual obligations, including recovery of unpaid wages and reinstatement of laid off or displaced U.S. workers.
(d)
Concurrent authority.
OFLC and WHD have concurrent authority to impose a debarment remedy pursuant to 20 CFR 655.182 and § 501.20.
(e)
Effect of regulations.
The enforcement functions carried out by WHD under 8 U.S.C. 1188, 20 CFR part 655, subpart B, and this part apply to the employment of any H-2A worker and any other worker in corresponding employment as the result of any
Application for Temporary Employment Certification
processed under 20 CFR 655.102(c).
§ 501.2
Coordination between Federal agencies.
(a) Complaints received by ETA or any State Workforce Agency (SWA) regarding contractual H-2A labor standards between the employer and the worker will be immediately forwarded to the appropriate WHD office for appropriate action under the regulations in this part.
(b) Information received in the course of processing applications, program integrity measures, or enforcement actions may be shared between OFLC and WHD or, where applicable to employer enforcement under the H-2A program, other Departments or agencies as appropriate, including the Department of State (DOS) and DHS.
(c) A specific violation for which debarment is imposed will be cited in a single debarment proceeding. OFLC and WHD may coordinate their activities to achieve this result. Copies of final debarment decisions will be forwarded to DHS promptly.
§ 501.3
Definitions.
(a)
Definitions of terms used in this part.
The following defined terms apply to this part:
Act.

§ 501.20
Debarment and revocation.
(a)
Debarment of an employer, agent, or attorney.
The WHD Administrator may debar an employer, agent, or attorney from participating in any action under 8 U.S.C. 1188, 20 CFR part 655, subpart
B, or this part, subject to the time limits set forth in paragraph (c) of this section, if the WHD Administrator finds that the employer, agent, or attorney substantially violated a material term or condition of the temporary agricultural labor certification, with respect to H-2A workers, workers in corresponding employment, or U.S. workers improperly rejected for employment, or improperly laid off or displaced, by issuing a Notice of Debarment.
(b)
Effect on future applications.
(1) No application for H-2A workers may be filed by or on behalf of a debarred employer, or by an employer represented by a debarred agent or attorney, subject to the time limits set forth in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. If such an application is filed, it will be denied without review.
(2) No application for H-2A workers may be filed by or on behalf of a successor in interest, as defined in 20 CFR 655.104, to a debarred employer, agent, or attorney, subject to the term limits set forth in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. If the CO determines that such an application is filed, the CO will issue a Notice of Deficiency (NOD) pursuant to 20 CFR 655.141 or deny the application pursuant to 20 CFR 655.164, as appropriate depending upon the status of the
Application for Temporary Employment Certification,
solely on the basis that the entity is a successor in interest to a debarred employer, agent, or attorney. The employer, agent, or attorney may appeal its status as a successor in interest to the debarred entity, pursuant to the procedures for appeals of CO determinations at 20 CFR 655.171.
(c)
Statute of limitations and period of debarment.
(1) The WHD Administrator must issue any Notice of Debarment not later than 2 years after the occurrence of the violation.
(2) No employer, agent, or attorney, or their successors in interest, may be debarred under this part for more than 3 years from the date of the final agency decision.
(d)
Definition of violation.
For the purposes of this section, a violation includes:
(1) One or more acts of commission or omission on the part of the employer or the employer's agent which involve:
(i) Failure to pay or provide the required wages, benefits, or working conditions to the employer's H-2A workers and/or workers in corresponding employment;
(ii) Failure, except for lawful, job-related reasons, to offer employment to qualified U.S. workers who applied for the job opportunity for which certification was sought;
(iii) Failure to comply with the employer's obligations to recruit U.S. workers;
(iv) Improper layoff or displacement of U.S. workers or workers in corresponding employment;
(v) Failure to comply with one or more sanctions or remedies imposed by the WHD Administrator for violation(s) of contractual or other H-2A obligations, or with one or more decisions or orders of the Secretary or a court under 8 U.S.C. 1188, 20 CFR part 655, subpart B, or this part;
(vi) Impeding an investigation of an employer under 8 U.S.C. 1188 or this part, or an audit under 20 CFR part 655, subpart B;
(vii) Employing an H-2A worker outside the area of intended employment, or in an activity/activities not listed in the job order or outside the validity period of employment of the job order, including any approved extension thereof;
(viii) A violation of the requirements of 20 CFR 655.135(j), (k), or (o);
(ix) A violation of any of the provisions listed in § 501.4(a); or
(x) A single heinous act showing such flagrant disregard for the law that future compliance with program requirements cannot reasonably be expected.
(2) In determining whether a violation is so substantial as to merit debarment, the factors set forth in § 501.19(b) shall be considered.
(e)
Procedural requirements.
The Notice of Debarment must be in writing, must state the reason for the debarment finding, including a detailed explanation of the grounds for and the duration of the debarment, must identify appeal opportunities under § 501.33 and a timeframe under which such rights must be exercised and must comply with § 501.32. The debarment will take effect 30 calendar days from the date the Notice of Debarment is
issued, unless a request for review is properly filed within 30 calendar days from the issuance of the Notice of Debarment. The timely filing of an administrative appeal stays the debarment pending the outcome of the appeal as provided in § 501.33(d).
(f)
Debarment of associations, employer-members of associations, and joint employers.
If, after investigation, the WHD Administrator determines that an individual employer-member of an agricultural association, or a joint employer under 20 CFR 655.131(b), has committed a substantial violation, the debarment determination will apply only to that employer-member unless the WHD Administrator determines that the agricultural association or another agricultural association member or joint employer under 20 CFR 655.131(b), participated in the violation, in which case the debarment will be invoked against the agricultural association or other complicit agricultural association member(s) or joint employer under 20 CFR 655.131(b) as well.
(g)
Debarment involving agricultural associations acting as sole employers.
If, after investigation, the WHD Administrator determines that an agricultural association acting as a sole employer has committed a substantial violation, the debarment determination will apply only to the agricultural association and any successor in interest to the debarred agricultural association.
(h)
Debarment involving agricultural associations acting as joint employers.
If, after investigation, the WHD Administrator determines that an agricultural association acting as a joint employer with its employer-members has committed a substantial violation, the debarment determination will apply only to the agricultural association, and will not be applied to any individual employer-member of the agricultural association. However, if the WHD Administrator determines that the employer-member participated in, had knowledge of, or had reason to know of the violation, the debarment may be invoked against the complicit agricultural association member as well. An agricultural association debarred from the H-2A temporary labor certification program will not be permitted to continue to file as a joint employer with its employer-members during the period of the debarment.
(i)
Revocation.
WHD may recommend to the OFLC Administrator the revocation of a temporary agricultural labor certification if WHD finds that the employer:
(1) Substantially violated a material term or condition of the approved temporary agricultural labor certification;
(2) Failed to cooperate with a DOL investigation or with a DOL official performing an investigation, inspection, or law enforcement function under 8 U.S.C. 1188, 20 CFR part 655, subpart B, or this part; or
(3) Failed to comply with one or more sanctions or remedies imposed by WHD, or with one or more decisions or orders of the Secretary or a court order secured by the Secretary under 8 U.S.C. 1188, 20 CFR part 655, subpart B, or this part.
(j)
Successors in interest.
When an employer, agent, or attorney is debarred under this section, any successor in interest to the debarred employer, agent, or attorney is also debarred, regardless of whether the successor is named or not named in the notice of debarment issued under paragraph (a) of this section.
[87 FR 61822, Oct. 12, 2022, as amended at 89 FR 34068, Apr. 29, 2024]
§ 501.21
Failure to cooperate with investigations.
(a) No person shall refuse to cooperate with any employee of the Secretary who is exercising or attempting to exercise this investigative or enforcement authority.
(b) Where an employer (or employer's agent or attorney) does not cooperate with an investigation concerning the employment of an H-2A worker, a worker in corresponding employment, or a U.S. worker who has been improperly rejected for employment or improperly laid off or displaced, WHD may make such information available to OFLC and may recommend that OFLC revoke the existing certification that is the basis for the employment of the H-2A workers giving rise to the investigation. In addition, WHD may take such action as appropriate, including initiating proceedings for the debarment of the employer, agent, or
attorney from future certification for up to 3 years, seeking an injunction, and/or assessing civil money penalties against any person who has failed to cooperate with a WHD investigation. The taking of any one action shall not bar the taking of any additional action.
§ 501.22
Civil money penalties—payment and collection.
Where a civil money penalty is assessed in a final order by the WHD Administrator, by an ALJ, or by the Administrative Review Board (ARB), the amount of the penalty must be received by the WHD Administrator within 30 days of the date of the final order. The person assessed such penalty shall remit the amount thereof, as finally determined, to the Secretary. Payment shall be made by certified check or money order made payable and delivered or mailed according to the instructions provided by the Department; through the electronic pay portal located at
www.pay.gov
or any successor system; or by any additional payment method deemed acceptable by the Department.

Except with respect to the imposition of civil money penalties, debarment, or an increase in the amount of a surety bond, the Secretary may, in the Secretary's discretion, seek enforcement action in a District Court of the United States without resort to any administrative proceedings.

# Procedures Relating to Hearing
§ 501.31
Written notice of determination required.
Whenever the WHD Administrator decides to assess a civil money penalty, debar, increase a surety bond, or proceed administratively to enforce contractual obligations, or obligations under 8 U.S.C. 1188, 20 CFR part 655, subpart B, or this part, including for the recovery of the monetary relief, the person against whom such action is taken shall be notified in writing of such determination.

(b) No particular form is prescribed for any request for hearing permitted by this part. However, any such request shall:
(1) Be typewritten or legibly written;

(3) State the specific reason or reasons the person requesting the hearing believes such determination is in error;
(4) Be signed by the person making the request or by an authorized representative of such person; and
(5) Include the address at which such person or authorized representative desires to receive further communications relating thereto.

Requests may be made by certified mail or by means normally assuring overnight delivery.
(d) The determination shall take effect on the start date identified in the written notice of determination, unless an administrative appeal is properly filed. The timely filing of an administrative appeal stays the determination pending the outcome of the appeal proceedings, provided that any surety bond remains in effect until the conclusion of any such proceedings.

# Subpart A—General Provisions
§ 502.0
Introduction.
These regulations cover the enforcement of all contractual obligation provisions applicable to the employment of H-2A workers under sec. 218 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), as amended by the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (IRCA). These regulations are also applicable to the employment of United States (U.S.) workers newly hired by employers of H-2A workers in the same occupations as the H-2A workers during the period of time set forth in the labor certification approved by ETA as a condition for granting H-2A certification, including any extension thereof. Such U.S. workers hired by H-2A employers are hereafter referred to as engaged in corresponding employment.
§ 502.1
Purpose and scope.
(a)
Statutory standard.
Section 218(a) of the INA provides that:
(1) A petition to import an alien as an H-2A worker (as defined in the INA) may not be approved by the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) unless the petitioner has applied to the Secretary of the United States Department of Labor (Secretary) for a certification that:
(i) There are not sufficient workers who are able, willing, and qualified, and who will be available at the time and place needed, to perform the labor or services involved in the petition, and
(ii) The employment of the alien in such labor or services will not adversely affect the wages and working conditions of workers in the U.S. similarly employed.
(2) [Reserved]
(b)
Role of the Employment and Training Administration (ETA).
The issuance and denial of labor certification under sec. 218 of the INA has been delegated by the Secretary to ETA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Labor (the Department or DOL). In general, matters concerning the obligations of an employer of H-2A workers related to the labor certification process are administered and enforced by ETA. Included within ETA's jurisdiction are issues such as whether U.S. workers are available, whether adequate recruitment has been conducted, whether there is a strike or lockout, the methodology for establishing AEWR, whether workers' compensation insurance has been provided, whether employment was offered to U.S. workers as required by sec. 218 of the INA and regulations at 20 CFR part 655, subpart B,
and other similar matters. The regulations pertaining to the issuance and denial of labor certification for temporary alien workers by the ETA are found in 20 CFR part 655, subpart B.
(c)
Role of the Employment Standards Administration (ESA), Wage and Hour Division (WHD).
(1) The Secretary is authorized to take actions that assure compliance with the terms and conditions of employment under sec. 218 of the INA, the regulations at 20 CFR part 655, subpart B, or these regulations, including the assessment of civil money penalties and seeking injunctive relief and specific performance of contractual obligations.
See
8 U.S.C. 1188(g)(2).
(2) Certain investigatory, inspection, and law enforcement functions to carry out the provisions of sec. 218 of the INA have been delegated by the Secretary to the ESA, WHD. In general, matters concerning the obligations under a work contract between an employer of H-2A workers and the H-2A workers and U.S. workers hired in corresponding employment by H-2A employers are enforced by ESA, including whether employment was offered to U.S. workers as required under sec. 218 of the INA or 20 CFR part 655, subpart B, or whether U.S. workers were laid off or displaced in violation of program requirements. Included within the enforcement responsibility of WHD are such matters as the payment of required wages, transportation, meals, and housing provided during the employment. The WHD has the responsibility to carry out investigations, inspections, and law enforcement functions and in appropriate instances impose penalties, recommend revocation of existing certification(s) or debarment from future certifications, and seek injunctive relief and specific performance of contractual obligations, including recovery of unpaid wages (either directly from the employer or in the case of an H-2A Labor Contractors (H-2ALC), from the H-2ALC directly and/or from the insurer who issued the surety bond to the H-2ALC as required by 20 CFR part 655, subpart B and 29 CFR 501.8).
(d)
Effect of regulations.
The amendments to the INA made by Title III of the IRCA apply to petitions and applications filed on and after June 1, 1987. Accordingly, the enforcement functions carried out by the WHD under the INA and these regulations apply to the employment of any H-2A worker and any other U.S. workers hired by H-2A employers in corresponding employment as the result of any application filed with the Department on and after June 1, 1987.
§ 502.2

Normally, wholly new management or ownership of the same business operation, one in which the former management or owner does not retain a direct or indirect interest, will not be deemed to be a successor in interest for purposes of debarment. A determination of whether or not a successor in interest exists is based on the entire circumstances viewed in their totality. The factors to be considered include:
(1) Substantial continuity of the same business operations;
(2) Use of the same facilities;
(3) Continuity of the work force;

(3) The gravity of the violation or violations;
(4) Efforts made in good faith to comply with the H-2A provisions of the Act and these regulations;

§ 502.20
Debarment and revocation.
(a) The WHD shall recommend to the Administrator, OFLC the debarment of any employer and any successor in interest to that employer (or the employer's attorney or agent if they are a responsible party) if the WHD finds that the employer substantially violated a material term or condition of its temporary labor certification for the employment of domestic or nonimmigrant workers.
(b) For purposes of this section, a substantial violation includes:
(1) A pattern or practice of acts of commission or omission on the part of the employer or the employer's agent which:

(4) A single heinous act showing such flagrant disregard for the law that future compliance with program requirements cannot reasonably be expected.
(c) Procedures for Debarment Recommendation. The WHD will send to the employer a
Notice of Recommended Debarment.
The
Notice of Recommended Debarment
must be in writing, must state the reason for the debarment recommendation, including a detailed explanation of the grounds for and the duration of the recommended debarment. The debarment recommendation will be forwarded to the Administrator, OFLC. The
Notice of Recommended Debarment
shall be issued no later than 2 years after the occurrence of the violation.
(d) The WHD may recommend to the Administrator, OFLC the revocation of a temporary agricultural labor certification if the WHD finds that the employer:

(4) Failed to comply with one or more sanctions or remedies imposed by the ESA for violation(s) of obligations found by that agency (if applicable), or with one or more decisions or orders of the Secretary or a court order Secured by the Secretary under sec. 218 of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1188, this subpart, or 29 CFR part 501 (ESA enforcement of contractual obligations).
(e) In considering a recommendation made by the WHD to debar an employer or to revoke a temporary agricultural labor certification, the Administrator, OFLC shall treat final agency determinations that the employer has committed a violation as res judicata and shall not reconsider those determinations.
§ 502.21
Failure to cooperate with investigations.
No person shall refuse to cooperate with any employee of the Secretary who is exercising or attempting to exercise this investigative or enforcement authority. As stated in §§ 501.6
and 501.19 of this part, a civil money penalty may be assessed for each failure to cooperate with an investigation, and other appropriate relief may be sought. In addition, the WHD shall report each such occurrence to ETA, and ETA may debar the employer from future certification. The WHD may also recommend to ETA that an existing certification be revoked. The taking of any one action shall not bar the taking of any additional action.
§ 502.22

# Subpart A—General Provisions
§ 503.0
Introduction.
The regulations in this part cover the enforcement of all statutory and regulatory obligations, including requirements under 8 U.S.C. 1184(c), section 214(c) of the INA and 20 CFR part 655, subpart A, applicable to the employment of H-2B workers in nonimmigrant status under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(b), section 101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(b) of the INA, and workers in corresponding employment, including obligations to offer employment to eligible United States (U.S.) workers and to not lay off or displace U.S. workers in a manner prohibited by the regulations in this part or 20 CFR part 655, subpart A.
§ 503.1
Scope and purpose.
(a)
Consultation standard.
Section 214(c)(1) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1184(c)(1), requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to consult with appropriate agencies before authorizing the classification of aliens as H-2B workers. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) regulations at 8 CFR 214.2(h)(6)(iii)(D) recognize the Secretary of Labor as the appropriate authority with whom DHS consults regarding the H-2B program, and recognize the Secretary of Labor's authority in carrying out the Secretary of Labor's consultative function to issue regulations regarding the issuance of temporary labor certifications. DHS regulations at 8 CFR 214.2(h)(6)(iv) provide that an employer's petition to employ nonimmigrant workers on H-2B visas for temporary non-agricultural employment in the United States (U.S.), except for Guam, must be accompanied by an approved temporary labor certification from the Secretary of Labor. The temporary labor certification reflects a determination by the Secretary that:
(1) There are not sufficient U.S. workers who are qualified and who will be available to perform the temporary services or labor for which an employer desires to hire foreign workers; and
(2) The employment of the foreign worker will not adversely affect the wages and working conditions of U.S. workers similarly employed.
(b)
Role of the Employment and Training Administration (ETA).
The issuance and denial of labor certifications for purposes of satisfying the consultation requirement in 8 U.S.C. 1184(c), INA section 214(c), has been delegated by the Secretary to ETA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL), which in turn has delegated that authority to the Office of Foreign Labor Certification (OFLC). In general, matters concerning the obligations of an H-2B employer related to the temporary labor certification process are administered by OFLC, including obligations and assurances made by employers, overseeing employer recruitment, and assuring program integrity. The regulations pertaining to the issuance, denial, and revocation of
labor certification for temporary foreign workers by the OFLC are found in 20 CFR part 655, subpart A.
(c)
Role of the Wage and Hour Division (WHD).
Effective January 18, 2009, DHS has delegated to the Secretary under 8 U.S.C. 1184(c)(14)(B), section 214(c)(14)(B) of the INA, certain investigatory and law enforcement functions to carry out the provisions under 8 U.S.C. 1184(c), INA section 214(c). The Secretary has delegated these functions to the WHD. In general, matters concerning the rights of H-2B workers and workers in corresponding employment under this part and the employer's obligations are enforced by the WHD, including whether employment was offered to U.S. workers as required under 20 CFR part 655, subpart A, or whether U.S. workers were laid off or displaced in violation of program requirements. The WHD has the responsibility to carry out investigations, inspections, and law enforcement functions and in appropriate instances to impose penalties, to debar from future certifications, to recommend revocation of existing certifications, and to seek remedies for violations, including recovery of unpaid wages and reinstatement of improperly laid off or displaced U.S. workers.
(d)
Effect of regulations.
The enforcement functions carried out by the WHD under 8 U.S.C. 1184(c), INA section 214(c), 20 CFR part 655, subpart A, and the regulations in this part apply to the employment of any H-2B worker and any worker in corresponding employment as the result of an
Application for Temporary Employment Certification
filed with the Department of Labor on or after April 29, 2015.
§ 503.2
Territory of Guam.
This part does not apply to temporary employment in the Territory of Guam. The Department of Labor does not certify to DHS the temporary employment of nonimmigrant foreign workers or enforce compliance with the provisions of the H-2B visa program in the Territory of Guam.
§ 503.3
Coordination among Governmental agencies.
(a) Complaints received by ETA or any State Workforce Agency (SWA) regarding noncompliance with H-2B statutory or regulatory labor standards will be immediately forwarded to the appropriate WHD office for suitable action under the regulations in this part.
(b) Information received in the course of processing registrations and applications, program integrity measures, or enforcement actions may be shared between OFLC and WHD or, where applicable to employer enforcement under the H-2B program, may be forwarded to other agencies as appropriate, including the Department of State (DOS) and DHS.
(c) A specific violation for which debarment is sought will be cited in a single debarment proceeding. OFLC and the WHD will coordinate their activities to achieve this result. Copies of final debarment decisions will be forwarded to DHS promptly.
§ 503.4
Definition of terms.
For purposes of this part:
Act
means the Immigration and Nationality Act or INA, as amended, 8 U.S.C. 1101

(2) No agent who is under suspension, debarment, expulsion, disbarment, or otherwise restricted from practice before any court, the Department of Labor, the Executive Office for Immigration Review under 8 CFR 1003.101, or
DHS under 8 CFR 292.3 may represent an employer under this part.
Agricultural labor or services
means those duties and occupations defined in 20 CFR part 655, subpart B.

Area of intended employment
means the geographic area within normal commuting distance of the place (worksite address) of the job opportunity for which the certification is sought. There is no rigid measure of distance that constitutes a normal commuting distance or normal commuting area, because there may be widely varying factual circumstances among different areas (e.g., average commuting times, barriers to reaching the worksite, or quality of the regional transportation network). If the place of intended employment is within a Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA), including a multistate MSA, any place within the MSA is deemed to be within normal commuting distance of the place of intended employment.

Certifying Officer (CO)
means an OFLC official designated by the Administrator, OFLC to make determinations on applications under the H-2B program. The Administrator, OFLC is the National CO. Other COs may also be designated by the Administrator, OFLC to make the determinations required under 20 CFR part 655, subpart A.

§ 503.16
Assurances and obligations of H-2B employers.
An employer employing H-2B workers and/or workers in corresponding employment under an
Application for Temporary Employment Certification
has agreed as part of the
Application for Temporary Employment Certification
that it will abide by the following conditions with respect to its H-2B workers and any workers in corresponding employment:
(a)
Rate of pay.
(1) The offered wage in the job order equals or exceeds the highest of the prevailing wage or Federal minimum wage, State minimum wage, or local minimum wage. The employer must pay at least the offered wage, free and clear, during the entire period of the
Application for Temporary Employment Certification
granted by OFLC.
(2) The offered wage is not based on commissions, bonuses, or other incentives, including paying on a piece-rate basis, unless the employer guarantees a wage earned every workweek that equals or exceeds the offered wage.
(3) If the employer requires one or more minimum productivity standards of workers as a condition of job retention, the standards must be specified in the job order and the employer must demonstrate that they are normal and usual for non-H-2B employers for the same occupation in the area of intended employment.
(4) An employer that pays on a piece-rate basis must demonstrate that the piece rate is no less than the normal rate paid by non-H-2B employers to workers performing the same activity in the area of intended employment. The average hourly piece rate earnings must result in an amount at least
equal to the offered wage. If the worker is paid on a piece rate basis and at the end of the workweek the piece rate does not result in average hourly piece rate earnings during the workweek at least equal to the amount the worker would have earned had the worker been paid at the offered hourly wage, then the employer must supplement the worker's pay at that time so that the worker's earnings are at least as much as the worker would have earned during the workweek if the worker had instead been paid at the offered hourly wage for each hour worked.
(b)
Wages free and clear.
The payment requirements for wages in this section will be satisfied by the timely payment of such wages to the worker either in cash or negotiable instrument payable at par. The payment must be made finally and unconditionally and “free and clear.” The principles applied in determining whether deductions are reasonable and payments are received free and clear and the permissibility of deductions for payments to third persons are explained in more detail in 29 CFR part 531.
(c)
Deductions.
The employer must make all deductions from the worker's paycheck required by law. The job order must specify all deductions not required by law which the employer will make from the worker's pay; any such deductions not disclosed in the job order are prohibited. The wage payment requirements of paragraph (b) of this section are not met where unauthorized deductions, rebates, or refunds reduce the wage payment made to the worker below the minimum amounts required by the offered wage or where the worker fails to receive such amounts free and clear because the worker “kicks back” directly or indirectly to the employer or to another person for the employer's benefit the whole or part of the wages delivered to the worker. Authorized deductions are limited to: those required by law, such as taxes payable by workers that are required to be withheld by the employer and amounts due workers which the employer is required by court order to pay to another; deductions for the reasonable cost or fair value of board, lodging, and facilities furnished; and deductions of amounts which are authorized to be paid to third persons for the worker's account and benefit through his or her voluntary assignment or order or which are authorized by a collective bargaining agreement with bona fide representatives of workers which covers the employer. Deductions for amounts paid to third persons for the worker's account and benefit which are not so authorized or are contrary to law or from which the employer, agent or recruiter, including any agents or employees of these entities, or any affiliated person derives any payment, rebate, commission, profit, or benefit directly or indirectly, may not be made if they reduce the actual wage paid to the worker below the offered wage indicated on the
Application for Temporary Employment Certification.
(d)
Job opportunity is full-time.
The job opportunity is a full-time temporary position, consistent with § 503.4, and the employer must use a single workweek as its standard for computing wages due. An employee's workweek must be a fixed and regularly recurring period of 168 hours—seven consecutive 24-hour periods. It need not coincide with the calendar week but may begin on any day and at any hour of the day.
(e)
Job qualifications and requirements.
Each job qualification and requirement must be listed in the job order and must be bona fide and consistent with the normal and accepted qualifications and requirements imposed by non-H-2B employers in the same occupation and area of intended employment. The employer's job qualifications and requirements imposed on U.S. workers must not be less favorable than the qualifications and requirements that the employer is imposing or will impose on H-2B workers. A qualification means a characteristic that is necessary to the individual's ability to perform the job in question. A requirement means a term or condition of employment which a worker is required to accept in order to obtain the job opportunity. The CO may require the employer to submit documentation to substantiate the appropriateness of any job qualification and/or requirement specified in the job order.
(f)
Three-fourths guarantee.
(1) The employer must guarantee to offer the
worker employment for a total number of work hours equal to at least three-fourths of the workdays in each 12-week period (each 6-week period if the period of employment covered by the job order is less than 120 days) beginning with the first workday after the arrival of the worker at the place of employment or the advertised first date of need, whichever is later, and ending on the expiration date specified in the job order or in its extensions, if any. See the exception in paragraph (y) of this section.
(2) For purposes of this paragraph (f) a workday means the number of hours in a workday as stated in the job order. The employer must offer a total number of hours of work to ensure the provision of sufficient work to reach the three-fourths guarantee in each 12-week period (each 6-week period if the period of employment covered by the job order is less than 120 days) during the work period specified in the job order, or during any modified job order period to which the worker and employer have mutually agreed and that has been approved by the CO.
(3) In the event the worker begins working later than the specified beginning date the guarantee period begins with the first workday after the arrival of the worker at the place of employment, and continues until the last day during which the job order and all extensions thereof are in effect.
(4) The 12-week periods (6-week periods if the period of employment covered by the job order is less than 120 days) to which the guarantee applies are based upon the workweek used by the employer for pay purposes. The first 12-week period (or 6-week period, as appropriate) also includes any partial workweek, if the first workday after the worker's arrival at the place of employment is not the beginning of the employer's workweek, with the guaranteed number of hours increased on a pro rata basis (thus, the first period may include up to 12 weeks and 6 days (or 6 weeks and 6 days, as appropriate)). The final 12-week period (or 6-week period, as appropriate) includes any time remaining after the last full 12-week period (or 6-week period) ends, and thus may be as short as 1 day, with the guaranteed number of hours decreased on a pro rata basis.
(5) Therefore, if, for example, a job order is for a 32-week period (a period greater than 120 days), during which the normal workdays and work hours for the workweek are specified as 5 days a week, 7 hours per day, the worker would have to be guaranteed employment for at least 315 hours in the first 12-week period (12 weeks × 35 hours/week = 420 hours × 75 percent = 315), at least 315 hours in the second 12-week period, and at least 210 hours (8 weeks × 35 hours/week = 280 hours × 75 percent = 210) in the final partial period. If the job order is for a 16-week period (less than 120 days), during which the normal workdays and work hours for the workweek are specified as 5 days a week, 7 hours per day, the worker would have to be guaranteed employment for at least 157.5 hours (6 weeks × 35 hours/week = 210 hours × 75 percent = 157.5) in the first 6-week period, at least 157.5 hours in the second 6-week period, and at least 105 hours (4 weeks × 35 hours/week = 140 hours × 75 percent = 105) in the final partial period.
(6) If the worker is paid on a piece rate basis, the employer must use the worker's average hourly piece rate earnings or the offered wage, whichever is higher, to calculate the amount due under the guarantee.
(7) A worker may be offered more than the specified hours of work on a single workday. For purposes of meeting the guarantee, however, the worker will not be required to work for more than the number of hours specified in the job order for a workday. The employer, however, may count all hours actually worked in calculating whether the guarantee has been met. If during any 12-week period (6-week period if the period of employment covered by the job order is less than 120 days) during the period of the job order the employer affords the U.S. or H-2B worker less employment than that required under paragraph (f)(1) of this section, the employer must pay such worker the amount the worker would have earned had the worker, in fact, worked for the guaranteed number of days. An
employer has not met the work guarantee if the employer has merely offered work on three-fourths of the workdays in an 12-week period (or 6-week period, as appropriate) if each workday did not consist of a full number of hours of work time as specified in the job order.
(8) Any hours the worker fails to work, up to a maximum of the number of hours specified in the job order for a workday, when the worker has been offered an opportunity to work in accordance with paragraph (f)(1) of this section, and all hours of work actually performed (including voluntary work over 8 hours in a workday), may be counted by the employer in calculating whether each 12-week period (or 6-week period, as appropriate) of guaranteed employment has been met. An employer seeking to calculate whether the guaranteed number of hours has been met must maintain the payroll records in accordance with this part.
(g)
Impossibility of fulfillment.
If, before the expiration date specified in the job order, the services of the worker are no longer required for reasons beyond the control of the employer due to fire, weather, or other Act of God, or similar unforeseeable man-made catastrophic event (such as an oil spill or controlled flooding) that is wholly outside the employer's control that makes the fulfillment of the job order impossible, the employer may terminate the job order with the approval of the CO. In the event of such termination of a job order, the employer must fulfill a three-fourths guarantee, as described in paragraph (f) of this section, for the time that has elapsed from the start date listed in the job order or the first workday after the arrival of the worker at the place of employment, whichever is later, to the time of its termination. The employer must make efforts to transfer the H-2B worker or worker in corresponding employment to other comparable employment acceptable to the worker and consistent with the INA, as applicable. If a transfer is not effected, the employer must return the worker, at the employer's expense, to the place from which the worker (disregarding intervening employment) came to work for the employer, or transport the worker to the worker's next certified H-2B employer, whichever the worker prefers.
(h)
Frequency of pay.
The employer must state in the job order the frequency with which the worker will be paid, which must be at least every 2 weeks or according to the prevailing practice in the area of intended employment, whichever is more frequent. Employers must pay wages when due.
(i)
Earnings statements.
(1) The employer must keep accurate and adequate records with respect to the workers' earnings, including but not limited to: records showing the nature, amount and location(s) of the work performed; the number of hours of work offered each day by the employer (broken out by hours offered both in accordance with and over and above the three-fourths guarantee in paragraph (f) of this section); the hours actually worked each day by the worker; if the number of hours worked by the worker is less than the number of hours offered, the reason(s) the worker did not work; the time the worker began and ended each workday; the rate of pay (both piece rate and hourly, if applicable); the worker's earnings per pay period; the worker's home address; and the amount of and reasons for any and all deductions taken from or additions made to the worker's wages.
(2) The employer must furnish to the worker on or before each payday in one or more written statements the following information:
(i) The worker's total earnings for each workweek in the pay period;
(ii) The worker's hourly rate and/or piece rate of pay;
(iii) For each workweek in the pay period the hours of employment offered to the worker (showing offers in accordance with the three-fourths guarantee as determined in paragraph (f) of this section, separate from any hours offered over and above the guarantee);
(iv) For each workweek in the pay period the hours actually worked by the worker;
(v) An itemization of all deductions made from or additions made to the worker's wages;
(vi) If piece rates are used, the units produced daily;
(vii) The beginning and ending dates of the pay period; and
(viii) The employer's name, address and FEIN.
(j)
Transportation and visa fees
—(1)(i)
Transportation to the place of employment.
The employer must provide or reimburse the worker for transportation and subsistence from the place from which the worker has come to work for the employer, whether in the U.S. or abroad, to the place of employment if the worker completes 50 percent of the period of employment covered by the job order (not counting any extensions). The employer may arrange and pay for the transportation and subsistence directly, advance at a minimum the most economical and reasonable common carrier cost of the transportation and subsistence to the worker before the worker's departure, or pay the worker for the reasonable costs incurred by the worker. When it is the prevailing practice of non-H-2B employers in the occupation in the area to do so or when the employer extends such benefits to similarly situated H-2B workers, the employer must advance the required transportation and subsistence costs (or otherwise provide them) to workers in corresponding employment who are traveling to the employer's worksite. The amount of the transportation payment must be no less (and is not required to be more) than the most economical and reasonable common carrier transportation charges for the distances involved. The amount of the daily subsistence must be at least the amount permitted in 20 CFR 655.173. Where the employer will reimburse the reasonable costs incurred by the worker, it must keep accurate and adequate records of: the costs of transportation and subsistence incurred by the worker; the amount reimbursed; and the date(s) of reimbursement. Note that the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) applies independently of the H-2B requirements and imposes obligations on employers regarding payment of wages.
(ii)
Transportation from the place of employment.
If the worker completes the period of employment covered by the job order (not counting any extensions), or if the worker is dismissed from employment for any reason by the employer before the end of the period, and the worker has no immediate subsequent H-2B employment, the employer must provide or pay at the time of departure for the worker's cost of return transportation and daily subsistence from the place of employment to the place from which the worker, disregarding intervening employment, departed to work for the employer. If the worker has contracted with a subsequent employer that has not agreed in the job order to provide or pay for the worker's transportation from the employer's worksite to such subsequent employer's worksite, the employer must provide or pay for that transportation and subsistence. If the worker has contracted with a subsequent employer that has agreed in the job order to provide or pay for the worker's transportation from the employer's worksite to such subsequent employer's worksite, the subsequent employer must provide or pay for such expenses.
(iii)
Employer-provided transportation.
All employer-provided transportation must comply with all applicable Federal, State, and local laws and regulations and must provide, at a minimum, the same vehicle safety standards, driver licensure requirements, and vehicle insurance as required under 49 CFR parts 390, 393, and 396.
(iv)
Disclosure.
All transportation and subsistence costs that the employer will pay must be disclosed in the job order.
(2) The employer must pay or reimburse the worker in the first workweek for all visa, visa processing, border crossing, and other related fees (including those mandated by the government) incurred by the H-2B worker, but not for passport expenses or other charges primarily for the benefit of the worker.
(k)
Employer-provided items.
The employer must provide to the worker, without charge or deposit charge, all tools, supplies, and equipment required to perform the duties assigned.
(l)
Disclosure of job order.
The employer must provide to an H-2B worker outside of the U.S. no later than the time at which the worker applies for the visa, or to a worker in corresponding employment no later than on the day work commences, a copy of the job order including any subsequent approved modifications. For an H-2B
worker changing employment from an H-2B employer to a subsequent H-2B employer, the copy must be provided no later than the time an offer of employment is made by the subsequent H-2B employer. The disclosure of all documents required by this paragraph (l) must be provided in a language understood by the worker, as necessary or reasonable.
(m)
Notice of worker rights.
The employer must post and maintain in a conspicuous location at the place of employment a poster provided by the Department of Labor that sets out the rights and protections for H-2B workers and workers in corresponding employment. The employer must post the poster in English. To the extent necessary, the employer must request and post additional posters, as made available by the Department of Labor, in any language common to a significant portion of the workers if they are not fluent in English.
(n)
No unfair treatment.
The employer has not and will not intimidate, threaten, restrain, coerce, blacklist, discharge or in any manner discriminate against, and has not and will not cause any person to intimidate, threaten, restrain, coerce, blacklist, discharge, or in any manner discriminate against, any person who has:
(1) Filed a complaint under or related to 8 U.S.C. 1184(c), section 214(c) of the INA, 20 CFR part 655, subpart A, or this part or any other regulation promulgated thereunder;
(2) Instituted or caused to be instituted any proceeding under or related to 8 U.S.C. 1184(c), section 214(c) of the INA, 20 CFR part 655, subpart A, or this part or any other regulation promulgated thereunder;
(3) Testified or is about to testify in any proceeding under or related to 8 U.S.C. 1184(c), section 214(c) of the INA, 20 CFR part 655, subpart A, or this part or any other regulation promulgated thereunder;
(4) Consulted with a workers' center, community organization, labor union, legal assistance program, or an attorney on matters related to 8 U.S.C. 1184(c), section 214(c) of the INA, 20 CFR part 655, subpart A, or this part or any other regulation promulgated thereunder; or
(5) Exercised or asserted on behalf of himself or herself or others any right or protection afforded by 8 U.S.C. 1184(c), section 214(c) of the INA, 20 CFR part 655, subpart A, or this part or any other regulation promulgated thereunder.
(o)
Comply with the prohibitions against employees paying fees.
The employer and its attorney, agents, or employees have not sought or received payment of any kind from the worker for any activity related to obtaining H-2B labor certification or employment, including payment of the employer's attorney or agent fees, application and
H-2B Petition
fees, recruitment costs, or any fees attributed to obtaining the approved
Application for Temporary Employment Certification.
For purposes of this paragraph (o), payment includes, but is not limited to, monetary payments, wage concessions (including deductions from wages, salary, or benefits), kickbacks, bribes, tributes, in-kind payments, and free labor. All wages must be paid free and clear. This provision does not prohibit employers or their agents from receiving reimbursement for costs that are the responsibility and primarily for the benefit of the worker, such as government-required passport fees.
(p)
Contracts with third parties to comply with prohibitions.
The employer must contractually prohibit in writing any agent or recruiter (or any agent or employee of such agent or recruiter) whom the employer engages, either directly or indirectly, in recruitment of H-2B workers to seek or receive payments or other compensation from prospective workers. The contract must include the following statement: “Under this agreement, [name of agent, recruiter] and any agent of or employee of [name of agent or recruiter] are prohibited from seeking or receiving payments from any prospective employee of [employer name] at any time, including before or after the worker obtains employment. Payments include but are not limited to, any direct or indirect fees paid by such employees for recruitment, job placement, processing, maintenance, attorneys' fees, agent fees, application fees, or petition fees.”
(q)
Prohibition against preferential treatment of foreign workers.
The employer's job offer must offer to U.S. workers no less than the same benefits, wages, and working conditions that the employer is offering, intends to offer, or will provide to H-2B workers. Job offers may not impose on U.S. workers any restrictions or obligations that will not be imposed on the employer's H-2B workers. This does not relieve the employer from providing to H-2B workers at least the minimum benefits, wages, and working conditions which must be offered to U.S. workers consistent with this section.
(r)
Non-discriminatory hiring practices.
The job opportunity is, and through the period set forth in paragraph (t) of this section must continue to be, open to any qualified U.S. worker regardless of race, color, national origin, age, sex, religion, disability, or citizenship. Rejections of any U.S. workers who applied or apply for the job must only be for lawful, job-related reasons, and those not rejected on this basis have been or will be hired. In addition, the employer has and will continue to retain records of all hired workers and rejected applicants as required by § 503.17.
(s)
Recruitment requirements.
The employer must conduct all required recruitment activities, including any additional employer-conducted recruitment activities as directed by the CO, and as specified in 20 CFR 655.40 through 655.46.
(t)
Continuing requirement to hire U.S. workers.
The employer has and will continue to cooperate with the SWA by accepting referrals of all qualified U.S. workers who apply (or on whose behalf a job application is made) for the job opportunity, and must provide employment to any qualified U.S. worker who applies to the employer for the job opportunity, until 21 days before the date of need.
(u)
No strike or lockout.
There is no strike or lockout at any of the employer's worksites within the area of intended employment for which the employer is requesting H-2B certification at the time the
Application for Temporary Employment Certification
is filed.
(v)
No recent or future layoffs.
The employer has not laid off and will not lay off any similarly employed U.S. worker in the occupation that is the subject of the
Application for Temporary Employment Certification
in the area of intended employment within the period beginning 120 calendar days before the date of need through the end of the period of certification. A layoff for lawful, job-related reasons such as lack of work or the end of a season is permissible if all H-2B workers are laid off before any U.S. worker in corresponding employment.
(w)
Contact with former U.S. employees.
The employer will contact (by mail or other effective means) its former U.S. workers, including those who have been laid off within 120 calendar days before the date of need (except those who were dismissed for cause or who abandoned the worksite), employed by the employer in the occupation at the place of employment during the previous year, disclose the terms of the job order, and solicit their return to the job.
(x)
Area of intended employment and job opportunity.
The employer must not place any H-2B workers employed under the approved
Application for Temporary Employment Certification
outside the area of intended employment or in a job opportunity not listed on the approved
Application for Temporary Employment Certification
unless the employer has obtained a new approved
Application for Temporary Employment Certification.
(y)
Abandonment/termination of employment.
Upon the separation from employment of worker(s) employed under the
Application for Temporary Employment Certification
or workers in corresponding employment, if such separation occurs before the end date of the employment specified in the
Application for Temporary Employment Certification,
the employer must notify OFLC in writing of the separation from employment not later than 2 work days after such separation is discovered by the employer. In addition, the employer must notify DHS in writing (or any other method specified by the Department of Labor or DHS in the
Federal Register
or the Code of Federal Regulations) of such separation of an H-2B worker. An abandonment or abscondment is deemed to begin after a
worker fails to report for work at the regularly scheduled time for 5 consecutive working days without the consent of the employer. If the separation is due to the voluntary abandonment of employment by the H-2B worker or worker in corresponding employment, and the employer provides appropriate notification specified under this paragraph (y), the employer will not be responsible for providing or paying for the subsequent transportation and subsistence expenses of that worker under this section, and that worker is not entitled to the three-fourths guarantee described in paragraph (f) of this section. The employer's obligation to guarantee three-fourths of the work described in paragraph (f) ends with the last full 12-week period (or 6-week period, as appropriate) preceding the worker's voluntary abandonment or termination for cause.
(z)
Compliance with applicable laws.
During the period of employment specified on the
Application for Temporary Employment Certification,
the employer must comply with all applicable Federal, State and local employment-related laws and regulations, including health and safety laws. This includes compliance with 18 U.S.C. 1592(a), with respect to prohibitions against employers, the employer's agents or their attorneys knowingly holding, destroying or confiscating workers' passports, visas, or other immigration documents.
(aa)
Disclosure of foreign worker recruitment.
The employer, and its attorney or agent, as applicable, must comply with 20 CFR 655.9 by providing a copy of all agreements with any agent or recruiter whom it engages or plans to engage in the recruitment of H-2B workers, and the identity and location of the persons or entities hired by or working for the agent or recruiter, and any of the agents or employees of those persons and entities, to recruit foreign workers. Pursuant to 20 CFR 655.15(a), the agreements and information must be filed with the
Application for Temporary Employment Certification.
(bb)
Cooperation with investigators.
The employer must cooperate with any employee of the Secretary who is exercising or attempting to exercise the Department's authority pursuant to 8 U.S.C. 1184(c)(14)(B), section 214(c)(14)(B) of the INA.

§ 503.19
Violations.
(a)
Types of violations.
Pursuant to the statutory provisions governing enforcement of the H-2B program, 8 U.S.C. 1184(c)(14), a violation exists under this part where the Administrator, WHD determines that there has been a:
(1) Willful misrepresentation of a material fact on the
H-2B Registration, Application for Prevailing Wage Determination,
Application for Temporary Employment Certification,
or
H-2B Petition;
(2) Substantial failure to meet any of the terms and conditions of the
H-2B Registration, Application for Prevailing Wage Determination,
Application for Temporary Employment Certification,
or
H-2B Petition.
A substantial failure is a
willful failure to comply that constitutes a significant deviation from the terms and conditions of such documents; or
(3) Willful misrepresentation of a material fact to the Department of State during the H-2B nonimmigrant visa application process.
(b)
Determining whether a violation is willful.
A willful misrepresentation of a material fact or a willful failure to meet the required terms and conditions occurs when the employer, attorney, or agent knows its statement is false or that its conduct is in violation, or shows reckless disregard for the truthfulness of its representation or for whether its conduct satisfies the required conditions.
(c)
Determining whether a violation is significant.
In determining whether a violation is a significant deviation from the terms and conditions of the
H-2B Registration, Application for Prevailing Wage Determination,
Application for Temporary Employment Certification,
or
H-2B Petition,
the factors that the Administrator, WHD may consider include, but are not limited to, the following:
(1) Previous history of violation(s) under the H-2B program;
(2) The number of H-2B workers, workers in corresponding employment, or U.S. workers who were and/or are affected by the violation(s);
(3) The gravity of the violation(s);
(4) The extent to which the violator achieved a financial gain due to the violation(s), or the potential financial loss or potential injury to the worker(s); and
(5) Whether U.S. workers have been harmed by the violation.
(d)
Employer acceptance of obligations.
The provisions of this part become applicable upon the date that the employer's
Application for Temporary Employment Certification
is accepted. The employer's submission of the approved
H-2B Registration, Application for Prevailing Wage Determination,
the employer's survey attestation (Form ETA-9165), Appendix B of the
Application for Temporary Employment Certification,
and
H-2B Petition
constitute the employer's representation that the statements on the forms are accurate and that it knows and accepts the obligations of the program.
§ 503.20
Sanctions and remedies—general.
Whenever the Administrator, WHD determines that there has been a violation(s), as described in § 503.19, such action will be taken and such proceedings instituted as deemed appropriate, including (but not limited to) the following:
(a) Institute administrative proceedings, including for: the recovery of unpaid wages (including recovery of prohibited recruitment fees paid or impermissible deductions from pay, and recovery of wages due for improperly placing workers in areas of employment or in occupations other than those identified on the
Application for Temporary Employment Certification
and for which a prevailing wage was not obtained); the enforcement of provisions of the job order, 8 U.S.C. 1184(c), 20 CFR part 655, subpart A, or the regulations in this part; the assessment of a civil money penalty; make whole relief for any person who has been discriminated against; reinstatement and make whole relief for any U.S. worker who has been improperly rejected for employment, laid off or displaced; or debarment for no less than 1 or no more than 5 years.
(b) The remedies referenced in paragraph (a) of this section will be sought either directly from the employer, or from its successor in interest, or from the employer's agent or attorney, as appropriate.
§ 503.21
Concurrent actions within the Department of Labor.
OFLC has primary responsibility to make all determinations regarding the issuance, denial, or revocation of a labor certification as described in § 503.1(b) and in 20 CFR part 655, subpart A. The WHD has primary responsibility to make all determinations regarding the enforcement functions as described in § 503.1(c). The taking of any one of the actions referred to above will not be a bar to the concurrent taking of any other action authorized by 8 U.S.C. 1184(c), 20 CFR part 655, subpart A, or the regulations in this
part. OFLC and the WHD have concurrent jurisdiction to impose a debarment remedy under 20 CFR 655.73 or under § 503.24.
§ 503.22
Representation of the Secretary.
The Solicitor of Labor, through authorized representatives, will represent the Administrator, WHD and the Secretary in all administrative hearings under 8 U.S.C. 1184(c)(14) and the regulations in this part.
§ 503.23
Civil money penalty assessment.
(a) A civil money penalty may be assessed by the Administrator, WHD for each violation that meets the standards described in § 503.19. Each such violation involving the failure to pay an individual worker properly or to honor the terms or conditions of a worker's employment required by the
H-2B Registration, Application for Prevailing Wage Determination, Application for Temporary Employment Certification,
or
H-2B Petition,
constitutes a separate violation. Civil money penalty amounts for such violations are determined as set forth in paragraphs (b) to (e) of this section.
(b) Upon determining that an employer has violated any provisions of § 503.16 related to wages, impermissible deductions or prohibited fees and expenses, the Administrator, WHD, may assess civil money penalties that are equal to the difference between the amount that should have been paid and the amount that actually was paid to such worker(s), not to exceed $15,846 per violation.
(c) Upon determining that an employer has terminated by layoff or otherwise or has refused to employ any worker in violation of § 503.16(r), (t), or (v), within the periods described in those sections, the Administrator, WHD may assess civil money penalties that are equal to the wages that would have been earned but for the layoff or failure to hire, not to exceed $15,846 per violation. No civil money penalty will be assessed, however, if the employee refused the job opportunity, or was terminated for lawful, job-related reasons.
(d) The Administrator, WHD, may assess civil money penalties in an amount not to exceed $15,846 per violation for any other violation that meets the standards described in § 503.19.
(e) In determining the amount of the civil money penalty to be assessed under paragraph (d) of this section, the Administrator, WHD will consider the type of violation committed and other relevant factors. In determining the level of penalties to be assessed, the highest penalties will be reserved for willful failures to meet any of the conditions of the
Application for Temporary Employment Certification
and
H-2B Petition
that involve harm to U.S. workers. Other factors which may be considered include, but are not limited to, the following:
(1) Previous history of violation(s) of 8 U.S.C. 1184(c), 20 CFR part 655, subpart A, or the regulations in this part;
(2) The number of H-2B workers, workers in corresponding employment, or improperly rejected U.S. applicants who were and/or are affected by the violation(s);
(3) The gravity of the violation(s);
(4) Efforts made in good faith to comply with 8 U.S.C. 1184(c), 20 CFR part 655, subpart A, and the regulations in this part;
(5) Explanation from the person charged with the violation(s);
(6) Commitment to future compliance, taking into account the public health, interest or safety; and
(7) The extent to which the violator achieved a financial gain due to the violation, or the potential financial loss or potential injury to the workers.

§ 503.24
Debarment.
(a)
Debarment of an employer.
The Administrator, OFLC may not issue future labor certifications under 20 CFR part 655, subpart A to an employer or any successor in interest to that employer, subject to the time limits set forth in paragraph (c) of this section, if the Administrator, WHD finds that the employer committed a violation that meets the standards of § 503.19. Where
these standards are met, debarrable violations would include but not be limited to one or more acts of commission or omission which involve:
(1) Failure to pay or provide the required wages, benefits, or working conditions to the employer's H-2B workers and/or workers in corresponding employment;
(2) Failure, except for lawful, job-related reasons, to offer employment to qualified U.S. workers who applied for the job opportunity for which certification was sought;
(3) Failure to comply with the employer's obligations to recruit U.S. workers;
(4) Improper layoff or displacement of U.S. workers or workers in corresponding employment;
(5) Failure to comply with one or more sanctions or remedies imposed by the Administrator, WHD for violation(s) of obligations under the job order or other H-2B obligations, or with one or more decisions or orders of the Secretary or a court under 20 CFR part 655, subpart A or this part;
(6) Impeding an investigation of an employer under this part;
(7) Employing an H-2B worker outside the area of intended employment, in an activity/activities not listed in the job order, or outside the validity period of employment of the job order, including any approved extension thereof;
(8) A violation of the requirements of § 503.16(o) or (p);
(9) A violation of any of the provisions listed in § 503.16(r);
(10) Any other act showing such flagrant disregard for the law that future compliance with program requirements cannot reasonably be expected;
(11) Fraud involving the
H-2B Registration, Application for Prevailing Wage Determination, Application for Temporary Employment Certification,
or
H-2B Petition;
or
(12) A material misrepresentation of fact during the registration or application process.
(b)
Debarment of an agent or attorney.
If the Administrator, WHD finds, under this section, that an agent or attorney committed a violation as described in paragraph (a) of this section or participated in an employer's violation, the Administrator, OFLC may not issue future labor certifications to an employer represented by such agent or attorney, subject to the time limits set forth in paragraph (c) of this section.
(c)
Period of debarment.
Debarment under this subpart may not be for less than 1 year or more than 5 years from the date of the final agency decision.
(d)
Debarment procedure.
If the Administrator, WHD makes a determination to debar an employer, attorney, or agent, the Administrator, WHD will send the party a Notice of Debarment. The notice will state the reason for the debarment finding, including a detailed explanation of the grounds for and the duration of the debarment and inform the party subject to the notice of its right to request a debarment hearing and the timeframe under which such rights must be exercised under § 503.43. If the party does not request a hearing within 30 calendar days of the date of the Notice of Debarment, the notice is the final agency action and the debarment will take effect at the end of the 30-day period. The timely filing of an administrative appeal stays the debarment pending the outcome of the appeal as provided in § 503.43(e).
(e)
Concurrent debarment jurisdiction.
OFLC and the WHD have concurrent jurisdiction debar under 20 CFR 655.73 or under this part. When considering debarment, OFLC and the WHD will coordinate their activities. A specific violation for which debarment is imposed will be cited in a single debarment proceeding. Copies of final debarment decisions will be forwarded to DHS and DOS promptly.
(f)
Debarment from other labor certification programs.
Upon debarment under this part or 20 CFR 655.73, the debarred party will be disqualified from filing any labor certification applications or labor condition applications with the Department of Labor by, or on behalf of, the debarred party for the same period of time set forth in the final debarment decision.
§ 503.25
Failure to cooperate with investigators.
(a) No person will interfere or refuse to cooperate with any employee of the Secretary who is exercising or attempting to exercise the Department's
investigative or enforcement authority under 8 U.S.C. 1184(c). Federal statutes prohibiting persons from interfering with a Federal officer in the course of official duties are found at 18 U.S.C. 111 and 18 U.S.C. 114.
(b) Where an employer (or employer's agent or attorney) interferes or does not cooperate with an investigation concerning the employment of an H-2B worker or a worker in corresponding employment, or a U.S. worker who has been improperly rejected for employment or improperly laid off or displaced, WHD may make such information available to OFLC and may recommend that OFLC revoke the existing certification that is the basis for the employment of the H-2B workers giving rise to the investigation. In addition, WHD may take such action as appropriate where the failure to cooperate meets the standards in § 503.19, including initiating proceedings for the debarment of the employer from future certification for up to 5 years, and/or assessing civil money penalties against any person who has failed to cooperate with a WHD investigation. The taking of any one action will not bar the taking of any additional action.
§ 503.26
Civil money penalties—payment and collection.
Where a civil money penalty is assessed in a final order by the Administrator, WHD, by an ALJ, or by the ARB, the amount of the penalty must be received by the Administrator, WHD within 30 calendar days of the date of the final order. The person assessed the penalty will remit the amount ordered to the Administrator, WHD by certified check or by money order, made payable to the Wage and Hour Division, United States Department of Labor. The remittance will be delivered or mailed to the WHD Regional Office for the area in which the violations occurred.

# Procedures Before Administrative Law Judge
§ 503.49
Consent findings and order.
(a)
General.
At any time after the commencement of a proceeding under this part, but before the reception of evidence in any such proceeding, a party may move to defer the receipt of any evidence for a reasonable time to permit negotiation of an agreement containing consent findings and an order disposing of the whole or any part of the proceeding. The allowance of such deferment and the duration thereof will be at the discretion of the ALJ, after consideration of the nature of the proceeding, the requirements of the public interest, the representations of the parties, and the probability of an agreement being reached which will result in a just disposition of the issues involved.
(b)
Content.
Any agreement containing consent findings and an order disposing of a proceeding or any part thereof will also provide:
(1) That the order will have the same force and effect as an order made after full hearing;
(2) That the entire record on which any order may be based will consist solely of the notice of administrative determination (or amended notice, if one is filed), and the agreement;
(3) A waiver of any further procedural steps before the ALJ; and
(4) A waiver of any right to challenge or contest the validity of the findings and order entered into in accordance with the agreement.
(c)
Submission.
On or before the expiration of the time granted for negotiations, the parties or their attorney or agent may:
(1) Submit the proposed agreement for consideration by the ALJ; or
(2) Inform the ALJ that agreement cannot be reached.
(d)
Disposition.
In the event an agreement containing consent findings and an order is submitted within the time allowed therefore, the ALJ, within 30 days thereafter, will, if satisfied with its form and substance, accept such agreement by issuing a decision based upon the agreed findings.

The decision will also include an appropriate order which may affirm, deny, reverse, or modify, in whole or in part, the determination of the Administrator, WHD. The reason or reasons for such order will be stated in the decision.
(c) In the event that the Administrator, WHD assesses back wages for wage violation(s) of § 503.16 based upon a PWD obtained by the Administrator from OFLC during the investigation and the ALJ determines that the Administrator's request was not warranted, the ALJ will remand the matter to the Administrator for further proceedings on the Administrator's determination. If there is no such determination and remand by the ALJ, the ALJ will accept as final and accurate the wage determination obtained from OFLC or, in the event the party filed a timely appeal under 20 CFR 655.13 the final wage determination resulting from that process. Under no circumstances will the ALJ determine the validity of the wage determination or require submission into evidence or disclosure of source data or the names of establishments contacted in developing the survey which is the basis for the PWD.
(d) The decision will be served on all parties.
(e) The decision concerning civil money penalties, debarment, monetary relief, and/or other administrative remedies, when served by the ALJ will constitute the final agency order unless the ARB, as provided for in § 503.51, determines to review the decision.

# Review of Administrative Law Judge's Decision
§ 503.51
Procedures for initiating and undertaking review.
(a) A respondent, the WHD, or any other party wishing review, including judicial review, of the decision of an ALJ will, within 30 days of the decision of the ALJ, petition the ARB to review the decision. Copies of the petition will be served on all parties and on the ALJ.

a timely filing of the petition, or within 30 days of the date of the decision if no petition has been received, the decision of the ALJ will be deemed the final agency action.
(d) Whenever the ARB, either on the ARB's own motion or by acceptance of a party's petition, determines to review the decision of an ALJ, a notice of the same will be served upon the ALJ and upon all parties to the proceeding.

[48 FR 36741, Aug. 12, 1983, as amended at 82 FR 2227, Jan. 9, 2017]
§ 505.3
Prevailing minimum compensation.
(a)(1) In the absence of an alternative determination made by the Administrator under paragraph (b) of this section, and except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the prevailing minimum compensation required to be paid under the Act to the
various professional performers and related or supporting professional personnel employed on projects or productions assisted by grants from the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities shall be the compensation (including fringe benefits) contained in collective bargaining agreements negotiated by the following national or international labor organizations or their local affiliates:

International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees and Moving Picture Machine Operators.

(2) Professional performers and related or supporting professional personnel who are to perform activities which do not come within the jurisdiction of any collective bargaining agreement negotiated by the labor organizations named in paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall be paid minimum compensation as determined by agreement of the grant applicant or grantee and the personnel who will perform such activities or their representatives. Evidence of the agreement reached by the parties shall be submitted by the grant applicant to the grant agency, together with evidence of the prevailing minimum compensation for similar activities. If the parties do not agree on the minimum compensation to be paid to such personnel, the matter shall be referred to the Administrator of the Wage and Hour Division for final determination.
(b)(1) Interested parties, including grant applicants, grantees, professional performers or related or supporting professional personnel and their representatives, may at any time submit to the Administrator a request for a determination of prevailing minimum compensation. The Administrator will make a determination concerning each such request in accordance with paragraph (b)(4) of this section.
(2) Any request for a determination of prevailing minimum compensation shall include or be accompanied by information as to the locality or localities, the class or classes of professional performers or related or supporting professional personnel for the project or production in question, the names and addresses (to the extent known) of interested parties, and all available information relating to prevailing minimum compensation currently being paid to such persons or to persons employed in similar activities. No particular form is prescribed for submission of information under this section.
(3) If the information specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section is not submitted with a request for an alternative determination of prevailing minimum compensation or is insufficient to permit a determination, the Administrator may deny the request or request additional information, at the Administrator's discretion. Pertinent information from any source may be considered by the Administrator in connection with any request.
(4) The Administrator will respond to a request for determination under this section within 30 days of receipt, by issuing a determination of alternative prevailing minimum compensation or denying the request or advising that additional time is necessary for a decision. If the Administrator determines from a preponderance of all relevant evidence obtained in connection with the request that the compensation provided for in the agreements negotiated by the labor organizations set forth in paragraph (a) of this section does not prevail for any professional performer or related or supporting professional personnel employed on similar activities in the locality, the Administrator will issue a determination of the prevailing minimum compensation required to be paid under the Act to such persons. If the Administrator finds that the compensation provided for in the agreements negotiated by the labor organizations set forth in paragraph (a)
of this section does prevail for the professional performers or related or supporting professional personnel in question, the requesting party will be so notified.
(c) All professional performers and related or supporting professional personnel (other than laborers or mechanics with respect to whom labor standards are prescribed in section 5(j) and 7(j) of the Act) employed on projects or productions which are financed in whole or in part under section 5 or section 7 of the Act will be paid, without subsequent deduction or rebate on any account, not less than the prevailing minimum compensation determined in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, unless an alternative determination is made under paragraph (b) of this section. Pending the decision of the Administrator on a request for determination under paragraph (b) of this section, the grantee may be required to set aside in a separate escrow account sufficient funds to satisfy the difference between the compensation (including fringe benefits) actually paid to the employee(s) in question, and the compensation (including fringe benefits) required under the applicable collective bargaining agreement negotiated by the labor organization named in paragraph (a) of this section, or furnish a bond with a surety or sureties satisfactory to the Administrator for the protection of the compensation of the affected employees.
§ 505.4
Receipt of grant funds.
(a) The grantee shall not receive funds authorized by section 5 or section 7 of the Act until adequate initial assurances have been filed with the Chairperson of the National Endowment for the Arts or the Chairperson of the National Endowment for the Humanities, pursuant to sections 5(i) (1) and (2) and sections 7(g) (1) and (2) of the Act as provided in § 505.5(a), that all professional performers and related or supporting professional personnel will be paid not less than the prevailing minimum compensation and that the safety and health requirements will be complied with. Neither shall the grantee receive any such funds if and after the Chairperson of the National Endowment for the Arts or Chairperson of the National Endowment for the Humanities is advised by the Secretary that continuing assurances as provided in § 505.5(b) are inadequate or that labor standards contemplated by sections 5(i) (1) and (2) or sections 7(g) (1) and (2) of the Act have not been observed.
(b) In order to facilitate such assurances so that the grantee may receive the grant funds promptly, the Chairpersons of the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities will transmit with the grant letter, to each grantee of a grant that will provide assistance to projects or productions employing professional performers or related or supporting professional personnel under section 5 or section 7 of the Act, a copy of these regulations together with two copies of the assurance form (Form No. ESA-38). The Chairperson will advise the grantee that before the grant may be received, the grantee must give assurances that all professional performers and related or supporting professional personnel (other than laborers or mechanics with respect to whom labor standards are prescribed in section 5(j) and section 7(j) of the Act), will be paid, without subsequent deduction or rebate on any account not less than the minimum compensation determined in accordance with § 505.3 (a) or (b) and that the safety and health requirements under § 505.6 will be met. The Chairpersons will maintain on file in Washington, DC, for a period of three (3) years and make available upon request of the Secretary the original signed Form ESA-38 and a copy of the grant letter together with any supplementary documents needed to give a description of the project or production to be financed in whole or in part under the grant.
§ 505.5
Adequate assurances.
(a)
Initial assurances.
The grantee shall give adequate initial assurances that not less than the prevailing minimum compensation determined in accordance with § 505.3 will be paid to all professional performers and related or supporting professional personnel, and that no part of the project or production will be performed under working conditions which are unsanitary or
hazardous or dangerous to the health and safety of the employees, by executing and filing with the Chairperson of the National Endowment for the Arts or the Chairperson of the National Endowment for the Humanities, as appropriate, Form ESA-38.
(b)
Continuing assurances.
(1) The grantee shall maintain and preserve sufficient records as an assurance of compliance with section 5(i) (1) and (2) and section 7(g) (1) and (2) of the Act and shall make such reports therefrom to the Secretary as necessary or appropriate to assure the adequacy of the assurances given. Such records shall be kept for a period of three (3) years after the end of the grant period to which they pertain. These records shall include the following information relating to each performer and related or supporting professional personnel to whom a prevailing minimum compensation determination applies pursuant to § 505.3. In addition the record required in paragraph (b)(1)(vii) of this section shall be kept for all employees engaged in the project or production assisted by the grant.
(i) Name.
(ii) Home address.
(iii) Occupation.
(iv) Basic unit of compensation (such as the amount of a weekly or monthly salary, talent or performance fee, hourly rate or other basis on which compensation is computed), including fringe benefits or amounts paid in lieu thereof.
(v) Work performed for each pay period expressed in terms of the total units of compensation fully and partially completed.
(vi) Total compensation paid each pay period, deductions made, and date of payment, including amounts paid for fringe benefits and the person to whom they were paid, and
(vii) Brief description of any injury incurred while performing under the grant and the dates and duration of disability.
(2) The grantee shall permit the Administrator and the Assistant Secretary or their representatives to investigate and gather data regarding the wages, hours, safety, health, and other conditions and practices of employment related to the project or production, and to enter and inspect such project or production and such records (and make such transcriptions thereof), interview such employees during normal working hours, and investigate such facts, conditions, practices, or matters as may be deemed necessary or appropriate to determine whether the grantee has violated the labor standards contemplated by section 5(i) and section 7(g) of the Act.
(c)
Determination of adequacy.
The Administrator and Assistant Secretary shall determine the adequacy of assurances given pursuant to paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section within each of their respective areas of responsibilities, and may revise any such determination at any time.
(The requirements in paragraph (b) were approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 1235-0018)
[53 FR 23541, June 22, 1988; 53 FR 24171, June 27, 1988, as amended at 82 FR 2227, Jan. 9, 2017]
§ 505.6
Safety and health standards.
(a)
Standards.
Section 5(i)(2) and section 7(g)(2) of the Act provide that “no part of any project or production which is financed in whole or in part under this section will be performed or engaged in under working conditions which are unsanitary or hazardous or dangerous to the health and safety of the employees engaged in such project or production. Compliance with the safety and sanitary laws in the State in which the performance or part thereof is to take place shall be prima facie evidence of compliance. * * *” The applicable safety and health standards shall be those set forth in 29 CFR parts 1910 and 1926, including matters incorporated by reference therein. Evidence of compliance with State laws relating to health and sanitation will be considered prime facie evidence of compliance with the safety and health requirements of the Act, and it shall be sufficient unless rebutted or overcome by a preponderance of evidence of a failure to comply with any applicable safety and health standards set forth in 29 CFR parts 1910 and 1926, including matters incorporated by reference therein.
(b)
Variances.
(1) Variances from standards applied under paragraph (a)
of this section may be granted under the same circumstances in which variances may be granted under section 6(b)(6)(A) or 6(d) of the Williams-Steiger Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (29 U.S.C. 655). The procedures for the granting of variances and for related relief are those published in part 1905 of this title.
(2) Any requests for variances shall also be considered requests for variances under the Williams-Steiger Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, and any variance from a standard applied under paragraph (a) of this section and in part 1910 of this title shall be deemed a variance from the standards under both the National Foundation on the Arts and Humanities Act of 1965 and the Williams-Steiger Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970.
§ 505.7
Failure to comply.
The Secretary's representatives shall maintain a list of those grantees who are considered to be responsible for instances of failure to comply with the obligation of the grantees specified in section 5(i) (1) and (2) and section 7(g) (1) and (2) of the Act, which are considered to have been willful or of such nature as to cast doubt on the reliability of formal assurances subsequently given and there shall be maintained a similar list where adjustment of the violations satisfactory to the Secretary was not properly made. Assurances from persons or organizations placed on either such list or any organization in which they have a substantial interest shall be considered inadequate for purposes of receiving further grants for a period not to exceed three (3) years from the date of notification by the Secretary that they have been placed on the lists unless, by appropriate application to the Secretary, they demonstrate a current responsibility to comply with section 5(i) (1) and (2) and section 7(g) (1) and (2) of the Act, and demonstrate that correction of the violations has been made.

# Subpart A—General
§ 510.1
Summary.
(a) The Fair Labor Standards Amendments of 1989 (Pub. L. 101-157) were enacted into law on November 17, 1989. Among other provisions, these amendments to the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) increased the minimum wage in section 6(a)(1) of the Act to $3.80 an hour effective April 1, 1990, and to $4.25 an hour effective April 1, 1991. With respect to certain industries and governmental entities in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Amendments provided that these increases would be phased in over extended periods of time.
(b) Section 6(c) of the FLSA provides for four separate categories or tiers for implementing the minimum wage rate increases in Puerto Rico.
(1) For Tier 1, which includes employees of the United States, employees of hotels, motels, or restaurants, retail or service establishments that employ such employees primarily in connection with the preparation or offering of food or beverages for human consumption, and industries in which the average hourly wage is greater than $4.64, there shall be no phase-in. The wage rates and effective dates shall be those specified in section 6(a)(1) of FLSA, i.e., $3.80 per hour beginning April 1, 1990 and $4.25 per hour beginning April 1, 1991.
(2) For Tier 2, which includes industries in which the average hourly wage is not less than $4.00 but not more than $4.64, the increases in the minimum wage rates shall be phased-in in five annual increments (rounded to the nearest 5 cents) beginning April 1, 1990, and ending April 1, 1994.
(3) For Tier 3, which includes industries in which the average hourly wage is less than $4.00, the increases in the minimum wage shall be phased-in in six annual increments (rounded to the nearest 5 cents) beginning April 1, 1990, and ending April 1, 1995.
(4) For Tier 4, which includes certain employees of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, municipalities, and other governmental entities of the Commonwealth in which the average hourly wage is less than $4.00, the increases shall be phased-in in seven annual increments (rounded to the nearest 5 cents) beginning April 1, 1990 and ending April 1, 1996.
(c) The Amendments also eliminated reference to Puerto Rico in those sections of FLSA relating to the establishment and conduct of special industry committees which recommend minimum wage rates in certain territories. These sections now apply only to American Samoa. (Industry committee regulations pertaining to American Samoa are found in 29 CFR parts 511 and 697).
§ 510.2
Purpose and scope of regulations.
(a) The purpose of these regulations is to implement the 1989 Amendments to the FLSA with respect to minimum wage increases in Puerto Rico. These regulations establish the applicable wage rates and effective dates in the four statutory tiers and categorize industries and governmental entities in Puerto Rico in those tiers according to average hourly wage rates. In addition, these regulations explain the methodology used to determine appropriate tiers, including the use of standard industrial classification (SIC) codes to categorize industries.
(b) Subpart A of this part summarizes the provisions of the Amendments as applicable to Puerto Rico and defines the terms used herein. Subpart B of this part states the specific minimum wage rates for each tier and the effective dates of those rates. Subpart C of this part explains how industry and governmental categories were determined, the general methodology used to conduct the surveys which provided the data used to determine average hourly wage rates, and special issues in the classification of governmental entities. Appendix A of this part contains a listing of manufacturing industries by Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code and indicates the tier to which each industry is subject. Appendix B of this part contains a listing of nonmanufacturing industries by SIC code and indicates the tier to which each industry is subject. Appendix C of this part contains a listing of government corporations and indicates the tier to which each such corporation is subject. Appendix D of this part contains a listing of municipalities and indicates the tier to which each municipality is subject.
(c) Nothing contained in this part should be construed as precluding the Puerto Rico Minimum Wage Board, which has been granted authority to promulgate minimum wage rates above the Federal statutory minimum, from providing for increases in any industry which would exceed the rates provided for in these regulations or in section 6(a)(1) of the Act.

# Subpart C—Classification of Industries
§ 510.20
Wage surveys in Puerto Rico.
(a) The legislative history to the 1989 Amendments (Conference Report 101-47 on H.R. 2, May 8, 1989) stated that for any industry to qualify for an extended minimum wage phase-in, the government of Puerto Rico would be required to furnish official survey data substantiating that an industry's average hourly wage is below either the $4.65 or $4.00 threshold level. Such data were to be compiled and submitted for review to the Department.
(b)
Manufacturing industries.
For purposes of implementing section 6(c) of the Act, as amended, Puerto Rico has submitted its Census of Manufacturing Industries. The Bureau of Labor Statistics of Puerto Rico regularly gathers data from manufacturing establishments regarding employment, hours and earnings. The data include hourly earnings for production and related workers and are generally specific to the four-digit SIC code level.
(c)
Non-manufacturing industries.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics of Puerto Rico designed and executed a survey to supplement data regularly gathered for the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (
i.e.
, that included in the payroll establishment survey published in
Employment and Earnings
). The supplemental survey was carried out to determine average hourly earnings for production workers or non-supervisory employees in the private non-agricultural, non-manufacturing sector. Employment and payroll information was collected for the payroll period which included April 12, 1989. The data provided to the Department were generally specific to the four-digit SIC code level.
(d)
Agriculture.
At the request of the Department, the Bureau of Labor Statistics of Puerto Rico conducted a survey of wages paid to agricultural workers which included employment and earnings from at least a specified number of sugarcane farms, coffee farms, ornamental farms, vegetable farms, and other farms, following standard statistical random sampling techniques. The survey included information on earnings, employment, and hourly wage rates paid to workers for the workweek including March 11 through March 17, 1990. In addition, applicable collective bargaining agreements were reviewed for sugarcane farms.
(e)
Commonwealth government.
In the case of the Commonwealth Government of Puerto Rico, a census of hourly earnings was undertaken of all government departments, commissions and other agencies. A separate survey was conducted of government corporations. Managers, officials and employees in positions which require a college degree were excluded from the surveys.
(f)
Municipalities.
In the case of the municipalities of Puerto Rico, a census of hourly earnings was conducted. Managers, officials and employees in positions which require a college degree were excluded from the survey.
[55 FR 12120, Mar. 30, 1990, as amended at 55 FR 53247, Dec. 27, 1990]
§ 510.21
SIC codes.
(a) The Conference Report specifically cites Puerto Rico's annual Census of Manufacturing Industries as a source of average hourly wage data by industry. Industries in that census are organized by Standard Industrial Classification (SIC), the statistical classification system used for a variety of governmental and statistical purposes. With respect to non-manufacturing industries, or other industries not included in the Census of Manufacturing, the Conference Report stated that data “should be at a level of specificity comparable to the four digit Standard Industry Code (SIC) code level.”
(b) The Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes listed in appendix A and B herein are designated in accordance with the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) Manual, 1987, published by the Executive Office of the President, Office of Management and Budget. This incorporation by reference was approved by the Director of the Federal Register in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51. Copies may be obtained from the National Technical Information Service, 5285 Port Royal Road, Springfield, VA 22161. Copies may be inspected at all federal depository libraries in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico; at the district office of the Wage and Hour Division, U.S. Department of Labor, New San Juan Office Building, 159 Chardon St., room 102, Hato Rey, PR 00918; at the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico Department of Labor and Human Resources, Prudencio Rivera Building, Munoz Rivera Avenue 505, Mato Rey, PR 00918; or at the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). For information on the availability of this material at NARA, call 202-741-6030, or go to:
http://www.archives.gov/federal_register/code_of_federal_regulations/ibr_locations.html.
Establishments are classified according to their primary activity. The classification structure classifies industries by:
(1) Two-digit major group,
(2) Three digit industry group, or
(3) Four-digit industry code, according to the level of industrial detail which may be required.
Each operating establishment is assigned an industry code on the basis of its primary activity, which is determined by its principal product or group of products produced or distributed, or services rendered.
[55 FR 12120, Mar. 30, 1990; 55 FR 12778, Apr. 5, 1990, as amended at 69 FR 18803, Apr. 9, 2004]
§ 510.22
Industries eligible for minimum wage phase-in.
(a) Appendix A contains a listing of all industries included in the Census of Manufacturing. Appendix B contains a listing of non-manufacturing industries. These listing are organized by SIC numbers, presented by:
(1) Major group (two-digit classification),
(2) Industry group (three-digit classification), and (3) industry (four-digit classification). In each instance the phase-in tier which applies to that industry or group is indicated.
(b) Employers are required to utilize the most detailed classification which applies to their industry. Where an employer's four-digit SIC code is listed, the tier applicable to that code determines the minimum wage phase-in schedule for that employer. (See § 510.10, above).
(c) Where an industry is not listed by four-digit SIC code, employers shall utilize the three-digit which applies to their industry. If a three-digit code is not listed, employers shall use the applicable two-digit code.
[55 FR 12120, Mar. 30, 1990; 55 FR 12778, Apr. 5, 1990]
§ 510.23
Agricultural activities eligible for minimum wage phase-in.
Agriculture activities eligible for an extended phase-in of the minimum wage in Major groups 01, 02, and 07 have been incorporated into Appendix B—Nonmanufacturing Industries Eligible for Minimum Wage Phase-In. Applicable wage rates are effective retroactive to April 1, 1990. Employers in the sugarcane farming industry (SIC Number 0133) who are subject to Tier 3 wage rates but who have paid wage rates based on Tier 2 wage rates may not take any action to recoup such payments where those actions would have the effect of reducing the wage rate
being paid at the time of such recoupment to below that required under Tier 3.
[55 FR 53247, Dec. 27, 1990]
§ 510.24
Governmental entities eligible for minimum wage phase-in.
(a) The Commonwealth government of Puerto Rico has been determined to be eligible for treatment under Tier 2, on the basis of wage data supplied to the Department.
(b) Appendix C of this part contains a listing of Commonwealth government corporations, indicating the phase-in tier which applies. Entities which do not appear on the list are those for which no wage data were supplied. These entities are therefore categorized under Tier 1, and are ineligible for an extended phase-in.
(c) Appendix D of the part contains a listing of municipalities, indicating the phase-in tier which applies. Municipalities categorized under Tier 1 are those which failed to supply wage data.
(d) Employees of municipalities who have reason to believe that the municipality by which they are employed has been incorrectly categorized, e.g., categorized under Tier 3 instead of Tier 2, may no later than June 1, 1990, file with the Administrator a petition for review. The petition shall be accompanied by any information the employee may have to support a determination that the municipality is incorrectly categorized. In the event the Administrator determines that a tier other than that listed in appendix D of this part applies, the affected municipality shall be liable for retroactive payment of any back wages found to be due.
(e) Certain employees of municipalities or government corporations in which the average wage is less than $4.00 per hour are eligible to be paid under Tier 4, rather than Tier 3. Tier 4 applies only to those employees employed by municipalities or government corporations who are principally engaged in one or more of the “traditional” functions listed in § 510.24 (a) or (b). All other employees of such entities must be paid in accordance with Tier 3.
[55 FR 12120, Mar. 30, 1990; 55 FR 12778, Apr. 5, 1990]
§ 510.25
Traditional functions of government.
(a) Section 6(c)(4) of the Act, as amended, limits the six-year phase-in of the statutory minimum wage (“Tier 4”) to those employees with an average wage of less than $4.00 per hour who were brought under minimum wage coverage “pursuant to an amendment made by the Fair Labor Standards Amendments of 1985.” The Department has interpreted this language as referring to section 2(c) of the 1985 FLSA Amendments, which provided for deferred liability for minimum wage violations (until April 15, 1986) “with respect to any employee who would not have been covered under the Secretary's special enforcement policy” published in 29 CFR 775.2 and 775.4. The latter subsection listed those functions of State or local government which were determined by the Supreme Court's ruling in
National League of Cities
v.
Usery,
426 U.S. 833 (1976) (subsequently overruled by
Garcia
v.
San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority,
469 U.S. 528 (1985)) to be integral operations of the governments in areas of traditional governmental functions. The listed “traditional” functions included the following:
(1) Schools.
(2) Hospitals.
(3) Fire prevention.
(4) Police protection.
(5) Sanitation.
(6) Public health.
(7) Parks and recreation.
(8) Libraries.
(9) Museums.
(b) The Supreme Court in
National League of Cities
clearly did not limit “traditional” functions of government to those set out in paragraph (a) of this section. The Court included within this concept all those governmental services which the States and their political subdivisions have traditionally afforded their citizens, which the States have regarded as integral parts of their governmental activities, and which
State and local governments are created to provide. The Department interprets the Court's analysis of “traditional” functions as turning in large part upon whether the States or local governments had, prior to initial enactment of federal regulatory legislation applicable to a particular field of service or activity (such as FLSA), generally established themselves as providers of the services. The Department therefore views the following government functions as falling within the “traditional” category:
(1) Finance (including Auditor, Budget and Comptroller).
(2) Elections.
(3) Personnel.
(4) Public works.
(5) Office of the Mayor.
(6) Legal Affairs.
(7) Planning.
(8) Waterworks.
(9) Social services.
(10) Street and highway construction and maintenance.
(11) Automobile licensing.
(12) Sewage treatment.
(c) Employees whose primary function falls within one or more of the activities listed in paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, are therefore considered to be engaged in “traditional” functions of government. This would include employees who provide support functions for such activities, such as clerical, secretarial, supply and janitorial.
(d) No employees of a municipality or government corporation may be paid in accordance with the Tier 4 phase-in schedule unless the employee:
(1) Is engaged in one of the specific activities listed in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, and
(2) Is employed by a municipality or government corporation in which the average wage is less than $4.00 per hour.
Pt. 510, App. A

# Appendix A to Part 510—Manufacturing Industries Eligible for Minimum Wage Phase-In
This appendix contains a listing of all manufacturing industries for which data were collected and compiled by the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico for purposes of implementing the 1989 Amendments to FLSA. This listing follows the order and classifications used in the
SIC Manual, 1987,
which is incorporated by reference in these regulations (§ 510.21).
The data in this appendix are presented by major industry group (two-digit classification), industry group number (three-digit classification), and industry number (four-digit classification). Tiers will not be listed for industry categories in which there were fewer than three employers, in conformance with standard procedures used by the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico in collecting and publishing these data until such time as Puerto Rico receives appropriate waivers of confidentiality from all employers in such categories. These categories are noted with an “a” on the following table. In addition, no tier will be listed where an industry was not included in the original survey, because it was not in existence, because the industry was too small to be included, or for other reasons.
Employers who do not find the four-digit classification for their industry shall refer to the appropriate three-digit classification under which their establishment falls. If the appropriate three-digit classification is not listed, employers shall refer to the appropriate two-digit classification. For example, no tier is listed for industry number 2034, dried and dehydrated fruits, vegetables, and soup mixes. Thus, an employer in industry 2034 must use the tier listed for industry group 203, i.e. Tier 2.
Further, employers who find the appropriate four-digit designation in this appendix
must
use that designation and cannot refer to a two- or three-digit classification. For example, an employer in industry number 2033, canned fruits, vegetables, preserves, jams, and jellies, which has a Tier 1 designation, cannot use the Tier 2 designation of industry group 203, canned, frozen, and preserved fruits, vegetables, and food specialties.
If no four-digit, three-digit, or two-digit classification is listed for an industry, employees in that group must pay the Tier 1 rates.
Important:
In referring to this appendix to determine appropriate tier designations, please note that certain categories of employees are subject to treatment under Tier 1 regardless of the average hourly wage rate for the industry and the tier designation contained herein. These employees, as listed in the 1989 Amendments, are those employed by:
(a) The United States
(b) An establishment that is a hotel, motel, or restaurant, or
(c) Any other retail or service establishment that employs such employee in connection with the preparation or offering of food or beverages for human consumption, either on the premises, or by such services as catering, banquet, box lunch, or curb or counter service, to the public, to employees, or to members or guests of clubs.
Please note that these named categories may not correspond exactly to categories established by the SIC manual.

Pt. 510, App. B

# Appendix B to Part 510—Nonmanufacturing Industries Eligible for Minimum Wage Phase-In
This appendix contains a listing of all non-manufacturing industries (except those in major groups 01, 02, 08, and 09, pertaining to agriculture) for which data were collected and compiled by the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico for purposes of implementing the 1989 Amendments to FLSA. This listing follows the order and classifications used in the
SIC Manual, 1987,
which is incorporated by reference in these regulations (§ 510.21).
The data in this appendix are presented by major industry group (two-digit classification), industry group number (three-digit classification), and industry number (four-digit classification).
Tiers will not be listed for industry categories in which there were fewer than three responding employers, or one responding employer had more than 80 percent of the employment in the category, in conformance with practices of the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics in collecting and publishing similar data, until such time as Puerto Rico receives appropriate waivers of confidentiality from all employers in such categories. These categories are noted with an “a” on the following table. In situations where one or more employers declined to furnish a waiver, categories are noted with a “b” on the following table.
In addition, no tier will be listed where an industry was not included in the original survey because it was not in existence, because the industry was too small to be included, or for other reasons.
Employers who do not find the four-digit classification for their industry shall refer to the appropriate three-digit classification under which their establishment falls. If the appropriate three-digit classification is not listed, employers shall refer to the appropriate two-digit classification.
For example, no tier is listed for industry number 1423, crushed and broken granite. However, a tier is listed for industry group 142, crushed and broken stone, including riprap. Thus, an employer in industry 1423 must use the tier listed for industry group 142,
i.e.,
Tier 1. Furthermore, employers who find the appropriate four-digit designation in this appendix
must
use that designation and cannot refer to a two- or three-digit classification. For example, an employer with industry number 5719, miscellaneous
homefurnishings stores, which has a Tier 1 designation, cannot refer to industry group number 571, home furniture and furnishings stores, which has a Tier 2 designation.
Important:
In referring to this appendix to determine appropriate tier designations, please note that certain categories of employees are subject to treatment under Tier 1 regardless of the average hourly wage rate for the industry and the tier designation contained herein. These employees, as listed in the 1989 Amendments, are those employed by:
(a) The United States,
(b) An establishment that is a hotel, motel, or restaurant, or
(c) Any other retail or service establishment that employs such employee in connection with the preparation or offering of food or beverages for human consumption, either on the premises, or by such services as catering, banquet, box lunch, or curb or counter service, to the public, to employees, or to members or guests of clubs.
Please note that these named categories may not correspond exactly to categories established by the SIC manual.
If no four-digit, three-digit, or two-digit classification is listed for an industry, employers in that group must pay the Tier 1 rates.

21 FR 7669, Oct. 6, 1956, unless otherwise noted.
§ 511.1
General method for issuance of wage orders.
Pursuant to authority delegated by the Secretary of Labor, the Administrator of the Wage and Hour Division publishes the orders that are required by statute to make the recommendations of industry committees effective as wage orders under section 6(a)(3) of the Fair Labor Standards Act. The wage orders issued by the Administrator must by law give effect to the recommendations of the industry committees. All wage order proceedings will be conducted in accordance with the standards provided in the Administrative Procedure Act as interpreted and applied in this part.
[55 FR 53298, Dec. 28, 1990]
§ 511.2
Initiation of proceedings; notices of hearings.
(a) Wage order proceedings are initiated by order of the Secretary, published in the
Federal Register,
giving notice of hearings by industry committees to recommend the minimum rate or rates of wages to be paid under section 6 of the Act to employees in American Samoa engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce or in any enterprise engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce. These orders will contain a definition of the particular industry in American Samoa, for which the committee is to make its recommendations, or these orders will direct the committee to recommend the minimum rate or rates of wages for all industry in American Samoa. All such orders will make provision for convening the committee. Any particular industry defined in such an order may be a trade, business, industry, or branch thereof, or group of industries, in which individuals are gainfully employed.
(b) These orders will also give reasonable notice (1) of the time and place of the commencement of the hearing of such witnesses and receiving of such evidence as may be necessary or appropriate to enable the committee to perform its duties and functions under the Act, (2) of the general nature of the wage order proceedings and the authority under which they are proposed, (3) of the subjects and issues involved, and (4) that the committee will take official notice of the economic report (note § 511.13) and the parties will have an opportunity at the hearing to show any contrary or additional facts.
[26 FR 6513, July 20, 1961, as amended at 55 FR 12120, Mar. 30, 1990]
§ 511.3
Composition and appointment of committees.
An industry committee will be composed of residents of American Samoa and residents of the United States outside of American Samoa. The Secretary will appoint as members of each committee an equal number of persons representing:
(a) The public,
(b) Employees in the industry, and
(c) Employers in the industry.
The public members shall be disinterested, and the Secretary will designate one as chairperson. For purposes of this section only, the definition of the industry shall be considered to include all such industry throughout the United States, its territories and possessions.
[55 FR 53298, Dec. 28, 1990]
§ 511.4
Compensation of committee members.
Each member of an industry committee will be allowed per diem compensation at the rate specified in Chapter 304 of the Department of Labor Supplement to the Federal Personnel Manual for each day actually spent in the work of the committee, and will, in addition, be reimbursed for necessary transportation and other expenses incident to traveling in accordance with Standard Government Travel Regulations then in effect. All travel expenses will be paid on travel vouchers certified by the Administrator or an authorized representative. Any other necessary expenses that are incidental to the work of the committee may be incurred by the committee upon approval of, and shall be paid upon, certification of the Administrator or an authorized representative.
[58 FR 34524, June 28, 1993]
§ 511.5
Vacancies and dissolution of committees.
The Secretary will appoint persons to fill any vacancies occurring in industry committees. If an industry committee is unable to arrive at a recommendation within a reasonable time, or refuses to make a recommendation, it may be dissolved by the Secretary. An industry committee shall cease to perform further functions when it has filed with the Administrator its report containing its findings of fact and recommendations with respect to the matters referred to it, and shall not again perform any functions with respect to any matter reported on, unless and until directed by the Administrator. An industry committee shall be dissolved automatically when its recommendations are no longer subject to review under section 10 of the Act.
[27 FR 10651, Nov. 1, 1962]
§ 511.6
Investigation.
The Administrator shall prepare an economic report containing such data as can be assembled pertinent to the matters to be referred to a committee. A copy of these regulations will be sent to all members of the committee following their appointment, and a copy of the economic report when completed will be furnished promptly. Before making its report the committee will decide whether it will conduct any further investigation, apart from the hearing and the review of the economic report, in connection with the matters referred to it.
[55 FR 53298, Dec. 28, 1990]
§ 511.7
Committee staff.
Each industry committee will be furnished a lawyer, to serve as committee counsel, and an economist, to serve as committee economist. Committee counsel shall advise the committee on the issues of law, including interpretations of these regulations and the legal scope of the committee's discretion, which arise during the committee proceedings. The committee counsel and economist shall be available to advise and assist the committee at all of its meetings. The Administrator shall furnish the committee with adequate stenographic, clerical, and other assistance.
§ 511.8
Prehearing statements.
(a) Every employer, employee, trade association, trade union, or group of employers, employees, associations, or unions in the industry as defined, or in such industry elsewhere in the United States, and every other person who, in the judgment of the committee has an interest sufficient to justify the participation proposed by such party, shall be considered an interested person. No member of the committee may participate as an interested person.
(b) Any interested person who wishes to participate on his or her own behalf or by counsel shall file a written prehearing statement within such period of time as may be prescribed in a notice of hearing, or other notice published in the
Federal Register.
The number of copies of such statements and the time and places for filing them
will be specified in notices of hearings. The prehearing statement shall describe the person's interest in the proceeding and shall contain:
(1) The prepared statement he or she proposes to give, if any;
(2) A statement of the individual classifications and minimum wage rates, if any, he or she proposes to support;
(3) The written data he or she proposes to introduce in evidence, including all tangible objective data to be submitted pursuant to § 511.13;
(4) The names and addresses of the witnesses he or she proposes to call and a summary of the evidence he or she proposes to develop;
(5) The name and address of the individual who will present his or her case; and
(6) A statement of the approximate length of time his or her case will take.
If the prehearing statement is in conformity with the above requirements, the person shall have the right to participate as a party. In accordance with section 6(c) of the Administrative Procedure Act, the industry committee shall, after considering the advice of committee counsel, issue subpoenas, authorized by section 9 of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, to parties who make a request therefor accompanied by a clear showing of general relevance and reasonable scope of the evidence sought.
(c) Prehearing statements of parties shall be made available for examination at the offices where they are filed. Each person who files a prehearing statement should, if requested, make himself or herself available for conference with the committee staff to make any needed clarification of his or her prehearing statement, and arrange details of presenting his or her testimony or case.
(d) In exceptional circumstances a person who has not filed the prehearing statement required by this section and who does not appear on a witness list filed by a party may nevertheless be permitted, in the discretion of the committee, to offer testimony.
[25 FR 14024, Dec. 31, 1960, as amended at 55 FR 53298, Dec. 28, 1990]
§ 511.9
Requirements for quorum and decisions.
Two-thirds of the members of an industry committee shall constitute a quorum. Approval by a majority of all of the members of an industry committee or subcommittee shall be required for its report. Except as otherwise provided in this part, the chairperson of the industry committee or subcommittee may make other decisions for the committee or subcommittee, but each such decision shall be subject to approval of a majority of the members present if any member objects.
[55 FR 53298, Dec. 28, 1990]
§ 511.10
Subjects and issues.
(a) The declared policy of the Act with respect to industries or enterprises in American Samoa engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce is to reach as rapidly as is economically feasible without substantially curtailing employment the object of the minimum wage rate that would apply in each such industry under paragraph (1) of section 6(a) but for section 6(a)(3) of the Act. Each industry committee shall recommend to the Administrator the highest minimum wage rates for the industry that it determines, having due regard to economic and competitive conditions, will not substantially curtail employment in the industry and will not give any industry in American Samoa a competitive advantage over any industry in the United States outside of American Samoa; except that the committee shall recommend to the Secretary the minimum wage rate prescribed in section 6(a)(1), that would be applicable but for section 6(a)(3), unless there is evidence in the record that establishes that the industry, or a predominant portion thereof, is unable to pay that wage due to such economic and competitive conditions.
(b) Whenever the industry committee finds that a higher minimum wage may be determined for employees engaged in certain activities or in the manufacture of certain products in the industry than may be determined for other employees in the industry, the industry
committee shall recommend such reasonable classifications within the industry as it determines to be necessary for the purpose of fixing for each classification the highest minimum wage rate (not in excess of that prescribed in paragraph (1) of section 6(a) of the Act) that can be determined for it under the principles set out in this section that will not substantially curtail employment in such classification and will not give a competitive advantage to any group in that industry. No classification shall be made, however, and no minimum wage rate shall be fixed solely on a regional basis or on the basis of age or sex. In determining whether there should be classifications within an industry, in making such classifications, and in determining the minimum wage rate for each classification, the committee shall consider, among other relevant factors, the following:
(1) Competitive conditions as affected by transportation, living and production costs;
(2) The wages established for work of like or comparable character by collective labor agreements negotiated between employers and employees by representatives of their own choosing; and
(3) The wages paid for work of like or comparable character by employers who voluntarily maintain minimum wage standards in the industry.
[55 FR 53298, Dec. 28, 1990]
§ 511.11
Pertinent data.
Among the types of data which may be considered pertinent to the subjects and issues delineated in § 511.10, are those revealing:
(a) Employment and labor conditions and trends in American Samoa, and on the mainland, particularly since the promulgation of the presently applicable wage order, including such items as present and past employment, present wage rates and fringe benefits, changes in average hourly earnings or wage structure, provisions of collective bargaining agreements, hours of work, labor turnover, absenteeism, productivity, learning periods, rejection rates, and similar factors;
(b) Market conditions and trends in American Samoa, and on the mainland, including changes in the volume and value of production, market outlets, price changes, style factors, consumer demand, competitive relationships, tariff rates, and similar marketing factors;
(c) Comparative production costs in American Samoa, on the mainland, and in foreign countries, together with the factors responsible for differences;
(d) Financial conditions and trends since promulgation of the present wage order as reflected in profit and loss statements and balance sheets; and
(e) Data bearing on proper definitions of classifications within an industry.
[55 FR 12120, Mar. 30, 1990]
§ 511.12
Committee and subcommittee meetings.
(a) The full committee, or a quorum thereof, will convene at the time and place appointed for an initial prehearing meeting as provided in the Secretary's order initiating the proceedings (note § 511.2). The full committee acting through a quorum will decide at that meeting whether it will preside at the reception at the hearing or will authorize a subcommittee to preside. Any resolution authorizing a subcommittee to hold the hearing shall provide a period of 30 days after:
(1) The subcommittee has filed its recommended report and
(2) A transcript of the subcommittee hearing is made available to the parties, for the parties to file exceptions to the recommended report, and the committee shall meet promptly thereafter on call of its chairperson or the Administrator to consider exceptions and prepare its final report.
(b) A committee may adjourn its meeting or hearing, or both, from time to time, and meet again, at hearing or otherwise, pursuant to the terms of adjournment, or on call of its chairperson or the Administrator.
[55 FR 53299, Dec. 28, 1990]
§ 511.13
Evidence.
In accordance with the notice of hearing, the committee and any authorized subcommittee will take official notice of the facts stated in the economic report to the extent they are not refuted by evidence received at the hearing. Other pertinent evidence available to the Department of Labor
may be presented at the hearing. The committee itself may call witnesses not otherwise scheduled to testify. Oral or documentary evidence may be received, but the committee shall exclude irrelevant, immaterial, and unduly repetitious evidence. Every interested person who has met the requirements for participation as a party shall have the right to present his or her case by oral or documentary evidence, to submit rebuttal evidence, and to conduct such cross-examination of witnesses called by others as may be required for a full and true disclosure of the facts. Testimony on behalf of an employer or group of employers as to inability to pay the minimum wage rate specified in paragraph (1) of section 6(a) of the Act, or as to inability to adjust to a higher minimum wage rate than prescribed by any applicable wage order of the Secretary, shall be supported by tangible objective data filed as part of the prehearing statement under § 511.8. Financial or other data shall include data for the most recent year or fraction thereof for which data are available. Financial statements filed in accordance with this provision, except those relating to a period of less than a full fiscal year or a fiscal year ending less than 90 days prior to the filing of the prehearing statement, shall be certified by an independent public accountant or shall be sworn to conform to and be consistent with the corresponding income tax returns covering the same years. Evidence of witnesses not present at the hearing may be submitted only by affidavits received with, or as a part of, a prehearing statement that meets the requirements of § 511.8 and satisfactorily explains why each affiant cannot be present. Such affidavits will be received in evidence to the same extent that testimony from affiants would have been admitted had they been present. The committee will give such weight to these statements as it considers appropriate, and the fact that such affiants have not been subject to cross-examination may be considered, along with other relevant facts, in assessing the weight to be given such evidence.
[55 FR 53299, Dec. 28, 1990]
§ 511.14
Procedure for receiving evidence.
(a) All testimony shall be given under oath or affirmation. Any party shall have the right to appear in person, by counsel, or by other specified representative. Misconduct at any hearing shall be grounds for summary exclusion from the hearing. The committee shall limit the testimony of any witness where appropriate to prevent the hearing from becoming unduly prolonged. The refusal of a witness to answer any question which has been ruled to be proper shall, in the discretion of the committee, be ground for striking all testimony given by the witness on related matters.
(b) Unless otherwise directed by the committee, witnesses shall be called in the following order: The committee economist qualified to testify concerning the content and preparation of the economic report, other witnesses called by the Department of Labor, witnesses called by the parties, other witnesses. Unless otherwise directed by the committee, all witnesses other than those called by the parties shall be examined in the following order: By committee counsel, by committee economist, by committee members, by the parties or their representatives. Witnesses called by the parties shall be examined first by the party calling them or by the party's specified representative, and then in the order herein indicated for all other witnesses. Redirect examination may be permitted at the discretion of the committee. Rebuttal evidence may be offered in the order and manner in this section provided for other evidence. To the extent not specified in this section, the order for calling and examining witnesses shall be specified by the chairperson of the committee or subcommittee.
[21 FR 7669, Oct. 6, 1956, as amended at 55 FR 53299, Dec. 28, 1990]
§ 511.15
Submittals prior to reports.
As soon as the receipt of evidence is concluded, a committee or subcommittee presiding at a hearing shall receive any proposed findings of fact and recommendations together with the reasons therefor submitted by any party. These submittals shall be oral
unless otherwise directed by the committee or subcommittee. If, in the discretion of the committee or subcommittee such proposals should be in writing, it may grant such additional time as it deems essential.
§ 511.16
Reports.
Promptly after receipt of submissions under § 511.15, the committee or subcommittee will resolve the issues before it and prepare a report containing its findings of fact and recommendations. The report shall contain the committee's or the subcommittee's findings and conclusions as well as the reasons or basis therefor upon all the material issues of fact, law, or discretion presented on the record. When a committee, acting through a quorum, has presided at the reception of evidence, this report shall be its final report on the matters referred to it. Where, however, a subcommittee has presided at the reception of evidence, this report shall be an initial report, and the committee shall meet thereafter to review the report and rule on exceptions in its final report. Where the committee presides at the reception of evidence and proceeds to final decision, every party shall be regarded as having objected to any wage rate or classification at variance with any the party proposed in the party's prehearing statements unless the party accepted such a rate or classification in any submittal made pursuant to § 511.15. A copy of the report shall be signed by each member of the committee who approves it, either at a meeting of the committee or by circulation of one or more copies among the members of the committee. At any time within 3 days after the committee report is signed by those who approve it, members dissenting therefrom may collectively or individually submit signed reports stating the reasons for their dissent.
[55 FR 53299, Dec. 28, 1990]
§ 511.17
Records.
Each industry committee shall keep a journal recording the time and place of all its meetings, the members present, the votes, and other formal proceedings, including the appointment of subcommittees. Subcommittees shall keep a similar journal. No report of committee or subcommittee discussions need be included. All hearings shall be recorded. The record of any hearing before any subcommittee shall be transcribed. All hearings before a committee shall also be transcribed in whole or in part whenever the Administrator so directs upon his or her own motion or upon the motion of any party or any person compelled to submit data or evidence and upon the payment of costs prescribed by the Administrator. Promptly after completion of the committee's final report, the committee chairperson shall certify the report and transmit it to the Administrator. As soon as practicable thereafter, the committee staff shall transmit to the Administrator:
(a) All committee and subcommittee journals;
(b) All applications for leave to participate as parties together with the record of action thereon; and,
(c) The record, including any transcript of the testimony and exhibits, together with all papers and requests filed in the proceedings.
These documents shall be available for inspections and copying by interested persons at the Office of the Administrator during usual business hours.
[55 FR 53300, Dec. 28, 1990]
§ 511.18
Publication and effective date of wage order.
Promptly after receipt of the committee report the Administrator shall publish the committee recommendations in the
Federal Register
and shall provide by order that the recommendations contained in such report shall take effect upon the expiration of 15 days after the date of such publication.
§ 511.19
Petitions.
Any interested person may at any time file a petition with the Administrator for an amendment to the regulations contained in this part or for an amendment to a wage order applicable to that person. In view of the statutory requirement that the minimum rates of wages established by order under section 6 of the Act be reviewed by an industry committee at least biennially, substantial cause must be shown in
support of any petition for an amendment of a wage order out of regular course. Any interested person may also file a petition at any time with the Administrator for a public hearing under section 13(e) of the Act to determine whether economic conditions warrant rules or regulations providing reasonable limitations or allowing reasonable variations, tolerances, or exemptions to or from any or all of the provisions of section 7 of the Act with respect to employees in American Samoa for whom the Secretary of Labor has established minimum wage rates under section 6(a)(3) of the Act and the regulations contained in this part. Whenever it appears to the Secretary of Labor, by reason of such a petition or otherwise, to be probable that such a hearing is likely to reveal that economic conditions warrant such action, notice of such hearing specifying the procedure to be followed will be published in the
Federal Register.

§ 516.1
Form of records; scope of regulations.
(a)
Form of records.
No particular order or form of records is prescribed by the regulations in this part. However, every employer subject to any provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended (hereinafter referred to as the “Act”), is required to maintain records containing the information and data required by the specific sections of this part. The records may be maintained and preserved on microfilm or other basic source document of an automatic word or data processing memory provided that adequate projection or viewing equipment is available, that the reproductions are clear and identifiable by date or pay period and that extensions or transcriptions of the information required by this part are made available upon request.
(b)
Scope of regulations.
The regulations in this part are divided into two subparts.
(1) Subpart A of this part contains the requirements generally applicable to all employers employing covered employees, including the requirements relating to the posting of notices, the preservation and location of records, and the recordkeeping requirements for employers of employees to whom both the minimum wage provisions of section 6 or the minimum wage provisions of section 6 and the overtime pay provisions of section 7(a) of the Act apply. In addition, § 516.3 contains the requirements relating to executive, administrative, and professional employees (including academic administrative personnel or teachers in elementary or secondary schools), and outside sales employees.
(2) Subpart B of this part deals with the information and data which must be kept for employees (other than executive, administrative, etc., employees) who are subject to any of the exemptions provided in the Act. This section also specifies the records needed for deductions from and additions to wages for “board, lodging, or other facilities,” industrial homeworkers and employees whose tips are credited toward wages. The sections in subpart B of this part require the recording of more, less, or different items of information or data than required under the generally applicable recordkeeping requirements of subpart A.
(c)
Relationship to other recordkeeping and reporting requirements.
Nothing in 29 CFR part 516 shall excuse any party from complying with any recordkeeping or reporting requirement imposed by any other Federal, State or local law, ordinance, regulation or rule.

(5) Time of day and day of week on which the employee's workweek begins (or for employees employed under section 7(k) of the Act, the starting time and length of each employee's work period). If the employee is part of a workforce or employed in or by an establishment all of whose workers have a workweek beginning at the same time on the same day, a single notation of the time of the day and beginning day of the workweek for the whole workforce or establishment will suffice,
(6)(i) Regular hourly rate of pay for any workweek in which overtime compensation is due under section 7(a) of the Act, (ii) explain basis of pay by indicating the monetary amount paid on a per hour, per day, per week, per piece, commission on sales, or other basis, and (iii) the amount and nature of each payment which, pursuant to section 7(e) of the Act, is excluded from the “regular rate” (these records may be in the form of vouchers or other payment data),
(7) Hours worked each workday and total hours worked each workweek (for purposes of this section, a “workday” is any fixed period of 24 consecutive hours and a “workweek” is any fixed and regularly recurring period of 7 consecutive workdays),
(8) Total daily or weekly straight-time earnings or wages due for hours worked during the workday or workweek, exclusive of premium overtime compensation,

(12) Date of payment and the pay period covered by payment.
(b)
Records of retroactive payment of wages.
Every employer who makes retroactive payment of wages or compensation under the supervision of the Administrator of the Wage and Hour Division pursuant to section 16(c) and/or section 17 of the Act, shall:
(1) Record and preserve, as an entry on the pay records, the amount of such payment to each employee, the period covered by such payment, and the date of payment.
(2) Prepare a report of each such payment on a receipt form provided by or authorized by the Wage and Hour Division, and (i) preserve a copy as part of the records, (ii) deliver a copy to the employee, and (iii) file the original, as evidence of payment by the employer and receipt by the employee, with the Administrator or an authorized representative within 10 days after payment is made.
(c)
Employees working on fixed schedules.

With respect to each employee in a bona fide executive, administrative, or professional capacity (including employees employed in the capacity of academic administrative personnel or teachers in elementary or secondary schools), or in outside sales, as defined in part 541 of this chapter (pertaining to so-called “white collar” employee exemptions), employers shall maintain and preserve records containing all the information and data required by § 516.2(a) except paragraphs (a) (6) through (10) and, in addition, the basis on which wages are paid in sufficient detail to permit calculation for each pay period of the employee's total remuneration for employment including fringe benefits and prerequisites. (This may be shown as the dollar amount of earnings per month, per week, per month plus commissions, etc. with appropriate addenda such as “plus hospitalization and insurance plan A,” “benefit package B,” “2 weeks paid vacation,” etc.)
§ 516.4
Posting of notices.
Every employer employing any employees subject to the Act's minimum
wage provisions shall post and keep posted a notice explaining the Act, as prescribed by the Wage and Hour Division, in conspicuous places in every establishment where such employees are employed so as to permit them to observe readily a copy. Any employer of employees to whom section 7 of the Act does not apply because of an exemption of broad application to an establishment may alter or modify the poster with a legible notation to show that the overtime provisions do not apply. For example:
Overtime Provisions Not Applicable to Taxicab Drivers (section 13(b)(17)).

(1)

(2)
Wage rate tables.
From their last effective date, all tables or schedules of the employer which provide the piece rates or other rates used in computing straight-time earnings, wages, or salary, or overtime pay computation.

(b)
Inspection of records.
All records shall be available for inspection and transcription by the Administrator or a duly authorized and designated representative.
§ 516.8

Each employer required to maintain records under this part shall make such extension, recomputation, or transcription of the records and shall submit to the Wage and Hour Division such reports concerning persons employed and the wages, hours, and other conditions and practices of employment set forth in the records as the Administrator or a duly authorized and designated representative may request in writing.
§ 516.9

(b)
Action on petitions.
If, after review of the petition, the Administrator finds that the authority requested will not hinder enforcement of the Act, the Administrator may grant such authority limited by any conditions determined necessary and subject to subsequent revocation.

If the employee is one of a group, all of whom have agreed to use this method of computation, a single memorandum will suffice.
§ 516.27
“Board, lodging, or other facilities” under section 3(m) of the Act.
(a) In addition to keeping other records required by this part, an employer who makes deductions from the wages of employees for “board, lodging, or other facilities” (as these terms are used in sec. 3(m) of the Act) furnished to them by the employer or by an affiliated person, or who furnishes such “board, lodging, or other facilities” to employees as an addition to wages, shall maintain and preserve records substantiating the cost of furnishing each class of facility except as noted in paragraph (c) of this section. Separate records of the cost of each item furnished to an employee need not be kept. The requirements may be met by keeping combined records of the costs incurred in furnishing each class of facility, such as housing, fuel, or merchandise furnished through a company store or commissary. Thus, in the case of an employer who furnishes housing, separate cost records need not be kept for each house. The cost of maintenance, utilities, and repairs for all the houses may be shown together. Original cost and depreciation records may be kept for groups of houses acquired at the same time. Costs incurred in furnishing similar or closely related facilities, moreover, may be shown in combined records. Where cost records are kept for a “class” of facility rather than for each individual article furnished to employees, the records must also show the gross income derived from each such class of facility; e.g., gross rentals in the case of houses, total sales through the store or commissary, total receipts from sales of fuel, etc.
(1) Such records shall include itemized accounts showing the nature and amount of any expenditures entering into the computation of the reasonable cost, as defined in part 531 of this
chapter, and shall contain the data required to compute the amount of the depreciated investment in any assets allocable to the furnishing of the facilities, including the date of acquisition or construction, the original cost, the rate of depreciation and the total amount of accumulated depreciation on such assets. If the assets include merchandise held for sale to employees, the records should contain data from which the average net investment in inventory can be determined.
(2) No particular degree of itemization is prescribed. However, the amount of detail shown in these accounts should be consistent with good accounting practices, and should be sufficient to enable the Administrator or authorized representative to verify the nature of the expenditure and the amount by reference to the basic records which must be preserved pursuant to § 516.6(c)(2).
(b) If additions to or deductions from wages paid (1) so affect the total cash wages due in any workweek (even though the employee actually is paid on other than a workweek basis) as to result in the employee receiving less in cash than the applicable minimum hourly wage, or (2) if the employee works in excess of the applicable maximum hours standard and (i) any additions to the wages paid are a part of wages, or (ii) any deductions made are claimed as allowable deductions under sec. 3(m) of the Act, the employer shall maintain records showing on a workweek basis those additions to or deductions from wages. (For legal deductions not claimed under sec. 3(m) and which need not be maintained on a workweek basis, see part 531 of this chapter.)
(c) The records specified in this section are not required with respect to an employee in any workweek in which the employee is not subject to the overtime provisions of the Act and receives not less than the applicable statutory minimum wage in cash for all hours worked in that workweek. (The application of section 3(m) of the Act in nonovertime weeks is discussed in part 531 of this chapter.)
§ 516.28
Tipped employees and employer-administered tip pools.
(a) With respect to each tipped employee whose wages are determined pursuant to section 3(m) of the Act, the employer shall maintain and preserve payroll or other records containing all the information and data required in § 516.2(a) and, in addition, the following:
(1) A symbol, letter or other notation placed on the pay records identifying each employee whose wage is determined in part by tips.
(2) Weekly or monthly amount reported by the employee, to the employer, of tips received (this may consist of reports made by the employees to the employer on IRS Form 4070).
(3) Amount by which the wages of each tipped employee have been deemed to be increased by tips as determined by the employer (not in excess of the difference between $2.13 and the applicable minimum wage specified in section 6(a)(1) of the Act). The amount per hour which the employer takes as a tip credit shall be reported to the employee in writing each time it is changed from the amount per hour taken in the preceding week.
(4) Hours worked each workday in any occupation in which the employee does not receive tips, and total daily or weekly straight-time payment made by the employer for such hours.
(5) Hours worked each workday in occupations in which the employee receives tips, and total daily or weekly straight-time earnings for such hours.
(b) With respect to employees who receive tips but for whom a tip credit is not taken under section 3(m)(2)(A), any employer that collects tips received by employees to operate a mandatory tip-pooling or tip-sharing arrangement shall maintain and preserve payroll or other records containing the information and data required in § 516.2(a) and, in addition, the following:
(1) A symbol, letter, or other notation placed on the pay records identifying each employee who receive tips.
(2) Weekly or monthly amount reported by the employee, to the employer, of tips received (this may consist of reports made by the employees to the employer on IRS Form 4070).

§ 516.30
Learners, apprentices, messengers, students, or handicapped workers employed under special certificates as provided in section 14 of the Act.
(a) With respect to persons employed as learners, apprentices, messengers or full-time students employed outside of their school hours in any retail or service establishment in agriculture, or in institutions of higher education, or handicapped workers employed at special minimum hourly rates under Special Certificates pursuant to section 14 of the Act, employers shall maintain and preserve records containing the same information and data required with respect to other employees employed in the same occupations.
(b) In addition, each employer shall segregate on the payroll or pay records the names and required information and data with respect to those learners, apprentices, messengers, handicapped workers and students, employed under Special Certificates. A symbol or letter may be placed before each such name on the payroll or pay records indicating that that person is a “learner,” “apprentice,” “messenger,” “student,” or “handicapped worker,” employed under a Special Certificate.

§ 519.1
Applicability of the regulations in this subpart.
(a)
Statutory provisions.
Under section 14 of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended, and the authority and responsibility delegated to him/her by the Secretary of Labor (36 FR 8755) and by the Assistant Secretary for Employment Standards (39 FR 33841) the Administrator of the Wage and Hour Division is authorized and directed, to the extent necessary in order to prevent curtailment of opportunities for employment, to provide by regulation or order for the employment, under certificates, of full-time students in retail or service establishments, or in agriculture. That section contains provisions requiring a wage rate in such certificates of not less than 85 percent of the minimum wage applicable under section 6 of the Act, limiting weekly hours of employment, stipulating compliance with the applicable child-labor standards, and safeguarding against the reduction of the full-time employment opportunities of employees other than full-time students employed under certificates.
(b)
Source of limitations.
Some of the limitations in this subpart are specifically required in section 14(b) of the Act. The other limitations implement the provisions in that section relating to employment opportunities,
i.e.,
the “extent necessary to prevent curtailment of opportunities for employment” and the avoidance of a “substantial probability of reducing the full-time employment opportunities of persons other than those to whom the minimum wage rate authorized” under section 14(b) is applicable.
[40 FR 6329, Feb. 11, 1975; 40 FR 22546, May 23, 1975]
§ 519.2
Definitions.
(a)
Full-time students.
A
full-time student
for the purpose of this subpart is defined as a student who receives primarily daytime instruction at the physical location of a bona fide educational institution, in accordance with the institution's accepted definition of a full-time student. A full-time student retains that status during the student's Christmas, summer and other vacations. An individual who was such a student immediately prior to vacation will be presumed not to have discontinued such status during vacation if local law requires his/her attendance at the end of the vacation. In the absence of such requirement his/her status during vacation will be governed by his/her intention as last communicated to his/her employer. The phrase in section 14(b) of the statute “regardless of age but in compliance with applicable child-labor laws,” among other things, restricts the employment in a retail or service establishment to full-time students who are at least 14 years of age because of the application of section 3(1) of the Act. There is a minimum age requirement of 16 years in agriculture for employment during school hours and in any occupation declared hazardous by the Secretary of Labor (subpart E-1 of part 570 of this title.) In addition, there is a minimum age restriction of 14 years generally for employment in agriculture of a full-time student outside school hours for the school district where such employee is living while so employed, except (1) Minors 12 or 13 years of age may be employed with written parental or guardian consent or they may work on farms where their parents or guardians are employed, and (2) minors under 12 may work on farms owned or operated by their parents or with parental or guardian consent on farms whose employees are exempt from section 6 by section 13 (a)(6)(A) of the Act.
(b)
Bona fide educational institution.
A
bona fide educational institution
is ordinarily an accredited institution. However, a school which is not accredited may be considered a
bona fide educational institution
in exceptional circumstances, such as when the school is too recently established to have received accreditation.
(c)
Retail or service establishment. Retail or service establishment
means a retail or service establishment as defined in section 13(a)(2) of the Fair Labor Standards Act. The statutory definition is interpreted in part 779 of this chapter.
(d)
Agriculture. Agriculture
means agriculture as defined in section 3(f) of
the Fair Labor Standards Act. The statutory definition is interpreted in part 780 of this chapter.
(e)
Student hours of employment.
Student hours of employment means hours during which students are employed under full-time student certificates issued under this part and is distinguished from
hours of employment of students.
(f)
Employer.
Section 519.4 permits an agricultural or retail or service establishment employer to employ not more than six full-time students at subminimum wages on forwarding an application but before certification. For this purpose, the term
employer
looks to the highest structure of ownership or control, and hence may be more than a single retail or service establishment or farm, e.g., the controlling conglomerate or enterprise would be the
employer.
With respect to public employers who operate retail or service establishments (see 29 CFR part 779), the
employer
means the highest structure of control such as the State, municipality, county or other political subdivision.

§ 519.3
Application for a full-time student certificate.
(a) Whenever the employment of full-time students working outside of school hours in agriculture or in a retail or service establishment at wages lower than the minimum applicable under section 6 of the Fair Labor Standards Act is believed to be necessary to prevent curtailment of opportunities for employment and employment of them will not create a substantial probability of reducing the full-time employment opportunities of the other workers, an application for a certificate may be filed by their employer with the appropriate Regional Office of the Wage and Hour Division (or the Denver, Colorado Area Office for Colorado, North Dakota, and South Dakota; the Salt Lake City, Utah area Office for Montana, Utah, and Wyoming; and the Caribbean Office for the area it covers). Such application shall be signed by an authorized representative of the employer.
(b) The application must be filed in duplicate on official forms or exact copies thereof. The forms are available at the offices mentioned in paragraph (a) of this section. The application must contain the information as to the type of products sold or services rendered by the establishment, hours of employment during the preceding twelve-month period or data from previous certificates (or applications) as pertinent to the application, and other information for which request is made on the form.
(c) Separate application must be made for each farm or establishment in which authority to employ full-time students at subminimum wage rates is sought.
(d) Application for renewal of a certificate shall be made either on the same type of form as is used for a new application or on an alternate official form. No certificate in effect shall expire until action on such an application shall have been finally determined, provided that such application has been properly executed, and is received by the office specified in paragraph (a) of this section not less than 15 nor more than 30 days prior to the expiration date. A properly executed application is one which fully and accurately contains the information required on the form, and the required certification by an authorized representative of the employer.
§ 519.4
Procedure for action upon an application.
(a) Under certain conditions, an agricultural or retail or service establishment employer may obtain temporary authorization to employ full-time students at subminimum wages. These conditions are: (1) Attestation by the employer that he/she will employ no more than six full-time students at subminimum wages on any workday and that the employment of such students will not reduce the full-time employment opportunities of other persons, and (2) forwarding a properly completed application to the Wage and Hour Division not later than the start of such employment, and (3) posting a notice of such filing at the place(s) specified in paragraph (a) of § 519.6 of this subpart, and (4) compliance during
the temporary authorization period with the requirements set forth in paragraphs (b) and (j) through (o) of § 519.6 of this subpart.
(b) Temporary authorization under the conditions set forth in paragraph (a) of this section is effective from the date the application is forwarded to the Wage and Hour Division in conformance with § 519.3 of this subpart. This authorization shall continue in effect for one year from the date of forwarding of the application unless, within 30 days the Administrator or his/her authorized representative denies the application, issues a certificate with modified terms and conditions, or expressly extends the 30-day period of review.
(c) Upon receipt of an application for a certificate, the officer authorized to act upon such application shall issue a certificate if the terms and conditions specified in this subpart are satisfied. To the extent he/she deems appropriate, the authorized officer may provide an opportunity to other interested persons to present data, views, or argument on the application prior to granting or denying a certificate.
(d) Until April 30, 1976, if a certificate is issued, there shall be published in the
Federal Register
a general statement of the terms of such certificate together with a notice that, pursuant to § 519.9, for 45 days following such publication any interested person may file a written request for reconsideration or review. Thereafter, applications and certificates will be available for examination in accordance with applicable regulations in Washington, DC, and in the appropriate Regional Office of the Wage and Hour Division (or the Denver, Colorado Area Office for Colorado, North Dakota, and South Dakota; the Salt Lake City, Utah Area Office for Montana, Utah, and Wyoming; and the Caribbean Office for the area it covers) for establishments in its area. A period of 60 days will be provided after certificate issuance during which any interested person may file a written request for reconsideration or review.
(e) If a certificate is denied, notice of such denial shall be sent to the employer, stating the reason or reasons for the denial. Such denial shall be without prejudice to the filing of any subsequent application.

§ 519.5
Conditions governing issuance of full-time student certificates.
Certificates authorizing the employment of full-time students at subminimum wage rates shall not be issued unless the following conditions are met:
(a) Full-time students are available for employment at subminimum rates; the granting of a certificate is necessary in order to prevent curtailment of opportunities for employment.
(b) The employment of more than six full-time students by an employer will not create a substantial probability of reducing the full-time employment opportunities for persons other than those employed under such certificates.
(c) Abnormal labor conditions such as a strike or lockout do not exist at the farm or establishment for which a full-time student certificate is requested.
(d) The data given on the application are accurate and based on available records.
(e) The farms or establishments on whose experience the applicant relies meet the requirements of paragraph (h) of § 519.6.
(f) There are no serious outstanding violations of the provisions of a full-time student certificate previously issued to the employer, nor have there been any serious violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act (including Child-Labor Regulation No. 3 and the Hazardous Occupations Orders published in part 570 of this chapter) which provide reasonable grounds to conclude that the terms of a certificate may not be compiled with, if issued.
(g) The subminimum wage rate(s) proposed to be paid full-time students under temporary authorization or under certificate is not less than 85 percent of the minimum wage applicable under section 6 of the Act.
(h) Certificates will not be issued where such issuance will result in a reduction of the wage rate paid to a current employee, including current student employees.
[40 FR 6329, Feb. 11, 1975, as amended at 42 FR 58745, Nov. 11, 1977]
§ 519.6
Terms and conditions of employment under full-time student certificates and under temporary authorization.
(a) A full-time student certificate will not be issued for a period longer than 1 year, nor will it be issued retroactively. It shall specify its effective and expiration dates. A copy of the certificate shall be posted during its effective period in a conspicuous place or places in the establishment or at the farm readily visable to all employees, for example, adjacent to the time clock or on the bulletin board used for notices to the employees. If temporary authorization is in effect under paragraph (a) of § 519.4 of this subpart, a notice thereof shall be similarly posted during the effective period of such authorization.
(b) Full-time students may not be employed under a certificate at less than 85 percent of the minimum wage applicable under section 6 of the Act.
(c) For retail or service establishment employers or agricultural employers, the allowable extent of full-time student employment under certificates varies depending on whether: (1) The employer proposes to employ no more than six full-time students at subminimum wages on any workday, (2) the applicant requests authority for not more than 10 percent of the total hours of all employees during any month, or (3) the applicant requests authority for more than 10 percent of the total hours during any month. (For agricultural employers, the month of full-time student certificated employment may vary somewhat from the month in a previous year on which the certificate is based, depending on seasonal factors.)
(d)
Retail or service establishment employers or agricultural employers requesting authorization to employ not more than six full-time students at subminimum wages on any workday.
An application from such an applicant provides temporary authorization for the employment of full-time students at subminimum wages:
Provided,
The conditions set forth in paragraph (a) of § 519.4 of this subpart are met. Upon review of the application by the Administration or his/her authorized representative, the extent of the temporary authority may be modified.
(e)
Applicants requesting authorization for not more than 10 percent of the total hours of all employees during any month.
For such an applicant, certificates may authorize the employment of full-time student at subminimum wages for up to 10 percent of the total hours of all employees during any month, regardless of past practice of employing students. (Note: An establishment which has not previously held a certificate may be authorized 10 percent of the total hours of all employees during any month. Applicants requesting authority under this paragraph need not refer to paragraphs (f), (g), or (h) of this section.)
(f)
Applicants requesting authorization for more than 10 percent of the total monthly hours of all employees during any month with records of hours of employment of students and coverage by the Act prior to May 1974.
For such an applicant, certificates may not authorize full-time student employment at subminimum wages in excess of the highest ratio under any of these three formulas: (1) The proportion of student hours of employment (
i.e.,
of full-time students under certificates) to total hours of all employees for the corresponding month of the preceding twelve-month period; (2) the maximum proportion of student hours of employment to total hours of all employees (in any corresponding month), applicable to the issuance of full-time student certificates before May 1974; or (3) 10 percent of the total hours of all employees, during any month. (Note: An establishment which is entitled to monthly allowances ranging from 5 to 20 percent may be authorized 10 percent for those months which were less than 10 percent and retain the higher allowances for those months above 10 percent.)
(g)
Applicants requesting authorization for more than 10 percent of the total hours of all employees during any month with
records of hours of employment of students and new coverage under the 1974 Amendments.
For such an applicant, the highest permissible allowance under a certificate during any month is the highest ratio under any of these three formulas:
(1) The proportion of hours of employment of full-time students to total hours of all employees during the corresponding month from May 1973 through April 1974;
(2) The proportion of student hours of employment (
i.e.,
of hours of full-time students under certificates) to total hours of all employees during the corresponding month of the preceding twelve-month period (an alternative which is not applicable to all months of the year until 12 months after May 1, 1974); or
(3) 10 percent of the total hours of all employees, during any month. (See notes under paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section.)
(h)
Applicants requesting authorization for more than 10 percent of the total hours of all employees during any month without records of student hours worked.
For such an applicant, the permissible proportion under certificate of full-time student hours at subminimum wages to total hours of all employees is based on the “practice” during the preceding twelve-month period of: (1) Similar establishments of the same employer in the same general metropolitan areas in which such establishment is located: (2) similar establishments in the same or nearby communities if such establishment is not in a metropolitan area; or (3) other establishments of the same general character operating in the community or the nearest comparable community. (“Practice” means either the certificate allowances or the proportion between the actual student hours of employment to the total hours of all employees.)
(i) An overestimate of total hours of employment of all employees for a current month resulting in the employment of the full-time students in excess of the hours authorized in paragraph (e), (f), (g), or (h) of this section may be corrected by compensating them for the difference between the subminimum wages actually paid and the applicable minimum under section 6 of the Act for the excess hours. Similarly, if an agricultural employer or a retail or service establishment employer has authorization to employ no more than six full-time students at subminimum wages on any workday but exceeds that number, the excess may be corrected by compensating the additional full-time students for the difference between the subminimum wages actually paid and the applicable minimum under section 6 of the Act. This additional compensation shall be paid on the regular payday next after the end of the period.
(j) Full-time students shall not be permitted to work at subminimum wages for more than 8 hours a day, nor for more than 40 hours a week when school is not in session, nor more than 20 hours a week when school is in session (apart from a full-time student's summer vacation), except that when a full-day school holiday occurs on a day when the establishment is open for business, the weekly limitation on the maximum number of hours which may be worked shall be increased by 8 hours for each such holiday but in no event shall the 40-hour limitation be exceeded. (Note: School is considered to be in session for a student attending summer school.) Whenever a full-time student is employed for more than 20 hours in any workweek in conformance with this paragraph, the employer shall note in his/her payroll records that school was not in session during all or part of that workweek or the student was in his/her summer vacation.
(k) Neither oppressive child labor as defined in section 3(1) of the Act and regulations issued under the Act nor any other employment in violation of a Federal, State or local child labor law or ordinance shall come within the terms of any certificate issued under this subpart.
(l) Full-time students shall be employed at subminimum wages under this subpart only outside of their school hours,
i.e.,
only outside of the scheduled hours of instruction of the individual student, or, in the case of agriculture, only outside of school hours for the school district where the employee is living while so employed, if the employee is under 16 years of age.
(m) No full-time student shall be hired under a full-time student certificate while abnormal labor conditions, such as a strike or lockout, exist at the establishment or farm.
(n) No provision of any full-time student certificate shall excuse noncompliance with higher standards applicable to full-time students which may be established under the Walsh-Healey Public Contracts Act or any other Federal law, State law, local ordinance, or union or other agreement. Thus, certificates issued under this law have no application to employment under the Service Contract Act.
(o) No full-time student certificate shall apply to any employee to whom a certificate issued under section 14 (a) or (c) of the Act has application.
[40 FR 6329, Feb. 11, 1975; 40 FR 22546, May 23, 1975, as amended at 42 FR 58745, Nov. 11, 1977]
§ 519.7
Records to be kept.
(a) The employer shall designate each worker employed as a full-time student under a full-time student certificate at subminimum wages, as provided under part 516 of this chapter.
(b)(1) In addition to the records required under part 516 of this chapter and this subpart, the employer shall keep the records specified in paragraph (b) (2) and (3) of this section specifically relating to full-time students employed at subminimum wages.
(2) The employer shall obtain at the time of hiring and keep in his records information from the school attended that the employee receives primarily daytime instruction at the physical location of the school in accordance with the school's accepted definition of a full-time student. During a period between attendance at different schools not longer than the usual summer vacation, a certificate from the school next to be attended that the student has been accepted as a full-time student will satisfy the requirements of this paragraph (b)(2).
(3) The employer operating any farm or retail or service establishment shall maintain records of the monthly hours of employment of full-time students at subminimum wages and of the total hours of employment during the month of all employees in the establishment except for those employed in agriculture who come within one of the other exemptions from the minimum wage provisions of the Act.
(c) The records required in this section, including a copy of any full-time student certificate issued, shall be kept for a period of 3 years at the place and made available for inspection, both as provided in part 516 of this chapter.
[40 FR 6329, Feb. 11, 1975; 40 FR 22546, May 23, 1975]
§ 519.8
Amendment or replacement of a full-time student certificate.
In the absence of an objection by the employer (which may be resolved in the manner provided in part 528 of this chapter), the authorized officer upon his/her own motion may amend the provisions of a certificate when it is necessary by reason of the amendment of these regulations, or may withdraw a certificate and issue a replacement certificate when necessary to correct omissions or apparent defects in the original certificate.
§ 519.9
Reconsideration and review.
(a) Within 15 days after being informed of a denial of an application for a full-time student certificate or within 45 days after
Federal Register
publication of a statement of the terms of the certificate granted (subsequent to April 30, 1976, within 60 days after a certificate is granted), any person aggrieved by the action of an authorized officer in denying or granting a certificate may:
(1) File a written request for reconsideration thereof by the authorized officer who made the decision in the first instance, or
(2) File with the Administrator a written request for review.
(b) A request for reconsideration shall be accompanied by a statement of the additional evidence which the applicant believes may materially affect the decision and a showing that there were reasonable grounds for failure to present such evidence in the original proceedings.
(c) Any person aggrieved by the reconsideration determination of an authorized officer may, within 15 days after such determination, file with the Administrator a written request for review.
(d) A request for review shall be granted where reasonable grounds for the review are set forth in the request.
(e) If a request for reconsideration or review is granted, the authorized officer or the Administrator may, to the extent he/she deems it appropriate, afford other interested persons an opportunity to present data, views, or argument.

# Subpart B—Institutions of Higher Education
§ 519.11
Applicability of the regulations in this subpart.
(a)
Statutory provisions.
Under section 14 of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended, and the authority and responsibility delegated to him/her by the Secretary of Labor (36 FR 8755), the Administrator of the Wage and Hour Division is authorized and directed, to the extent necessary in order to prevent curtailment of employment opportunities for employment, to provide by regulation or order for the employment, under certificates, of full-time students in institutions of higher education. That section contains provisions requiring a wage rate in such certificates of not less than 85 percent of the minimum wage applicable under section 6 of the Act, limiting weekly hours of employment, stipulating compliance with the applicable child-labor standards, and safeguarding against the reduction of the full-time employment opportunities of employees other than full-time students employed under certificates.
(b)
Source of limitations.
Some of the limitations expressed in this subpart are specifically required in section 14(b) of the Act. The other limitations implement the provisions relating to employment opportunities,
i.e.,
the “extent necessary in order to prevent curtailment of opportunities for employment” and the requirement that the regulations shall “prescribe standards and requirements to insure that this paragraph will not create a substantial probability of reducing the full-time employment opportunities of persons other than those to whom the minimum wage rate authorized by” section 14(b) of the Act is applicable.
[40 FR 6329, Feb. 11, 1975; 40 FR 22546, May 23, 1975, as amended at 82 FR 2227, Jan. 9, 2017]
§ 519.12
Definitions.
(a)
Full-time students.
A
full-time student
for the purpose of this subpart is defined as one who meets the accepted definition of a full-time student of the institution of higher education which employs him/her. A full-time student retains that status during the student's Christmas, summer and other vacations, even when a student is taking one or more courses during his/her summer or other vacation. The phrase in section 14(b) of the statute “regardless of age but in compliance with applicable child labor laws”, among other things restricts the employment in an institution of higher education to full-time students who are at least 14 years of age because of the application of section 3(1) of the Act.
(b)
Institution of higher education.
An
institution of higher education
is an institution above the secondary level, such as a college or university, a junior college, or a professional school of engineering, law, library science, social work, etc. It is one that is recognized by a national accrediting agency or association as determined by the U.S. Commissioner of Education. Generally, an institution of higher education: (1) Admits as regular students only individuals having a certificate of graduation from a high school or the recognized equivalent of such a certificate; and (2) is legally authorized within a State to provide a program of education beyond high school; and (3) provides an educational program for which it normally awards a bachelor's degree, or provides not less than a two-year program which is acceptable for full credit toward such a degree or offers a two-year program in engineering, mathematics, or the physical or biological sciences which is designed to prepare the student to work as a technician and at a semi-professional level in engineering, scientific, or other technological fields which require the understanding and application of basic
engineering, scientific, or mathematical principles of knowledge.

§ 519.13
Application for a full-time student certificate.
(a) Whenever the employment of its full-time students working in an institution at wages lower than the minimum wage applicable under section 6 of the Fair Labor Standards Act is believed to be necessary to prevent curtailment of opportunities for employment and employment of them will not create a substantial probability of reducing the full-time employment opportunities of other workers, an application for a certificate may be filed by their employer with the appropriate Regional Office of the Wage and Hour Division (or the Denver, Colorado Area Office for Colorado, North Dakota and South Dakota; the Salt Lake City, Utah Area Office for Montana, Utah and Wyoming; and the Caribbean Office for the area it covers). Such an application shall be signed by an authorized representative of the employer.
(b) The application provided for under § 519.14 must be filed in duplicate on official forms or exact copies thereof. The forms are available at the offices mentioned in paragraph (a) of this section. The application must contain the information on numbers of full-time students and full-time employees (other than full-time students), minimum full-time student wages, and other information for which request is made on the form.
(c) Separate application must be made for each campus of an institution of higher education for which authority to employ full-time students at subminimum wage rates is sought.
(d) Application for renewal of a certificate shall be made on the same type of form as is used for a new application. No certificate in effect shall expire until action on such an application shall have been finally determined, provided that such application has been properly executed, and is received by the office specified in paragraph (a) of this section not less than 15 nor more than 30 days prior to the expiration date. A properly executed application is one which fully and accurately contains the information required on the form, and the required certification by an authorized representative of the employer.

(c) Upon receipt of an application for a certificate, the officer authorized to act upon such application shall issue a certificate if the terms and conditions specified in this subpart are satisfied. To the extent he/she deems appropriate, the authorized officer may provide an opportunity to other interested persons to present data, views, or argument on the application prior to granting or denying a certificate.
(d) Until April 30, 1976, if a certificate is issued there shall be published in the
Federal Register
a general statement of the terms of such certificate together with a notice that, pursuant to § 519.19, for 45 days following such publication any interested person may file a written request for reconsideration or review. Thereafter, applications and certificates will be available for examination in accordance with applicable regulations in Washington, DC, and in the appropriate Regional Office of the Wage and Hour Division (or the Denver, Colorado Area Office for Colorado, North Dakota, and South Dakota; the Salt Lake City, Utah Area Office for Montana, Utah, and Wyoming; and the Caribbean Office for the area it covers) for institutions of higher education in its area. A period of 60 days will be provided after certificate issuance during which any interested person may file a written request for reconsideration or review.
(e) If a certificate is denied, notice of such denial shall be sent to the employer, stating the reason or reasons for the denial. Such denial shall be without prejudice to the filing of any subsequent application.
§ 519.15
Conditions governing issuance of full-time student certificates.
Certificates authorizing the employment of full-time students at subminimum wage rates shall not be issued unless the following conditions are met:
(a) Full-time students are available for employment at subminimum rates; the granting of a certificate is necessary in order to prevent curtailment of opportunities for employment.
(b) The employment of full-time students will not create a substantial probability of reducing the full-time employment opportunities for persons other than those employed under such certificates.

(d) The data given on the application are accurate and based on available records.
(e) There are no serious outstanding violations of the provisions of a full-time student certificate previously issued to the employer, nor have there been any serious violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act (including Child-Labor Regulation No. 3 and the Hazardous Occupations Orders published in part 570 of this chapter) which provide reasonable grounds to conclude that the terms of a certificate may not be complied with, if issued.
(f) The subminimum wage rate(s) proposed to be paid full-time students under temporary authorization or under certificate is not less than 85 percent of the minimum wage applicable under section 6 of the Act.
(g) Full-time students are not to be employed by an institution of higher education at subminimum wages under this subpart in unrelated trades or businesses as defined and applied under sections 511 through 515 of the Internal Revenue Code, such as apartment houses, stores, or other businesses not primarily catering to the students of the institution.
(h) Certificates will not be issued where such issuance will result in a reduction of the wage rate paid to a current employee, including current student employees.
§ 519.16
Terms and conditions of employment under full-time student certificates and under temporary authorization.
(a) A full-time student certificate will not be issued for a period longer than 1 year, nor will it be issued retroactively. It shall specify its effective and expiration dates. A copy of the certificate shall be posted during its effective period in a conspicuous place or places in the institution of higher education readily visible to all employees, for example, adjacent to the time clock or on the bulletin board used for notices to the employees. If temporary authorization is in effect under paragraph (a) of § 519.14, a notice thereof shall be similarly posted during the effective period of such authorization.
(b) Full-time students may not be employed under a certificate at less than 85 percent of the minimum wage applicable under section 6 of the Act.
(c) An institution of higher education shall not employ full-time students at subminimum wages under this subpart in unrelated trades or businesses as defined and applied under sections 511 through 515 of the Internal Revenue Code, such as apartment houses, stores, or other businesses not primarily catering to the students of the institution.
(d) An institution of higher education subject to a finding by the Secretary that it is in violation of the requirements of section 14(b)(3) of the Act or of this subpart must be issued a full-time student certificate before it can employ full-time students at wages below those required by section 6 of the Act. The Administrator or his/her authorized representative will not issue a full-time student certificate to such an institution without adequate assurances and safeguards to insure that the violations found by the Secretary will not continue.
(e) Full-time students shall not be permitted to work at subminimum wages for more than 8 hours a day, nor for more than 40 hours a week when school is not in session, nor more than 20 hours a week when school is in session (apart from a full-time student's summer vacation), except that when a full-day school holiday occurs the weekly limitation on the maximum hours which may be worked shall be increased by 8 hours for each such holiday but in no event shall the 40-hour limitation be exceeded. (Note: School is considered to be in session for a student taking one or more courses during a summer or other vacation.) Whenever a full-time student is employed for more than 20 hours in any workweek in conformance with this paragraph, the employer shall note in his/her payroll that school was not in session during all or part of that workweek or the student was in his/her summer vacation.
(f) Neither oppressive child labor as defined in section 3(1) of the Act and regulations issued under the Act nor any other employment in violation of a Federal, State or local child labor law or ordinance shall come within the terms of any certificate issued under this subpart.

i.e.,
only outside of the scheduled hours of instruction of the individual full-time student.

Thus, certificates issued under this subpart have no application to employment under the Service Contract Act.
(j) No full-time student certificate shall apply to any employee to whom a certificate issued under section 14(a) or (c) of the Act has application.
[40 FR 6329, Feb. 11, 1975; 40 FR 22546, May 23, 1975]
§ 519.17
Records to be kept.
(a) The employer shall designate each worker employed as a full-time student under a full-time student certificate at subminimum wages, as provided under part 516 of this chapter.

# Subpart B—What are the General Provisions Governing the Employment of Messengers, Learners (Including Student-Learners), and Apprentices at Subminimum Wages?
§ 520.200
What is the legal authority for payment of wages lower than the minimum wage required by section 6(a) of the Fair Labor Standards Act?
Section 14(a) of the Fair Labor Standards Act provides, in order to prevent curtailment of employment opportunities, for the payment of special minimum wage rates to workers employed as messengers, learners (including student-learners), and apprentices under special certificates issued by the Department of Labor.
§ 520.201
How are those classifications of workers which may be paid subminimum wages under section 14(a) of the Fair Labor Standards Act defined?
(a) A messenger is a worker who is primarily engaged in delivering letters and messages for a firm whose principal business is the delivery of such letters and messages.
(b) A learner is a worker who is being trained for an occupation, which is not customarily recognized as an apprenticeable trade, for which skill, dexterity and judgment must be learned and who, when initially employed, produces little or nothing of value. Except in extraordinary circumstances, an employee cannot be considered a “learner” once he/she has
acquired a total of 240 hours of job-related and/or vocational training with the same or other employer(s) or training facility(ies) during the past three years. An individual qualifying as a “learner” may only be trained in two qualifying occupations.
(c) A student-learner is a student who is at least sixteen years of age, or at least eighteen years of age if employed in an occupation which the Secretary has declared to be particularly hazardous, who is receiving instruction in an accredited school, college or university and who is employed on a part-time basis, pursuant to a “bona fide vocational training program” as defined in subpart C of this part.
(d) An apprentice is a worker, at least sixteen years of age unless a higher minimum age standard is otherwise fixed by law, who is employed to learn a skilled trade through a registered apprenticeship program. Training is provided through structured on-the-job training combined with supplemental related theoretical and technical instruction. This term excludes pre-apprentices, trainees, learners, and student-learners. The terms learner and student-learner are defined in subpart C of this part. Standards governing the registration of apprenticeship programs are established and administered by the U.S. Department of Labor, Employment and Training Administration, Bureau of Apprenticeship and Training (BAT) and are found in Regulations, 29 CFR Part 29.
(e) Additional terms used in this part are defined in subpart C of this part.
§ 520.202
How do persons who want to apply for a particular certificate find out what is needed?
The application process, terms, conditions and requirements of certificates and other matters are discussed in subparts D and E of this part. Messengers, learners (excluding student-learners), and apprentices are discussed in subpart D of this part and student-learners in subpart E of this part.
§ 520.203
What records does an employer have to keep when subminimum wage certificates are granted? How long do they have to be kept?
(a) In addition to other records required under the recordkeeping requirements (part 516 of this chapter), the employer is required to keep records specific to certification under section 14(a) of the Fair Labor Standards Act. All workers employed under a subminimum wage certificate shall be designated as such on the employer's payroll records. Further recordkeeping requirements are described in each applicable subpart of this part (see §§ 520.412 and 520.508 of this part).
(b) Employers must maintain and preserve all required records for at least three years from the last date of employment under a subminimum wage program. The employer's copy of the application and the certificate shall also be maintained for three years. Such records shall be kept secure and accessible at the place of employment or where payroll records are customarily maintained. All records must be available for inspection and copying by the Administrator.
§ 520.204
If someone does not agree with the Department of Labor's decision on a certificate, can the decision be appealed?
(a) Any person, applicant, trade union, association, etc. who does not agree with action granting or denying a certificate (pursuant to §§ 520.406 and 520.505) may, within 60 days of that action or such additional time as the Administrator may allow, file with the Administrator a petition for review. The decision of the Administrator becomes final unless such a written request is timely filed.
(b) Such requests should contain a statement of the additional evidence which the person believes may materially affect the decision and establish that there were reasonable grounds for failure to present such evidence during the original certification process.
(c) If a request for reconsideration or review is granted, the Administrator, to the extent it is deemed appropriate, may afford other interested persons an opportunity to present data and views.
(d) The Administrator may conduct an investigation, which may include a hearing, prior to taking any action pursuant to this part.
§ 520.205
How do these rules affect other Federal, state and local laws and collective bargaining agreements?
No provision of this part, or of any special minimum wage certificate issued thereunder, shall excuse noncompliance with any other Federal or state law or municipal ordinance or collective bargaining agreement establishing higher standards.

(e) Reasonable efforts must have been made to recruit workers paid at least the minimum wage in those occupations in which certificates to employ learners at subminimum wages have been requested. This includes the placement of an order with the local State or Territorial Public Employment Service Office (except in possessions where there is no such office) not more than fifteen days prior to the date of application.

(g) If experienced workers are paid on a piece rate basis, learners shall be paid at least the same piece rates as experienced workers employed on similar work in the plant and shall receive earnings based on such piece rates whenever such earnings exceed the subminimum wage rates permitted in the certificate.
§ 520.409
When will authority to pay apprentices special minimum wages become effective and what is the special minimum wage rate?
(a) An apprenticeship program which has been registered with a recognized apprenticeship agency shall constitute a temporary special certificate authorizing the employment of an apprentice at the wages and under the conditions specified in such program until a special certificate is issued or denied. This temporary authorization is, however, conditioned on the requirement that within 90 days from the beginning date of employment of the apprentice, the employer or the apprenticeship committee shall send one copy of each apprenticeship agreement, with evidence of registration, to the appropriate Regional Office of the Wage and Hour Division.
(b) The wage rate specified by the apprenticeship program becomes the special minimum wage rate that must be paid unless the Administrator issues a certificate modifying the terms and conditions of employment of apprentices at special minimum wages.
§ 520.410
How long does a messenger, learner, or apprentice certificate remain in effect?
(a) Messenger and/or learner certificates may be issued for a period of not longer than one year.
(b) Each special apprentice certificate shall specify the conditions and limitations under which it is granted, including the periods of time during which subminimum wage rates may be paid pursuant to a registered apprenticeship program.
(c) No certificate may be issued retroactively.
(d) The Administrator may amend the provisions of a certificate when necessary to correct omissions or defects in the original certificate or reflect changes in this part.
§ 520.411
Does a certificate authorizing payment of subminimum wages to messengers and/or learners remain in effect during the renewal process?
(a) Application for renewal of a messenger and/or learner certificate shall be made on the same form as described in this section and employees shall be advised of such renewal application in the same manner as explained in § 520.405. No effective messenger and/or learner certificate shall expire until action on an application for renewal shall have been finally determined, provided that such application has been properly executed in accordance with the requirements, and filed with and received by the Administrator not less than fifteen nor more than thirty days prior to the expiration date. A final determination means either the granting of or initial denial of the application for renewal of a messenger and/or learner certificate, or withdrawal of the application. A “properly executed application” is one which contains the complete information required on the form, and the required certification by the applicant.
(b) A renewal certificate will not be issued unless there is a clear showing that the conditions set forth in section 520.404 of this part still prevail.
§ 520.412
What records, in addition to those required by Part 516 of this chapter and section 520.203 of this part, must I keep relating to the employment of messengers, learners, or apprentices under special certificate?
(a) Each worker employed as a messenger, learner, or apprentice under a certificate shall be designated as such on the employer's payroll records. All such messengers, learners, or apprentices shall be listed together as a separate group on the payroll records, with each messenger's, learner's, or apprentice's occupation being shown.
(b) At the time learners are hired, the employer shall also obtain and keep in his/her records a statement signed by each employee showing all applicable experience which the learner had in the employer's industry, including vocational training, during the preceding three years. The statement shall contain the dates of such previous employment, names and addresses of employers, the occupation or occupations in which the learner was engaged and the types of products upon which the learner worked. The statement shall also contain information concerning pertinent training in vocational training schools or similar training facilities, including the dates
of such training and the identity of the vocational school or training facility. If the learner has had no applicable experience or pertinent training, a statement to that effect signed by the learner shall likewise be kept in the employer's records.
(c) The employer shall maintain a file of all evidence and records, including any correspondence, pertaining to the filing or cancellation of job orders placed with the local State or Territorial Public Employment Service Office pertaining to job orders for occupations to be performed by learners.
(d) Every employer who employs apprentices under temporary or special certificates shall preserve for three years from the last effective date of the certificate copies of the apprenticeship program, apprenticeship agreement and special certificate under which such an apprentice is employed.
(e) Every apprenticeship committee which holds a certificate under this part shall keep the following records for each apprentice under its control and supervision:
(1) The apprenticeship program, apprenticeship agreement and special certificate under which the apprentice is employed by an employer;
(2) The cumulative amount of work experience gained by the apprentice, in order to establish the proper wage at the time of his/her assignment to an employer; and
(3) A list of the employers to whom the apprentice was assigned and the period of time he/she worked for each employer.
(f) The records required in this section, including a copy of the application(s) submitted and any special certificate(s) issued, shall be kept and made available for inspection for at least three years from the expiration date of the certificate(s).

# Subpart E—Student-Learners

(d) The occupation for which the student-learner is receiving preparatory training requires a sufficient degree of skill to necessitate a substantial learning period;
(e) The training is not for the purpose of acquiring manual dexterity and high production speed in repetitive operations;
(f) The employment of a student-learner will not have the effect of displacing a worker employed in the establishment;
(g) The employment of the student-learners at subminimum wages must not tend to impair or depress the wage rates or working standards established for experienced workers for work of a like or comparable character;
(h) The occupational needs of the community or industry warrant the training of student-learners;
(i) There are no serious outstanding violations of the provisions of a student-learner certificate previously issued to the employer, or serious violations of any other provisions of the FLSA by the employer which provide reasonable grounds to conclude that the terms of the certificate would not be complied with, if issued;
(j) The issuance of such a certificate would not tend to prevent the development of apprenticeship programs in accordance with the regulations applicable thereto (subpart D of this part) or would not impair established apprenticeship standards in the occupation or industry involved; and
(k) The number of student-learners to be employed in one establishment is not more than a small proportion of its work force.
§ 520.504
When will authority to pay student-learners subminimum wages become effective?
(a) Certification by the appropriate school official on an application for a special student-learner certificate shall constitute a temporary authorization. This temporary authorization is effective from the date such application is forwarded to the Wage and Hour Division in conformance with § 520.501.

with modified terms and conditions, or expressly extends the period of review.
§ 520.505
How will I be notified that my request to employ student-learners at subminimum wages has been denied and can I appeal the denial?
(a) If, after review, an application is denied, notification of denial will be made to the appropriate school official, the employer and the student. This notification will occur within 30 days following the date such application was forwarded to the Wage and Hour Division, unless additional time for review is considered necessary or appropriate.
(b) If additional time for review is considered necessary or appropriate, the proper school official, the employer, and the student shall be so notified. To the extent feasible, the Administrator may provide an opportunity to other interested persons to present data and views on the application before denying a special student-learner certificate.
(c) Whenever a notification of denial is mailed to the employer, such denial shall be without prejudice to any subsequent application, except under the circumstances referred to in § 520.502(i)(3).
(d) Section 520.204 of this part describes the procedures for requesting reconsideration of a decision to grant or deny a certificate.
§ 520.506
What is the subminimum wage for student-learners and what must I do to comply with the terms of my student-learner certificate?
(a) The special minimum wage rate paid to student-learners shall be not less than 75 percent of the applicable minimum under section 6(a) of the FLSA.
(b) Compliance with items listed for favorable review of a student-learner application (§ 540.503) must be demonstrated.
(c)(1) The number of hours of employment training each week at subminimum wages pursuant to a certificate, when added to the hours of school instruction, shall not exceed 40 hours, except that authorization may be granted by the Administrator for a greater number of hours if found to be justified by extraordinary circumstances.
(2) When school is not in session on any school day, the student-learner may work a number of hours in addition to the weekly hours of employment training authorized by the certificate; provided,
(i) The total hours worked shall not exceed 8 hours on any such day, and
(ii) A notation shall be made in the employer's records to the effect that school not being in session was the reason additional hours were worked on such day.
(3) During the school term, when school is not in session for the entire week, the student-learner may work at his/her employment training a number of hours in the week in addition to those authorized by the certificate; provided,
(i) The total hours shall not exceed 40 hours in any such week, and
(ii) A notation shall be made in the employer's records to the effect that school not being in session was the reason additional hours were worked in such week.
(d) A special student-learner certificate shall not constitute authorization to pay a subminimum wage rate to a student-learner in any week in which he/she is employed for a number of hours in addition to the number authorized in the certificate, except as provided in paragraphs (c)(1), (2), and (3) of this section.
§ 520.507
How long does my certificate remain in effect?
(a) A special student-learner certificate shall be effective for a period not to exceed the length of one school year unless a longer period is found to be justified by extraordinary circumstances. These circumstances must be explained in detail at the time of application. While each such request will be considered on its own merit, it is anticipated that such authorizations would be limited to occupations requiring an extended period of specialized training;
(b) No certificate shall authorize employment training beyond the date of graduation.
(c) No special student-learner certificate may be issued retroactively.
§ 520.508
What records, in addition to those required by Part 516 of this chapter and section 520.203 of this part, must I keep when student-learners are employed?

§ 525.1
Introduction.
The Fair Labor Standards Amendments of 1986 (Pub. L. 99-486, 100 Stat. 1229) substantially revised those provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 201) (FLSA) permitting the employment of individuals disabled for the work to be performed (workers with disabilities) at special minimum wage rates below the rate that would otherwise be required by statute. These provisions are codified at section 14(c) of the FLSA and:
(a) Provide for the employment under certificates of individuals with disabilities at special minimum wage rates which are commensurate with those paid to workers not disabled for the work to be performed employed in the vicinity for essentially the same type, quality, and quantity of work;
(b) Require employers to provide written assurances that wage rates of individuals paid on an hourly rate basis be reviewed at least once every six months and that the wages of all employees be reviewed at least annually to reflect changes in the prevailing wages paid to experienced individuals not disabled for the work to be performed employed in the locality for essentially the same type of work;
(c) Prohibit employers from reducing the wage rates prescribed by certificate in effect on June 1, 1986, for two years;
(d) Permit the continuance or establishment of work activities centers; and
(e) Provide that any employee receiving a special minimum wage rate pursuant to section 14(c), or the parent or guardian of such an employee, may petition for a review of that wage rate by an administrative law judge.
§ 525.2
Purpose and scope.
The regulations in this part govern the issuance of all certificates authorizing the employment of workers with disabilities at special minimum wages pursuant to section 14(c) of FLSA.
§ 525.3
Definitions.
(a)
FLSA
means the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended.
(b)
Secretary
means the Secretary of Labor or the Secretary of Labor's authorized representative.
(c)
Administrator
means the Administrator of the Wage and Hour Division, U.S. Department of Labor, or the Administrator's authorized representative.
(d)
Worker with a disability
for the purpose of this part means an individual whose earning or productive capacity is impaired by a physical or mental disability, including those relating to age or injury, for the work to be performed. Disabilities which may affect earning or productive capacity include blindness, mental illness, mental retardation, cerebral palsy, alcoholism, and drug addiction. The following, taken by themselves, are not considered disabilities for the purposes of this part: Vocational, social, cultural, or educational disabilities; chronic unemployment; receipt of welfare benefits; nonattendance at school; juvenile delinquency; and, correctional parole or probation. Further, a disability which may affect earning or productive capacity for one type of work may not affect such capacity for another.
(e)
Patient worker
means a worker with a disability, as defined above, employed by a hospital or institution providing residential care where such worker receives treatment or care without regard to whether such worker is a resident of the establishment.
(f)
Hospital or institution,
hereafter referred to as
institution,
is a public or private, nonprofit or for-profit facility primarily engaged in (
i.e.,
more than 50 percent of the income is attributable to) providing residential care for the sick, the aged, or the mentally ill or retarded, including but not limited to nursing homes, intermediate care facilities, rest homes, convalescent homes, homes for the elderly and infirm, halfway houses, residential centers for drug addicts or alcoholics, and the like, whether licensed or not licensed.
(g)
Employ
is defined in FLSA as
to suffer or permit to work.
An employment relationship arises whenever an individual, including an individual with a disability, is suffered or permitted to work. The determination of an employment relationship does not depend upon the level of performance or whether the work is of some therapeutic benefit. However, an individual does not become an employee if engaged in such activities as making craft products where the individual voluntarily participates in such activities and the products become the property of the individual making them, or all of the funds resulting from the sale of the products are divided among the participants in the activity or are used in purchasing additional materials to make craft products.
(h)
Special minimum wage
is a wage authorized under a certificate issued to an employer under this part that is less than the statutory minimum wage.
(i)
Commensurate
wage is a special minimum wage paid to a worker with a disability which is based on the worker's individual productivity in proportion to the wage and productivity of experienced nondisabled workers performing essentially the same type, quality, and quantity of work in the vicinity in which the individual under certificate is employed. For example, the commensurate wage of a worker with a disability who is 75% as productive as the average experienced nondisabled worker, taking into consideration the type, quality, and quantity of work of the disabled worker, would be set at 75% of the wage paid to the nondisabled worker. For purposes of these regulations, a commensurate wage is always a special minimum wage,
i.e.,
a wage below the statutory minimum.
(j)
Vicinity
or
locality
means the geographic area from which the labor force of the community is drawn.
(k)
Experienced worker
means a worker who has learned the basic elements or requirements of the work to be performed, ordinarily by completion of a probationary or training period. Typically, such a worker will have received at least one pay raise after successful completion of the probationary or training period.
§ 525.4
Patient workers.
With respect to patient workers, as defined in § 525.3(e), a major factor in determining if an employment relationship exists is whether the work performed is of any consequential economic benefit to the institution. Generally, work shall be considered to be of consequential economic benefit if it is of the type that workers without disabilities normally perform, in whole or in part in the institution or elsewhere. However, a patient does not become an employee if he or she merely performs
personal housekeeping chores, such as maintaining his or her own quarters, or receives a token remuneration in connection with such services. It may also be possible for patients in family-like settings such as group homes to rotate or share household tasks or chores without becoming employees.
§ 525.5
Wage payments.
(a) An individual whose earning or productive capacity is not impaired for the work being performed cannot be employed under a certificate issued pursuant to this part and must be paid at least the applicable minimum wage. An individual whose earning or productive capacity is impaired to the extent that the individual is unable to earn at least the applicable minimum wage may be paid a commensurate wage, but only after the employer has obtained a certificate authorizing payment of special minimum wages from the appropriate office of the Wage and Hour Division of the Department of Labor.
(b) With respect to patient workers employed in institutions, no deductions can be made from such individuals' commensurate wages to cover the cost of room, board, or other services provided by the facility. Such an individual must receive his or her wages free and clear, except for amounts deducted for taxes assessed against the employee and any voluntary wage assignments directed by the employee. (See part 531 of this title.) However, it is not the intention of these regulations to preclude the institution thereafter from assessing or collecting charges for room, board, and other services actually provided to an individual to the extent permitted by applicable Federal or State law and on the same basis as it assesses and collects from nonworking patients.
§ 525.6
Compensable time.
Individuals employed subject to this part must be compensated for all hours worked. Compensable time includes not only those hours during which the individual is actually performing productive work but also includes those hours when no work is performed but the individual is required by the employer to remain available for the next assignment. However, where the individual is completely relieved from duty and is not required to remain available for the next assignment, such time will not be considered compensable time. For example, an individual employed by a rehabilitation facility would not be engaged in a compensable activity where such individual is completely relieved from duty but is provided therapy or the opportunity to participate in an alternative program or activity in the facility not involving work and not directly related to the worker's job (e.g., self-help skills training, recreation, job seeking skills training, independent living skills, or adult basic education). The burden of establishing that such hours are not compensable rests with the facility and such hours must be clearly distinguishable from compensable hours. (For further information on compensable time in general under FLSA, see part 785 of this title.)
§ 525.7
Application for certificates.
(a) Application for a certificate may be filed by any employer with the Regional Office of the Wage and Hour Division having administrative jurisdiction over the geographic area in which the employment is to take place.
(b) The employer shall provide answers to all of the applicable questions contained on the application form provided by the Regional Office.
(c) The application shall be signed by the employer or the employer's authorized representative.
§ 525.8
Special provisions for temporary authority.
(a) Temporary authority may be granted to an employer permitting the employment of workers with disabilities pursuant to a vocational rehabilitation program of the Veterans Administration for veterans with a service-incurred disability or a vocational rehabilitation program administered by a State agency.
(b) Temporary authority is effective for 90 days from the date the appropriate section of the application form is signed and completed by the duly designated representative of the State agency or the Veterans Administration. Such authority may not be renewed or extended by the issuing agency.
(c) The signed application constitutes the temporary authority to employ workers with disabilities at special minimum wage rates. A copy of the application must be forwarded within 10 days to the appropriate Regional Office of the Wage and Hour Division. Upon receipt, the application will be reviewed and, where appropriate, a certificate will be issued by the Regional Office. Where additional information is required or certification is denied, the applicant will receive notification from the Regional Office.
§ 525.9
Criteria for employment of workers with disabilities under certificates at special minimum wage rates.
(a) In order to determine that special minimum wage rates are necessary in order to prevent the curtailment of opportunities for employment, the following criteria will be considered:
(1) The nature and extent of the disabilities of the individuals employed as these disabilities relate to the individuals' productivity;
(2) The prevailing wages of experienced employees not disabled for the job who are employed in the vicinity in industry engaged in work comparable to that performed at the special minimum wage rate;
(3) The productivity of the workers with disabilities compared to the norm established for nondisabled workers through the use of a verifiable work measurement method (see § 525.12(h)) or the productivity of experienced nondisabled workers employed in the vicinity on comparable work; and,
(4) The wage rates to be paid to the workers with disabilities for work comparable to that performed by experienced nondisabled workers.
(b) In order to be granted a certificate authorizing the employment of workers with disabilities at special minimum wage rates, the employer must provide the following written assurances concerning such employment:
(1) In the case of individuals paid hourly rates, the special minimum wage rates will be reviewed by the employer at periodic intervals at a minimum of once every six months; and,
(2) Wages for all employees will be adjusted by the employer at periodic intervals at a minimum of once each year to reflect changes in the prevailing wages paid to experienced nondisabled individuals employed in the locality for essentially the same type of work.
§ 525.10
Prevailing wage rates.
(a) A prevailing wage rate is a wage rate that is paid to an experienced worker not disabled for the work to be performed. The Department recognizes that there may be more than one wage rate for a specific type of work in a given area. An employer must be able to demonstrate that the rate being used as prevailing for determining a commensurate wage was objectively determined according to the guidelines contained in this section.
(b) An employer whose work force primarily consists of nondisabled workers or who employs more than a token number of nondisabled workers doing similar work may use as the prevailing wage the wage rate paid to that employer's experienced nondisabled employees performing similar work. Where an agency places a worker or workers with disabilities on the premises of an employer described above, the wage paid to the employer's experienced workers may be used as prevailing.
(c) An employer whose work force primarily consists of workers disabled for the work to be performed may determine the prevailing wage by ascertaining the wage rates paid to the experienced nondisabled workers of other employers in the vicinity. Such data may be obtained by surveying comparable firms in the area that employ primarily nondisabled workers doing similar work. The firms surveyed must be representative of comparable firms in terms of wages paid to experienced workers doing similar work. The appropriate size of such a sample will depend on the number of firms doing similar work but should include no less than three firms unless there are fewer firms doing such work in the area. A comparable firm is one which is of similar size in terms of employees or which competes for or bids on contracts of a similar size or nature. Employers may contact other sources such as the Bureau of Labor Statistics or
private or State employment services where surveys are not practical. If similar work cannot be found in the area defined by the geographic labor market, the closest comparable community may be used.
(d) The prevailing wage rate must be based upon the wage rate paid to experienced nondisabled workers as defined elsewhere in these regulations. Employment services which only provide entry level wage data are not acceptable as sources for prevailing wage information as required in these regulations.
(e) There is no prescribed method for tabulating the results of a prevailing wage survey. For example, either a weighted or unweighted average would be acceptable provided the employer is consistent in the methodology used.
(f) The prevailing wage must be based upon work utilizing similar methods and equipment. Where the employer is unable to obtain the prevailing wage for a specific job to be performed on the premises, such as collating documents, it would be acceptable to use as the prevailing wage the wage paid to experienced individuals employed in similar jobs such as file clerk or general office clerk, requiring the same general skill levels.
(g) The following information should be recorded in documenting the determination of prevailing wage rates:
(1) Date of contact with firm or other source;
(2) Name, address, and phone number of firm or other source contacted;
(3) Individual contacted within firm or source;
(4) Title of individual contacted;
(5) Wage rate information provided;
(6) Brief description of work for which wage information is provided;
(7) Basis for the conclusion that wage rate is not based upon an entry level position. (See also § 525.10(c).)
(h) A prevailing wage may not be less than the minimum wage specified in section 6(a) of FLSA.
§ 525.11
Issuance of certificates.
(a) Upon consideration of the criteria cited in these regulations, a special certificate may be issued.
(b) If a special minimum wage certificate is issued, a copy shall be sent to the employer. If denied, the employer will be notified in writing and told the reasons for the denial, as well as the right to petition under § 525.18.
§ 525.12
Terms and conditions of special minimum wage certificates.
(a) A special minimum wage certificate shall specify the terms and conditions under which it is granted.
(b) A special minimum wage certificate shall apply to all workers employed by the employer to which the special certificate is granted provided such workers are in fact disabled for the work they are to perform.
(c) A special minimum wage certificate shall be effective for a period to be designated by the Administrator. Workers with disabilities may be paid wages lower than the statutory minimum wage rate set forth in section 6 of FLSA only during the effective period of the certificate.
(d) Workers paid under special minimum wage certificates shall be paid wages commensurate with those paid experienced nondisabled workers employed in the vicinity in which they are employed for essentially the same type, quality, and quantity of work.
(e) Workers with disabilities shall be paid not less than one and one-half times their regular rates of pay for all hours worked in excess of the maximum workweek applicable under section 7 of FLSA.
(f) The wages of all workers paid a special minimum wage under this part shall be adjusted by the employer at periodic intervals at a minimum of once a year to reflect changes in the prevailing wages paid to experienced individuals not disabled for the work to be performed employed in the vicinity for essentially the same type of work.
(g) Each worker with a disability and, where appropriate, a parent or guardian of the worker, shall be informed, orally and in writing, of the terms of the certificate under which such worker is employed. This requirement may be satisfied by making copies of the certificate available. Where a worker with disabilities displays an understanding of the terms of a certificate and requests that other parties not be informed, it is not necessary to inform a parent or guardian.
(h) In establishing piece rates for workers with disabilities, the following criteria shall be used:
(1) Industrial work measurement methods such as stop watch time studies, predetermined time systems, standard data, or other measurement methods (hereinafter referred to as “work measurement methods”) shall be used by the employer to establish standard production rates of workers not disabled for the work to be performed. The Department will accept the use of whatever method an employer chooses to use. However, the employer has the responsibility of demonstrating that a particular method is generally accepted by industrial engineers and has been properly executed. No specific training or certification will be required. Where work measurement methods have already been applied by another employer or source, and documentation exists to show that the methods used are the same, it is not necessary to repeat these methods to establish production standards.
(i) The piece rates shall be based on the standard production rates (number of units an experienced worker not disabled for the work is expected to produce per hour) and the prevailing industry wage rate paid experienced nondisabled workers in the vicinity for essentially the same type and quality of work or for work requiring similar skill. (Prevailing industry wage rate divided by the standard number of units per hour equals the piece rate.).
(ii) Piece rates shall not be less than the prevailing piece rates paid experienced workers not disabled for the work doing the same or similar work in the vicinity when such piece rates exist and can be compared with the actual employment situations of the workers with disabilities.
(2) Any work measurement method used to establish piece rates shall be verifiable through the use of established industrial work measurement techniques.
(i) If stop watch time studies are made, they shall be made with a person or persons whose productivity represents normal or near normal performance. If their productivity does not represent normal or near normal performance, adjustments of performance shall be made. Such adjustments, sometimes called “performance rating” or “leveling” shall be made only by a person knowledgeable in this technique, as evidenced by successful completion of training in this area. The persons observed should be given time to practice the work to be performed in order to provide them with an opportunity to overcome the initial learning curve. The persons observed shall be trained to use the specific work method and tools which are available to workers with disabilities employed under special minimum wage certificates.
(ii) Appropriate time shall be allowed for personal time, fatigue, and unavoidable delays. Generally, not less than 15% allowances (9-10 minutes per hour) shall be used in conducting time studies.
(iii) Work measurements shall be conducted using the same work method that will be utilized by the workers with disabilities. When modifications such as jigs or fixtures are made to production methods to accommodate special needs of individual workers with disabilities, additional work measurements need not be conducted where the modifications enable the workers with disabilities to perform the work or increase productivity but would impede a worker without disabilities. Where workers with disabilities do not have a method available to them, as for example where an adequate number of machines are not available, a second work measurement should be conducted.
(i) Each worker with a disability employed on a piece rate basis should be paid full earnings. Employers may “pool” earnings only where piece rates cannot be established for each individual worker. An example of this situation is a team production operation where each worker's individual contribution to the finished product cannot be determined separately. However, in such situations, the employer should make every effort to objectively divide the earnings according to the productivity level of each individual worker.
(j) The following terms shall be met for workers with disabilities employed at hourly rates:
(1) Hourly rates shall be based upon the prevailing hourly wage rates paid to experienced workers not disabled for the job doing essentially the same type of work and using similar methods or equipment in the vicinity. (See also § 525.10.)
(2) An initial evaluation of a worker's productivity shall be made within the first month after employment begins in order to determine the worker's commensurate wage rate. The results of the evaluation shall be recorded and the worker's wages shall be adjusted accordingly no later than the first complete pay period following the initial evaluation. Each worker is entitled to commensurate wages for all hours worked. Where the wages paid to the worker during pay periods prior to the initial evaluation were less than the commensurate wage indicated by the evaluation, the employer must compensate the worker for any such difference unless it can be demonstrated that the initial payments reflected the commensurate wage due at that time.
(3) Upon completion of not more than six months of employment, a review shall be made with respect to the quantity and quality of work of each hourly-rated worker with a disability as compared to that of nondisabled workers engaged in similar work or work requiring similar skills and the findings shall be recorded. The worker's productivity shall then be reviewed and the findings recorded at least every 6 months thereafter. A review and recording of productivity shall also be made after a worker changes jobs and at least every 6 months thereafter. The worker's wages shall be adjusted accordingly no later than the first complete pay period following each review. Conducting reviews at six-month intervals should be viewed as a minimum requirement since workers with disabilities are entitled to commensurate wages for all hours worked. Reviews must be conducted in a manner and frequency to insure payment of commensurate wages. For example, evaluations should not be conducted before a worker has had an opportunity to become familiar with the job or at a time when the worker is fatigued or subject to conditions that result in less than normal productivity.
(4) Each review should contain, as a minimum and in addition to the data cited above, the following: name of the individual being reviewed; date and time of the review; and, name and position of the individual doing the review.
§ 525.13
Renewal of special minimum wage certificates.
(a) Applications may be filed for renewal of special minimum wage certificates.
(b) If an application for renewal has been properly and timely filed, an existing special minimum wage certificate shall remain in effect until the application for renewal has been granted or denied.
(c) Workers with disabilities may not continue to be paid special minimum wages after notice that an application for renewal has been denied.
(d) Except in cases of willfulness or those in which the public interest requires otherwise, before an application for renewal is denied facts or conduct which may warrant such action shall be called to the attention of the employer in writing and such employer shall be afforded an opportunity to demonstrate or achieve compliance with all legal requirements.
§ 525.14
Posting of notices.
Every employer having workers who are employed under special minimum wage certificates shall at all times display and make available to employees a poster as prescribed and supplied by the Administrator. The Administrator will make available, upon request, posters in other formats such as Braille or recorded tapes. Such a poster will explain, in general terms, the conditions under which special minimum wages may be paid and shall be posted in a conspicuous place on the employer's premises where it may be readily observed by the workers with disabilities, the parents and guardians of such workers, and other workers. Where an employer finds it inappropriate to post such a notice, this requirement may be satisfied by providing the poster directly to all employees subject to its terms.
§ 525.15
Industrial homework.
(a) Where the employer is an organization or institution carrying out a recognized program of rehabilitation for workers with disabilities and holds a special certificate issued pursuant to this part, certification under regulations governing the employment of industrial homeworkers (29 CFR part 530) is not required.
(b) For all other types of employers, special rules apply to the employment of homeworkers in the following industries: Jewelry manufacturing, knitted outerwear, gloves and mittens, buttons and buckles, handkerchief manufacturing, embroideries, and women's apparel. (See 29 CFR part 530.)
§ 525.16
Records to be kept by employers.
Every employer, or where appropriate (in the case of records verifying the workers' disabilities) the referring agency or facility, of workers employed under special minimum wage certificates shall maintain and have available for inspection records indicating:
(a) Verification of the workers' disabilities;
(b) Evidence of the productivity of each worker with a disability gathered on a continuing basis or at periodic intervals (not to exceed six months in the case of employees paid hourly wage rates);
(c) The prevailing wages paid workers not disabled for the job performed who are employed in industry in the vicinity for essentially the same type of work using similar methods and equipment as that used by each worker with disabilities employed under a special minimum wage certificate (see also § 525.10(b) and (d));
(d) The production standards and supporting documentation for nondisabled workers for each job being performed by workers with disabilities employed under special certificates; and
(e) The records required under all of the applicable provisions of part 516 of this title, except that any provision pertaining to homeworker handbooks shall not be applicable to workers with disabilities who are employed by a recognized nonprofit rehabilitation facility and working in or about a home, apartment, tenement, or room in a residential establishment. (See § 525.15) Records required by this section shall be maintained and preserved for the periods specified in part 516 of this title.

§ 525.17
Revocation of certificates.
(a) A special minimum wage certificate may be revoked for cause at any time. A certificate may be revoked:
(1) As of the date of issuance, if it is found that misrepresentations or false statements have been made in obtaining the certificate or in permitting a worker with a disability to be employed thereunder;
(2) As of the date of violation, if it is found that any of the provisions of FLSA or of the terms of the certificate have been violated; or
(3) As of the date of notice of revocation, if it is found that the certificate is no longer necessary in order to prevent curtailment of opportunities for employment, or that the requirements of these regulations other than those referred to in paragraph (a)(2) of this section have not been complied with.
(b) Except in cases of willfulness or those in which the public interest requires otherwise, before any certificate shall be revoked, facts or conduct which may warrant such action shall be called to the attention of the employer in writing and such employer shall be afforded an opportunity to demonstrate or achieve compliance with all legal requirements.
§ 525.18
Review.
Any person aggrieved by any action of the Administrator taken pursuant to this part may, within 60 days or such additional time as the Administrator may allow, file with the Administrator a petition for review. Such review, if granted, shall be made by the Administrator. Other interested persons, to the extent it is deemed appropriate, may be afforded an opportunity to present data and views.
§ 525.19
Investigations and hearings.
The Administrator may conduct an investigation, which may include a hearing, prior to taking any action pursuant to these regulations. To the extent it is deemed appropriate, the Administrator may provide an opportunity to other interested persons to present data and views. Proceedings initiated pursuant to this section are separate from those taken pursuant to FLSA section 14(c)(5) and § 525.22.
§ 525.20
Relation to other laws.
No provision of these regulations, or of any special minimum wage certificate issued thereunder, shall excuse noncompliance with any other Federal or State law or municipal ordinance establishing higher standards.
§ 525.21
Lowering of wage rates.
(a) No employer may reduce the minimum hourly wage rate, guaranteed by a special minimum wage certificate in effect on June 1, 1986, of any worker with disabilities from June 1, 1986 until May 31, 1988, without prior authorization of the Secretary.
(b) This provision applies to those workers with disabilities who were:
(1) Employed during the pay period which included June 1, 1986, even if no work was performed during that pay period; and
(2) Employed under a group or individual special minimum wage certificate which specified a minimum guaranteed rate, i.e., a special certificate issued under former section 14(c) (1) or (2)(b) of FLSA.
(c) In order to obtain authority to lower the wage rate of a worker with a disability to whom this provision applies to a rate below the certificate rate, the employer must submit information as prescribed under this section to the appropriate Regional Office. The burden of establishing the necessity of lowering the wage of a worker with a disability rests with the employer.
(d) In reviewing a request to lower a wage rate of a worker with a disability, documented evidence of the following will be considered:
(1) Any change in the worker's disabling condition which has a substantially negative impact on productive capacity;
(2) Any change in the type of work being performed in the facility which would affect the productivity of the worker with a disability or which would result in the application of a lower prevailing wage rate;
(3) Any change in general economic conditions in the locality in which the work is performed which results in lower prevailing wage rates.
(e) A wage rate may not be lowered until authorization is obtained.
§ 525.22
Employee's right to petition.
(a) Any employee receiving a special minimum wage at a rate specified pursuant to subsection 14(c) of FLSA or the parent or guardian of such an employee may petition the Secretary to obtain a review of such special minimum wage rate. No particular form of petition is required, except that a petition must be signed by the individual, or the parent or guardian of the individual, and should contain the name and address of the employee and the name and address of the employee's employer. A petition may be filed in person or by mail with the Administrator of the Wage and Hour Division, U.S. Department of Labor, Room S3502, 200 Constitution Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20210. The petitioner may be represented by counsel in any stage of such proceedings. Upon receipt, the petition shall be forwarded immediately to the Chief Administrative Law Judge.
(b) Upon receipt of a petition, the Chief Administrative Law Judge shall, within 10 days of the receipt of the petition by the Secretary, appoint an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) to hear the case. Upon receipt, the ALJ shall notify the employer named in the petition. The ALJ shall also notify the employee, the employer, the Administrator, and the Associate Solicitor for Fair Labor Standards of the time and place of the hearing. The date of the hearing shall be not more than 30 days after the assignment of the case to the ALJ. All the parties shall be given at least eight days' notice of such hearing. Because of the time constraints imposed by the statute, requests for postponement shall be granted only sparingly and for compelling reasons.
(c) Hearings held under this subpart shall be conducted, consistent with statutory time limitations, under the Department's rules of practice and procedure for administrative hearings found in 29 CFR part 18. There shall be a minimum of formality in the proceeding consistent with orderly procedure. Any employer who intends to participate in the proceeding shall provide to the ALJ, and shall serve on the petitioner and the Associate Solicitor for Fair Labor Standards no later than 15 days prior to the commencement of the hearing, or as soon as practical depending on when the notice of a hearing as required under paragraph (b) of this section was received, that documentary evidence pertaining to the employee or employees identified in the petition which is contained in the records required by § 525.16 (a), (b), (c) and (d). The Administrator shall be permitted to participate by counsel in the proceeding upon application.
(d) In determining whether any special minimum wage rate is justified, the ALJ shall consider, to the extent evidence is available, the productivity of the employee or employees identified in the petition and the conditions under which such productivity was measured, and the productivity of other employees performing work of essentially the same type and quality for other employers in the same vicinity and the conditions under which much productivity was mesured. In these proceedings, the burden of proof on all matters relating to the propriety of a wage at issue shall rest with the employer.
(e) The ALJ shall issue a decision within 30 days after the termination of the hearing and shall serve the decision on the Administrator and all interested parties in accordance with 29 CFR part 18. The decision shall contain appropriate findings and conclusions and an order. If the ALJ finds that the special minimum wage being paid or which has been paid is not justified, the order shall specify the lawful rate and the period of employment to which the rate is applicable. In the absence of evidence sufficient to support the conclusion that the proper wage should be less than the minimum wage, the ALJ shall order that the minimum wage be paid.
(f) Within 15 days after the date of the decision of the ALJ, the petitioner, the Administrator, or the employer who seeks review thereof may request review by the Administrative Review Board (Board). The request must be filed in accordance with 29 CFR part 26 and must include a copy of the ALJ's decision. Any other interested party may file a reply thereto with the Board and the Administrator within 5 working days of receipt of such request for review. The request for review and reply thereto shall be transmitted by the Administrator to all interested parties by a method guaranteeing one-day delivery.
(g) The decision of the ALJ shall be deemed to be final agency action 30 days after issuance thereof, unless within 30 days of the date of the decision the Board grants a request to review the decision. Where such request for review is granted, within 30 days after receipt of such request the Board shall review the record and shall either adopt the decision of the ALJ or issue exceptions. The decision of the ALJ, together with any exceptions issued by the Board, shall be deemed to be a final agency action, unless the Secretary exercises discretionary review over the decision and exceptions as provided in Secretary's Order 01-2020 (or any successor to that order).
(h) Within 30 days of issuance of the decision of the ALJ, ARB, or Secretary becoming a final action, any person adversely affected or aggrieved by such action may seek judicial review pursuant to chapter 7 of title 5, United States Code. The record of the case, including the record of proceedings before the ALJ, shall be transmitted by the Board to the appropriate court pursuant to the rules of such court.

§ 525.23
Work activities centers.
Nothing in these regulations shall be interpreted to prevent an employer from maintaining or establishing work
activities centers to provide therapeutic activities for workers with disabilities as long as the employer complies with the requirement of these regulations. Work activities centers shall include centers planned and designed to provide therapeutic activities for workers with severe disabilities affecting their productive capacity. Any establishment whose workers with disabilities are employed at special minimum wages must comply with the requirements of this part, regardless of the designation of such establishment.
§ 525.24
Advisory Committee on Special Minimum Wages.
The Advisory Committee on Special Minimum Wages, the members of which are appointed by the Secretary, shall advise and make recommendations to the Administrator concerning the administration and enforcement of these regulations and the need for amendments thereof and shall serve such other functions as may be desired by the Administrator.

§ 528.3
Withdrawal and annulment of certificates.
(a) An authorized representative may withdraw a certificate from any employer within that representative's region who, acting under color of any certificate or application for the employment of learners, handicapped workers, student workers, student learners, apprentices, messengers, or full-time students in agriculture, retail, or service establishments, or in institutions of higher education at subminimum wages under section 14 of the act, fails to comply with the limitations in such certificate or otherwise violates the act.
(b) An authorized representative may annul a certificate affected by mistake in its issuance if the employer knowingly induced or knowingly took advantage of the mistake. Where the employer did not knowingly induce the mistake but knowingly took advantage of it, a new certificate shall be issued by the authorized representative if, and on such terms as, such certificate would have been issued had there been no mistake limited in its term from the date of issuance to the date of annulment of the annulled certificate.
(c) A certificate may be withdrawn in the public interest by a representative authorized to issue such type of certificate whenever any part of the exemption it provides is no longer necessary to prevent curtailment of opportunities for employment. If appropriate, a more limited replacement certificate may be issued by the authorized representative.

[43 FR 28469, June 30, 1978]
§ 528.4
According opportunity to demonstrate or achieve compliance.
Prior to instituting proceedings for withdrawal of a certificate under paragraph (a) of § 528.3, except in cases of willfullness, an area director shall mail a letter to the employer setting forth alleged facts or conduct which may warrant withdrawal of the certificate, and fixing a time and a place for a conference at which the employer shall be accorded an opportunity to show that no cause for withdrawal under § 528.3(a) exists or that compliance has been achieved by paying wages improperly withheld and by taking steps adequate to insure that new cause for annulment or withdrawal will not occur. By written report to the appropriate authorized representative, a copy of which shall be mailed to the employer, the area director shall concisely summarize the conference and shall include conclusions as to whether the employer demonstrated or achieved compliance. If the authorized representative is satisfied that the employer either demonstrated or achieved such compliance, no proceedings shall be instituted under § 528.3(a) for the withdrawal of the certificate.
(Secretary's Order No. 16-75, dated Nov. 25, 1975 (40 FR 55913), Employment Standards Order 76-2, dated Feb. 23, 1976 (41 FR 9016))
[43 FR 28469, June 30, 1978]
§ 528.5
Proceedings for withdrawal or annulment.
The representative authorized to withdraw or annul a certificate under § 528.3 shall institute proceedings by a letter mailed to the employer and, where appropriate, to the apprenticeship agency (in the case of apprentice certificates) or the responsible school official (in the case of student-learner certificates), setting forth alleged facts which may warrant such annulment or withdrawal and advising the employer that such an annulment or withdrawal of the scope provided in § 528.7 will take effect at a time specified unless facts are presented which convince the authorized representative that such action should not be taken. The letter shall advise such person, agency, or official of the right to respond by mail or to appear by or with counsel or by other duly qualified representative at a specified time and place. If there is no timely objection to the withdrawal or annulment thus proposed, it shall be deemed effective according to the terms of the letter instituting the annulment or withdrawal proceeding without the necessity of any further action. If objection to the annulment or withdrawal as proposed is made within the specified time the further proceedings shall be as informal as practicable commensurate with orderly dispatch and fairness. Department of Labor investigation files or reports or portions thereof may be considered in such proceedings to the extent they are made available for examination during the proceedings. If objection to the proposed annulment or withdrawal is made by such specified time, the authorized representative shall, after considering all pertinent matters presented, mail a letter to the employer and, where appropriate, to the apprenticeship agency or the responsible school official, setting out that representative's findings of specific pertinent facts and conclusions and that representative's order concerning the
proposed annulment or withdrawal. In proceedings instituted for annulment, the order may provide for withdrawal instead of annulment if the proof warrants such withdrawal but fails to support adequately the annulment. Such an order shall be deemed issued and effective according to its terms when mailed.

§ 528.6
Review.
Any employer and, when appropriate, any apprenticeship agency or responsible school official, who expressed timely objection to the proposed action prior to issuance of an order of annulment or withdrawal may obtain review, limited to the question of whether the findings of fact support the order under the regulations in this part. Application for such review shall be in writing addressed to the Administrator and mailed within 15 days after the order is issued. The Administrator may affirm, modify, or reverse the order, or may remand it for further proceedings. The order under review shall not be stayed in effect pending such review. Any aggrieved person may obtain such review of an order entered in proceedings instituted under paragraph (c) of § 528.3.

§ 528.7
Effect of order of annulment or withdrawal.
Except as otherwise expressly provided in such order, any order of annulment or withdrawal under paragraph (a) or (b) of § 528.3 shall be effective to terminate all certifications to which the regulations in this part apply in effect at the establishment where the cause for withdrawal arose or where the annulled certificate had effect. After such annulment or withdrawal, such employer shall be ineligible to obtain or exercise the privileges granted in such a certificate until he satisfies the issuing officer that he will not again give cause for annulment or withdrawal if a certificate is issued.

Provided, however,
That nothing in this section shall relieve an employer from maintaining all other records required by part 516 of this chapter.

§ 530.102
Requests for employer certificates.

The notification shall be in writing and addressed to the Administrator, Wage and Hour Division, 200 Constitution Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20210.
[82 FR 2228, Jan. 9, 2017]
§ 530.103
Employer assurances.
In order to be granted a certificate authorizing the employment of industrial homeworkers, the employer must provide written assurances concerning the employment of homeworkers subject to section 11(d) of the Fair Labor Standards Act to the effect that:
(a) All homeworkers shall be paid in accordance with the monetary provisions of the Act.
(b) All homeworkers shall be employed in compliance with the child labor provisions contained in section 12 of the Act and regulations and orders issued pursuant to section 12. All homeworkers will be instructed not to permit minors to work in violation of such provisions.
(c) Records of hours worked and wages paid shall be maintained in accordance with section 11 of the Act and part 516 of this chapter.
(d) All homeworkers shall complete homeworker handbooks in accordance with § 516.31 of part 516.
(e) All homeworkers will be instructed to accurately record all hours worked, piece work information, and business-related expenses in the handbooks.

(i) With respect to jewelry manufacturing, no operations other than the stringing of beads and other jewelry and the carding and packaging of jewelry will be performed by homeworkers.
§ 530.104
Bonding or security payments.
(a) Where in the Administrator's judgment there is not sufficient reason to believe that the Act will be complied with or that money will be available if violations of the Act occur, the Administrator may condition issuance or renewal of a certificate to an employer upon the furnishing of a bond with a surety or sureties satisfactory to the Administrator.
(b) The Administrator shall condition issuance or reinstatement of a certificate to any employer whose application for a certificate had previously been denied, or whose certificate had been revoked, upon the furnishing of a bond.
(c) Any bond required by the Administrator under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section shall be in an amount determined by the Administrator, up to $2500 for each homeworker to be employed by such employer under the certificate. In lieu of a bond, the employer may furnish a cash payment of equal amount, to be held in a special deposit account by the Administrator for the period during which the certificate is in effect. Such bond, or cash payment, shall be subject to payment or forfeiture, in whole or in part, upon a final determination that the employer has failed to pay minimum wages or overtime compensation to homeworkers in accordance with the Act. Any sums thus paid or forfeited to the Administrator shall be disbursed to affected homeworkers in accordance with section 16(c) of the Act.
(d) At the Administrator's discretion, the obligation of a bond may be relieved, and any cash payment held as security in lieu thereof may be refunded (together with any interest accrued thereon), upon a subsequent determination that the employer is in compliance with the Act and that sufficient funds will be available to meet back wage payment obligations in the event of violations of the Act.
§ 530.105
Investigations.
Any employer in a restricted industry who requests certification to employ homeworkers will be investigated promptly after the issuance of the certificate by the Wage and Hour Division.

# Subpart C—Denial/Revocation of Homeworker Employer Certificates

# Source:
53 FR 45723, Nov. 10, 1988, unless otherwise noted.
§ 530.201
Conflict with State law.
No certificate will be issued pursuant to § 530.101 of subpart B above authorizing the employment of homeworkers in an industry in a State where the Governor (or authorized representative) has advised the Administrator of the Wage and Hour Division in writing that the employment of homeworkers in such industry, as defined in paragraphs (f) through (k) of § 530.1, is illegal by virtue of a State labor standards or health and safety law.
§ 530.202
Piece rates—work measurement.
(a) No certificate will be issued pursuant to § 530.101 of subpart B to an employer who pays homeworkers based on piece rates unless the employer establishes the piece rates for the different types of items produced using stop watch time studies or other work measurement methods. Documentation of the work measurements used to establish the piece rates, and the circumstances under which such measurements were conducted shall be retained for three years and made available on request to the Wage and Hour Division.
(b) The fact that an employer bases piece rates on work measurements which indicate that the homeworkers would receive at least the minimum wage at such piece rate(s) does not relieve the employer from the Act's requirement that
each
homeworker actually receive not less than the minimum wage for all hours worked.
§ 530.203
Outstanding violations and open investigations.
A homework certificate will not be issued or renewed by the Administrator if, within the previous three years, the Administrator has found and notified the applicant of a monetary violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act in an amount certain, or the Administrator has assessed a civil money penalty pursuant to subpart D of these regulations or part 579 of this chapter (child labor), and such amounts are unpaid, or if the applicant is the subject of a revocation proceeding at the time of the application for renewal, or the applicant is the subject of an open investigation.
§ 530.204
Discretionary denial or revocation.
Where the Administrator finds that the employment of homeworkers under
a certificate is likely to result in violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act, the regulations issued thereunder, or the assurances required by this part, the Administrator may deny or revoke the certificate.
§ 530.205
Mandatory denial or revocation.
The Administrator shall deny or revoke a certificate in accordance with the following standards and for the period specified in the standards:
(a)
Serious wage violations.
Upon a finding by the Administrator of a serious wage violation, a certificate shall be denied (including refusal to renew) or revoked for one year. A serious wage violation is defined as minimum wage or overtime pay violations of the Act totalling $10,000 or more with respect to homeworkers; or minimum wage violations where 10 percent or more of a certificate holder's homeworkers (but in all cases at least two homeworkers) failed to receive at least 80 percent of the minimum wage for all hours worked for 6 or more weeks in any 3 month period; or minimum wage or overtime pay violations affecting more than half of the homeworkers of the certificate holder for 6 or more weeks in any 3 month period. All other wage violations are deemed non-serious wage violations for purposes of this section.
(b)
Repeated wage violations.
For repeated wage violations found by the Administrator, a certificate shall be denied or revoked for one to three years, depending on the seriousness and frequency of the violations.
(c)
Child labor violations.
Upon a finding by the Administrator of a violation of the child labor provisions of section 12 of the Fair Labor Standards Act and the regulations at part 570 of this title, a certificate shall be denied or revoked for one year. Upon a second finding by the Administrator of such a violation, the certificate shall be denied or revoked for three years.
(d)
Failure to pay back wages or civil money penalties judged owing.
Upon the failure of a certificate holder to pay within 60 days back wages or civil money penalties finally judged by a court, administrative law judge or other appropriate authority, as the case may be, to be owed by the certificate holder, or agreed to be paid by the certificate holder, or within such longer period as may be specified in the final order or agreement, a certificate shall be denied or revoked for up to one year or for such period as such obligation shall remain unpaid if longer than one year.
(e)
Failure to cooperate in an investigation.
Where the Administrator finds obstruction of or other failure to cooperate in a Wage and Hour investigation by a certificate holder which impedes the investigation, the certificate shall be denied or revoked for a period of one to three years, depending on the circumstances. For purposes of this regulation, cooperation includes providing records upon request to Wage and Hour compliance officers, identifying homeworkers of the certificate holder, and encouraging homeworkers to make themselves available in connection with an investigation.
(f)
Serious recordkeeping violations.
Upon a finding by the Administrator that a certificate holder has engaged in a serious recordkeeping violation, the certificate may be revoked for up to one year. Upon a second finding by the Administrator of a serious recordkeeping violation, a certificate shall be denied or revoked for one to three years. A serious recordkeeping violation is defined as one where, either through errors in or omissions of required information, the name and current address of homeworkers and the data which is necessary for the accurate determination of hours worked by or wages paid to homeworkers or data necessary for the computation of wages owed to homeworkers is unavailable with respect to 10 percent or more of the homeworkers.
(g)
Deliberate misstatement in an application for a certificate or in other documents.
Upon a finding by the Administrator of a deliberate misstatement of a material fact in an application for a certificate, in payroll records, or in any other information submitted to the Wage and Hour Division or maintained by the employer pursuant to these regulations, the certificate shall be denied or revoked for one to three years.
(h)
Discrimination against a homeworker.
Upon a finding by the Administrator that a certificate holder has discharged or otherwise discriminated against a homeworker with respect to the homeworker's compensation or terms, conditions, or privileges of employment because the homeworker engaged in protected activity, the certificate shall be denied or revoked for three years. Protected activity is defined as: (1) Any complaint of a violation of the Act to the employer, the Department or other appropriate authority, or (2) any action which furthers the enforcement of or compliance with the Act, such as giving information to a Wage and Hour compliance officer.
§ 530.206
Special circumstances.
At the discretion of the Administrator, a certificate need not be denied or revoked pursuant to §§ 530.204 or 530.205 of this subpart if the Administrator finds all of the following:
(a) The certificate holder, despite the exercise of due care, did not know and did not have reason to know of the violations;
(b) All back wages and civil money penalties found by the Administrator to be owing by the certificate holder have been paid; and
(c) The certificate holder has taken appropriate steps to prevent recurrence of the violations.

# Subpart D—Civil Money Penalties

# Source:
53 FR 45724, Nov. 10, 1988, unless otherwise noted.
§ 530.301
General.
A system of civil money penalties is established to provide a remedy for any violation of the FLSA related to homework (except child labor violations, which are subject to civil money penalties pursuant to part 579 of this chapter), or for any violation of the homeworker regulations or employers' assurances pursuant to this part, which are not so serious as to warrant denial or revocation of a certificate. Accordingly, no civil money penalty will be assessed for conduct which serves as the basis of proposed denial or revocation of a certificate. (See subpart C of this part.) Civil money penalties will be assessed only against employers who are operating under a certificate or who are seeking certification.
§ 530.302
Amounts of civil money penalties.
(a) A civil money penalty, not to exceed $1,313 per affected homeworker for any one violation, may be assessed for any violation of the Act or of this part or of the assurances given in connection with the issuance of a certificate.
(b) The amount of civil money penalties shall be determined per affected homeworker within the limits set forth in the following schedule, except that no penalty shall be assessed in the case of violations which are deemed to be de minimis in nature:

§ 530.303
Considerations in determining amounts.
(a) In determining the amount of a penalty within any range, the Administrator shall take into account the presence or absence of circumstances such as the following:
(1) Good faith attempts to comply with the Act or regulations;
(2) Extent to which the violation is under the employer's control;
(3) Non-culpable ignorance of the requirements of the Act or regulations;
(4) False documents or representations; and
(5) Exercise of due care.
(b) An employer's financial inability to meet obligations under the Act shall not constitute a mitigating or extenuating circumstance.
(c) No civil money penalty shall be assessed against an employer, who applies for a certificate, solely for employing homeworkers, provided the employer is not currently under investigation by the Wage and Hour Division.
§ 530.304

The procedures and rules contained herein prescribe the administrative process which will be applied with respect to a determination to deny (including refusal to renew) or revoke a certificate and to a determination to assess civil money penalties. Special rules and procedures for the emergency revocation of certificates are prescribed in § 530.412 of this subpart.
§ 530.402
Notice of determination.
Whenever the Administrator determines to deny or revoke a certificate or determines to assess a civil money penalty, the person affected by such determination shall be notified of the determination in writing, by certified mail to the last known address. The notice required shall:

(e) Inform any affected persons that in the absence of a timely request for a hearing the determination of the Administrator shall become final and unappealable.
§ 530.403
Request for hearing.
(a) Except in the case of an emergency revocation under § 530.411 of this subpart, a request for an administrative hearing on a determination referred to in § 530.402 of this subpart shall be made in writing to the Administrator of the Wage and Hour Division, U.S. Department of Labor, Washington, DC 20210, and must be received no later than thirty (30) days after issuance of the notice referred to in § 530.402 of this subpart.
(b) No particular form is prescribed for any request for a hearing permitted by this part. However, any such request shall be typewritten or legibly written; specify the issue or issues stated in the notice of determination giving rise to such request; state the specific reason or reasons why the person requesting the hearing believes such determination is in error; be signed by the person making the request or by an authorized
representative of such person; and include the address at which such person or authorized representative desires to receive further communications relating thereto.

If the Administrative Law Judge finds that the Administrator has established by a preponderance of the evidence the factual basis for the determination to deny or revoke a certificate or to assess a civil money penalty, that determination shall be affirmed. The decision shall also include an appropriate order which may affirm, deny, reverse, or modify, in whole or in part, the determination of the Administrator. The reason or reasons for such order shall be stated in the decision.
(c) The decision shall be served on all parties and the Secretary.

§ 530.408
Notice of the Secretary to review decision.

[86 FR 1787, Jan. 11, 2021]
§ 530.410
Special procedures.
In a revocation proceeding pursuant to § 530.205(d) of subpart C of this part arising as a result of a certificate holder's failure to pay back wages or civil money penalties judged owing, the Administrator may file a motion for expedited decision, attaching to the notice, by affidavit or other means, evidence that a final order has been entered or agreement signed requiring respondent to pay back wages or civil money penalties and that the back wages or civil money penalties have not been paid. The respondent in the proceeding shall have 20 days in which to file a countering affidavit or other evidence. If no evidence countering the material assertions of the Administrator has been submitted within 20 days, the Administrative Law Judge shall, within 30 days thereafter, affirm the revocation or denial of the certificate. If the respondent does timely file such evidence, the Administrative Law Judge shall schedule a hearing pursuant to § 530.411(c) of this subpart and the case shall be subject to the expeditious procedures following therein.
§ 530.411
Emergency certificate revocation procedures.
(a) When the Administrator determines that immediate revocation of a homework certificate is necessary to safeguard the payment of minimum wages to homeworkers, a notice of proposed emergency revocation of a certificate shall be sent to the certificate holder pursuant to § 530.402 of this subpart setting forth reasons requiring emergency revocation of the certificate.
(b) If no request for a hearing pursuant to § 530.403 of this subpart is received within 20 days of the date of receipt of the notice by the certificate holder, the proposed revocation of the certificate shall become final.
(c) The Office of Administrative Law Judges shall notify the parties, electronically or at their last known address, of the date, time, and place for the hearing, which shall be no more than 60 days from the date of receipt of the request for the hearing. All parties shall be given at least 5 days' notice of such hearing. No requests for postponement shall be granted except for compelling reasons.
(d) The Administrative Law Judge shall issue a decision pursuant to § 530.406 of this subpart within 30 days after the termination of a proceeding at which evidence was submitted. The decision shall be served on all parties and the Administrative Review Board (“Board”) and shall constitute the final order of the Department of Labor unless the Board determines to review the decision.
(e) Any party desiring review of the decision of the Administrative Law Judge may petition the Secretary to review the decision of the Administrative Law Judge. To be effective, such petition must be received by the Secretary within 30 days of the date of the decision of the Administrative Law Judge. If the Secretary does not issue a notice accepting a petition for review within 15 days after receipt of a timely filing of the petition, or within 30 days of the date of the decision if no petition is filed, the decision of the Administrative Law Judge shall be deemed the final agency action.
(f) The Board's decision shall be issued within 60 days of the notice by the Board accepting the submission, and shall be served upon all parties and the Administrative Law Judge. The Board's decision is subject to discretionary review by the Secretary as provided in Secretary's Order 01-2020 (or any successor to that order).
[24 FR 729, Feb. 3, 1959, as amended at 86 FR 1787, Jan. 11, 2021]
§ 530.412
Alternative summary proceedings.
In lieu of an administrative hearing before an Administrative Law Judge under the above procedures, an applicant or certificate holder who does not dispute the factual findings of the Administrator may, within 30 days of the date of issuance of the notice of denial, revocation, or assessment (or within 20 days in the case of a notice of emergency revocation) petition the Administrator instead to reconsider the denial or revocation of the certificate or the assessment of civil money penalties. An applicant or certificate holder electing this informal procedure may appear before the Administrator in person, make a written submission to the Administrator, or both. Such reconsideration by the Administrator shall be available only upon waiver by the applicant or certificate holder of the formal hearing procedures provided by the above regulations.
§ 530.413
Certification of the record.
Upon receipt of a complaint seeking review of a final decision issued pursuant to this part filed in a United States District Court, after the administrative remedies have been exhausted, the Chief Administrative Law Judge shall promptly index, certify and file with the appropriate United States District Court, a full, true, and correct copy of the entire record, including the transcript of proceedings.
§ 530.414
Equal Access to Justice Act.
Proceedings under this part are not subject to the provisions of the Equal Access to Justice Act.

# Subpart A—Preliminary Matters
§ 531.1
Definitions.
(a)
Administrator
means the Administrator of the Wage and Hour Division or his authorized representative. The Secretary of Labor has delegated to the Administrator the functions vested in him under section 3(m) of the Act.
(b)
Act
means the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended.
§ 531.2
Purpose and scope.
(a) Section 3(m) of the Act defines the term “wage” to include the “reasonable cost”, as determined by the Secretary of Labor, to an employer of furnishing any employee with board, lodging, or other facilities, if such board, lodging, or other facilities are customarily furnished by the employer to his employees. In addition, section 3(m) gives the Secretary authority to determine the “fair value.” of such facilities on the basis of average cost to the employer or to groups of employers similarly situated, on average value to groups of employees, or other appropriate measures of “fair value.” Whenever so determined and when applicable and pertinent, the “fair value” of the facilities involved shall be includable as part of “wages” instead of the actual measure of the costs of those facilities. The section provides, however, that the cost of board, lodging, or other facilities shall not be included as part of “wages” if excluded therefrom by a bona fide collective bargaining agreement. Section 3(m) also provides a method for determining the wage of a tipped employee.
(b) This part 531 contains any determinations made as to the “reasonable cost” and “fair value” of board, lodging, or other facilities having general application, and describes the procedure whereby determinations having general or particular application may be made. The part also interprets generally the provisions of section 3(m) of the Act, including the term “tipped employee” as defined in section 3(t).

# Subpart B—Determinations of “Reasonable Cost” and “Fair Value”; Effects of Collective Bargaining Agreements
§ 531.3
General determinations of “reasonable cost.”
(a) The term
reasonable cost
as used in section 3(m) of the Act is hereby determined to be not more than the actual cost to the employer of the board, lodging, or other facilities customarily furnished by him to his employees.
(b)
Reasonable cost
does not include a profit to the employer or to any affiliated person.
(c) Except whenever any determination made under § 531.4 is applicable, the “reasonable cost” to the employer of furnishing the employee with board, lodging, or other facilities (including housing) is the cost of operation and maintenance including adequate depreciation plus a reasonable allowance (not more than 5
1/2
percent) for interest on the depreciated amount of capital invested by the employer:
Provided,
That if the total so computed is more than the fair rental value (or the fair price of the commodities or facilities offered for sale), the fair rental value (or the fair price of the commodities or facilities offered for sale) shall be the reasonable cost. The cost of operation and maintenance, the rate of depreciation, and the depreciated amount of capital invested by the employer shall be those arrived at under good accounting practices. As used in this paragraph, the term “good accounting practices” does not include accounting practices which have been rejected by the Internal Revenue Service for tax purposes, and the term “depreciation” includes obsolescence.
(d)(1) The cost of furnishing “facilities” found by the Administrator to be primarily for the benefit or convenience of the employer will not be recognized as reasonable and may not therefore be included in computing wages.
(2) The following is a list of facilities found by the Administrator to be primarily for the benefit of convenience of the employer. The list is intended to be illustrative rather than exclusive: (i) Tools of the trade and other materials and services incidental to carrying on the employer's business; (ii) the cost of any construction by and for the employer; (iii) the cost of uniforms and of their laundering, where the nature of the business requires the employee to wear a uniform.
§ 531.4
Making determinations of “reasonable cost.”
(a)
Procedure.
Upon his own motion or upon the petition of any interested person, the Administrator may determine generally or particularly the “reasonable cost” to an employer of furnishing any employee with board, lodging, or other facilities, if such board, lodging, or other facilities are customarily furnished by the employer to his employees. Notice of proposed determination shall be published in the
Federal Register,
and interested persons shall be afforded an opportunity to participate through submission of written data, views, or arguments. Such notice shall indicate whether or not an opportunity will be afforded to make oral presentations. Whenever the latter opportunity is afforded, the notice shall specify the time and place of any hearing and the rules governing such proceedings. Consideration shall be given to all relevant matter presented in the adoption of any rule.
(b)
Contents of petitions submitted by interested persons.
Any petition by an employee or an authorized representative of employees, an employer or group of employers, or other interested persons for a determination of “reasonable cost” shall include the following information:
(1) The name and location of the employer's or employers' place or places of business;
(2) A detailed description of the board, lodging, or other facilities furnished by the employer or employers, whether or not these facilities are customarily furnished by the employer or employers, and whether or not they are alleged to constitute “wages”;
(3) The charges or deductions made for the facility or facilities by the employer or employers;
(4) When the actual cost of the facility or facilities is known an itemized statement of such cost to the employer or employers of the furnished facility or facilities;
(5) The cash wages paid;
(6) The reason or reasons for which the determination is requested, including any reason or reasons why the determinations in § 531.3 should not apply; and
(7) Whether an opportunity to make an oral presentation is requested; and if it is requested, the inclusion of a summary of any expected presentation.
§ 531.5
Making determinations of “fair value.”
(a)
Procedure.
The procedures governing the making of determinations of the “fair value” of board, lodging, or other facilities for defined classes of employees and in defined areas under section 3(m) of the Act shall be the same as that prescribed in § 531.4 with respect to determinations of “reasonable cost.”
(b)
Petitions of interested persons.
Any petition by an employee or an authorized representative of employees, an employer or group of employers, or other interested persons for a determination of “fair value” under section 3(m) of the Act shall contain the information required under paragraph (b) of § 531.4, and in addition, to the extent possible, the following:
(1) A proposed definition of the class or classes of employees involved;
(2) A proposed definition of the area to which any requested determination would apply;
(3) Any measure of “fair value” of the furnished facilities which may be appropriate in addition to the cost of such facilities.
§ 531.6
Effects of collective bargaining agreements.
(a) The cost of board, lodging, or other facilities shall not be included as part of the wage paid to any employee to the extent it is excluded therefrom under the terms of a bona fide collective bargaining agreement applicable to the particular employee.
(b) A collective bargaining agreement shall be deemed to be “bona fide” when it is made with a labor organization which has been certified pursuant to the provision of section 7(b)(1) or 7(b)(2) of the Act by the National Labor Relations Board, or which is the certified representative of the employees under the provisions of the National Labor Relations Act, as amended, or the Railway Labor Act, as amended.
(c) Collective bargaining agreements made with representatives who have not been so certified will be ruled on individually upon submission to the Administrator.
§ 531.7
[Reserved]

# Subpart C—Interpretations
§ 531.25
Introductory statement.
(a) The ultimate decisions on interpretations of the Act are made by the courts (
Mitchell
v.
Zachry,
362 U.S. 310;
Kirschbaum
v.
Walling,
316 U.S. 517). Court decisions supporting interpretations contained in this subpart are cited where it is believed they may be helpful. On matters which have not been determined by the courts, it is necessary for the Secretary of Labor and the Administrator to reach conclusions as to the meaning and the application of provisions of the law in order to carry out their responsibilities of administration and enforcement (
Skidmore
v.
Swift,
323 U.S. 134). In order that these positions may be made known to persons who may be affected by them, official interpretations are issued by the Administrator on the advice of the Solicitor of Labor, as authorized by the Secretary (Reorganization Plan 6 of 1950, 64 Stat. 1263; Gen. Order 45A, May 24, 1950, 15 FR 3290). The Supreme Court has recognized that such interpretations of this Act “provide a practical guide to employers and employees as to how the office representing the public interest in its enforcement will seek to apply it” and “constitute a body of experience and informed judgment to which courts and litigants may properly resort for guidance.” Further, as stated by the Court: “Good administration of the Act and good judicial administration alike require that the standards of public enforcement and those for determining private rights shall be at variance only where justified by very good reasons.” (
Skidmore
v.
Swift,
323 U.S. 134.)
(b) The interpretations of the law contained in this subpart are official interpretations of the Department of Labor with respect to the application under described circumstances of the provisions of law which they discuss. The interpretations indicate, with respect to the methods of paying the compensation required by sections 6 and 7 and the application thereto of the provisions of section 3(m) of the Act, the construction of the law which the Secretary of Labor and the Administrator believe to be correct and which will guide them in the performance of their administrative duties under the Act unless and until they are otherwise directed by authoritative decisions of the courts or conclude, upon reexamination of an interpretation, that it is incorrect. Reliance may be placed upon the interpretations as provided in section 10 of the Portal-to-Portal Act (29 U.S.C. 259) so long as they remain effective and are not modified, amended, rescinded, or determined by judicial authority to be incorrect. For discussion of section 10 of the Portal-to-Portal Act, see part 790 of this chapter.
§ 531.26
Relation to other laws.
Various Federal, State, and local legislation requires the payment of wages in cash; prohibits or regulates the issuance of scrip, tokens, credit cards, “dope checks” or coupons; prevents or restricts payment of wages in services or facilities; controls company stores and commissaries; outlaws “kickbacks”; restrains assignment and garnishment of wages; and generally governs the calculation of wages and the frequency and manner of paying them. Where such legislation is applicable and does not contravene the requirements of the Act, nothing in the Act, the regulations, or the interpretations announced by the Administrator should be taken to override or nullify the provisions of these laws.

# How Payments May Be Made
§ 531.27
Payment in cash or its equivalent required.
(a) Standing alone, sections 6 and 7 of the Act require payments of the prescribed wages, including overtime compensation, in cash or negotiable instrument payable at par. Section 3(m) provides, however, for the inclusion in the “wage” paid to any employee, under the conditions which it prescribes of the “reasonable cost,” or “fair value” as determined by the Secretary, of furnishing such employee with board, lodging, or other facilities. In addition, section 3(m) provides that a tipped employee's wages may consist in part of tips. It is section 3(m) which permits and governs the payment of wages in other than cash.
(b) It should not be assumed that because the term “wage” does not appear in section 7, all overtime compensation must be paid in cash and may not be paid in board, lodging, or other facilities. There appears to be no evidence in either the statute or its legislative history which demonstrates the intention to provide one rule for the payment of the minimum wage and another rule for the payment of overtime compensation. The principles stated in paragraph (a) of this section are considered equally applicable to payment of the minimum hourly wage required by section 6 or of the wages required by the equal pay provisions of section 6(d), and to payment, when overtime is worked, of the compensation required by section 7. Thus, in determining whether he has met the minimum wage and overtime requirements of the Act, the employer may credit himself with the reasonable cost to himself of board, lodging, or other facilities customarily furnished by him to his employees when the cost of such board, lodging, or other facilities is not excluded from wages paid to such employees under the term of a bona fide collective bargaining agreement applicable to the employees. Unless the context clearly indicates otherwise, the term “wage” is used in this part to designate the amount due under either section 6 or section 7 without distinction. It should be remembered, however, that the wage paid for a job, within the meaning of the equal pay provisions of section 6(d), may include remuneration for employment which is not included in the employee's regular rate of pay under section 7(e) of the act or is not allocable to compensation for hours of work required by the minimum wage provisions of section 6. Reference should be made to parts 778 and 800 of this chapter for a more detailed discussion of the applicable principles.
(c) Tips may be credited or offset against the wages payable under the Act in certain circumstances, as discussed later in this subpart. See also the recordkeeping requirements contained in part 516 of this chapter.
§ 531.28
Restrictions applicable where payment is not in cash or its equivalent.
It appears to have been the clear intention of Congress to protect the basic minimum wage and overtime compensation required to be paid to the employee by sections 6 and 7 of the Act from profiteering or manipulation by the employer in dealings with the employee. Section 3(m) of the Act and subpart B of this part accordingly prescribe certain limitations and safeguards which control the payment of wages in other than cash or its equivalent. (Special recordkeeping requirements must also be met. These are contained in part 516 of this chapter.) These provisions, it should be emphasized, do not prohibit payment of wages in facilities furnished either as additions to a stipulated wage or as items for which deductions from the stipulated wage will be made; they prohibit only the use of such a medium of payment to avoid the obligation imposed by sections 6 and 7.
§ 531.29
Board, lodging, or other facilities.
Section 3(m) applies to both of the following situations: (a) Where board, lodging, or other facilities are furnished in addition to a stipulated wage; and (b) where charges for board, lodging, or other facilities are deducted from a stipulated wage. The use of the word “furnishing” and the legislative history of section 3(m) clearly indicate that this section was intended to apply
to all facilities furnished by the employer as compensation to the employee, regardless of whether the employer calculates charges for such facilities as additions to or deductions from wages.
§ 531.30
“Furnished” to the employee.
The reasonable cost of board, lodging, or other facilities may be considered as part of the wage paid an employee only where customarily “furnished” to the employee. Not only must the employee receive the benefits of the facility for which he is charged, but it is essential that his acceptance of the facility be voluntary and uncoerced. See
Williams
v.
Atlantic Coast Line Railroad Co.
(E.D.N.C.). 1 W.H. Cases 289.
§ 531.31
“Customarily” furnished.
The reasonable cost of board, lodging, or other facilities may be considered as part of the wage paid an employee only where “customarily” furnished to the employee. Where such facilities are “furnished” to the employee, it will be considered a sufficient satisfaction of this requirement if the facilities are furnished regularly by the employer to his employees or if the same or similar facilities are customarily furnished by other employees engaged in the same or similar trade, business, or occupation in the same or similar communities. See
Walling
v.
Alaska Pacific Consolidated Mining Co.,
152 F. (2d) 812 (C.A. 9), cert. denied, 327 U.S. 803;
Southern Pacific Co.
v.
Joint Council
(C.A. 9) 7 W.H. Cases 536. Facilities furnished in violation of any Federal, State, or local law, ordinance or prohibition will not be considered facilities “customarily” furnished.
§ 531.32
“Other facilities.”
(a) “Other facilities,” as used in this section, must be something like board or lodging. The following items have been deemed to be within the meaning of the term: Meals furnished at company restaurants or cafeterias or by hospitals, hotels, or restaurants to their employees; meals, dormitory rooms, and tuition furnished by a college to its student employees; housing furnished for dwelling purposes; general merchandise furnished at company stores and commissaries (including articles of food, clothing, and household effects); fuel (including coal, kerosene, firewood, and lumber slabs), electricity, water, and gas furnished for the noncommercial personal use of the employee; transportation furnished employees between their homes and work where the travel time does not constitute hours worked compensable under the Act and the transportation is not an incident of and necessary to the employment.
(b) Shares of capital stock in an employer company, representing only a contingent proprietary right to participate in profits and losses or in the assets of the company at some future dissolution date, do not appear to be “facilities” within the meaning of the section.
(c) It should also be noted that under § 531.3(d)(1), the cost of furnishing “facilities” which are primarily for the benefit or convenience of the employer will not be recognized as reasonable and may not therefore be included in computing wages. Items in addition to those set forth in § 531.3 which have been held to be primarily for the benefit or convenience of the employer and are not therefore to be considered “facilities” within the meaning of section 3(m) include: Safety caps, explosives, and miners' lamps (in the mining industry); electric power (used for commercial production in the interest of the employer); company police and guard protection; taxes and insurance on the employer's buildings which are not used for lodgings furnished to the employee; “dues” to chambers of commerce and other organizations used, for example, to repay subsidies given to the employer to locate his factory in a particular community; transportation charges where such transportation is an incident of and necessary to the employment (as in the case of maintenance-of-way employees of a railroad); charges for rental of uniforms where the nature of the business requires the employee to wear a uniform; medical services and hospitalization which the employer is bound to furnish under workmen's compensation acts, or similar Federal, State, or local law. On the other hand, meals are always regarded
as primarily for the benefit and convenience of the employee. For a discussion of reimbursement for expenses such as “supper money,” “travel expenses,” etc., see § 778.217 of this chapter.
§ 531.33
“Reasonable cost”; “fair value.”
(a) Section 3(m) directs the Administrator to determine “the reasonable cost * * * to the employer of furnishing * * * facilities” to the employee, and in addition it authorizes him to determine “the fair value” of such facilities for defined classes of employees and in defined areas, which may be used in lieu of the actual measure of the cost of such facilities in ascertaining the “wages” paid to any employee. Subpart B contains three methods whereby an employer may ascertain whether any furnished facilities are a part of “wages” within the meaning of section 3(m): (1) An employer may calculate the “reasonable cost” of facilities in accordance with the requirements set forth in § 531.3; (2) an employer may request that a determination of “reasonable cost” be made, including a determination having particular application; and (3) an employer may request that a determination of “fair value” of the furnished facilities be made to be used in lieu of the actual measure of the cost of the furnished facilities in assessing the “wages” paid to an employee.
(b) “Reasonable cost,” as determined in § 531.3 “does not include a profit to the employer or to any affiliated person.” Although the question of affiliation is one of fact, where any of the following persons operate company stores or commissaries or furnish lodging or other facilities they will normally be deemed “affiliated persons” within the meaning of the regulations: (1) A spouse, child, parent, or other close relative of the employer; (2) a partner, officer, or employee in the employer company or firm; (3) a parent, subsidiary, or otherwise closely connected corporation; and (4) an agent of the employer.
§ 531.34
Payment in scrip or similar medium not authorized.
Scrip, tokens, credit cards, “dope checks,” coupons, and similar devices are not proper mediums of payment under the Act. They are neither cash nor “other facilities” within the meaning of section 3(m). However, the use of such devices for the purpose of conveniently and accurately measuring wages earned or facilities furnished during a single pay period is not prohibited. Piecework earnings, for example, may be calculated by issuing tokens (representing a fixed amount of work performed) to the employee, which are redeemed at the end of the pay period for cash. The tokens do not discharge the obligation of the employer to pay wages, but they may enable him to determine the amount of cash which is due to the employee. Similarly, board, lodging, or other facilities may be furnished during the pay period in exchange for scrip or coupons issued prior to the end of the pay period. The reasonable cost of furnishing such facilities may be included as part of the wage, since payment is being made not in scrip but in facilities furnished under the requirements of section 3(m). But the employer may not credit himself with “unused scrip” or “coupons outstanding” on the pay day in determining whether he has met the requirements of the Act because such scrip or coupons have not been redeemed for cash or facilities within the pay period. Similarly, the employee cannot be charged with the loss or destruction of scrip or tokens.
§ 531.35
“Free and clear” payment; “kickbacks.”
Whether in cash or in facilities, “wages” cannot be considered to have been paid by the employer and received by the employee unless they are paid finally and unconditionally or “free and clear.” The wage requirements of the Act will not be met where the employee “kicks-back” directly or indirectly to the employer or to another person for the employer's benefit the whole or part of the wage delivered to the employee. This is true whether the “kick-back” is made in cash or in other than cash. For example, if it is a requirement of the employer that the
employee must provide tools of the trade which will be used in or are specifically required for the performance of the employer's particular work, there would be a violation of the Act in any workweek when the cost of such tools purchased by the employee cuts into the minimum or overtime wages required to be paid him under the Act. See also in this connection, § 531.32(c).

# Payment Where Additions or Deductions Are Involved
§ 531.36
Nonovertime workweeks.
(a) When no overtime is worked by the employees, section 3(m) and this part apply only to the applicable minimum wage for all hours worked. To illustrate, where an employee works 40 hours a week at a cash wage rate of at least the applicable minimum wage and is paid that amount free and clear at the end of the workweek, and in addition is furnished facilities, no consideration need be given to the question of whether such facilities meet the requirements of section 3(m) and this part, since the employee has received in cash the applicable minimum wage for all hours worked. Similarly, where an employee is employed at a rate in excess of the applicable minimum wage and during a particular workweek works 40 hours for which the employee receives at least the minimum wage free and clear, the employer having deducted from wages for facilities furnished, whether such deduction meets the requirement of section 3(m) and subpart B of this part need not be considered, since the employee is still receiving, after the deduction has been made, a cash wage of at least the minimum wage for each hour worked. Deductions for board, lodging, or other facilities may be made in nonovertime workweeks even if they reduce the cash wage below the minimum wage, provided the prices charged do not exceed the “reasonable cost” of such facilities. When such items are furnished the employee at a profit, the deductions from wages in weeks in which no overtime is worked are considered to be illegal only to the extent that the profit reduces the wage (which includes the “reasonable cost” of the facilities) below the required minimum wage. Facilities must be measured by the requirements of section 3(m) and this part to determine if the employee has received the applicable minimum wage in cash or in facilities which may be legitimately included in “wages” payable under the Act.
(b) Deductions for articles such as tools, miners' lamps, dynamite caps, and other items which do not constitute “board, lodging, or other facilities” may likewise be made in nonovertime workweeks if the employee nevertheless received the required minimum wage in cash free and clear; but to the extent that they reduce the wages of the employee in any such workweek below the minimum required by the Act, they are illegal.
[32 FR 13575, Sept. 28, 1967, as amended at 76 FR 18855, Apr. 5, 2011]
§ 531.37
Overtime workweeks.
(a) Section 7 requires that the employee receive compensation for overtime hours at “a rate of not less than one and one-half times the regular rate at which he is employed.” When overtime is worked by an employee who receives the whole or part of his or her wage in facilities and it becomes necessary to determine the portion of wages represented by facilities, all such facilities must be measured by the requirements of section 3(m) and subpart B of this part. It is the Administrator's opinion that deductions may be made, however, on the same basis in an overtime workweek as in nonovertime workweeks (
see
§ 531.36), if their purpose and effect are not to evade the overtime requirements of the Act or other law, providing the amount deducted does not exceed the amount which could be deducted if the employee had only worked the maximum number of straight-time hours during the workweek. Deductions in excess of this amount for such articles as tools or other articles which are not “facilities” within the meaning of the Act are illegal in overtime workweeks as well as in nonovertime workweeks. There is no limit on the amount which may be deducted for “board, lodging, or other facilities” in overtime workweeks (as in workweeks when no overtime is
worked), provided that these deductions are made only for the “reasonable cost” of the items furnished. These principles assume a situation where bona fide deductions are made for particular items in accordance with the agreement or understanding of the parties. If the situation is solely one of refusal or failure to pay the full amount of wages required by section 7, these principles have no application. Deductions made only in overtime workweeks, or increases in the prices charged for articles or services during overtime workweeks will be scrutinized to determine whether they are manipulations to evade the overtime requirements of the Act.
(b) Where deductions are made from the stipulated wage of an employee, the regular rate of pay is arrived at on the basis of the stipulated wage before any deductions have been made. Where board, lodging, or other facilities are customarily furnished as additions to a cash wage, the reasonable cost of the facilities to the employer must be considered as part of the employee's regular rate of pay.

# Payments Made to Persons Other Than Employees
§ 531.38
Amounts deducted for taxes.
Taxes which are assessed against the employee and which are collected by the employer and forwarded to the appropriate governmental agency may be included as “wages” although they do not technically constitute “board, lodging, or other facilities” within the meaning of section 3(m). This principle is applicable to the employee's share of social security and State unemployment insurance taxes, as well as other Federal, State, or local taxes, levies, and assessments. No deduction may be made for any tax or share of a tax which the law requires to be borne by the employer.
§ 531.39
Payments to third persons pursuant to court order.
(a) Where an employer is legally obliged, as by order of a court of competent and appropriate jurisdiction, to pay a sum for the benefit or credit of the employee to a creditor of the employee, trustee, or other third party, under garnishment, wage attachment, trustee process, or bankruptcy proceeding, deduction from wages of the actual sum so paid is not prohibited:
Provided,
That neither the employer nor any person acting in his behalf or interest derives any profit or benefit from the transaction. In such case, payment to the third person for the benefit and credit of the employee will be considered equivalent, for the purposes of the Act, to payment to the employee.
(b) The amount of any individual's earnings withheld by means of any legal or equitable procedure for the payment of any debt may not exceed the restriction imposed by section 303(a), title III, Restriction on Garnishment, of the Consumer Credit Protection Act (82 Stat. 163, 164; 15 U.S.C. 1671
et seq.
). The application of title III is discussed in part 870 of this chapter. When the payment to a third person of moneys withheld pursuant to a court order under which the withholdings exceeds that permitted by the CCPA, the excess will not be considered equivalent to payment of wages to the employee for purpose of the Fair Labor Standards Act.
[35 FR 10757, July 2, 1970]
§ 531.40
Payments to employee's assignee.
(a) Where an employer is directed by a voluntary assignment or order of his employee to pay a sum for the benefit of the employee to a creditor, donee, or other third party, deduction from wages of the actual sum so paid is not prohibited:
Provided,
That neither the employer nor any person acting in his behalf or interest, directly or indirectly, derives any profit or benefit from the transaction. In such case, payment to the third person for the benefit and credit of the employee will be considered equivalent, for purposes of the Act, to payment to the employee.
(b) No payment by the employer to a third party will be recognized as a valid payment of compensation required under the Act where it appears
that such payment was part of a plan or arrangement to evade or circumvent the requirements of section 3(m) or subpart B of this part. For the protection of both employer and employee it is suggested that full and adequate record of all assignments and orders be kept and preserved and that provisions of the applicable State law with respect to signing, sealing, witnessing, and delivery be observed.
(c) Under the principles stated in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, employers have been permitted to treat as payments to employees for purposes of the Act sums paid at the employees' direction to third persons for the following purposes: Sums paid, as authorized by the employee, for the purchase in his behalf of U.S. savings stamps or U.S. savings bonds; union dues paid pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement with bona fide representatives of the employees and as permitted by law; employees' store accounts with merchants wholly independent of the employer; insurance premiums (paid to independent insurance companies where the employer is under no obligation to supply the insurance and derives, directly or indirectly, no benefit or profit from it); voluntary contributions to churches and charitable, fraternal, athletic, and social organizations, or societies from which the employer receives no profit or benefit directly or indirectly.

# Subpart D—Tipped Employees
§ 531.50
Statutory provisions with respect to tipped employees.
(a) With respect to tipped employees, section 3(m)(2)(A) provides that, in determining the wage an employer is required to pay a tipped employee, the amount paid such employee by the employee's employer shall be an amount equal to—
(1) The cash wage paid such employee which for purposes of such determination shall not be less than the cash wage required to be paid such an employee on August 20, 1996 [
i.e.,
$2.13]; and
(2) An additional amount on account of the tips received by such employee which amount is equal to the difference between the wage specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section and section 6(a)(1) of the Act.
(b) Section 3(m)(2)(A) also provides that an employer that takes a tip credit against its minimum wage obligations to its tipped employees must inform those employees of the provisions of that subsection, and that the employees must retain all of their tips, although the employer may require those employees to participate in a tip pool with other tipped employees that customarily and regularly receive tips.
(c) Section 3(m)(2)(B) provides that an employer may not keep tips received by its employees for any purposes, including allowing managers and supervisors to keep any portion of employees' tips, regardless of whether the employer takes a tip credit under section 3(m)(2)(A).
(d) “Tipped employee” is defined in section 3(t) of the Act as any employee engaged in an occupation in which he or she customarily and regularly receives more than $30 a month in tips.
[85 FR 86789, Dec. 30, 2020]
§ 531.51
Conditions for taking tip credits in making wage payments.
The wage credit permitted on account of tips under section 3(m)(2)(A) may be taken only with respect to wage payments made under the Act to those employees whose occupations in the workweeks for which such payments are made are those of “tipped employees” as defined in section 3(t). Under section 3(t), the occupation of the employee must be one “in which he customarily and regularly receives more than $30 a month in tips.” To determine whether a tip credit may be taken in paying wages to a particular employee it is necessary to know what payments constitute “tips,” whether the employee receives “more than $30 a month” in such payments in the occupation in which he is engaged, and whether in such occupation he receives these payments in such amount “customarily and regularly.” The principles applicable to a resolution of these questions are discussed in the following sections.
[32 FR 13575, Sept. 28, 1967, as amended at 76 FR 18855, Apr. 5, 2011; 85 FR 86789, Dec. 30, 2020]
§ 531.52
General restrictions on an employer's use of its employees' tips.
(a) A tip is a sum presented by a customer as a gift or gratuity in recognition of some service performed for the customer. It is to be distinguished from payment of a charge, if any, made for the service. Whether a tip is to be given, and its amount, are matters determined solely by the customer. An employer that takes a tip credit against its minimum wage obligations is prohibited from using an employee's tips for any reason other than that which is statutorily permitted in section 3(m)(2)(A): As a credit against its minimum wage obligations to the employee, or in furtherance of a tip pool limited to employees who customarily and regularly receive tips. Only tips actually received by an employee as money belonging to the employee may be counted in determining whether the person is a “tipped employee” within the meaning of the Act and in applying the provisions of section 3(m)(2)(A) which govern wage credits for tips.
(b) Section 3(m)(2)(B) of the Act provides that an employer may not keep tips received by its employees for any purposes, regardless of whether the employer takes a tip credit.
(1) An employer may exert control over an employee's tips only to distribute tips to the employee who received them, require employees to share tips with other employees in compliance with § 531.54, or, where the employer facilitates tip pooling by collecting and redistributing employees' tips, distribute tips to employees in a tip pool in compliance with § 531.54.
(2) An employer may not allow managers and supervisors to keep any portion of an employee's tips, regardless of whether the employer takes a tip credit. A manager or supervisor may keep tips that he or she receives directly from customers based on the service that he or she directly and solely provides. For purposes of section 3(m)(2)(B), the term “manager” or “supervisor” shall mean any employee whose duties match those of an executive employee as described in § 541.100(a)(2) through (4) or § 541.101 of this chapter.
[85 FR 86789, Dec. 30, 2020, as amended at 86 FR 52986, Sept. 24, 2021]
§ 531.53
Payments which constitute tips.
In addition to cash sums presented by customers which an employee keeps as his own, tips received by an employee include, within the meaning of the Act, amounts paid by bank check or other negotiable instrument payble at par and amounts transferred by the employer to the employee pursuant to directions from credit customers who designate amounts to be added to their bills as tips. Special gifts in forms other than money or its equivalent as above described such as theater tickets, passes, or merchandise, are not counted as tips received by the employee for purposes of the Act.
§ 531.54
Tip pooling.
(a)
Monies counted as tips.
Where employees practice tip splitting, as where waiters give a portion of their tips to the busser, both the amounts retained by the waiters and those given the bussers are considered tips of the individuals who retain them, in applying the provisions of sections 3(m)(2)(A) and 3(t). Similarly, where an accounting is made to an employer for his or her information only or in furtherance of a pooling arrangement whereby the employer redistributes the tips to the employees upon some basis to which they have mutually agreed among themselves, the amounts received and retained by each individual as his or her own are counted as his or her tips for purposes of the Act. Section 3(m)(2)(A) does not impose a maximum contribution percentage on mandatory tip pools.
(b)
Prohibition against keeping tips
—(1)
Meaning of “keep.”
Section 3(m)(2)(B)'s prohibition against keeping tips applies regardless of whether an employer takes a tip credit. Section 3(m)(2)(B) expressly prohibits employers from requiring employees to share tips with managers or supervisors, as defined in § 531.52(b)(2), or employers, as defined in 29 U.S.C. 203(d). An employer does not violate section 3(m)(2)(B)'s prohibition against keeping tips if it requires employees to share tips with other employees who are eligible to receive tips.
(2)
Full and prompt distribution of tips.
An employer that facilitates tip pooling by collecting and redistributing
employees' tips does not violate section 3(m)(2)(B)'s prohibition against keeping tips if it fully distributes any tips the employer collects no later than the regular payday for the workweek in which the tips were collected, or when the pay period covers more than a single workweek, the regular payday for the period in which the workweek ends. To the extent that it is not possible for an employer to ascertain the amount of tips that have been received or how tips should be distributed prior to processing payroll, tips must be distributed to employees as soon as practicable after the regular payday.
(c)
Employers that take a section 3(m)(2)(A) tip credit.
When an employer takes a tip credit pursuant to section 3(m)(2)(A):
(1) The employer may require an employee for whom the employer takes a tip credit to contribute tips to a tip pool only if it is limited to employees who customarily and regularly receive tips; and
(2) The employer must notify its employees of any required tip pool contribution amount, may only take a tip credit for the amount of tips each employee ultimately receives, and may not retain any of the employees' tips for any other purpose.
(3) An employer may not receive tips from such a tip pool and may not allow managers and supervisors to receive tips from the tip pool.
(d)
Employers that do not take a section 3(m)(2)(A) tip credit.
An employer that pays its tipped employees the full minimum wage and does not take a tip credit may impose a tip pooling arrangement that includes dishwashers, cooks, or other employees in the establishment who are not employed in an occupation in which employees customarily and regularly receive tips. An employer may not receive tips from such a tip pool and may not allow supervisors and managers to receive tips from the tip pool.
[85 FR 86789, Dec. 30, 2020, as amended at 86 FR 52986, Sept. 24, 2021]
§ 531.55
Examples of amounts not received as tips.
(a) A compulsory charge for service, such as 15 percent of the amount of the bill, imposed on a customer by an employer's establishment, is not a tip and, even if distributed by the employer to its employees, cannot be counted as a tip received in applying the provisions of sections 3(m)(2)(A) and 3(t). Similarly, where negotiations between a hotel and a customer for banquet facilities include amounts for distribution to employees of the hotel, the amounts so distributed are not counted as tips received.
(b) As stated above, service charges and other similar sums which become part of the employer's gross receipts are not tips for the purposes of the Act. Where such sums are distributed by the employer to its employees, however, they may be used in their entirety to satisfy the monetary requirements of the Act.
[76 FR 18856, Apr. 5, 2011, as amended at 85 FR 86750, Dec. 30, 2020]
§ 531.56
“More than $30 a month in tips.”
(a)
In general.
An employee who receives tips, within the meaning of the Act, is a “tipped employee” under the definition in section 3(t) when, in the occupation in which he is engaged, the amounts he receives as tips customarily and regularly total “more than $30 a month.” An employee employed in an occupation in which the tips he or she receives meet the minimum standard in the preceding sentence is a “tipped employee” for whom the wage credit provided by section 3(m)(2)(A) may be taken in computing the compensation due him or her under the Act for employment in such occupation, whether he or she is employed in it full time or part time. An employee employed full time or part time in an occupation in which he or she does not receive more than $30 a month in tips customarily and regularly is not a “tipped employee” within the meaning of the Act and must receive the full compensation required by the provisions of the Act in cash or allowable facilities without any deduction for tips received under the provisions of section 3(m)(2)(A).
(b)
Month.
The definition of tipped employee does not require that the calendar month be used in determining
whether more than $30 a month is customarily and regularly received as tips. Any appropriate recurring monthly period beginning on the same day of the calendar month may be used.
(c)
Individual tip receipts are controlling.
An employee must him- or herself customarily and regularly receive more than $30 a month in tips in order to qualify as a tipped employee. The fact that he or she is part of a group which has a record of receiving more than $30 a month in tips will not qualify him or her. For example, a server who is newly hired will not be considered a tipped employee merely because the other servers in the establishment receive tips in the requisite amount. For the method of applying the test in initial and terminal months of employment,
see
§ 531.58.
(d)
Significance of minimum monthly tip receipts.
More than $30 a month in tips customarily and regularly received by the employee is a minimum standard that must be met before any wage credit for tips is determined under section 3(m)(2)(A). It does not govern or limit the determination of the appropriate amount of wage credit under section 3(m)(2)(A) that may be taken for tips under section 6(a)(1) (tip credit equals the difference between the minimum wage required by section 6(a)(1) and the cash wage paid (at least $2.13 per hour)).
(e)
Dual jobs.
In some situations an employee is employed in a dual job, as for example, where a maintenance man in a hotel also serves as a waiter. In such a situation the employee, if he customarily and regularly receives at least $30 a month in tips for his work as a waiter, is a tipped employee only with respect to his employment as a waiter. He is employed in two occupations, and no tip credit can be taken for his hours of employment in his occupation of maintenance man. Such a situation is distinguishable from that of a waitress who spends part of her time cleaning and setting tables, toasting bread, making coffee and occasionally washing dishes or glasses. It is likewise distinguishable from the counterman who also prepares his own short orders or who, as part of a group of countermen, takes a turn as a short order cook for the group. Such related duties in an occupation that is a tipped occupation need not by themselves be directed toward producing tips.
[32 FR 13575, Sept. 28, 1967, as amended at 76 FR 18855, Apr. 5, 2011; 85 FR 86790, Dec. 30, 2020; 86 FR 60156, 60157, Oct. 29, 2021; 86 FR 71829, Dec. 20, 2021; 89 FR 101887, Dec. 17, 2024]
§ 531.57
Receiving the minimum amount “customarily and regularly.”
The employee must receive more than $30 a month in tips “customarily and regularly” in the occupation in which he is engaged in order to qualify as a tipped employee under section 3(t). If it is known that he always receives more than the stipulated amount each month, as may be the case with many employees in occupations such as those of waiters, bellhops, taxicab drivers, barbers, or beauty operators, the employee will qualify and the tip credit provisions of section 3(m) may be applied. On the other hand, an employee who only occasionally or sporadically receives tips totaling more than $30 a month, such as at Christmas or New Years when customers may be more generous than usual, will not be deemed a tipped employee. The phrase “customarily and regularly” signifies a frequency which must be greater than occasional, but which may be less than constant. If an employee is in an occupation in which he normally and recurrently receives more than $30 a month in tips, he will be considered a tipped employee even though occasionally because of sickness, vacation, seasonal fluctuations or the like, he fails to receive more than $30 in tips in a particular month.
[32 FR 13575, Sept. 28, 1967, as amended at 76 FR 18855, Apr. 5, 2011]
§ 531.58
Initial and terminal months.
An exception to the requirement that an employee, whether full-time, part-time, permanent or temporary, will qualify as a tipped employee only if he customarily and regularly receives more than $30 a month in tips is made in the case of initial and terminal months of employment. In such months the purpose of the provision for tipped employees would seem fulfilled if qualification as a tipped employee is
based on his receipt of tips in the particular week or weeks of such month at a rate in excess of $30 a month, where the employee has worked less than a month because he started or terminated employment during the month.
[32 FR 13575, Sept. 28, 1967, as amended at 76 FR 18855, Apr. 5, 2011]
§ 531.59
The tip wage credit.
(a) In determining compliance with the wage payment requirements of the Act, under the provisions of section 3(m)(2)(A) the amount paid to a tipped employee by an employer is increased on account of tips by an amount equal to the formula set forth in the statute (minimum wage required by section 6(a)(1) of the Act minus cash wage paid (at least $2.13)), provided that the employer satisfies all the requirements of section 3(m)(2)(A). This tip credit is in addition to any credit for board, lodging, or other facilities which may be allowable under section 3(m).
(b) As indicated in § 531.51, the tip credit may be taken only for hours worked by the employee in an occupation in which the employee qualifies as a “tipped employee.” Pursuant to section 3(m)(2)(A), an employer is not eligible to take the tip credit unless it has informed its tipped employees in advance of the employer's use of the tip credit of the provisions of section 3(m)(2)(A) of the Act,
i.e.:
The amount of the cash wage that is to be paid to the tipped employee by the employer; the additional amount by which the wages of the tipped employee are increased on account of the tip credit claimed by the employer, which amount may not exceed the value of the tips actually received by the employee; that all tips received by the tipped employee must be retained by the employee except for a tip pooling arrangement limited to employees who customarily and regularly receive tips; and that the tip credit shall not apply to any employee who has not been informed of the requirements in this section. The credit allowed on account of tips may be less than that permitted by statute (minimum wage required by section 6(a)(1) minus the cash wage paid (at least $2.13)); it cannot be more. In order for the employer to claim the maximum tip credit, the employer must demonstrate that the employee received at least that amount in actual tips. If the employee received less than the maximum tip credit amount in tips, the employer is required to pay the balance so that the employee receives at least the minimum wage with the defined combination of wages and tips. With the exception of tips contributed to a tip pool limited to employees who customarily and regularly receive tips as described in § 531.54, section 3(m)(2)(A) also requires employers that take a tip credit to permit employees to retain all tips received by the employee.
[85 FR 86790, Dec. 30, 2020]
§ 531.60
Overtime payments.
When overtime is worked by a tipped employee who is subject to the overtime pay provisions of the Act, the employee's regular rate of pay is determined by dividing the employee's total remuneration for employment (except statutory exclusions) in any workweek by the total number of hours actually worked by the employee in that workweek for which such compensation was paid. (
See
part 778 of this chapter for a detailed discussion of overtime compensation under the Act.) In accordance with section 3(m)(2)(A), a tipped employee's regular rate of pay includes the amount of tip credit taken by the employer per hour (not in excess of the minimum wage required by section 6(a)(1) minus the cash wage paid (at least $2.13)), the reasonable cost or fair value of any facilities furnished to the employee by the employer, as authorized under section 3(m) and this part, and the cash wages including commissions and certain bonuses paid by the employer. Any tips received by the employee in excess of the tip credit need not be included in the regular rate. Such tips are not payments made by the employer to the employee as remuneration for employment within the meaning of the Act.

§ 536.3
“Area of production” as used in section 13(b)(14) of the Fair Labor Standards Act.
(a) An employee employed by an establishment commonly recognized as a country elevator and having not more than five employees (including such an establishment which sells products and services used in the operation of a farm) shall be regarded as employed within the “area of production,” within the meaning of section 13(b)(14) of the Fair Labor Standards Act, if the establishment by which he is employed is located in the open country or in a rural community and 95 percent of the agricultural commodities received by the establishment for storage or for market come from normal rural sources of supply within the following air-line distances from the establishment:
(1) With respect to grain and soybeans—50 miles;
(2) With respect to any other agricultural commodities—20 miles.
(b) For the purpose of this section:
(1) “Open country or rural community” shall not include any city, town, or urban place of 2,500 or greater population or any area within:
(i) One air-line mile of the city, town, or urban place with a population of 2,500 up to by not including 50,000, or
(ii) Three air-line miles of any city, town, or urban place with a population of 50,000 up to but not including 500,000, or
(iii) Five air-line miles of any city with a population of 500,000 or greater, according to the latest available United States Census.
(2) The commodities shall be considered to come from “normal rural sources of supply” within the specified distances from the establishment if they are received: (i) From farms within such specified distances, or (ii) from farm assemblers or other establishments through which the commodity customarily moves, which are within such specified distances and located in the open country or in a rural community, or (iii) from farm assemblers or other establishments not located in the open country or in a rural community provided it can be demonstrated that the commodities were produced on farms within such specified distances.
(3) The period for determining whether 95 percent of the commodities are received from normal rural sources of supply shall be the last preceding calendar month in which operations were carried on for two workweeks or more, except that until such time as an establishment has operated for such a calendar month the period shall be the time during which it has been in operation.
(4) The percentage of commodities received from normal rural sources of supply within the specified distances shall be determined by weight, volume or other physical unit of measure, except that dollar value shall be used if different commodities received in the establishment are customarily measured in physical units that are not comparable.

# Subpart A—General Regulations
§ 541.0
Introductory statement.
(a) Section 13(a)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards Act, as amended, provides an exemption from the Act's minimum wage and overtime requirements for any employee employed in a bona fide executive, administrative, or professional capacity (including any employee employed in the capacity of academic administrative personnel or teacher in elementary or secondary schools), or in the capacity of an outside sales employee, as such terms are defined and delimited from time to time by regulations of the Secretary, subject to the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act. Section 13(a)(17) of the Act provides an exemption from the minimum wage and overtime requirements for computer systems analysts, computer programmers, software engineers, and other similarly skilled computer employees.
(b) The requirements for these exemptions are contained in this part as follows: executive employees, subpart B; administrative employees, subpart C; professional employees, subpart D; computer employees, subpart E; outside sales employees, subpart F. Subpart G contains regulations regarding salary requirements applicable to most of the exemptions, including salary levels and the salary basis test. Subpart G also contains a provision for exempting certain highly compensated employees. Subpart H contains definitions and other miscellaneous provisions applicable to all or several of the exemptions.
(c) Effective July 1, 1972, the Fair Labor Standards Act was amended to include within the protection of the equal pay provisions those employees
exempt from the minimum wage and overtime pay provisions as bona fide executive, administrative, and professional employees (including any employee employed in the capacity of academic administrative personnel or teacher in elementary or secondary schools), or in the capacity of an outside sales employee under section 13(a)(1) of the Act. The equal pay provisions in section 6(d) of the Fair Labor Standards Act are administered and enforced by the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.
§ 541.1
Terms used in regulations.
Act
means the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended.
Administrator
means the Administrator of the Wage and Hour Division, United States Department of Labor. The Secretary of Labor has delegated to the Administrator the functions vested in the Secretary under sections 13(a)(1) and 13(a)(17) of the Fair Labor Standards Act.
§ 541.2
Job titles insufficient.
A job title alone is insufficient to establish the exempt status of an employee. The exempt or nonexempt status of any particular employee must be determined on the basis of whether the employee's salary and duties meet the requirements of the regulations in this part.
§ 541.3
Scope of the section 13(a)(1) exemptions.
(a) The section 13(a)(1) exemptions and the regulations in this part do not apply to manual laborers or other “blue collar” workers who perform work involving repetitive operations with their hands, physical skill and energy. Such nonexempt “blue collar” employees gain the skills and knowledge required for performance of their routine manual and physical work through apprenticeships and on-the-job training, not through the prolonged course of specialized intellectual instruction required for exempt learned professional employees such as medical doctors, architects and archeologists. Thus, for example, non-management production-line employees and non-management employees in maintenance, construction and similar occupations such as carpenters, electricians, mechanics, plumbers, iron workers, craftsmen, operating engineers, longshoremen, construction workers and laborers are entitled to minimum wage and overtime premium pay under the Fair Labor Standards Act, and are not exempt under the regulations in this part no matter how highly paid they might be.
(b)(1) The section 13(a)(1) exemptions and the regulations in this part also do not apply to police officers, detectives, deputy sheriffs, state troopers, highway patrol officers, investigators, inspectors, correctional officers, parole or probation officers, park rangers, fire fighters, paramedics, emergency medical technicians, ambulance personnel, rescue workers, hazardous materials workers and similar employees, regardless of rank or pay level, who perform work such as preventing, controlling or extinguishing fires of any type; rescuing fire, crime or accident victims; preventing or detecting crimes; conducting investigations or inspections for violations of law; performing surveillance; pursuing, restraining and apprehending suspects; detaining or supervising suspected and convicted criminals, including those on probation or parole; interviewing witnesses; interrogating and fingerprinting suspects; preparing investigative reports; or other similar work.
(2) Such employees do not qualify as exempt executive employees because their primary duty is not management of the enterprise in which the employee is employed or a customarily recognized department or subdivision thereof as required under § 541.100. Thus, for example, a police officer or fire fighter whose primary duty is to investigate crimes or fight fires is not exempt under section 13(a)(1) of the Act merely because the police officer or fire fighter also directs the work of other employees in the conduct of an investigation or fighting a fire.
(3) Such employees do not qualify as exempt administrative employees because their primary duty is not the performance of work directly related to the management or general business operations of the employer or the employer's customers as required under § 541.200.
(4) Such employees do not qualify as exempt professionals because their primary duty is not the performance of work requiring knowledge of an advanced type in a field of science or learning customarily acquired by a prolonged course of specialized intellectual instruction or the performance of work requiring invention, imagination, originality or talent in a recognized field of artistic or creative endeavor as required under § 541.300. Although some police officers, fire fighters, paramedics, emergency medical technicians and similar employees have college degrees, a specialized academic degree is not a standard prerequisite for employment in such occupations.
§ 541.4
Other laws and collective bargaining agreements.
The Fair Labor Standards Act provides minimum standards that may be exceeded, but cannot be waived or reduced. Employers must comply, for example, with any Federal, State or municipal laws, regulations or ordinances establishing a higher minimum wage or lower maximum workweek than those established under the Act. Similarly, employers, on their own initiative or under a collective bargaining agreement with a labor union, are not precluded by the Act from providing a wage higher than the statutory minimum, a shorter workweek than the statutory maximum, or a higher overtime premium (double time, for example) than provided by the Act. While collective bargaining agreements cannot waive or reduce the Act's protections, nothing in the Act or the regulations in this part relieves employers from their contractual obligations under collective bargaining agreements.
§ 541.5
Severability.
The provisions of this part are separate and severable and operate independently from one another. If any provision of this part is held to be invalid or unenforceable by its terms, or as applied to any person or circumstance, or stayed pending further agency action, the provision must be construed so as to continue to give the maximum effect to the provision permitted by law, unless such holding be one of utter invalidity or unenforceability, in which event the provision will be severable from part 541 and will not affect the remainder thereof.
[89 32971, Apr. 26, 2024]

# Subpart B—Executive Employees
§ 541.100
General rule for executive employees.
(a) The term “employee employed in a bona fide executive capacity” in section 13(a)(1) of the Act shall mean any employee:
(1) Compensated on a salary basis at not less than the level set forth in § 541.600;
(2) Whose primary duty is management of the enterprise in which the employee is employed or of a customarily recognized department or subdivision thereof;
(3) Who customarily and regularly directs the work of two or more other employees; and
(4) Who has the authority to hire or fire other employees or whose suggestions and recommendations as to the hiring, firing, advancement, promotion or any other change of status of other employees are given particular weight.
(b) The phrase “salary basis” is defined at § 541.602; “board, lodging or other facilities” is defined at § 541.606; “primary duty” is defined at § 541.700; and “customarily and regularly” is defined at § 541.701.
[69 FR 22260, Apr. 23, 2004, as amended at 81 FR 32549, May 23, 2016; 84 FR 51306, Sept. 27, 2019; 89 FR 32971, Apr. 26, 2024]
§ 541.101
Business owner.
The term “employee employed in a bona fide executive capacity” in section 13(a)(1) of the Act also includes any employee who owns at least a bona fide 20-percent equity interest in the enterprise in which the employee is employed, regardless of whether the business is a corporate or other type of organization, and who is actively engaged in its management. The term “management” is defined in § 541.102. The requirements of Subpart G (salary requirements) of this part do not apply to the business owners described in this section.
§ 541.102
Management.
Generally, “management” includes, but is not limited to, activities such as interviewing, selecting, and training of employees; setting and adjusting their rates of pay and hours of work; directing the work of employees; maintaining production or sales records for use in supervision or control; appraising employees' productivity and efficiency for the purpose of recommending promotions or other changes in status; handling employee complaints and grievances; disciplining employees; planning the work; determining the techniques to be used; apportioning the work among the employees; determining the type of materials, supplies, machinery, equipment or tools to be used or merchandise to be bought, stocked and sold; controlling the flow and distribution of materials or merchandise and supplies; providing for the safety and security of the employees or the property; planning and controlling the budget; and monitoring or implementing legal compliance measures.
§ 541.103
Department or subdivision.
(a) The phrase “a customarily recognized department or subdivision” is intended to distinguish between a mere collection of employees assigned from time to time to a specific job or series of jobs and a unit with permanent status and function. A customarily recognized department or subdivision must have a permanent status and a continuing function. For example, a large employer's human resources department might have subdivisions for labor relations, pensions and other benefits, equal employment opportunity, and personnel management, each of which has a permanent status and function.
(b) When an enterprise has more than one establishment, the employee in charge of each establishment may be considered in charge of a recognized subdivision of the enterprise.
(c) A recognized department or subdivision need not be physically within the employer's establishment and may move from place to place. The mere fact that the employee works in more than one location does not invalidate the exemption if other factors show that the employee is actually in charge of a recognized unit with a continuing function in the organization.
(d) Continuity of the same subordinate personnel is not essential to the existence of a recognized unit with a continuing function. An otherwise exempt employee will not lose the exemption merely because the employee draws and supervises workers from a pool or supervises a team of workers drawn from other recognized units, if other factors are present that indicate that the employee is in charge of a recognized unit with a continuing function.
§ 541.104
Two or more other employees.
(a) To qualify as an exempt executive under § 541.100, the employee must customarily and regularly direct the work of two or more other employees. The phrase “two or more other employees” means two full-time employees or their equivalent. One full-time and two half-time employees, for example, are equivalent to two full-time employees. Four half-time employees are also equivalent.
(b) The supervision can be distributed among two, three or more employees, but each such employee must customarily and regularly direct the work of two or more other full-time employees or the equivalent. Thus, for example, a department with five full-time nonexempt workers may have up to two exempt supervisors if each such supervisor customarily and regularly directs the work of two of those workers.
(c) An employee who merely assists the manager of a particular department and supervises two or more employees only in the actual manager's absence does not meet this requirement.
(d) Hours worked by an employee cannot be credited more than once for different executives. Thus, a shared responsibility for the supervision of the same two employees in the same department does not satisfy this requirement. However, a full-time employee who works four hours for one supervisor and four hours for a different supervisor, for example, can be credited as a half-time employee for both supervisors.
§ 541.105
Particular weight.
To determine whether an employee's suggestions and recommendations are given “particular weight,” factors to be considered include, but are not limited to, whether it is part of the employee's job duties to make such suggestions and recommendations; the frequency with which such suggestions and recommendations are made or requested; and the frequency with which the employee's suggestions and recommendations are relied upon. Generally, an executive's suggestions and recommendations must pertain to employees whom the executive customarily and regularly directs. It does not include an occasional suggestion with regard to the change in status of a co-worker. An employee's suggestions and recommendations may still be deemed to have “particular weight” even if a higher level manager's recommendation has more importance and even if the employee does not have authority to make the ultimate decision as to the employee's change in status.
§ 541.106
Concurrent duties.
(a) Concurrent performance of exempt and nonexempt work does not disqualify an employee from the executive exemption if the requirements of § 541.100 are otherwise met. Whether an employee meets the requirements of § 541.100 when the employee performs concurrent duties is determined on a case-by-case basis and based on the factors set forth in § 541.700. Generally, exempt executives make the decision regarding when to perform nonexempt duties and remain responsible for the success or failure of business operations under their management while performing the nonexempt work. In contrast, the nonexempt employee generally is directed by a supervisor to perform the exempt work or performs the exempt work for defined time periods. An employee whose primary duty is ordinary production work or routine, recurrent or repetitive tasks cannot qualify for exemption as an executive.
(b) For example, an assistant manager in a retail establishment may perform work such as serving customers, cooking food, stocking shelves and cleaning the establishment, but performance of such nonexempt work does not preclude the exemption if the assistant manager's primary duty is management. An assistant manager can supervise employees and serve customers at the same time without losing the exemption. An exempt employee can also simultaneously direct the work of other employees and stock shelves.
(c) In contrast, a relief supervisor or working supervisor whose primary duty is performing nonexempt work on the production line in a manufacturing plant does not become exempt merely because the nonexempt production line employee occasionally has some responsibility for directing the work of other nonexempt production line employees when, for example, the exempt supervisor is unavailable. Similarly, an employee whose primary duty is to work as an electrician is not an exempt executive even if the employee also directs the work of other employees on the job site, orders parts and materials for the job, and handles requests from the prime contractor.

# Subpart C—Administrative Employees
§ 541.200
General rule for administrative employees.
(a) The term “employee employed in a bona fide administrative capacity” in section 13(a)(1) of the Act shall mean any employee:
(1) Compensated on a salary or fee basis at not less than the level set forth in § 541.600;
(2) Whose primary duty is the performance of office or non-manual work directly related to the management or general business operations of the employer or the employer's customers; and
(3) Whose primary duty includes the exercise of discretion and independent judgment with respect to matters of significance.
(b) The term “salary basis” is defined at § 541.602; “fee basis” is defined at § 541.605; “board, lodging or other facilities” is defined at § 541.606; and “primary duty” is defined at § 541.700.
[69 FR 22260, Apr. 23, 2004, as amended at 81 FR 32549, May 23, 2016; 84 FR 51306, Sept. 27, 2019; 89 FR 32971, Apr. 26, 2024]
§ 541.201
Directly related to management or general business operations.
(a) To qualify for the administrative exemption, an employee's primary duty must be the performance of work directly related to the management or general business operations of the employer or the employer's customers. The phrase “directly related to the management or general business operations” refers to the type of work performed by the employee. To meet this requirement, an employee must perform work directly related to assisting with the running or servicing of the business, as distinguished, for example, from working on a manufacturing production line or selling a product in a retail or service establishment.
(b) Work directly related to management or general business operations includes, but is not limited to, work in functional areas such as tax; finance; accounting; budgeting; auditing; insurance; quality control; purchasing; procurement; advertising; marketing; research; safety and health; personnel management; human resources; employee benefits; labor relations; public relations, government relations; computer network, internet and database administration; legal and regulatory compliance; and similar activities. Some of these activities may be performed by employees who also would qualify for another exemption.
(c) An employee may qualify for the administrative exemption if the employee's primary duty is the performance of work directly related to the management or general business operations of the employer's customers. Thus, for example, employees acting as advisers or consultants to their employer's clients or customers (as tax experts or financial consultants, for example) may be exempt.
§ 541.202
Discretion and independent judgment.
(a) To qualify for the administrative exemption, an employee's primary duty must include the exercise of discretion and independent judgment with respect to matters of significance. In general, the exercise of discretion and independent judgment involves the comparison and the evaluation of possible courses of conduct, and acting or making a decision after the various possibilities have been considered. The term “matters of significance” refers to the level of importance or consequence of the work performed.
(b) The phrase “discretion and independent judgment” must be applied in the light of all the facts involved in the particular employment situation in which the question arises. Factors to consider when determining whether an employee exercises discretion and independent judgment with respect to matters of significance include, but are not limited to: whether the employee has authority to formulate, affect, interpret, or implement management policies or operating practices; whether the employee carries out major assignments in conducting the operations of the business; whether the employee performs work that affects business operations to a substantial degree, even if the employee's assignments are related to operation of a particular segment of the business; whether the employee has authority to commit the employer in matters that have significant financial impact; whether the employee has authority to waive or deviate from established policies and procedures without prior approval; whether the employee has authority to negotiate and bind the company on significant matters; whether the employee provides consultation or expert advice to management; whether the employee is involved in planning long- or short-term business objectives; whether the employee investigates and resolves matters of significance on behalf of management; and whether the employee represents the company in handling complaints, arbitrating disputes or resolving grievances.
(c) The exercise of discretion and independent judgment implies that the employee has authority to make an independent choice, free from immediate direction or supervision. However, employees can exercise discretion and independent judgment even if their decisions or recommendations are reviewed at a higher level. Thus, the
term “discretion and independent judgment” does not require that the decisions made by an employee have a finality that goes with unlimited authority and a complete absence of review. The decisions made as a result of the exercise of discretion and independent judgment may consist of recommendations for action rather than the actual taking of action. The fact that an employee's decision may be subject to review and that upon occasion the decisions are revised or reversed after review does not mean that the employee is not exercising discretion and independent judgment. For example, the policies formulated by the credit manager of a large corporation may be subject to review by higher company officials who may approve or disapprove these policies. The management consultant who has made a study of the operations of a business and who has drawn a proposed change in organization may have the plan reviewed or revised by superiors before it is submitted to the client.
(d) An employer's volume of business may make it necessary to employ a number of employees to perform the same or similar work. The fact that many employees perform identical work or work of the same relative importance does not mean that the work of each such employee does not involve the exercise of discretion and independent judgment with respect to matters of significance.
(e) The exercise of discretion and independent judgment must be more than the use of skill in applying well-established techniques, procedures or specific standards described in manuals or other sources.
See also
§ 541.704 regarding use of manuals. The exercise of discretion and independent judgment also does not include clerical or secretarial work, recording or tabulating data, or performing other mechanical, repetitive, recurrent or routine work. An employee who simply tabulates data is not exempt, even if labeled as a “statistician.”
(f) An employee does not exercise discretion and independent judgment with respect to matters of significance merely because the employer will experience financial losses if the employee fails to perform the job properly. For example, a messenger who is entrusted with carrying large sums of money does not exercise discretion and independent judgment with respect to matters of significance even though serious consequences may flow from the employee's neglect. Similarly, an employee who operates very expensive equipment does not exercise discretion and independent judgment with respect to matters of significance merely because improper performance of the employee's duties may cause serious financial loss to the employer.
§ 541.203
Administrative exemption examples.
(a) Insurance claims adjusters generally meet the duties requirements for the administrative exemption, whether they work for an insurance company or other type of company, if their duties include activities such as interviewing insureds, witnesses and physicians; inspecting property damage; reviewing factual information to prepare damage estimates; evaluating and making recommendations regarding coverage of claims; determining liability and total value of a claim; negotiating settlements; and making recommendations regarding litigation.
(b) Employees in the financial services industry generally meet the duties requirements for the administrative exemption if their duties include work such as collecting and analyzing information regarding the customer's income, assets, investments or debts; determining which financial products best meet the customer's needs and financial circumstances; advising the customer regarding the advantages and disadvantages of different financial products; and marketing, servicing or promoting the employer's financial products. However, an employee whose primary duty is selling financial products does not qualify for the administrative exemption.
(c) An employee who leads a team of other employees assigned to complete major projects for the employer (such as purchasing, selling or closing all or part of the business, negotiating a real estate transaction or a collective bargaining agreement, or designing and
implementing productivity improvements) generally meets the duties requirements for the administrative exemption, even if the employee does not have direct supervisory responsibility over the other employees on the team.
(d) An executive assistant or administrative assistant to a business owner or senior executive of a large business generally meets the duties requirements for the administrative exemption if such employee, without specific instructions or prescribed procedures, has been delegated authority regarding matters of significance.
(e) Human resources managers who formulate, interpret or implement employment policies and management consultants who study the operations of a business and propose changes in organization generally meet the duties requirements for the administrative exemption. However, personnel clerks who “screen” applicants to obtain data regarding their minimum qualifications and fitness for employment generally do not meet the duties requirements for the administrative exemption. Such personnel clerks typically will reject all applicants who do not meet minimum standards for the particular job or for employment by the company. The minimum standards are usually set by the exempt human resources manager or other company officials, and the decision to hire from the group of qualified applicants who do meet the minimum standards is similarly made by the exempt human resources manager or other company officials. Thus, when the interviewing and screening functions are performed by the human resources manager or personnel manager who makes the hiring decision or makes recommendations for hiring from the pool of qualified applicants, such duties constitute exempt work, even though routine, because this work is directly and closely related to the employee's exempt functions.
(f) Purchasing agents with authority to bind the company on significant purchases generally meet the duties requirements for the administrative exemption even if they must consult with top management officials when making a purchase commitment for raw materials in excess of the contemplated plant needs.
(g) Ordinary inspection work generally does not meet the duties requirements for the administrative exemption. Inspectors normally perform specialized work along standardized lines involving well-established techniques and procedures which may have been catalogued and described in manuals or other sources. Such inspectors rely on techniques and skills acquired by special training or experience. They have some leeway in the performance of their work but only within closely prescribed limits.
(h) Employees usually called examiners or graders, such as employees that grade lumber, generally do not meet the duties requirements for the administrative exemption. Such employees usually perform work involving the comparison of products with established standards which are frequently catalogued. Often, after continued reference to the written standards, or through experience, the employee acquires sufficient knowledge so that reference to written standards is unnecessary. The substitution of the employee's memory for a manual of standards does not convert the character of the work performed to exempt work requiring the exercise of discretion and independent judgment.
(i) Comparison shopping performed by an employee of a retail store who merely reports to the buyer the prices at a competitor's store does not qualify for the administrative exemption. However, the buyer who evaluates such reports on competitor prices to set the employer's prices generally meets the duties requirements for the administrative exemption.
(j) Public sector inspectors or investigators of various types, such as fire prevention or safety, building or construction, health or sanitation, environmental or soils specialists and similar employees, generally do not meet the duties requirements for the administrative exemption because their work typically does not involve work directly related to the management or general business operations of the employer. Such employees also do not qualify for the administrative exemption because their work involves the
use of skills and technical abilities in gathering factual information, applying known standards or prescribed procedures, determining which procedure to follow, or determining whether prescribed standards or criteria are met.
§ 541.204
Educational establishments.
(a) The term “employee employed in a bona fide administrative capacity” in section 13(a)(1) of the Act also includes employees:
(1) Compensated on a salary or fee basis at not less than the level set forth in § 541.600; or on a salary basis which is at least equal to the entrance salary for teachers in the educational establishment by which employed; and
(2) Whose primary duty is performing administrative functions directly related to academic instruction or training in an educational establishment or department or subdivision thereof.
(b) The term “educational establishment” means an elementary or secondary school system, an institution of higher education or other educational institution. Sections 3(v) and 3(w) of the Act define elementary and secondary schools as those day or residential schools that provide elementary or secondary education, as determined under State law. Under the laws of most States, such education includes the curriculums in grades 1 through 12; under many it includes also the introductory programs in kindergarten. Such education in some States may also include nursery school programs in elementary education and junior college curriculums in secondary education. The term “other educational establishment” includes special schools for mentally or physically disabled or gifted children, regardless of any classification of such schools as elementary, secondary or higher. Factors relevant in determining whether post-secondary career programs are educational institutions include whether the school is licensed by a state agency responsible for the state's educational system or accredited by a nationally recognized accrediting organization for career schools. Also, for purposes of the exemption, no distinction is drawn between public and private schools, or between those operated for profit and those that are not for profit.
(c) The phrase “performing administrative functions directly related to academic instruction or training” means work related to the academic operations and functions in a school rather than to administration along the lines of general business operations. Such academic administrative functions include operations directly in the field of education. Jobs relating to areas outside the educational field are not within the definition of academic administration.
(1) Employees engaged in academic administrative functions include: the superintendent or other head of an elementary or secondary school system, and any assistants, responsible for administration of such matters as curriculum, quality and methods of instructing, measuring and testing the learning potential and achievement of students, establishing and maintaining academic and grading standards, and other aspects of the teaching program; the principal and any vice-principals responsible for the operation of an elementary or secondary school; department heads in institutions of higher education responsible for the administration of the mathematics department, the English department, the foreign language department, etc.; academic counselors who perform work such as administering school testing programs, assisting students with academic problems and advising students concerning degree requirements; and other employees with similar responsibilities.
(2) Jobs relating to building management and maintenance, jobs relating to the health of the students, and academic staff such as social workers, psychologists, lunch room managers or dietitians do not perform academic administrative functions. Although such work is not considered academic administration, such employees may qualify for exemption under § 541.200 or under other sections of this part, provided the requirements for such exemptions are met.
[69 FR 22260, Apr. 23, 2004, as amended at 81 FR 32549, May 23, 2016; 84 FR 51306, Sept. 27, 2019; 89 FR 32971, Apr. 26, 2024]

# Subpart D—Professional Employees
§ 541.300
General rule for professional employees.
(a) The term “employee employed in a bona fide professional capacity” in section 13(a)(1) of the Act shall mean any employee:
(1) Compensated on a salary or fee basis at not less than the level set forth in § 541.600; and
(2) Whose primary duty is the performance of work:
(i) Requiring knowledge of an advanced type in a field of science or learning customarily acquired by a prolonged course of specialized intellectual instruction; or
(ii) Requiring invention, imagination, originality or talent in a recognized field of artistic or creative endeavor.
(b) The term “salary basis” is defined at § 541.602; “fee basis” is defined at § 541.605; “board, lodging or other facilities” is defined at § 541.606; and “primary duty” is defined at § 541.700.
[69 FR 22260, Apr. 23, 2004, as amended at 81 FR 32549, May 23, 2016; 84 FR 51306, Sept. 27, 2019; 89 32971, Apr. 26, 2024]
§ 541.301
Learned professionals.
(a) To qualify for the learned professional exemption, an employee's primary duty must be the performance of work requiring advanced knowledge in a field of science or learning customarily acquired by a prolonged course of specialized intellectual instruction. This primary duty test includes three elements:
(1) The employee must perform work requiring advanced knowledge;
(2) The advanced knowledge must be in a field of science or learning; and
(3) The advanced knowledge must be customarily acquired by a prolonged course of specialized intellectual instruction.
(b) The phrase “work requiring advanced knowledge” means work which is predominantly intellectual in character, and which includes work requiring the consistent exercise of discretion and judgment, as distinguished from performance of routine mental, manual, mechanical or physical work. An employee who performs work requiring advanced knowledge generally uses the advanced knowledge to analyze, interpret or make deductions from varying facts or circumstances. Advanced knowledge cannot be attained at the high school level.
(c) The phrase “field of science or learning” includes the traditional professions of law, medicine, theology, accounting, actuarial computation, engineering, architecture, teaching, various types of physical, chemical and biological sciences, pharmacy and other similar occupations that have a recognized professional status as distinguished from the mechanical arts or skilled trades where in some instances the knowledge is of a fairly advanced type, but is not in a field of science or learning.
(d) The phrase “customarily acquired by a prolonged course of specialized intellectual instruction” restricts the exemption to professions where specialized academic training is a standard prerequisite for entrance into the profession. The best prima facie evidence that an employee meets this requirement is possession of the appropriate academic degree. However, the word “customarily” means that the exemption is also available to employees in such professions who have substantially the same knowledge level and perform substantially the same work as the degreed employees, but who attained the advanced knowledge through a combination of work experience and intellectual instruction. Thus, for example, the learned professional exemption is available to the occasional lawyer who has not gone to law school, or the occasional chemist who is not the possessor of a degree in chemistry. However, the learned professional exemption is not available for occupations that customarily may be performed with only the general knowledge acquired by an academic degree in any field, with knowledge acquired through an apprenticeship, or with training in the performance of routine mental, manual, mechanical or physical processes. The learned professional exemption also does not apply to occupations in which most employees have acquired their skill by experience rather than by advanced specialized intellectual instruction.
(e)(1)
Registered or certified medical technologists.
Registered or certified medical technologists who have successfully completed three academic years of pre-professional study in an accredited college or university plus a fourth year of professional course work in a school of medical technology approved by the Council of Medical Education of the American Medical Association generally meet the duties requirements for the learned professional exemption.
(2)
Nurses.
Registered nurses who are registered by the appropriate State examining board generally meet the duties requirements for the learned professional exemption. Licensed practical nurses and other similar health care employees, however, generally do not qualify as exempt learned professionals because possession of a specialized advanced academic degree is not a standard prerequisite for entry into such occupations.
(3)
Dental hygienists.
Dental hygienists who have successfully completed four academic years of pre-professional and professional study in an accredited college or university approved by the Commission on Accreditation of Dental and Dental Auxiliary Educational Programs of the American Dental Association generally meet the duties requirements for the learned professional exemption.
(4)
Physician assistants.
Physician assistants who have successfully completed four academic years of pre-professional and professional study, including graduation from a physician assistant program accredited by the Accreditation Review Commission on Education for the Physician Assistant, and who are certified by the National Commission on Certification of Physician Assistants generally meet the duties requirements for the learned professional exemption.
(5)
Accountants.
Certified public accountants generally meet the duties requirements for the learned professional exemption. In addition, many other accountants who are not certified public accountants but perform similar job duties may qualify as exempt learned professionals. However, accounting clerks, bookkeepers and other employees who normally perform a great deal of routine work generally will not qualify as exempt professionals.
(6)
Chefs.
Chefs, such as executive chefs and sous chefs, who have attained a four-year specialized academic degree in a culinary arts program, generally meet the duties requirements for the learned professional exemption. The learned professional exemption is not available to cooks who perform predominantly routine mental, manual, mechanical or physical work.
(7)
Paralegals.
Paralegals and legal assistants generally do not qualify as exempt learned professionals because an advanced specialized academic degree is not a standard prerequisite for entry into the field. Although many paralegals possess general four-year advanced degrees, most specialized paralegal programs are two-year associate degree programs from a community college or equivalent institution. However, the learned professional exemption is available for paralegals who possess advanced specialized degrees in other professional fields and apply advanced knowledge in that field in the performance of their duties. For example, if a law firm hires an engineer as a paralegal to provide expert advice on product liability cases or to assist on patent matters, that engineer would qualify for exemption.
(8)
Athletic trainers.
Athletic trainers who have successfully completed four academic years of pre-professional and professional study in a specialized curriculum accredited by the Commission on Accreditation of Allied Health Education Programs and who are certified by the Board of Certification of the National Athletic Trainers Association Board of Certification generally meet the duties requirements for the learned professional exemption.
(9)
Funeral directors or embalmers.
Licensed funeral directors and embalmers who are licensed by and working in a state that requires successful completion of four academic years of pre-professional and professional study, including graduation from a college of mortuary science accredited by the American Board of Funeral Service Education, generally meet the duties requirements for the learned professional exemption.
(f) The areas in which the professional exemption may be available are expanding. As knowledge is developed, academic training is broadened and specialized degrees are offered in new and diverse fields, thus creating new specialists in particular fields of science or learning. When an advanced specialized degree has become a standard requirement for a particular occupation, that occupation may have acquired the characteristics of a learned profession. Accrediting and certifying organizations similar to those listed in paragraphs (e)(1), (e)(3), (e)(4), (e)(8) and (e)(9) of this section also may be created in the future. Such organizations may develop similar specialized curriculums and certification programs which, if a standard requirement for a particular occupation, may indicate that the occupation has acquired the characteristics of a learned profession.
§ 541.302
Creative professionals.
(a) To qualify for the creative professional exemption, an employee's primary duty must be the performance of work requiring invention, imagination, originality or talent in a recognized field of artistic or creative endeavor as opposed to routine mental, manual, mechanical or physical work. The exemption does not apply to work which can be produced by a person with general manual or intellectual ability and training.
(b) To qualify for exemption as a creative professional, the work performed must be “in a recognized field of artistic or creative endeavor.” This includes such fields as music, writing, acting and the graphic arts.
(c) The requirement of “invention, imagination, originality or talent” distinguishes the creative professions from work that primarily depends on intelligence, diligence and accuracy. The duties of employees vary widely, and exemption as a creative professional depends on the extent of the invention, imagination, originality or talent exercised by the employee. Determination of exempt creative professional status, therefore, must be made on a case-by-case basis. This requirement generally is met by actors, musicians, composers, conductors, and soloists; painters who at most are given the subject matter of their painting; cartoonists who are merely told the title or underlying concept of a cartoon and must rely on their own creative ability to express the concept; essayists, novelists, short-story writers and screen-play writers who choose their own subjects and hand in a finished piece of work to their employers (the majority of such persons are, of course, not employees but self-employed); and persons holding the more responsible writing positions in advertising agencies. This requirement generally is not met by a person who is employed as a copyist, as an “animator” of motion-picture cartoons, or as a retoucher of photographs, since such work is not properly described as creative in character.
(d) Journalists may satisfy the duties requirements for the creative professional exemption if their primary duty is work requiring invention, imagination, originality or talent, as opposed to work which depends primarily on intelligence, diligence and accuracy. Employees of newspapers, magazines, television and other media are not exempt creative professionals if they only collect, organize and record information that is routine or already public, or if they do not contribute a unique interpretation or analysis to a news product. Thus, for example, newspaper reporters who merely rewrite press releases or who write standard recounts of public information by gathering facts on routine community events are not exempt creative professionals. Reporters also do not qualify as exempt creative professionals if their work product is subject to substantial control by the employer. However, journalists may qualify as exempt creative professionals if their primary duty is performing on the air in radio, television or other electronic media; conducting investigative interviews; analyzing or interpreting public events; writing editorials, opinion columns or other commentary; or acting as a narrator or commentator.
§ 541.303
Teachers.
(a) The term “employee employed in a bona fide professional capacity” in section 13(a)(1) of the Act also means any employee with a primary duty of
teaching, tutoring, instructing or lecturing in the activity of imparting knowledge and who is employed and engaged in this activity as a teacher in an educational establishment by which the employee is employed. The term “educational establishment” is defined in § 541.204(b).
(b) Exempt teachers include, but are not limited to: Regular academic teachers; teachers of kindergarten or nursery school pupils; teachers of gifted or disabled children; teachers of skilled and semi-skilled trades and occupations; teachers engaged in automobile driving instruction; aircraft flight instructors; home economics teachers; and vocal or instrumental music instructors. Those faculty members who are engaged as teachers but also spend a considerable amount of their time in extracurricular activities such as coaching athletic teams or acting as moderators or advisors in such areas as drama, speech, debate or journalism are engaged in teaching. Such activities are a recognized part of the schools' responsibility in contributing to the educational development of the student.
(c) The possession of an elementary or secondary teacher's certificate provides a clear means of identifying the individuals contemplated as being within the scope of the exemption for teaching professionals. Teachers who possess a teaching certificate qualify for the exemption regardless of the terminology (e.g., permanent, conditional, standard, provisional, temporary, emergency, or unlimited) used by the State to refer to different kinds of certificates. However, private schools and public schools are not uniform in requiring a certificate for employment as an elementary or secondary school teacher, and a teacher's certificate is not generally necessary for employment in institutions of higher education or other educational establishments. Therefore, a teacher who is not certified may be considered for exemption, provided that such individual is employed as a teacher by the employing school or school system.
(d) The requirements of § 541.300 and Subpart G (salary requirements) of this part do not apply to the teaching professionals described in this section.
§ 541.304
Practice of law or medicine.
(a) The term “employee employed in a bona fide professional capacity” in section 13(a)(1) of the Act also shall mean:
(1) Any employee who is the holder of a valid license or certificate permitting the practice of law or medicine or any of their branches and is actually engaged in the practice thereof; and
(2) Any employee who is the holder of the requisite academic degree for the general practice of medicine and is engaged in an internship or resident program pursuant to the practice of the profession.
(b) In the case of medicine, the exemption applies to physicians and other practitioners licensed and practicing in the field of medical science and healing or any of the medical specialties practiced by physicians or practitioners. The term “physicians” includes medical doctors including general practitioners and specialists, osteopathic physicians (doctors of osteopathy), podiatrists, dentists (doctors of dental medicine), and optometrists (doctors of optometry or bachelors of science in optometry).
(c) Employees engaged in internship or resident programs, whether or not licensed to practice prior to commencement of the program, qualify as exempt professionals if they enter such internship or resident programs after the earning of the appropriate degree required for the general practice of their profession.
(d) The requirements of § 541.300 and subpart G (salary requirements) of this part do not apply to the employees described in this section.

# Subpart E—Computer Employees
§ 541.400
General rule for computer employees.
(a) Computer systems analysts, computer programmers, software engineers or other similarly skilled workers in the computer field are eligible for exemption as professionals under section 13(a)(1) of the Act and under section 13(a)(17) of the Act. Because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer industry, job titles are not determinative of the applicability of this exemption.
(b) The section 13(a)(1) exemption applies to any computer employee who is compensated on a salary or fee basis at not less than the level set forth in § 541.600. The section 13(a)(17) exemption applies to any computer employee compensated on an hourly basis at a rate of not less than $27.63 an hour. In addition, under either section 13(a)(1) or section 13(a)(17) of the Act, the exemptions apply only to computer employees whose primary duty consists of:
(1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional specifications;
(2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on and related to user or system design specifications;
(3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer programs related to machine operating systems; or
(4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which requires the same level of skills.
(c) The term “salary basis” is defined at § 541.602; “fee basis” is defined at § 541.605; “board, lodging or other facilities” is defined at § 541.606; and “primary duty” is defined at § 541.700.
[69 FR 22260, Apr. 23, 2004, as amended at 81 FR 32550, May 23, 2016; 84 FR 51306, Sept. 27, 2019; 89 FR 32971, Apr. 26, 2024]
§ 541.401
Computer manufacture and repair.
The exemption for employees in computer occupations does not include employees engaged in the manufacture or repair of computer hardware and related equipment. Employees whose work is highly dependent upon, or facilitated by, the use of computers and computer software programs (e.g., engineers, drafters and others skilled in computer-aided design software), but who are not primarily engaged in computer systems analysis and programming or other similarly skilled computer-related occupations identified in § 541.400(b), are also not exempt computer professionals.
§ 541.402
Executive and administrative computer employees.
Computer employees within the scope of this exemption, as well as those employees not within its scope, may also have executive and administrative duties which qualify the employees for exemption under subpart B or subpart C of this part. For example, systems analysts and computer programmers generally meet the duties requirements for the administrative exemption if their primary duty includes work such as planning, scheduling, and coordinating activities required to develop systems to solve complex business, scientific or engineering problems of the employer or the employer's customers. Similarly, a senior or lead computer programmer who manages the work of two or more other programmers in a customarily recognized department or subdivision of the employer, and whose recommendations as to the hiring, firing, advancement, promotion or other change of status of the other programmers are given particular weight, generally meets the duties requirements for the executive exemption.

# Subpart F—Outside Sales Employees
§ 541.500
General rule for outside sales employees.
(a) The term “employee employed in the capacity of outside salesman” in section 13(a)(1) of the Act shall mean any employee:
(1) Whose primary duty is:
(i) making sales within the meaning of section 3(k) of the Act, or
(ii) obtaining orders or contracts for services or for the use of facilities for which a consideration will be paid by the client or customer; and
(2) Who is customarily and regularly engaged away from the employer's place or places of business in performing such primary duty.
(b) The term “primary duty” is defined at § 541.700. In determining the primary duty of an outside sales employee, work performed incidental to and in conjunction with the employee's own outside sales or solicitations, including incidental deliveries and collections, shall be regarded as exempt
outside sales work. Other work that furthers the employee's sales efforts also shall be regarded as exempt work including, for example, writing sales reports, updating or revising the employee's sales or display catalogue, planning itineraries and attending sales conferences.
(c) The requirements of subpart G (salary requirements) of this part do not apply to the outside sales employees described in this section.
§ 541.501
Making sales or obtaining orders.
(a) Section 541.500 requires that the employee be engaged in:
(1) Making sales within the meaning of section 3(k) of the Act, or
(2) Obtaining orders or contracts for services or for the use of facilities.
(b) Sales within the meaning of section 3(k) of the Act include the transfer of title to tangible property, and in certain cases, of tangible and valuable evidences of intangible property. Section 3(k) of the Act states that “sale” or “sell” includes any sale, exchange, contract to sell, consignment for sale, shipment for sale, or other disposition.
(c) Exempt outside sales work includes not only the sales of commodities, but also “obtaining orders or contracts for services or for the use of facilities for which a consideration will be paid by the client or customer.” Obtaining orders for “the use of facilities” includes the selling of time on radio or television, the solicitation of advertising for newspapers and other periodicals, and the solicitation of freight for railroads and other transportation agencies.
(d) The word “services” extends the outside sales exemption to employees who sell or take orders for a service, which may be performed for the customer by someone other than the person taking the order.
§ 541.502
Away from employer's place of business.
An outside sales employee must be customarily and regularly engaged “away from the employer's place or places of business.” The outside sales employee is an employee who makes sales at the customer's place of business or, if selling door-to-door, at the customer's home. Outside sales does not include sales made by mail, telephone or the Internet unless such contact is used merely as an adjunct to personal calls. Thus, any fixed site, whether home or office, used by a salesperson as a headquarters or for telephonic solicitation of sales is considered one of the employer's places of business, even though the employer is not in any formal sense the owner or tenant of the property. However, an outside sales employee does not lose the exemption by displaying samples in hotel sample rooms during trips from city to city; these sample rooms should not be considered as the employer's places of business. Similarly, an outside sales employee does not lose the exemption by displaying the employer's products at a trade show. If selling actually occurs, rather than just sales promotion, trade shows of short duration (
i.e.,
one or two weeks) should not be considered as the employer's place of business.
§ 541.503
Promotion work.
(a) Promotion work is one type of activity often performed by persons who make sales, which may or may not be exempt outside sales work, depending upon the circumstances under which it is performed. Promotional work that is actually performed incidental to and in conjunction with an employee's own outside sales or solicitations is exempt work. On the other hand, promotional work that is incidental to sales made, or to be made, by someone else is not exempt outside sales work. An employee who does not satisfy the requirements of this subpart may still qualify as an exempt employee under other subparts of this rule.
(b) A manufacturer's representative, for example, may perform various types of promotional activities such as putting up displays and posters, removing damaged or spoiled stock from the merchant's shelves or rearranging the merchandise. Such an employee can be considered an exempt outside sales employee if the employee's primary duty is making sales or contracts. Promotion activities directed toward consummation of the employee's own sales are exempt. Promotional activities designed to stimulate sales that will be
made by someone else are not exempt outside sales work.
(c) Another example is a company representative who visits chain stores, arranges the merchandise on shelves, replenishes stock by replacing old with new merchandise, sets up displays and consults with the store manager when inventory runs low, but does not obtain a commitment for additional purchases. The arrangement of merchandise on the shelves or the replenishing of stock is not exempt work unless it is incidental to and in conjunction with the employee's own outside sales. Because the employee in this instance does not consummate the sale nor direct efforts toward the consummation of a sale, the work is not exempt outside sales work.
§ 541.504
Drivers who sell.
(a) Drivers who deliver products and also sell such products may qualify as exempt outside sales employees only if the employee has a primary duty of making sales. In determining the primary duty of drivers who sell, work performed incidental to and in conjunction with the employee's own outside sales or solicitations, including loading, driving or delivering products, shall be regarded as exempt outside sales work.
(b) Several factors should be considered in determining if a driver has a primary duty of making sales, including, but not limited to: a comparison of the driver's duties with those of other employees engaged as truck drivers and as salespersons; possession of a selling or solicitor's license when such license is required by law or ordinances; presence or absence of customary or contractual arrangements concerning amounts of products to be delivered; description of the employee's occupation in collective bargaining agreements; the employer's specifications as to qualifications for hiring; sales training; attendance at sales conferences; method of payment; and proportion of earnings directly attributable to sales.
(c) Drivers who may qualify as exempt outside sales employees include:
(1) A driver who provides the only sales contact between the employer and the customers visited, who calls on customers and takes orders for products, who delivers products from stock in the employee's vehicle or procures and delivers the product to the customer on a later trip, and who receives compensation commensurate with the volume of products sold.
(2) A driver who obtains or solicits orders for the employer's products from persons who have authority to commit the customer for purchases.
(3) A driver who calls on new prospects for customers along the employee's route and attempts to convince them of the desirability of accepting regular delivery of goods.
(4) A driver who calls on established customers along the route and persuades regular customers to accept delivery of increased amounts of goods or of new products, even though the initial sale or agreement for delivery was made by someone else.
(d) Drivers who generally would not qualify as exempt outside sales employees include:
(1) A route driver whose primary duty is to transport products sold by the employer through vending machines and to keep such machines stocked, in good operating condition, and in good locations.
(2) A driver who often calls on established customers day after day or week after week, delivering a quantity of the employer's products at each call when the sale was not significantly affected by solicitations of the customer by the delivering driver or the amount of the sale is determined by the volume of the customer's sales since the previous delivery.
(3) A driver primarily engaged in making deliveries to customers and performing activities intended to promote sales by customers (including placing point-of-sale and other advertising materials, price stamping commodities, arranging merchandise on shelves, in coolers or in cabinets, rotating stock according to date, and cleaning and otherwise servicing display cases), unless such work is in furtherance of the driver's own sales efforts.

# Subpart G—Salary Requirements
§ 541.600
Amount of salary required.
(a)
Standard salary level.
To qualify as an exempt executive, administrative, or professional employee under section 13(a)(1) of the Act, an employee must be compensated on a salary basis at a rate per week of not less than the amount set forth in paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this section, exclusive of board, lodging or other facilities, unless paragraph (b) or (c) of this section applies. Administrative and professional employees may also be paid on a fee basis, as defined in § 541.605.
(1) Beginning on July 1, 2024, $844 per week (the 20th percentile of weekly earnings of full-time nonhourly workers in the lowest-wage Census Region and/or retail industry nationally).
(2) Beginning on January 1, 2025, $1,128 per week (the 35th percentile of weekly earnings of full-time nonhourly workers in the lowest-wage Census Region).
(3) As of July 1, 2027, the level calculated pursuant to § 541.607(b)(1).
(b)
Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands.
To qualify as an exempt executive, administrative, or professional employee under section 13(a)(1) of the Act, an employee in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, Puerto Rico, or the U.S. Virgin Islands employed by employers other than the Federal Government must be compensated on a salary basis at a rate of not less than $455 per week, exclusive of board, lodging or other facilities. Administrative and professional employees may also be paid on a fee basis, as defined in § 541.605.
(c)
American Samoa.
To qualify as an exempt executive, administrative, or professional employee under section 13(a)(1) of the Act, an employee in American Samoa employed by employers other than the Federal Government must be compensated on a salary basis at a rate of not less than $380 per week, exclusive of board, lodging or other facilities. Administrative and professional employees may also be paid on a fee basis, as defined in § 541.605.
(d)
Frequency of payment.
The salary level requirement may be translated into equivalent amounts for periods longer than one week. For example, the $1,128 per week requirement described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section would be met if the employee is compensated biweekly on a salary basis of not less than $2,256, semimonthly on a salary basis of not less than $2,444, or monthly on a salary basis of not less than $4,888. However, the shortest period of payment that will meet this compensation requirement is one week.
(e)
Alternative salary level for academic administrative employees.
In the case of academic administrative employees, the salary level requirement also may be met by compensation on a salary basis at a rate at least equal to the entrance salary for teachers in the educational establishment by which the employee is employed, as provided in § 541.204(a)(1).
(f)
Hourly rate for computer employees.
In the case of computer employees, the compensation requirement also may be met by compensation on an hourly basis at a rate not less than $27.63 an hour, as provided in § 541.400(b).
(g)
Exceptions to the standard salary criteria.
In the case of professional employees, the compensation requirements in this section shall not apply to employees engaged as teachers (
see
§ 541.303); employees who hold a valid license or certificate permitting the practice of law or medicine or any of their branches and are actually engaged in the practice thereof (
see
§ 541.304); or to employees who hold the requisite academic degree for the general practice of medicine and are engaged in an internship or resident program pursuant to the practice of the profession (
see
§ 541.304). In the case of medical occupations, the exception from the salary or fee requirement does not apply to pharmacists, nurses, therapists, technologists, sanitarians, dietitians, social workers, psychologists, psychometrists, or other professions which service the medical profession.
[89 FR 32971, Apr. 26, 2024]
§ 541.601
Highly compensated employees.
(a) An employee shall be exempt under section 13(a)(1) of the Act if the
employee receives total annual compensation of not less than the amount set forth in paragraph (a)(1) through (4) of this section, and the employee customarily and regularly performs any one or more of the exempt duties or responsibilities of an executive, administrative, or professional employee identified in subpart B, C, or D of this part:
(1) Beginning on July 1, 2024, $132,964 per year (the annualized earnings amount of the 80th percentile of full-time nonhourly workers nationally).
(2) Beginning on January 1, 2025, $151,164 per year (the annualized earnings amount of the 85th percentile of full-time nonhourly workers nationally).
(3) As of July 1, 2027, the total annual compensation level calculated pursuant to § 541.607(b)(2).
(4) Where the annual period covers periods during which multiple total annual compensation levels apply, the amount of total annual compensation due will be determined on a proportional basis.
(b)(1) Total annual compensation must include at least a weekly amount equal to that required by § 541.600(a)(1) through (3) paid on a salary or fee basis as set forth in §§ 541.602 and 541.605, except that § 541.602(a)(3) shall not apply to highly compensated employees. Total annual compensation may also include commissions, nondiscretionary bonuses and other nondiscretionary compensation earned during a 52-week period. Total annual compensation does not include board, lodging and other facilities as defined in § 541.606, and does not include payments for medical insurance, payments for life insurance, contributions to retirement plans and the cost of other fringe benefits.
(2) If an employee's total annual compensation does not total at least the amount set forth in paragraph (a) of this section by the last pay period of the 52-week period, the employer may, during the last pay period or within one month after the end of the 52-week period, make one final payment sufficient to achieve the required level. For example, for a 52-week period beginning January 1, 2025, an employee may earn $135,000 in base salary, and the employer may anticipate based upon past sales that the employee also will earn $20,000 in commissions. However, due to poor sales in the final quarter of the year, the employee only earns $14,000 in commissions. In this situation, the employer may within one month after the end of the year make a payment of at least $2,164 to the employee. Any such final payment made after the end of the 52-week period may count only toward the prior year's total annual compensation and not toward the total annual compensation in the year it was paid. If the employer fails to make such a payment, the employee does not qualify as a highly compensated employee, but may still qualify as exempt under subpart B, C, or D of this part.
(3) An employee who does not work a full year for the employer, either because the employee is newly hired after the beginning of the year or ends the employment before the end of the year, may qualify for exemption under this section if the employee receives a
pro rata
portion of the minimum amount established in paragraph (a) of this section, based upon the number of weeks that the employee will be or has been employed. An employer may make one final payment as under paragraph (b)(2) of this section within one month after the end of employment.
(4) The employer may utilize any 52-week period as the year, such as a calendar year, a fiscal year, or an anniversary of hire year. If the employer does not identify some other year period in advance, the calendar year will apply.
(c) A high level of compensation is a strong indicator of an employee's exempt status, thus eliminating the need for a detailed analysis of the employee's job duties. Thus, a highly compensated employee will qualify for exemption if the employee customarily and regularly performs any one or more of the exempt duties or responsibilities of an executive, administrative or professional employee identified in subparts B, C or D of this part. An employee may qualify as a highly compensated executive employee, for example, if the employee customarily and regularly directs the work of two or more other employees, even though the employee does not meet all of the
other requirements for the executive exemption under § 541.100.
(d) This section applies only to employees whose primary duty includes performing office or non-manual work. Thus, for example, non-management production-line workers and non-management employees in maintenance, construction and similar occupations such as carpenters, electricians, mechanics, plumbers, iron workers, craftsmen, operating engineers, longshoremen, construction workers, laborers and other employees who perform work involving repetitive operations with their hands, physical skill and energy are not exempt under this section no matter how highly paid they might be.

§ 541.602
Salary basis.
(a)
General rule.
An employee will be considered to be paid on a “salary basis” within the meaning of this part if the employee regularly receives each pay period on a weekly, or less frequent basis, a predetermined amount constituting all or part of the employee's compensation, which amount is not subject to reduction because of variations in the quality or quantity of the work performed.
(1) Subject to the exceptions provided in paragraph (b) of this section, an exempt employee must receive the full salary for any week in which the employee performs any work without regard to the number of days or hours worked. Exempt employees need not be paid for any workweek in which they perform no work.
(2) An employee is not paid on a salary basis if deductions from the employee's predetermined compensation are made for absences occasioned by the employer or by the operating requirements of the business. If the employee is ready, willing and able to work, deductions may not be made for time when work is not available.
(3) Up to ten percent of the salary amount required by § 541.600(a) through (c) may be satisfied by the payment of nondiscretionary bonuses, incentives, and commissions, that are paid annually or more frequently. The employer may utilize any 52-week period as the year, such as a calendar year, a fiscal year, or an anniversary of hire year. If the employer does not identify some other year period in advance, the calendar year will apply. This provision does not apply to highly compensated employees under § 541.601.
(i) If by the last pay period of the 52-week period the sum of the employee's weekly salary plus nondiscretionary bonus, incentive, and commission payments received is less than 52 times the weekly salary amount required by § 541.600(a) through (c), the employer may make one final payment sufficient to achieve the required level no later than the next pay period after the end of the year. Any such final payment made after the end of the 52-week period may count only toward the prior year's salary amount and not toward the salary amount in the year it was paid.
(ii) An employee who does not work a full 52-week period for the employer, either because the employee is newly hired after the beginning of this period or ends the employment before the end of this period, may qualify for exemption if the employee receives a
pro rata
portion of the minimum amount established in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, based upon the number of weeks that the employee will be or has been employed. An employer may make one final payment as under paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section within one pay period after the end of employment.
(b)
Exceptions.
The prohibition against deductions from pay in the salary basis requirement is subject to the following exceptions:
(1) Deductions from pay may be made when an exempt employee is absent from work for one or more full days for personal reasons, other than sickness or disability. Thus, if an employee is absent for two full days to handle personal affairs, the employee's salaried status will not be affected if deductions are made from the salary for two full-day absences. However, if an exempt employee is absent for one and a half days for personal reasons, the employer can deduct only for the one full-day absence.
(2) Deductions from pay may be made for absences of one or more full days occasioned by sickness or disability (including work-related accidents) if the deduction is made in accordance with a bona fide plan, policy or practice of providing compensation for loss of salary occasioned by such sickness or disability. The employer is not required to pay any portion of the employee's salary for full-day absences for which the employee receives compensation under the plan, policy or practice. Deductions for such full-day absences also may be made before the employee has qualified under the plan, policy or practice, and after the employee has exhausted the leave allowance thereunder. Thus, for example, if an employer maintains a short-term disability insurance plan providing salary replacement for 12 weeks starting on the fourth day of absence, the employer may make deductions from pay for the three days of absence before the employee qualifies for benefits under the plan; for the twelve weeks in which the employee receives salary replacement benefits under the plan; and for absences after the employee has exhausted the 12 weeks of salary replacement benefits. Similarly, an employer may make deductions from pay for absences of one or more full days if salary replacement benefits are provided under a State disability insurance law or under a State workers' compensation law.
(3) While an employer cannot make deductions from pay for absences of an exempt employee occasioned by jury duty, attendance as a witness or temporary military leave, the employer can offset any amounts received by an employee as jury fees, witness fees or military pay for a particular week against the salary due for that particular week without loss of the exemption.
(4) Deductions from pay of exempt employees may be made for penalties imposed in good faith for infractions of safety rules of major significance. Safety rules of major significance include those relating to the prevention of serious danger in the workplace or to other employees, such as rules prohibiting smoking in explosive plants, oil refineries and coal mines.
(5) Deductions from pay of exempt employees may be made for unpaid disciplinary suspensions of one or more full days imposed in good faith for infractions of workplace conduct rules. Such suspensions must be imposed pursuant to a written policy applicable to all employees. Thus, for example, an employer may suspend an exempt employee without pay for three days for violating a generally applicable written policy prohibiting sexual harassment. Similarly, an employer may suspend an exempt employee without pay for twelve days for violating a generally applicable written policy prohibiting workplace violence.
(6) An employer is not required to pay the full salary in the initial or terminal week of employment. Rather, an employer may pay a proportionate part of an employee's full salary for the time actually worked in the first and last week of employment. In such weeks, the payment of an hourly or daily equivalent of the employee's full salary for the time actually worked will meet the requirement. However, employees are not paid on a salary basis within the meaning of these regulations if they are employed occasionally for a few days, and the employer pays them a proportionate part of the weekly salary when so employed.
(7) An employer is not required to pay the full salary for weeks in which an exempt employee takes unpaid leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act. Rather, when an exempt employee takes unpaid leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act, an employer may pay a proportionate part of the full salary for time actually worked. For example, if an employee who normally works 40 hours per week uses four hours of unpaid leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act, the employer could deduct 10 percent of the employee's normal salary that week.
(c) When calculating the amount of a deduction from pay allowed under paragraph (b) of this section, the employer may use the hourly or daily equivalent of the employee's full weekly salary or any other amount proportional to the time actually missed by the employee. A deduction from pay as a penalty for violations of major safety
rules under paragraph (b)(4) of this section may be made in any amount.
[69 FR 22260, Apr. 23, 2004, as amended at 81 FR 32550, May 23, 2016; 84 FR 51307, Sept. 27, 2019; 89 FR 32972, Apr. 26, 2024]
§ 541.603
Effect of improper deductions from salary.
(a) An employer who makes improper deductions from salary shall lose the exemption if the facts demonstrate that the employer did not intend to pay employees on a salary basis. An actual practice of making improper deductions demonstrates that the employer did not intend to pay employees on a salary basis. The factors to consider when determining whether an employer has an actual practice of making improper deductions include, but are not limited to: the number of improper deductions, particularly as compared to the number of employee infractions warranting discipline; the time period during which the employer made improper deductions; the number and geographic location of employees whose salary was improperly reduced; the number and geographic location of managers responsible for taking the improper deductions; and whether the employer has a clearly communicated policy permitting or prohibiting improper deductions.
(b) If the facts demonstrate that the employer has an actual practice of making improper deductions, the exemption is lost during the time period in which the improper deductions were made for employees in the same job classification working for the same managers responsible for the actual improper deductions. Employees in different job classifications or who work for different managers do not lose their status as exempt employees. Thus, for example, if a manager at a company facility routinely docks the pay of engineers at that facility for partial-day personal absences, then all engineers at that facility whose pay could have been improperly docked by the manager would lose the exemption; engineers at other facilities or working for other managers, however, would remain exempt.
(c) Improper deductions that are either isolated or inadvertent will not result in loss of the exemption for any employees subject to such improper deductions, if the employer reimburses the employees for such improper deductions.
(d) If an employer has a clearly communicated policy that prohibits the improper pay deductions specified in § 541.602(a) and includes a complaint mechanism, reimburses employees for any improper deductions and makes a good faith commitment to comply in the future, such employer will not lose the exemption for any employees unless the employer willfully violates the policy by continuing to make improper deductions after receiving employee complaints. If an employer fails to reimburse employees for any improper deductions or continues to make improper deductions after receiving employee complaints, the exemption is lost during the time period in which the improper deductions were made for employees in the same job classification working for the same managers responsible for the actual improper deductions. The best evidence of a clearly communicated policy is a written policy that was distributed to employees prior to the improper pay deductions by, for example, providing a copy of the policy to employees at the time of hire, publishing the policy in an employee handbook or publishing the policy on the employer's Intranet.
(e) This section shall not be construed in an unduly technical manner so as to defeat the exemption.
§ 541.604
Minimum guarantee plus extras.
(a) An employer may provide an exempt employee with additional compensation without losing the exemption or violating the salary basis requirement, if the employment arrangement also includes a guarantee of at least the minimum weekly-required amount paid on a salary basis. Thus, for example under the salary requirement described in § 541.600(a)(2), an exempt employee guaranteed at least $1,128 each week paid on a salary basis may also receive additional compensation of a one percent commission on sales. An exempt employee also may receive a percentage of the sales or profits of the employer if the employment arrangement also includes a
guarantee of at least $1,128 each week paid on a salary basis. Similarly, the exemption is not lost if an exempt employee who is guaranteed at least $1,128 each week paid on a salary basis also receives additional compensation based on hours worked for work beyond the normal workweek. Such additional compensation may be paid on any basis (e.g., flat sum, bonus payment, straight-time hourly amount, time and one-half or any other basis), and may include paid time off.
(b) An exempt employee's earnings may be computed on an hourly, a daily or a shift basis, without losing the exemption or violating the salary basis requirement, if the employment arrangement also includes a guarantee of at least the minimum weekly required amount paid on a salary basis regardless of the number of hours, days or shifts worked, and a reasonable relationship exists between the guaranteed amount and the amount actually earned. The reasonable relationship test will be met if the weekly guarantee is roughly equivalent to the employee's usual earnings at the assigned hourly, daily or shift rate for the employee's normal scheduled workweek. Thus, for example under the salary requirement described in § 541.600(a)(2), an exempt employee guaranteed compensation of at least $1,210 for any week in which the employee performs any work, and who normally works four or five shifts each week, may be paid $350 per shift without violating the $1,128 per week salary basis requirement. The reasonable relationship requirement applies only if the employee's pay is computed on an hourly, daily or shift basis. It does not apply, for example, to an exempt store manager paid a guaranteed salary per week that exceeds the current salary level who also receives a commission of one-half percent of all sales in the store or five percent of the store's profits, which in some weeks may total as much as, or even more than, the guaranteed salary.
[84 FR 51307, Sept. 27, 2019, as amended by 89 FR 32972, Apr. 26, 2024]
§ 541.605
Fee basis.
(a) Administrative and professional employees may be paid on a fee basis, rather than on a salary basis. An employee will be considered to be paid on a “fee basis” within the meaning of these regulations if the employee is paid an agreed sum for a single job regardless of the time required for its completion. These payments resemble piecework payments with the important distinction that generally a “fee” is paid for the kind of job that is unique rather than for a series of jobs repeated an indefinite number of times and for which payment on an identical basis is made over and over again. Payments based on the number of hours or days worked and not on the accomplishment of a given single task are not considered payments on a fee basis.
(b) To determine whether the fee payment meets the minimum amount of salary required for exemption under these regulations, the amount paid to the employee will be tested by determining the time worked on the job and whether the fee payment is at a rate that would amount to at least the minimum salary per week, as required by §§ 541.600(a) through (c) and 541.602(a), if the employee worked 40 hours. Thus, for example under the salary requirement described in § 541.600(a)(2), an artist paid $600 for a picture that took 20 hours to complete meets the $1,128 minimum salary requirement for exemption since earnings at this rate would yield the artist $1,200 if 40 hours were worked.
[69 FR 22260, Apr. 23, 2004, as amended at 81 FR 32551, May 23, 2016; 84 FR 51308, Sept. 27, 2019; 89 FR 32972, Apr. 26, 2024]
§ 541.606
Board, lodging or other facilities.
(a) To qualify for exemption under section 13(a)(1) of the Act, an employee must earn the minimum salary amount set forth in § 541.600, “exclusive of board, lodging or other facilities.” The phrase “exclusive of board, lodging or other facilities” means “free and clear” or independent of any claimed credit for non-cash items of value that an employer may provide to an employee. Thus, the costs incurred by an employer to provide an employee with board, lodging or other facilities may not count towards the minimum salary amount required for exemption under
this part 541. Such separate transactions are not prohibited between employers and their exempt employees, but the costs to employers associated with such transactions may not be considered when determining if an employee has received the full required minimum salary payment.
(b) Regulations defining what constitutes “board, lodging, or other facilities” are contained in 29 CFR part 531. As described in 29 CFR 531.32, the term “other facilities” refers to items similar to board and lodging, such as meals furnished at company restaurants or cafeterias or by hospitals, hotels, or restaurants to their employees; meals, dormitory rooms, and tuition furnished by a college to its student employees; merchandise furnished at company stores or commissaries, including articles of food, clothing, and household effects; housing furnished for dwelling purposes; and transportation furnished to employees for ordinary commuting between their homes and work.
§ 541.607
Regular updates to amounts of salary and compensation required.
(a)
Initial update
—(1)
Standard salary level.
Beginning on July 1, 2024, the amount required to be paid per week to an exempt employee on a salary or fee basis, as applicable, pursuant to § 541.600(a)(1) will be not less than $844.
(2)
Highly compensated employees.
Beginning on July 1, 2024, the amount required to be paid in total annual compensation to an exempt highly compensated employee pursuant to § 541.601(a)(1) will be not less than $132,964.

(ii) The Secretary will determine the future update amounts by applying the methodology in effect under § 541.600(a) at the time the Secretary issues the notice required by paragraph (b)(3) of this section to current earnings data.
(2)
Highly compensated employees.
(i) As of July 1, 2027, and every 3 years thereafter, the amount required to be paid in total annual compensation to an exempt highly compensated employee pursuant to § 541.601(a) will be updated to reflect current earnings data.
(ii) The Secretary will determine the future update amounts by applying the methodology used to determine the total annual compensation amount in effect under § 541.601(a) at the time the Secretary issues the notice required by paragraph (b)(3) of this section to current earnings data.
(3)
Notice.
(i) Not fewer than 150 days before each future update of the earnings requirements under paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section, the Secretary will publish a notice in the
Federal Register
stating the updated amounts based on the most recent available 4 quarters of CPS MORG data, or its successor publication, as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
(ii) No later than the effective date of the updated earnings requirements, the Wage and Hour Division will publish on its website the updated amounts for employees paid pursuant to this part.
(4)
Delay of updates.
A future update to the earnings thresholds under this section is delayed from taking effect for a period of 120 days if the Secretary has separately published a notice of proposed rulemaking in the
Federal Register,
not fewer than 150 days before the date the update is set to take effect, proposing changes to the earnings threshold(s) and/or updating mechanism due to unforeseen economic or other conditions. The Secretary must state in the notice issued pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section that the scheduled update is delayed in accordance with this paragraph (b)(4). If the Secretary does not issue a final rule affecting the scheduled update to the earnings thresholds by the end of the 120-day extension period, the updated amounts published in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this section will take effect upon the expiration of the 120-day period. The 120-day delay of a scheduled update under this paragraph will not change the effective dates for future updates of the earnings requirements under this section.
[89 FR 32972, Apr. 26, 2024]

# Subpart H—Definitions and Miscellaneous Provisions
§ 541.700
Primary duty.
(a) To qualify for exemption under this part, an employee's “primary duty” must be the performance of exempt work. The term “primary duty” means the principal, main, major or most important duty that the employee performs. Determination of an employee's primary duty must be based on all the facts in a particular case, with the major emphasis on the character of the employee's job as a whole. Factors to consider when determining the primary duty of an employee include, but are not limited to, the relative importance of the exempt duties as compared with other types of duties; the amount of time spent performing exempt work; the employee's relative freedom from direct supervision; and the relationship between the employee's salary and the wages paid to other employees for the kind of nonexempt work performed by the employee.
(b) The amount of time spent performing exempt work can be a useful guide in determining whether exempt work is the primary duty of an employee. Thus, employees who spend more than 50 percent of their time performing exempt work will generally satisfy the primary duty requirement. Time alone, however, is not the sole test, and nothing in this section requires that exempt employees spend more than 50 percent of their time performing exempt work. Employees who do not spend more than 50 percent of their time performing exempt duties may nonetheless meet the primary duty requirement if the other factors support such a conclusion.
(c) Thus, for example, assistant managers in a retail establishment who perform exempt executive work such as supervising and directing the work of other employees, ordering merchandise, managing the budget and authorizing payment of bills may have management as their primary duty even if the assistant managers spend more than 50 percent of the time performing nonexempt work such as running the cash register. However, if such assistant managers are closely supervised and earn little more than the nonexempt employees, the assistant managers generally would not satisfy the primary duty requirement.
§ 541.701
Customarily and regularly.
The phrase “customarily and regularly” means a frequency that must be greater than occasional but which, of course, may be less than constant. Tasks or work performed “customarily and regularly” includes work normally and recurrently performed every workweek; it does not include isolated or one-time tasks.
§ 541.702
Exempt and nonexempt work.
The term “exempt work” means all work described in §§ 541.100, 541.101, 541.200, 541.300, 541.301, 541.302, 541.303, 541.304, 541.400 and 541.500, and the activities directly and closely related to such work. All other work is considered “nonexempt.”
§ 541.703
Directly and closely related.
(a) Work that is “directly and closely related” to the performance of exempt work is also considered exempt work. The phrase “directly and closely related” means tasks that are related to exempt duties and that contribute to or facilitate performance of exempt work. Thus, “directly and closely related” work may include physical tasks and menial tasks that arise out of exempt duties, and the routine work without which the exempt employee's exempt work cannot be performed properly. Work “directly and closely related” to the performance of exempt duties may also include recordkeeping; monitoring and adjusting machinery; taking notes; using the computer to create documents or presentations; opening the mail for the purpose of reading it and making decisions; and using a photocopier or fax machine. Work is not “directly and closely related” if the work is remotely related or completely unrelated to exempt duties.
(b) The following examples further illustrate the type of work that is and is not normally considered as directly and closely related to exempt work:
(1) Keeping time, production or sales records for subordinates is work directly and closely related to an exempt
executive's function of managing a department and supervising employees.
(2) The distribution of materials, merchandise or supplies to maintain control of the flow of and expenditures for such items is directly and closely related to the performance of exempt duties.
(3) A supervisor who spot checks and examines the work of subordinates to determine whether they are performing their duties properly, and whether the product is satisfactory, is performing work which is directly and closely related to managerial and supervisory functions, so long as the checking is distinguishable from the work ordinarily performed by a nonexempt inspector.
(4) A supervisor who sets up a machine may be engaged in exempt work, depending upon the nature of the industry and the operation. In some cases the setup work, or adjustment of the machine for a particular job, is typically performed by the same employees who operate the machine. Such setup work is part of the production operation and is not exempt. In other cases, the setting up of the work is a highly skilled operation which the ordinary production worker or machine tender typically does not perform. In large plants, non-supervisors may perform such work. However, particularly in small plants, such work may be a regular duty of the executive and is directly and closely related to the executive's responsibility for the work performance of subordinates and for the adequacy of the final product. Under such circumstances, it is exempt work.
(5) A department manager in a retail or service establishment who walks about the sales floor observing the work of sales personnel under the employee's supervision to determine the effectiveness of their sales techniques, checks on the quality of customer service being given, or observes customer preferences is performing work which is directly and closely related to managerial and supervisory functions.
(6) A business consultant may take extensive notes recording the flow of work and materials through the office or plant of the client; after returning to the office of the employer, the consultant may personally use the computer to type a report and create a proposed table of organization. Standing alone, or separated from the primary duty, such note-taking and typing would be routine in nature. However, because this work is necessary for analyzing the data and making recommendations, the work is directly and closely related to exempt work. While it is possible to assign note-taking and typing to nonexempt employees, and in fact it is frequently the practice to do so, delegating such routine tasks is not required as a condition of exemption.
(7) A credit manager who makes and administers the credit policy of the employer, establishes credit limits for customers, authorizes the shipment of orders on credit, and makes decisions on whether to exceed credit limits would be performing work exempt under § 541.200. Work that is directly and closely related to these exempt duties may include checking the status of accounts to determine whether the credit limit would be exceeded by the shipment of a new order, removing credit reports from the files for analysis, and writing letters giving credit data and experience to other employers or credit agencies.
(8) A traffic manager in charge of planning a company's transportation, including the most economical and quickest routes for shipping merchandise to and from the plant, contracting for common-carrier and other transportation facilities, negotiating with carriers for adjustments for damages to merchandise, and making the necessary rearrangements resulting from delays, damages or irregularities in transit, is performing exempt work. If the employee also spends part of the day taking telephone orders for local deliveries, such order-taking is a routine function and is not directly and closely related to the exempt work.
(9) An example of work directly and closely related to exempt professional duties is a chemist performing menial tasks such as cleaning a test tube in the middle of an original experiment, even though such menial tasks can be assigned to laboratory assistants.
(10) A teacher performs work directly and closely related to exempt duties when, while taking students on a field
trip, the teacher drives a school van or monitors the students' behavior in a restaurant.
§ 541.704
Use of manuals.
The use of manuals, guidelines or other established procedures containing or relating to highly technical, scientific, legal, financial or other similarly complex matters that can be understood or interpreted only by those with advanced or specialized knowledge or skills does not preclude exemption under section 13(a)(1) of the Act or the regulations in this part. Such manuals and procedures provide guidance in addressing difficult or novel circumstances and thus use of such reference material would not affect an employee's exempt status. The section 13(a)(1) exemptions are not available, however, for employees who simply apply well-established techniques or procedures described in manuals or other sources within closely prescribed limits to determine the correct response to an inquiry or set of circumstances.
§ 541.705
Trainees.
The executive, administrative, professional, outside sales and computer employee exemptions do not apply to employees training for employment in an executive, administrative, professional, outside sales or computer employee capacity who are not actually performing the duties of an executive, administrative, professional, outside sales or computer employee.
§ 541.706
Emergencies.
(a) An exempt employee will not lose the exemption by performing work of a normally nonexempt nature because of the existence of an emergency. Thus, when emergencies arise that threaten the safety of employees, a cessation of operations or serious damage to the employer's property, any work performed in an effort to prevent such results is considered exempt work.
(b) An “emergency” does not include occurrences that are not beyond control or for which the employer can reasonably provide in the normal course of business. Emergencies generally occur only rarely, and are events that the employer cannot reasonably anticipate.
(c) The following examples illustrate the distinction between emergency work considered exempt work and routine work that is not exempt work:
(1) A mine superintendent who pitches in after an explosion and digs out workers who are trapped in the mine is still a bona fide executive.
(2) Assisting nonexempt employees with their work during periods of heavy workload or to handle rush orders is not exempt work.
(3) Replacing a nonexempt employee during the first day or partial day of an illness may be considered exempt emergency work depending on factors such as the size of the establishment and of the executive's department, the nature of the industry, the consequences that would flow from the failure to replace the ailing employee immediately, and the feasibility of filling the employee's place promptly.
(4) Regular repair and cleaning of equipment is not emergency work, even when necessary to prevent fire or explosion; however, repairing equipment may be emergency work if the breakdown of or damage to the equipment was caused by accident or carelessness that the employer could not reasonably anticipate.
§ 541.707
Occasional tasks.
Occasional, infrequently recurring tasks that cannot practicably be performed by nonexempt employees, but are the means for an exempt employee to properly carry out exempt functions and responsibilities, are considered exempt work. The following factors should be considered in determining whether such work is exempt work: Whether the same work is performed by any of the exempt employee's subordinates; practicability of delegating the work to a nonexempt employee; whether the exempt employee performs the task frequently or occasionally; and existence of an industry practice for the exempt employee to perform the task.
§ 541.708
Combination exemptions.
Employees who perform a combination of exempt duties as set forth in
the regulations in this part for executive, administrative, professional, outside sales and computer employees may qualify for exemption. Thus, for example, an employee whose primary duty involves a combination of exempt administrative and exempt executive work may qualify for exemption. In other words, work that is exempt under one section of this part will not defeat the exemption under any other section.
§ 541.709
Motion picture producing industry.
The requirement that the employee be paid “on a salary basis” does not apply to an employee in the motion picture producing industry who is compensated at a base rate of at least $1,043 per week (exclusive of board, lodging, or other facilities). Thus, an employee in this industry who is otherwise exempt under subparts B, C, or D of this part, and who is employed at a base rate of at least the applicable current minimum amount a week is exempt if paid a proportionate amount (based on a week of not more than 6 days) for any week in which the employee does not work a full workweek for any reason. Moreover, an otherwise exempt employee in this industry qualifies for exemption if the employee is employed at a daily rate under the following circumstances:
(a) The employee is in a job category for which a weekly base rate is not provided and the daily base rate would yield at least the minimum weekly amount if 6 days were worked; or
(b) The employee is in a job category having the minimum weekly base rate and the daily base rate is at least one-sixth of such weekly base rate.
[81 FR 32552, May 23, 2016, as amended at 84 FR 51308, Sept. 27, 2019]
§ 541.710
Employees of public agencies.
(a) An employee of a public agency who otherwise meets the salary basis requirements of § 541.602 shall not be disqualified from exemption under §§ 541.100, 541.200, 541.300 or 541.400 on the basis that such employee is paid according to a pay system established by statute, ordinance or regulation, or by a policy or practice established pursuant to principles of public accountability, under which the employee accrues personal leave and sick leave and which requires the public agency employee's pay to be reduced or such employee to be placed on leave without pay for absences for personal reasons or because of illness or injury of less than one work-day when accrued leave is not used by an employee because:
(1) Permission for its use has not been sought or has been sought and denied;
(2) Accrued leave has been exhausted; or
(3) The employee chooses to use leave without pay.
(b) Deductions from the pay of an employee of a public agency for absences due to a budget-required furlough shall not disqualify the employee from being paid on a salary basis except in the workweek in which the furlough occurs and for which the employee's pay is accordingly reduced.

§ 547.0
Scope and effect of part.
(a) The regulations in this part set forth the requirements of a “bona fide thrift or savings plan” under section 7(e)(3)(b) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended (hereinafter called the Act). In determining the total remuneration for employment which section 7(e) of the Act requires to be included in the regular rate at which an employee is employed, it is not necessary to include any sums paid to or on behalf of such employee, in recognition of services performed by him during a given period, which are paid pursuant to a bona fide thrift or savings plan meeting the requirements set forth herein. In the formulation of these regulations due regard has been
given to the factors and standards set forth in section 7(e)(3)(b) of the Act.
(b) Where a thrift or savings plan is combined in a single program (whether in one or more documents) with a plan or trust for providing profit-sharing payments to employees, or with a plan or trust for providing old age, retirement, life, accident or health insurance or similar benefits for employees, contributions made by the employer pursuant to such thrift or savings plan may be excluded from the regular rate if the plan meets the requirements of the regulation in this part and the contributions made for the other purposes may be excluded from the regular rate if they meet the tests set forth in regulations. Part 549, or the tests set forth in Interpretative Bulletin, part 778 of this chapter, §§ 778.214 and 778.215, as the case may be.
§ 547.1
Essential requirements for qualifications.
(a) A “bona fide thrift or savings plan” for the purpose of section 7(e)(3)(b) of the Act is required to meet all the standards set forth in paragraphs (b) through (f) of this section and must not contain the disqualifying provisions set forth in § 547.2.
(b) The thrift or savings plan constitutes a definite program or arrangement in writing, adopted by the employer or by contract as a result of collective bargaining and communicated or made available to the employees, which is established and maintained, in good faith, for the purpose of encouraging voluntary thrift or savings by employees by providing an incentive to employees to accumulate regularly and retain cash savings for a reasonable period of time or to save through the regular purchase of public or private securities.
(c) The plan specifically shall set forth the category or categories of employees participating and the basis of their eligibility. Eligibility may not be based on such factors as hours of work, production, or efficiency of the employees'
Provided, however,
That hours of work may be used to determine eligibility of part-time or casual employees.
(d) The amount any employee may save under the plan shall be specified in the plan or determined in accordance with a definite formula specified in the plan, which formula may be based on one or more factors such as the straight-time earnings or total earnings, base rate of pay, or length of service of the employee.
(e) The employer's total contribution in any year may not exceed 15 percent of the participating employees' total earnings during that year. In addition, the employer's total contribution in any year may not exceed the total amount saved or invested by the participating employees during that year:
Provided, however,
That a plan permitting a greater contribution may be submitted to the Administrator and approved by him as a “bona fide thrift or savings plan” within the meaning of section 7(e)(3)(b) of the Act if:
(1) The plan meets all the other standards of this section;
(2) The plan contains none of the disqualifying factors enumerated in § 547.2;
(3) The employer's contribution is based to a substantial degree upon retention of savings; and
(4) The amount of the employer's contribution bears a reasonable relationship to the amount of savings retained and the period of retention.
(f) The employer's contributions shall be apportioned among the individual employees in accordance with a definite formula or method of calculation specified in the plan, which formula or method of calculation is based on the amount saved or the length of time the individual employee retains his savings or investment in the plan:
Provided,
That no employee's share determined in accordance with the plan may be diminished because of any other remuneration received by him.

§ 548.1
Scope and effect of regulations.
The regulations for computing overtime pay under sections 7(g)(1) and 7(g)(2) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended (“the Act” or “FLSA”), for employees paid on the basis of a piece rate, or at a variety of hourly rates or piece rates, or a combination thereof, are set forth in §§ 778.415 through 778.421. Payment of overtime compensation in accordance with other subsections of section 7 of the Act is explained in part 778 of this title (Interpretive Bulletin on Overtime Compensation).
[20 FR 5679, Aug. 6, 1955, as amended at 84 FR 68769, Dec. 16, 2019]
§ 548.2
General conditions.
The requirements of section 7 of the Act with respect to the payment of overtime compensation to an employee for a workweek longer than the applicable number of hours established in section 7(a) of the Act, will be met under the provisions of section 7(g)(3) of the Act by payments which satisfy all the following standards:
(a) Overtime compensation computed in accordance with this part and section 7(g)(3) of the Act is paid pursuant to an agreement or understanding arrived at between the employer and the employee or as a result of collective bargaining before performance of the work;
(b) A rate is established by such agreement or understanding as the basic rate to be used in computing overtime compensation thereunder;
(c) The established basic rate is a specified rate or a rate which can be derived from the application of a specified method of calculation;
(d) The established basic rate is a bona fide rate and is not less than the minimum hourly rate required by applicable law;
(e) The basic rate so established is authorized by § 548.3 or is authorized by the Administrator under § 548.4 as being substantially equivalent to the average
hourly earnings of the employee, exclusive of overtime premiums, in the particular work over a representative period of time;
(f) Overtime hours are compensated at a rate of not less than one and one-half times such established basic rate;
(g) The hours for which the employee is paid not less than one and one-half times such established basic rate qualify as overtime hours under section 7(e) (5), (6), or (7) of the Act;
(h) The number of hours for which the employee is paid not less than one and one-half times such established basic rate equals or exceeds the number of hours worked by him in any workweek in excess of the maximum workweek applicable to such employees under subsection 7(a) of the Act;
(i) The employee's average hourly earnings for the workweek exclusive of payments described in paragraphs (1) through (7) of section 7(e) of the Act are not less than the minimum hourly rate required by this Act or other applicable law;
(j) Extra overtime compensation is properly computed and paid on other forms of additional pay which have not been considered in arriving at the basic rate but which are required to be included in computing the regular rate.
[20 FR 5679, Aug. 6, 1955, as amended at 26 FR 7731, Aug. 18, 1961]
§ 548.3
Authorized basic rates.
A rate which meets all of the conditions of § 548.2 and which in addition satisfies all the conditions set forth in one of the following paragraphs will be regarded as being substantially equivalent to the average hourly earnings of the employee, exclusive of overtime premiums, in the particular work over a representative period of time and may be used in computing overtime compensation for purposes of section 7(g)(3) of the Act, and § 548.2:
(a) A rate per hour which is obtained by dividing a monthly or semi-monthly salary by the number of regular working days in each monthly or semi-monthly period and then by the number or hours in the normal or regular workday. Such a rate may be used to compute overtime compensation for all the overtime hours worked by the employee during the monthly or semimonthly period for which the salary is paid.
(b) A rate per hour which is obtained by averaging the earnings, exclusive of payments described in paragraphs (1) through (7) of section 7(e) of the Act, of the employee for all work performed during the workday or any other longer period not exceeding sixteen calendar days for which such average is regularly computed under the agreement or understanding. Such a rate may be used to compute overtime compensation for all the overtime hours worked by the employee during the particular period for which the earnings average is computed.
(c) A rate per hour which is obtained by averaging the earnings, exclusive of payments described in paragraphs (1) through (7) of section 7(e) of the Act, of the employee for each type of work performed during each workweek, or any other longer period not exceeding sixteen calendar days, for which such average is regularly computed under the agreement or understanding. Such a rate may be used to compute overtime compensation, during the particular period for which such average is computed, for all the overtime hours worked by the employee at the type of work for which the rate is obtained.
(d) The rate or rates which may be used under the Act to compute overtime compensation of the employee but excluding the cost of meals where the employer customarily furnishes not more than a single meal per day.
(e) The rate or rates (not less than the rates required by section 6(a) and (b) of the Act) which may be used under the Act to compute overtime compensation of the employee but excluding additional payments in cash or in kind which, if included in the computation of overtime under the Act, would not increase the total compensation of the employee by more than 40 percent of the applicable hourly minimum wage under either section 6(a) of the Act or the state or local law applicable in the jurisdiction in which the employee is employed, whichever is higher, per week on the average for all overtime weeks (in excess of the number of hours applicable under section 7(a) of the Act) in the period for which such additional payments are made.
(f)(1) A rate per hour for each workweek equal to the average hourly remuneration of the employee for employment during the annual period or the quarterly period immediately preceding the calendar or fiscal quarter year in which such workweek ends, provided: (i) It is a fact, confirmed by proper records of the employer, that the terms, conditions, and circumstances of employment during such prior period, including weekly hours of work, work assignments and duties, and the basis of remuneration for employment, were not significantly different from the terms, conditions, and circumstances of employment which affect the employee's regular rates of pay during the current quarter year, or differ only because of some change in basic salary or similar nonfluctuating factor for which suitable adjustments have been made in the calculations to accurately reflect such change and (ii) such average hourly remuneration during the prior period is computed by the method or methods authorized in the following paragraphs.
(2) The average hourly remuneration on which the rate authorized in paragraph (f)(1) of this section is based shall be computed: (i) By totaling all remuneration for employment during the workweeks ending in the prior period (including all earnings at hourly or piece rates, bonuses, commission or other incentive payments, and other forms of remuneration paid to or on behalf of the employee) except overtime premiums and other payments excluded from the regular rate pursuant to provisions of section 7(e) of the Act, and (ii) by dividing the amount thus obtained by the number of hours worked in such prior period for which such compensation was paid.
(3) Where it is not practicable for an employer to compute the total remuneration of an employee for employment in the prior period in time to determine obligations under the Act for the current quarter year (as where computation of bonus, commission, or incentive payments cannot be made immediately at the end of the period), a one month grace period may be used. If this one month grace period is used, it will be deemed in compliance with paragraph (f)(1) of this section to use the basic rate authorized therein for the quarter commencing one month after the next preceding four-quarter or quarter-year period (whichever length period is adopted as the base period for the rate determination). Once the grace period method of computation is adopted it must be used for each successive quarter.

§ 548.4
Application for authorization of a “basic rate.”
(a) Application may be made by any employer or group of employers, for authorization of a basic rate or rates, other than those approved under § 548.3. Application must be made jointly with any collective bargaining representative of employees covered by the application. Application must be made to the Administrator of the Wage and Hour Division, U.S. Department of Labor, Washington, DC 20210.
(b) Each application shall contain the following:
(1) A statement of the agreement or understanding arrived at between the employer and employee, including the proposed effective date, the term of the agreement or understanding, and a statement of the applicable overtime provisions, and
(2) A description of the basic rate of the method or formula to be used in computing the basic rate for the type of work or position to which it will be applicable, and
(3) A statement of the kinds of jobs or employees covered by the agreement, and
(4) The facts and reasons relied upon to show that the basic rate so established is substantially equivalent to the average hourly earnings of the employee, exclusive of overtime premiums, in the particular work over a representative period of time. For such showing, a basic rate shall be deemed “substantially equivalent” to the average hourly earnings of the employee if, during a representative period, the employee's total overtime earnings calculated at the basic rate in accordance with the applicable overtime provisions are substantially equivalent to the amount of such earnings when
computed in accordance with section 7(a) of the Act on the basis of the employee's average hourly earnings for each workweek, and
(5) Such additional information as the Administrator may require.
(c) The Administrator shall require that notice of the application be given to affected employees in such manner as he deems appropriate. The Administrator shall notify the applicants in writing of his decision as to each application.
(d) In authorizing a basic rate pursuant to this part, the Administrator shall include such conditions as are necessary to insure that the basic rate will be used only so long as it is substantially equivalent to the average hourly earnings of the employee, exclusive of overtime premiums, in the particular work over a representative period of time, and such other conditions as are necessary or appropriate to insure compliance with the provisions of the Act.
(e) The Administrator may at any time, upon his own motion or upon written request of any interested party setting forth reasonable grounds therefor, and after a hearing or other opportunity to interested persons to present their views, amend or revoke any authorization granted under this part.

# Subpart B—Interpretations

# Introduction
§ 548.100
Introductory statement.
(a) This subpart contains material explaining and illustrating the terms used in subpart A of this part which were issued under section 7(g)(3) of the Fair Labor Standards Act. The purpose of section 7(g)(3) of the Act, and subpart A of this part, is to provide an exception from the requirements of computing overtime pay at the regular rate,
1
and to allow, under specific conditions, the use of an established “basic” rate
2
instead. Basic rates are alternatives to the regular rate of pay under section 7(a), and their use is optional. The use of basic rates is principally intended to simplify bookkeeping and computation of overtime pay.
1
The regular rate is the average hourly earnings of an employee for a workweek. See §§ 778.107 to 778.122 of this chapter on overtime compensation. Sections 7(g)(1) and 7(g)(2) of the Act permit overtime compensation to be computed, under specified conditions, at time and one-half the bona fide hourly or piece rate applicable to the work performed during the overtime hours. See §§ 778.415 to 778.421 of this chapter.
2
The term “basic” rate as used in this part means the rate authorized under section 7(g)(3) of the Fair Labor Standards Act. Such a rate may be used to compute overtime compensation under the Walsh-Healey Public Contracts Act. (See Rulings and Interpretations No. 3. section 42(e)(1)). However, the term “basic” rate in this part should not be confused with the more general use of the term in the Public Contracts Act to describe all rates which may be used to compute overtime compensation or the use of the term in any other statute.
(b) Section 7(g) of the Fair Labor Standards Act provides that an employer will comply with the overtime requirements of the Act if:
* * * pursuant to an agreement or understanding arrived at between the employer and the employee before performance of the work, the amount paid to the employee for the number of hours worked by him in such workweek in excess of the maximum workweek applicable to such employee under such subsection [7](a):
(3) is computed at a rate not less than one and one-half times the rate established by such agreement or understanding as the basic rate to be used in computing overtime compensation thereunder:
Provided,
That the rate so established shall be authorized by regulation by the Secretary of Labor as being substantially equivalent to the average hourly earnings of the employee, exclusive of overtime premiums, in the particular work over a representative period of time; and if (i) the employee's average hourly earnings for the workweek exclusive of payments described in paragraphs (1) through (7) of subsection (e) are not less than the minimum hourly rate required by applicable law, and (ii) extra overtime compensation is properly computed and paid on other forms of additional pay required to be included in computing the regular rate.
[20 FR 5680, Aug. 6, 1955, as amended at 26 FR 7731, Aug. 18, 1961]

# Requirements for a Basic Rate
§ 548.200
Requirements.
The following conditions must be satisfied if a “basic” rate is to be considered proper under section 7(g)(3) and subpart A of this part.
(a)
Agreement or understanding.
There must be an agreement or understanding establishing a basic rate or rates. This agreement must be arrived at before performance of the work to which it is intended to apply. It may be arrived at directly with the employee or through his representative. The “basic” rate method of computing overtime may be used for as many of the employees in an establishment as the employer chooses, provided he has reached an agreement or understanding with these employees prior to the performance of the work.
3
3
The records which an employer is required to maintain and preserve for an employee compensated for overtime hours on the basis of a basic rate are described in §§ 516.5(b)(5) and 516.21 of this subchapter.
(b)
The rate.
The established basic rate may be a specified rate or a rate which can be derived from the application of a specified method of calculation. For instance, under certain conditions the Regulations permit the use of the daily average hourly earnings of the employee as a basis for computing daily overtime.
4
Thus, a method rather than a specific rate is authorized. Also, under certain conditions, the cost of a single meal a day furnished to employees may be excluded from the computation of overtime pay.
5
It is the exclusion of the cost of the meals that is authorized and each employee's rate of pay, whatever it may be—an hourly rate, a piece rate or a salary—is his basic rate.
4
See § 548.302.
5
See § 548.304.
(c)
Minimum wage.
The employee's average hourly earnings for the workweek (exclusive of overtime pay and other pay which may be excluded from the regular rate)
6
and the established basic rate used to compute overtime pay may not be less than the legal minimum.
7
6
See §§ 778.200 through 778.225 of this chapter for further discussion of what payments may be excluded.
7
The legal minimum is the highest rate required by the Fair Labor Standards Act or other Federal, State or local law.
[20 FR 5680, Aug. 6, 1955, as amended at 21 FR 338, Jan. 18, 1956]

# Authorized Basic Rates
§ 548.300
Introductory statement.
Section 548.3 contains a description of a number of basic rates any one of which, when established by agreement or understanding, is authorized for use without prior specific approval of the Administrator. These basic rates have been found in use in industry and the Administrator has determined that they are substantially equivalent to the straight-time average hourly earnings of the employee over a representative period of time. The authorized basic rates are described below.
[20 FR 5681, Aug. 6, 1955]
§ 548.301
Salaried employees.
(a) Section 548.3(a) authorizes as an established basic rate: “A rate per hour which is obtained by dividing a monthly or semi-monthly salary by the number of regular working days in each monthly or semi-monthly period and then by the number of hours in the normal or regular workday. Such a rate may be used to compute overtime compensation for all the overtime hours worked by the employee during the monthly or semi-monthly period for which the salary is paid.”
(b) Section 548.3(a) may be applied to salaried employees paid on a monthly or semi-monthly basis. Under section 7(a) of the Act the method of computing the regular rate of pay for an employee who is paid on a monthly or semi-monthly salary basis is to reduce the salary to its weekly equivalent by multiplying the monthly salary by 12 (the number of months) or the semi-monthly salary by 24, and dividing by 52 (the number of weeks). The weekly equivalent is then divided by the number of hours in the week which the salary is intended to compensate.
8
Section 548.3(a) is designed to provide an alternative method of computing the
rate for overtime purposes in the case of an employee who is compensated on a monthly or semi-monthly salary basis, where this method is found more desirable. This method is applicable only where the salary is paid for a specified number of days per week and a specified number of hours per day normally or regularly worked by the employee. It permits the employer to take into account the variations in the number of regular working days in each pay period. The basic rate authorized by § 548.3(a) is obtained by dividing the monthly or semi-monthly salary by the number of regular working days in the month or half-month, and then by the number of hours of the normal or regular work day.
8
See § 778.113 of this chapter.

# Example.
An employee is compensated at a semi-monthly salary of $154 for a workweek of 5 days of 8 hours each, Monday through Friday. If a particular half-month begins on Tuesday and ends on the second Tuesday following, there are 11 working days in that half-month. The employee's basic rate would then be computed by dividing the $154 salary by 11 working days of 8 hours each, or 88 hours. The basic rate in this situation would therefore be $1.75 an hour. The basic rate would remain the same regardless of the fact that the employee did not actually work 11 days of 8 hours each because of the occurrence of a holiday, or because the employee took a day off, or because he worked longer than 8 hours on some days during the period, or because he worked fewer than 8 hours on some days, or because he worked more then 11 days. In any of these circumstances the employee's basic rate would still be $1.75 an hour. If in the next semimonthly period there are 10 working days the rate would be computed by dividing the salary of $154 by 80 working hours, or 10 days of 8 hours each. The basic rate would therefore be $1.925 an hour. The rate would remain $1.925 an hour even though the employee did not in fact work ten 8-hour days during the period for the reasons indicated above, or for any other reason.
(c) The overtime compensation for each workweek should be computed at not less than time and one-half the established basic rate applicable in the period during which the overtime is worked. Thus, in the example given above all overtime worked in the first half-month would be computed at not less than time and one-half the basic rate of $1.75 an hour; in the second half-month overtime would be paid for at not less than time and one-half the rate of $1.925 an hour. Where a workweek overlaps two semimonthly periods part of the overtime may be performed in one semimonthly period and part in another semimonthly period with a different basic rate. If it is desired to avoid computing overtime compensation in the same workweek at two different rates, the employment arrangement may provide that overtime compensation for each workweek should be computed at the established basic rate applicable in the half-monthly or monthly period during which the workweek ends.

)
[20 FR 5681, Aug. 6, 1955, as amended at 32 FR 3293, Feb. 25, 1967]
§ 548.302
Average earnings for period other than a workweek.
(a) Section 548.3(b) authorizes as an established basic rate: “A rate per hour which is obtained by averaging the earnings, exclusive of payments described in paragraphs (1) through (7) of section 7(e) of the act, of the employee for all work performed during the workday or any other longer period not exceeding sixteen calendar days for which such average is regularly computed under the agreement or understanding. Such a rate may be used to compute overtime compensation for all the overtime hours worked by the employee during the particular period for which the earnings average is computed.”
(b)(1) The ordinary method of computing overtime under the act is at the employee's regular rate of pay, obtained by averaging his hourly earnings for each workweek. Section 548.3(b) authorizes overtime to be computed on the basis of the employee's average hourly earnings for a period longer or shorter than a workweek. It permits the payment of overtime compensation on the basis of average hourly earnings for a day, a week, two weeks or any period up to 16 calendar days, if the period is established and agreed to with the employee prior to
the performance of the work.
9
The agreement or understanding may contemplate that the basic rate will be the average hourly earnings for a day or a specified number of days within the sixteen day limit, or it may provide that the basic rate will be the average hourly earnings for the period required to complete a specified job or jobs.
9
Averaging over periods in excess of 16 calendar days may in appropriate cases be authorized by the Administrator under § 548.4.

# Example 1.
An employee is employed on a piece-work basis with overtime after 8 hours a day and on Saturday. Ordinarily his overtime compensation would be computed by averaging his earnings for the entire workweek to arrive at the regular rate of pay and then computing the overtime compensation due. Under this subsection of the regulations the employer and the employee may agree to compute overtime on the basis of the average hourly earnings for each day. Similarly, in a situation involving a bi-weekly or a semi-monthly pay period the employer may find it convenient to compute overtime on the basis of the average hourly earnings for the bi-weekly or semi-monthly period.
10
10
See § 548.301 (c) for a discussion of the method of computing overtime for an employee paid on a semi-monthly basis.

# Example 2.
An employee, who normally would come within the forty hour provision of section 7(a) of the Act, is paid a fixed amount of money for the completion of each job. Each job takes 2 or 3 days to complete. Under the employment agreement, the employee is entitled to time and one-half an authorized basic rate for all hours worked in excess of forty in the workweek. The authorized basic rate is the employee's average hourly earnings for each job. Suppose he completes two jobs in a particular workweek and all his overtime hours are on job No. 2. The employee's average hourly earnings on job No. 2 may be used to compute his overtime pay.
(2) In this connection it should be noted that although the basic rate is obtained by averaging earnings over a period other than a workweek the number of overtime hours under the act must be determined on a workweek basis.
(c) In computing the basic rate under § 548.3(b), the employer may exclude from the computation the payments which he could exclude in computing the “regular” rate of pay.

See §§ 778.200 through 778.225 of this chapter for an explanation of what payments may be excluded.

§ 548.303
Average earnings for each type of work.
(a) Section 548.3(c) authorizes as an established basic rate: “A rate per hour which is obtained by averaging the earnings, exclusive of payments described in paragraphs (1) through (7) of section 7(e) of the act, of the employee for each type of work performed during each workweek, or any other longer period not exceeding sixteen calendar days, for which such average is regularly computed under the agreement or understanding. Such a rate may be used to compute overtime compensation, during the particular period for which such average is computed, for all the overtime hours worked by the employee at the type of work for which the rate is obtained.”
(b) Section 548.3(c) differs from § 548.3(b) in this way: Section 548.3(b) provides for the computation of the basic rate on the average of all earnings during the specified period; § 548.3(c) permits the basic rate to be computed on the basis of the earnings for each particular type of work. Thus, if the employee performs different types of work, each involving a different rate of pay such as different piece-rate, job rates, or a combination of these with hourly rates, a separate basic rate may be computed for each type of work and overtime computed on the basis of the rate or rates applicable to the type of work performed during the overtime hours.

# Example.
An employee who is paid on a weekly basis with overtime after 40 hours works six 8-hour days in a workweek under an agreement or understanding reached pursuant to this subsection. He performs three different types of piecework, each at a different rate of pay. The basic rates to be used for computing overtime in this situation would be arrived at by dividing the earnings for each type of work by the number of hours during which that type of work was performed. There would thus be three different basic rates, one for each type of work. Since
the overtime hours used in this illustration occur on the sixth day, the types of work performed on the sixth day would determine the basic rate or rates on which overtime would be computed that week. Thus, if the average hourly earnings for the three types of work are respectively $1.70 an hour in type A, $1.80 an hour in type B, and $2 an hour in type C, and on the sixth day the employee works on type B, his overtime premium for the sixth day would be one-half the basic rate of $1.80 an hour, multiplied by the 8 hours worked on that day.

§ 548.304
Excluding value of lunches furnished.
(a) Section 548.3(d) authorizes as established basic rates:
The rate or rates which may be used under the Act to compute overtime compensation of the employee but excluding the cost of meals where the employer customarily furnishes not more than a single meal per day.
(b) It is the purpose of § 548.3(d) to permit the employer upon agreement with his employees to omit from the computation of overtime the cost of a free daily lunch or other single daily meal furnished to the employees. The policy behind § 548.3(d) is derived from the Administrator's experience that the amount of additional overtime compensation involved in such cases is trivial and does not justify the bookkeeping required in computing it. Section 548.3(d) is applicable only in cases where the employer customarily furnishes no more than a single meal a day. If more than one meal a day is customarily furnished by the employer all such meals must be taken into account in computing the regular rate of pay and the overtime compensation due.
12
In a situation where the employer furnishes three meals a day to his employees he may not, under § 548.3(d), omit one of the three meals in computing overtime compensation. However, if an employer furnishes a free lunch every day and, in addition, occasionally pays “supper money”
13
when the employees work overtime, the cost of the lunches and the supper money may both be excluded from the overtime rates.

§ 548.305
Excluding certain additions to wages.
(a) See § 548.3(e) for authorized established basic rates.
(b) Section 548.3(e) permits the employer, upon agreement or understanding with the employee, to omit from the computation of overtime certain incidental payments which have a trivial effect on the overtime compensation due. Examples of payments which may be excluded are: modest housing, bonuses or prizes of various sorts, tuition paid by the employer for the employee's attendance at a school, and cash payments or merchandise awards for soliciting or obtaining new business. It may also include such things as payment by the employer of the employee's social security tax.
(c) The exclusion of one or more additional payments under § 548.3(e) must not affect the overtime compensation of the employee by more than 40 percent of the applicable hourly minimum wage under either section 6(a) of the Act or the state or local law applicable in the jurisdiction in which the employee is employed, whichever is higher, per week on the average for the overtime weeks.
(1)
Example.
An employee, who normally would come within the 40-hour provision of section 7(a) of the Act, is paid a cost-of-living bonus of $1300 each calendar quarter, or $100 per week. The employee works overtime in only 2 weeks in the 13-week period, and in each of these overtime weeks he works 50 hours. He is therefore entitled to $10 as overtime compensation on the bonus for each week in which overtime was worked (
i.e.,
$100 bonus divided by 50 hours equals $2 an hour; 10 overtime hours, times one-half, times $2 an hour, equals $10 per week). Forty percent of the minimum wage of $7.25 is $2.90 (this example assumes the employee works in a state or locality that does not have a minimum wage that is higher than the minimum wage under the FLSA). Since the overtime on the bonus is more than $2.90 on the average for the 2 overtime weeks, this cost-of-
living bonus would be included in the overtime computation under § 548.3(e).
(2) [Reserved]
(d) It is not always necessary to make elaborate computations to determine whether the effect of the exclusion of a bonus or other incidental payment on the employee's total compensation will exceed 40 percent of the applicable hourly minimum wage under either section 6(a) of the Act or the state or local law applicable in the jurisdiction in which the employee is employed, whichever is higher, per week on the average. Frequently the addition to regular wages is so small or the number of overtime hours is so limited that under any conceivable circumstances exclusion of the additional payments from the rate used to compute the employee's overtime compensation would not affect the employee's total earnings by more than 40 percent of the applicable hourly minimum wage under either section 6(a) of the Act or the state or local law applicable in the jurisdiction in which the employee is employed, whichever is higher, per week. The determination that this is so may be made by inspection of the payroll records or knowledge of the normal working hours.
(1)
Example.
An employer has a policy of giving employees who have a perfect attendance record during a 4-week period a bonus of $50. The employee never works more than 50 hours a week. Exclusion of this attendance bonus from the rate of pay used to compute overtime compensation could not affect the employee's total earnings by more than $2.90 per week (
i.e.,
40 percent of the minimum wage of $7.25, assuming the employee works in a state or locality that does not have a minimum wage that is higher than the minimum wage under the FLSA).
14
14
For a 50-hour week, an employee's bonus would have to exceed $29 a week to affect his overtime compensation by more than $2.90 (
i.e.,
40 percent of the minimum wage of $7.25). ($30 ÷ 50 hours worked × 10 overtime hours × 0.5).
(2) [Reserved]
(e) There are many situations in which the employer and employee cannot predict with any degree of certainty the amount of bonus to be paid at the end of the bonus period. They may not be able to anticipate with any degree of certainty the number of hours an employee might work each week during the bonus period. In such situations, the employer and employee may agree prior to the performance of the work that a bonus will be disregarded in the computation of overtime pay if the employee's total earnings are not affected by more than 40 percent of the applicable hourly minimum wage under either section 6(a) of the Act or the state or local law applicable in the jurisdiction in which the employee is employed, whichever is higher, per week on the average for all overtime weeks during the bonus period. If it turns out at the end of the bonus period that the effect on the employee's total compensation would exceed 40 percent of the applicable minimum wage under either section 6(a) of the Act or the state or local law applicable in the jurisdiction in which the employee is employed, whichever is higher, per week on the average, then additional overtime compensation must be paid on the bonus. (See § 778.209 of this chapter, for an explanation of how to compute overtime on the bonus).
(f) In order to determine whether the exclusion of a bonus or other incidental payment would affect the total compensation of the employee by not more than 40 percent of the applicable hourly minimum wage under either section 6(a) of the Act or the state or local law applicable in the jurisdiction in which the employee is employed, whichever is higher, per week on the average, a comparison is made between his total compensation computed under the employment agreement and his total compensation computed in accordance with the applicable overtime provisions of the Act.
(1)
Example.
An employee, who normally would come within the 40-hour provision of section 7(a) of the Act, is paid at piece rates and at one and one-half times the applicable piece rates for work performed during hours in excess of 40 in the workweek. The employee is also paid a bonus, which when apportioned over the bonus period, amounts to $10 a week. He never works more than 50 hours a week. The piece rates could be established as basic
rates under the employment agreement and no additional overtime compensation paid on the bonus. The employee's total compensation computed in accordance with the applicable overtime provision of the Act, section 7(g)(1)
15
would be affected by not more than $1 in any week by not paying overtime compensation on the bonus.
16
15
Section 7(g)(1) of the Act provides that overtime compensation may be paid at one and one-half times the applicable piece rate but extra overtime compensation must be properly computed and paid on additional pay required to be included in computing the regular rate.
16
Bonus of $10 divided by fifty hours equals 20 cents an hour. Half of this hourly rate multiplied by ten overtime hours equals $1.
(2) [Reserved]
(g) Section 548.3(e) is not applicable to employees employed at subminimum wage rates under learner certificates, or special certificates for handicapped workers, or in the case of employees in Puerto Rico or the Virgin Islands employed at special minimum rates authorized by wage orders issued pursuant to the Act.
[31 FR 6769, May 6, 1966, as amended at 84 FR 68769, Dec. 16, 2019]
§ 548.306
Average earnings for year or quarter year preceding the current quarter.
(a) Section 548.3(f)(1) authorizes as an established basic rate:
A rate per hour for each workweek equal to the average hourly remuneration of the employee for employment during the annual period or the quarterly period immediately preceding the calendar or fiscal quarter year in which such workweek ends, provided (i) it is a fact, confirmed by proper records of the employer, that the terms, conditions, and circumstances of employment during such prior period, including weekly hours of work, work assignments and duties, and the basis of remuneration for employment, were not significantly different from the terms, conditions, and circumstances of employment which affect the employee's regular rates of pay during the current quarter year, and (ii) such average hourly remuneration during the prior period is computed by the method or methods authorized in the following subparagraphs.
(b) There may be circumstances in which it would be impossible or highly impracticable for an employer at the end of a pay period to compute, allocate, and pay to an employee certain kinds of remuneration for employment during that pay period. This may be true in the case of such types of compensation as commissions, recurring bonuses, and other incentive payments which are calculated on work performance over a substantial period of time. Since the total amount of straight-time remuneration is unknown at the time of payment the full regular rate cannot be ascertained and overtime compensation could not be paid immediately except for the provisions of § 548.3(f). In many such situations, the necessity for any subsequent computation and payment of the additional overtime compensation due on these types of remuneration can be avoided and all overtime premium pay due under the Act, including premium pay due on such a commission, bonus or incentive payment, can be paid at the end of the pay period rather than at some later date, if the parties to the employment agreement so desire. This is authorized by § 548.3(f)(1), which provides an alternate method of paying overtime premium pay by permitting an employer, under certain conditions, to use an established basic rate for computing overtime premium pay at the end of each pay period rather than waiting until some later date when the exact amounts of the commission, bonus, or other incentive payment can be ascertained. Such established rate may also be used in other appropriate situations where the parties desire to avoid the necessity of recomputing the regular rate from week to week.
(c)(1) The rate authorized by §§ 548.3(f)(1) is an average hourly rate based on earnings and hours worked during the workweeks ending in a representative period consisting of either the four quarter-years or the last quarter-year immediately preceding the calendar or fiscal quarter-year in which the established rate is to be used. Such a rate may be used only if it is a fact, confirmed by proper records of the employer, that the terms, conditions, and circumstances of employment during this prior period were not significantly different from those affecting the employee's regular rates of
pay during the current quarterly period. Significant differences in weekly hours of work, work assignments and duties, the basis of remuneration for employment, or other factors in the employment which could result in substantial differences in regular rates of pay as between the two periods will render the use of an established rate based on such a prior period inappropriate, and its use is not authorized under such circumstances.
(2) However, an increase in the basic salary or other constant factor would not preclude the use of such a rate provided that accurate adjustments are made. For instance, assume that during the previous annual period an employee was compensated on the basis of a weekly salary of $70 plus a commission of 1 percent of sales. If his weekly salary is raised to $80 for the next annual period (assuming he still receives his commission of 1 percent of sales) the annual rate on which the established rate is to be computed must be adjusted by an increase of $520 ($10 × 52 weeks). For instance, assume the above employee earned a total of $4,244 and worked 2,318 hours during the previous annual period when his salary was $70 per week. Normally his established basic rate would be computed by dividing 2,318 hours into $4,244, thus arriving at a rate of $1.83. However, since the rate must reflect the increase in salary it must be computed by adding the anticipated increase to the pay received during the previous annual period ($4,244 + $520 = $4,764). The established basic rate would then be $2.05.
(d) Establishment of the rate explained in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section is authorized under the circumstances there stated, provided it is computed in accordance with § 548.3(f)(2), which prescribes the following method: First, all of the employees' remuneration for employment during the workweeks ending in the representative four-quarter or quarter-year period immediately preceding the current quarter, except overtime premiums and other payments excluded from the regular rate under section 7(e) of the Act, must be totaled. All straight-time earnings at hourly or piece rates or in the form of salary, commissions, bonus or other incentive payments, and board, lodging, or other facilities to the extent required under section 3(m) of the Act and Part 531 of this chapter, together with all other forms of remuneration paid to or on behalf of the employee must be included in the above total. Second, this total sum must be divided by the total number of hours worked during all the workweeks ending in the prior period for which such remuneration was paid. The average hourly rate obtained through this division may be used as the established rate for computing overtime compensation in any workweek, in which the employee works in excess of the applicable maximum standard number of hours, ending in the calendar or fiscal quarter-year period following the four-quarter or quarterly period used for determination of this rate. This is authorized irrespective of any fluctuations of average straight-time hourly earnings above or below such rate from workweek to workweek within the quarter.
(e) As a variant to the method of computation described in paragraph (d) of this section, it is provided in § 548.3(f)(3), with respect to situations where it is not practicable for an employer to compute the total remuneration of an employee for employment in the prior period in time to determine obligations under the Act for the current quarter year, a one-month grace period may be used. This method is authorized, for example, in employment situations where the computation of bonuses, commissions, or other incentive payments cannot be made immediately at the end of the four-quarter or quarterly base period. If this one month grace period is used, it will be deemed in compliance with § 548.3(f)(1) to use the basic rate authorized therein for the quarter commencing one month after the next preceding four-quarter or quarter-year period. To illustrate, suppose an employer and employee agree that the employee will be paid for overtime work at one and one-half times a basic rate computed in accordance with § 548.3(f)(1), but on the pay day for the first workweek ending in the current quarter his records do not show all commissions earned by the employee in the preceding quarter. The employer and employee may therefore
elect to use a one month grace period. This would mean that a basic rate for the quarter January 1-March 31, for example, which is derived from the prior four-quarter (January 1-December 31) or quarterly (October 1-December 31) period, as the case may be, would be applied during a quarterly period commencing one month later (February 1-April 30) than the period (January 1-March 31) in which it would otherwise be applicable. The same adjustment would be made in succeeding quarters. Once the grace method of computation is adopted it must be used for each successive quarter.
(f) The established basic rate must be designated and substantiated in the employer's records as required by part 516 of this chapter, and other requirements of such part with respect to records must be met. An agreement or understanding between the parties to use such rate must be reached prior to the quarter-year period in which the work to which it is applied is performed. The agreement or understanding may be limited to a fixed period or may be a continuing one, but use of the established rate under such an agreement or understanding is not authorized for any period in which terms, conditions, and circumstances of employment become significantly different from those obtaining during the period from which the rate was derived. This method of computation cannot be used if there is any change in the employee's position, method of pay, or amount of salary or if the employee was not employed during the full period used to determine the rate.
(g) To function properly and to provide, over an extended period, overtime premium pay substantially equivalent to the pay the employee would receive if overtime were paid on the true regular rate, the plan must provide that overtime be computed on the established basic rate in every overtime week without regard to the fact that in some weeks the employee receives more premium pay than he would using the true regular rate and in some weeks less. Plans initiated pursuant to this section are based on averages and, if properly applied, will yield substantially the same overtime compensation in a representative period as the employee would have received if it were computed on the true regular rate.
(h) The following examples assume the employee is due overtime premium pay for hours worked over 40 in the workweek.
(1)
Example.
A sales employee whose applicable maximum hours standard is 40 hours enters into an agreement with his employer that he will be paid a salary plus a commission based on a certain percentage of sales. He agrees that this compensation will constitute his total straight-time earnings for all hours worked each week, provided such compensation equals or exceeds the applicable minimum wage.
The employee further agrees that he is to receive overtime premium pay for each workweek on the normal pay day for that week; based each quarter on one-half his established basic rate derived by taking the hourly average of the total straight-time remuneration he received during the workweeks ending in the four-quarter period immediately preceding the current quarter. For example, his established basic rate for each workweek ending in the first quarter of 1964 (January through March) is determined by computing his average hourly rate for employment during all workweeks ending in the four quarter periods of 1963.
Assume the employee worked the following number of hours and received the straight-time pay indicated:

The employee's basic rate for the first quarter of 1964 (line 6) is determined by the hours worked and pay received in the four previous quarters (lines 1, 2, 3 and 4). Total pay received during that period ($4,488.00, line 5) is divided by the total hours worked (2,200 hours, line 5) to derive the established basic rate ($2.04 per hour). This is the hourly rate on which overtime is computed in
each workweek ending in the first quarter of 1964 in which the employee worked in excess of the applicable maximum hours standard. For instance, if in the first week of that quarter the employee worked 47 hours he would be due his guaranteed salary, his commission (at a later date) plus $7.14 as overtime premium pay (7 hours × 2.04 × 1/2). It does not matter that the employee actually earned and ultimately received $90.71 in salary and commission as his total straight-time pay for that week and that his true hourly rate would be only $1.93 ($90.71 ÷ 47 hours). The established basic rate is an average rate and is designed to be used, and must be used, in every overtime week in the quarter for which it was computed, without regard to the employee's true hourly rate in the particular week.
The employee's basic rate for the second quarter of 1964 will be similarly computed at the end of the first quarter of that year by adding together the hours worked and pay received in the second, third, and fourth quarters of 1963 and the first quarter of 1964 (lines 2, 3, 4 and 6) so that the totals now reflect the figures in line 7. The regular rate is again computed by dividing pay received ($4,582.00) by hours worked (2,181) and the new basic rate would be $2.10.
(2)
Example.
Assume that an employee employed under a similar arrangement agrees to receive overtime premium pay for each workweek on the normal pay day, based each quarter on one-half his established basic rate determined by the
quarterly
method rather than by the
annual
method previously discussed. His established basic rate for the first quarter of 1964 would therefore be determined by computing his average hourly rate for the
last quarter
of 1963. To illustrate, if in the latter quarter the employee received $1,156.00 in straight time compensation and worked 561 hours, his basic rate for the first quarter of 1964 would therefore be $2.06 ($1,156.00 ÷ 561 hours). During the overtime weeks in this quarter there would be due him, in addition to his straight time compensation, premium pay of $1.03 ($2.06 × 1/2) for each hour he works in excess of the applicable maximum hours standard.
As in the previous example the established basic rate must be used in every overtime week in the quarter for which it was computed without regard to the employee's true hourly rate in the particular quarter.

# Rates Authorized on Application
§ 548.400
Procedures.
(a) If an employer wants to use an established basic rate other than one of those authorized under § 548.3, he must obtain specific prior approval from the Administrator. For example, if an employer wishes to compute overtime compensation for piece workers for each workweek in a 4-week period at established basic rates which are the straight-time average hourly earnings for each employee for the immediately preceding 4-week period, he should apply to the Administrator for authorization. The application for approval of such a basic rate should be addressed to the Administrator of the Wage and Hour Division, U.S. Department of Labor, Washington, DC 20210. No particular form of application is required but the minimum necessary information outlined in § 548.4 should be included. The application may be made by an employer or a group of employers. If any of the employees covered by the application is represented by a collective bargaining agent, a joint application of the employer and the bargaining agent should be filed. It is not necessary to file separate applications for each employee. One application will cover as many employees as will be paid at the proposed basic rate or rates.
(b) Prior approval of the Administrator is also required if the employer desires to use a basic rate or basic rates which come within the scope of a combination of two or more of the paragraphs in § 548.3 unless the basic rate or rates sought to be adopted meet the requirements of a single paragraph in § 548.3. For instance, an employee may receive free lunches, the cost of which, by agreement or understanding, is not to be included in the rate used to
compute overtime compensation.
17
In addition, the employee may receive an attendance bonus which, by agreement or understanding, is to be excluded from the rate used to compute overtime compensation.
18
Since these exclusions involve two paragraphs of § 548.3, prior approval of the Administrator would be necessary unless the exclusion of the cost of the free lunches together with the attendance bonus do not affect the employee's overtime compensation by more than 40 percent of the applicable hourly minimum wage under either section 6(a) of the Act or the state or local law applicable in the jurisdiction in which the employee is employed, whichever is higher, per week on the average, in which case the employer and the employee may treat the situation as one falling within § 548.3(e).

§ 548.401
Agreement or understanding.
If the agreement or understanding establishing the basic rate is in writing, whether incorporated in a collective bargaining agreement or not, a copy of the agreement or understanding should be attached to the application. If it is not in writing, however, the application to the Administrator for approval of a basic rate should contain a written statement describing the substance of the agreement or understanding, including the proposed effective date and term of the agreement or understanding. The term of the agreement or understanding may be of definite duration, or may run indefinitely until modified or changed. If an agreement or understanding is modified, a new application for authorization should be made.

The application should also contain a description of the terms of employment relating to overtime so that the Administrator can determine how the established basic rate will be used if it is approved. For instance, if the employees are to be paid time and one-half the basic rate for all hours worked in excess of 35 each workweek, this should be stated in the application. If the employees are to be paid double time for work on Sundays the application should so state.
[20 FR 5683, Aug. 6, 1955]
§ 548.403
Description of method of calculation.
The established basic rate for which approval will be sought will normally be a formula or method of calculation of a rate rather than a specific dollars and cents rates.
20
The application should contain a complete description of the formula or method of calculation of the established basic rate, including any necessary examples which will enable the Administrator to understand how the rate will be computed and applied.
20
See § 548.200.
[20 FR 5683, Aug. 6, 1955]
§ 548.404
Kinds of jobs or employees.
The application should describe or otherwise identify the employees to whom the established basic rate will apply. The individual employees need not be identified by name but may be described in terms of job classification, department, location or other appropriate identifying characteristics.
[20 FR 5683, Aug. 6, 1955]
§ 548.405
Representative period.
(a) The application must set forth the facts relied upon to show that the established basic rate is substantially equivalent to the average hourly earnings of the employee exclusive of overtime premiums over a representative
period of time.
21
The basic rate will be considered “substantially equivalent” to the average hourly earnings of the employee if, during a representative period, the employee's total overtime earnings calculated at the basic rate in accordance with the applicable overtime provisions are approximately equal to the employee's total overtime earnings computed on his average hourly earnings for each workweek in accordance with section 7(a) of the Act.
22
21
See §§ 778.200 through 778.207 of this chapter for further discussion of overtime premiums which may be excluded from the regular rate of pay.
22
See §§ 778.208 through 778.225 of this chapter for further discussion of the exclusion of vacation pay, holiday pay, discretionary bonuses and other payments from the average hourly earnings which comprise the employee's regular rate of pay.
(b) The length of time constituting a representative period will depend on the factors that cause the employee's average hourly earnings to vary appreciably from week to week. For instance, if the variation in earnings of an employee paid on an incentive basis is due to the difference in availability of work in the slow and busy seasons the period used for comparison of overtime earnings would have to include both a slow and a busy season in order to be representative. Likewise, if a piece-worker's average hourly earnings vary appreciably from week to week because of differences in materials or styles worked on, the period used for purposes of comparison would have to include work on the different materials and styles in order to be representative.

# Computation of Overtime Pay
§ 548.500
Methods of computation.
The methods of computing overtime pay on the basic rates for piece workers, hourly rated employees, and salaried employees are the same as the methods of computing overtime pay at the regular rate.

# Example 1.
Under an employment agreement the basic rate to be used in computing overtime compensation for a piece worker for hours of work in excess of 8 in each day is the employee's average hourly earnings for all work performed during that day.
23
The employee is entitled to one-half the basic rate for each daily overtime hour in addition to the total piece work earnings for the day.
23
See § 548.302.

# Example 2.
An employee, who normally would come within the forty hour provision of section 7(a) of the Act, has a basic rate which is his monthly salary divided by the number of regular hours of work in the month.
24
If the salary is intended to cover straight-time compensation for a forty hour week he would be entitled to overtime for every hour after forty computed on the basis of one and one-half times the established basic rate, in addition to his monthly salary. If the salary is intended to cover a workweek shorter than forty hours, such as thirty-five hours, he would be entitled to additional straight time at the basic rate for the hours between thirty-five and forty and also to overtime at one and one-half time that rate for all hours worked in excess of forty in a week.
24
See § 548.301.
[20 FR 5683, Aug. 6, 1955, as amended at 26 FR 7732, Aug. 18, 1961]
§ 548.501
Overtime hours based on nonstatutory standards.
Many employees are paid daily overtime pay or Saturday overtime pay or overtime pay on a basis other than the statutory standard of overtime pay required by section 7(a) of the Act. In these cases, the number of hours for which an employee is paid at least one and one-half times an established basic rate must equal or exceed the number of hours worked in excess of the applicable number of hours established in section 7(a) of the Act in the workweek. However, only overtime hours under the employment agreement which also qualify as overtime hours under section 7(e) (5), (6), or (7) of the Act
25
may be offset against the hours of work in excess of the applicable number of hours established in section 7(a) of the Act.
25
See §§ 778.201 through 778.207 of this chapter.
[26 FR 7732, Aug. 18, 1961]
§ 548.502
Other payments.
Extra overtime compensation must be separately computed and paid on payments such as bonuses or shift differentials which are not included in the
computation of the established basic rate and which would have been included in the regular rate of pay.
26
26
Unless specifically excluded by agreement or understanding and prior authorization is obtained from the Administrator. See § 548.400(b).

# Example 1.
An employee is paid on an hourly rate basis plus a production bonus, and also a shift differential of 10 cents for each hour worked on the second shift. The authorized basic rate under the agreement is the employee's daily average hourly earnings, and under the employment agreement he is paid one and one-half times the basic rate for all hours worked in excess of 8 each day. Suppose his production bonus is included in the computation of the basic rate, but the shift differential is not. In addition to overtime compensation computed at the basic rate the employee must be paid an extra 5 cents for each overtime hour worked on the second shift.

# Example 2.
A piece worker, under his employment agreement, is paid overtime compensation for daily overtime and for hours of work on Saturday based on an authorized basic rate obtained by averaging his piece work earnings for the half-month. In addition, he is paid a monthly cost-of-living bonus which is not included in the computation of the basic rate. It will be necessary for the employer to compute and pay overtime compensation separately on the bonus.
27
27
See § 778.209 of this chapter for an explanation of how to compute overtime on the bonus.

§ 549.0
Scope and effect of regulations.
(a) The regulations in this part set forth the requirements of a “bona fide profit-sharing plan or trust” under section 7(e)(3)(b) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended (hereinafter called the Act). In determining the total remuneration for employment which section 7(e) of the Act requires to be included in the regular rate at which an employee is employed, it is not necessary to include any sums paid to or on behalf of such employee, in recognition of services performed by him during a given period, which are paid pursuant to a bona fide profit-sharing plan or trust meeting the requirements set forth herein. In the formulation of these regulations due regard has been given to the factors and standards set forth in section 7(e)(3)(b) of the Act.
(b) The inclusion or exclusion from the regular rate of contributions made by an employer pursuant to any plan or trust for providing old age, retirement, life, accident or health insurance or similar benefits for employees (regardless of whether the plan or trust is financed out of profits) is governed by section 7(e)(4) of the Act, the requirements of which are set forth in the Interpretative Bulletin on Overtime Compensation, part 778, of this chapter, §§ 778.214 and 778.215. However, where such a plan or trust is combined in a single program (whether in one or more documents) with a plan or trust for providing profit-sharing payments to employees, the profit-sharing payments may be excluded from the regular rate if they meet the requirements of the regulations in this part and the contributions made by the employer for providing the benefits described in section 7(e)(4) of the Act may be excluded from the regular rate if they meet the tests set forth in the Interpretative Bulletin, part 778, of this chapter, §§ 778.214 and 778.215.
§ 549.1
Essential requirements for qualifications.
(a) A bona fide profit-sharing plan or trust for purposes of section 7(e)(3)(b) of the Act is required to meet all of the standards set forth in paragraphs (b) through (g) of this section and must not contain any of the disqualifying provisions set forth in § 549.2.
(b) The profit-sharing plan or trust constitutes a definite program or arrangement in writing, communicated or made available to the employees, which is established and maintained in
good faith for the purpose of distributing to the employees a share of profits as additional remuneration over and above the wages or salaries paid to employees which wages or salaries are not dependent upon or influenced by the existence of such profit-sharing plan or trust or the amount of the payments made pursuant thereto.
(c) All contributions or allocations by the employer to the fund or trust to be distributed to the employees are:
(1) Derived solely from profits of the employer's business enterprise, establishment or plant as a whole, or an established branch or division of the business or enterprise which is recognized as such for general business purposes and for which profits are separately and regularly calculated in accordance with accepted accounting practice; and
(2) Made periodically, but not more frequently than is customary or consonant with accepted accounting practice to make periodic determinations of profit.
(d) Eligibility to share in profits extends:
(1) At least to all employees who are subject to the minimum wage and overtime provisions of the Act, or to all such employees in an established part of the employer's business as described in paragraph (c) of this section:
Provided, however,
That such eligibility may be determined by factors such as length of service or minimum schedule of hours or days of work which are specified in the plan or trust, and further, that eligibility need not extend to officers of the employer; or
(2) To such classifications of employees as the employer may designate with the approval of the Administrator upon a finding, after notice to interested persons, including employee representatives, and an opportunity to present their views either orally or in writing, that it is in accord with the meaning and intent of the provisions of section 7(e)(3)(b) of the Act and this part. The Administrator may give such notice by requiring the employer to post a notice approved by the Administrator for a specified period in a place or places where notices to employees are customarily posted or at such other place or places designated by the Administrator, or he may require notice to be given in such other manner as he deems appropriate.
(e) The amounts paid to individual employees are determined in accordance with a definite formula or method of calculation specified in the plan or trust. The formula or method of calculation may be based on any one or more or more of such factors as straight-time earnings, total earnings, base rate of pay of the employee, straight-time hours or total hours worked by employees, or length of service, or distribution may be made on a per capita basis.
(f) An employee's total share determined in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section may not be diminished because of any other remuneration received by him.
(g) Provision is made either for payment to the individual employees of their respective shares of profits within a reasonable period after the determination of the amount of profits to be distributed, or for the irrevocable deposit by the employer of his employees' distributive shares of profits with a trustee for deferred distribution to such employees of their respective shares after a stated period of time or upon the occurrence of appropriate contingencies specified in the plan or trust:
Provided, however,
That the right of an employee to receive his share is not made dependent upon his continuing in the employ of the employer after the period for which the determination of profits has been made.

§ 549.2
Disqualifying provisions.
No plan or trust which contains any one of the following provisions shall be deemed to meet the requirements of a bona fide profit-sharing plan or trust under section 7(e)(3)(b) of the Act:
(a) If the share of any individual employee is determined in substance on the basis of attendance, quality or quantity of work, rate of production, or efficiency;
(b) If the amount to be paid periodically by the employer into the fund or
trust to be distributed to the employees is a fixed sum;
(c) If periodic payments of minimum amounts to the employees are guaranteed by the employer;
(d) If any individual employee's share, by the terms of the plan or trust, is set at a predetermined fixed sum or is so limited as to provide in effect for the payment of a fixed sum, or is limited to or set at a predetermined specified rate per hour or other unit of work or worktime;
(e) If the employer's contributions or allocations to the fund or trust to be distributed to the employees are based on factors other than profits such as hours of work, production, efficiency, sales or savings in cost.
§ 549.3
Distinction between plan and trust.
As used in this part:
(a)
Profit-sharing plan
means any such program or arrangement as qualifies hereunder which provides for the distribution by the employer to his employees of their respective shares of profits;
(b)
Profit-sharing trust
means any such program or arrangement as qualifies under this part which provides for the irrevocable deposit by the employer of his employees' distributive shares of profits with a trustee for deferred distribution to such employees of their respective shares.

§ 551.1
Statutory provision.
The following provision for exemption from the overtime pay provision is contained in section 13(b) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended (29 U.S.C. 213(b)):
(b) The provisions of section 7 shall not apply with respect to:
(11) any employee employed as a driver or driver's helper making local deliveries, who is compensated for such employment on the basis of trip rates, or other delivery payment plan, if the Secretary shall find that such plan has the general purpose and effect of reducing hours worked by such employees to, or below, the maximum workweek applicable to them under section 7(a).
Under this provision, an employee employed and compensated as described in the quoted paragraph (11) may be employed without payment of overtime compensation for a workweek longer than the maximum workweek applicable to him under section 7(a) of the Act, but only if it is established by a finding of the Secretary that the employee is compensated for his employment as a driver or driver's helper making local deliveries on the basis of trip rates or other delivery payment plan that has the general purpose and effect stated in section 13(b)(11). Such a finding is prescribed by the statute as one of the “explicit prerequisites to exemption”. (See
Arnold
v.
Kanowsky,
361 U.S. 388, 392.)
§ 551.2
Findings authorized by this part.
(a) The Administrator, pursuant to the authority vested in him by the Secretary of Labor, will make and apply findings under section 13(b)(11) of the Act as provided in this part. Such findings shall be made only upon petitions meeting the requirements of this part, and only as authorized in this section.
(b) For the purpose of establishing whether a wage payment plan has the purpose and effect required by section 13(b)(11) for an exemption from the overtime provisions of the Act, the Administrator shall have authority, upon a proper showing and in accordance with the provisions of this part, to make a finding as to the general purpose and effect of any specific plan of compensation on the basis of trip rates or other delivery payment plan, with respect to the reduction of the length of the workweeks worked by the employees of any specific employer who are compensated in accordance with
such plan for their employment by such employer as drivers or drivers' helpers making local deliveries.
(c) Any finding made as to the purpose and effect of such a wage payment plan pursuant to a petition therefor will be based upon a consideration of all relevant facts shown or represented to exist with respect to such plan that are made available to the Administrator. A finding that such plan has the general effect of reducing the hours worked by drivers or drivers' helpers compensated thereunder to, or below, the maximum workweek applicable to them under section 7(a) of the Act is not authorized under this part unless the Administrator finds that during the most recently completed representative period of one year (based on the experience of the employer in question, or if such employer has not previously used such plan, on the experience of another employer using such plan under substantially the same conditions, all as defined in § 551.8(g)(1)), the average weekly hours, taken in the aggregate, of all full-time employees covered by the plan are not in excess of the maximum workweek applicable to such employees under section 7(a), or unless the Administrator makes an interim finding with respect to such plan that, notwithstanding a lack of experience under it for a representative period of 1 year, its provisions and manner of operation, together with the other available information concerning the plan, indicate clearly that by the end of such first representative year the effect of the plan will have been to reduce the average weekly hours worked by the employees covered by the plan in such first year of operation to, or below, such maximum applicable workweek.
