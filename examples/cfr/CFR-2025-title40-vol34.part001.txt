(B) If you discover that the PCB concentration of the fluid in a reclassified electromagnet, switch, or voltage regulator has changed, causing the reclassified status to change, the electromagnet, switch, or voltage regulator is regulated based on the actual concentration of the fluid. For example, an electromagnet, switch, or voltage regulator that was reclassified to non-PCB status is regulated as a PCB-Contaminated electromagnet, switch, or voltage regulator if you discover that the concentration of the fluid has increased to ≥50 but
500 ppm PCBs. If you discover that the PCB concentration of the fluid in a voltage regulator has risen to ≥500 ppm, follow paragraph (h)(1)(iii) of this section to come into compliance with the regulations applicable to voltage regulators containing ≥500 ppm PCBs. You also have the option of repeating the reclassification process.
(C) The Director, National Program Chemicals Division may, without further rulemaking, grant approval on a case-by-case basis for the use of alternative methods to reclassify electromagnets, switches or voltage regulators. You may request an approval by writing to the Director, National Program Chemicals Division (7404), Environmental Protection Agency,1200 Pennsylvania Ave., NW., Washington, DC 20460. Describe the equipment you plan to reclassify, the alternative reclassification method you
plan to use, and test data or other evidence on the effectiveness of the method.

(2) No person may process liquid PCBs into non-liquid forms to circumvent the high temperature incineration requirements of § 761.60(a).
(3) No person may discharge water containing PCBs to a treatment works (as defined § 503.9(aa) of this chapter) or to navigable waters unless the PCB concentration is
3 µg/L (approximately 3 ppb), or unless the discharge is in accordance with a PCB discharge limit included in a permit issued under
section 307(b) or 402 of the Clean Water Act.
(4) Spills and other uncontrolled discharges of PCBs at concentrations of ≥50 ppm constitute the disposal of PCBs.
(5) Any person land disposing of non-liquid PCBs may avoid otherwise-applicable sampling requirements by presuming that the PCBs disposed of are ≥500 ppm (or ≥100 µg/100 cm
2
if no free-flowing liquids are present).
(6) Any person storing or disposing of PCBs is also responsible for determining and complying with all other applicable Federal, State, and local laws and regulations.
(b)
PCB waste
—(1)
PCB liquids.
Any person removing PCB liquids from use (i.e., not PCB remediation waste) must dispose of them in accordance with § 761.60(a), or decontaminate them in accordance with § 761.79.
(2)
PCB Items.
Any person removing from use a PCB Item containing an intact and non-leaking PCB Article must dispose of it in accordance with § 761.60(b), or decontaminate it in accordance with § 761.79. PCB Items where the PCB Articles are no longer intact and non-leaking are regulated for disposal as PCB bulk product waste under § 761.62(a) or (c).
(i) Fluorescent light ballasts containing PCBs only in an intact and non-leaking PCB Small Capacitor are regulated for disposal under § 761.60(b)(2)(ii).
(ii) Fluorescent light ballasts containing PCBs in the potting material are regulated for disposal as PCB bulk product waste under § 761.62.
(3)
PCB remediation waste.
PCB remediation waste, including PCB sewage sludge, is regulated for cleanup and disposal in accordance with § 761.61.
(i) Any person responsible for PCB waste at as-found concentrations ≥50 ppm that was either placed in a land disposal facility, spilled, or otherwise released into the environment prior to April 18, 1978, regardless of the concentration of the spill or release; or placed in a land disposal facility, spilled, or otherwise released into the environment on or after April 18, 1978, but prior to July 2, 1979, where the concentration of the spill or release was ≥50 ppm but
500 ppm, must dispose of the waste as follows:
(A) Sites containing these wastes are presumed not to present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment from exposure to PCBs at the site. However, the EPA Regional Administrator may inform the owner or operator of the site that there is reason to believe that spills, leaks, or other uncontrolled releases or discharges, such as leaching, from the site constitute ongoing disposal that may present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment from exposure to PCBs at the site, and may require the owner or operator to generate data necessary to characterize the risk. If after reviewing any such data, the EPA Regional Administrator makes a finding, that an unreasonable risk exists, then they may direct the owner or operator of the site to dispose of the PCB remediation waste in accordance with § 761.61 such that an unreasonable risk of injury no longer exists.
(B) Unless directed by the EPA Regional Administrator to dispose of PCB waste in accordance with paragraph (b)(3)(i)(A) of this section, any person responsible for PCB waste at as-found concentrations ≥50 ppm that was either placed in a land disposal facility, spilled, or otherwise released into the environment prior to April 18, 1978, regardless of the concentration of the spill or release; or placed in a land disposal facility, spilled, or otherwise released into the environment on or after April 18, 1978, but prior to July 2, 1979, where the concentration of the spill or release was ≥50 ppm but
500 ppm, who unilaterally decides to dispose of that waste (for example, to obtain insurance or to sell the property), is not required to clean up in accordance with § 761.61. Disposal of the PCB remediation waste must comply with § 761.61. However, cleanup of those wastes that is not in complete compliance with § 761.61 will not afford the responsible party with relief from the applicable PCB regulations for that waste.
(ii) Any person responsible for PCB waste that was either placed in a land disposal facility, spilled, or otherwise released into the environment on or after April 18, 1978, but prior to July 2, 1979, where the concentration of the
spill or release was ≥500 ppm; or placed in a land disposal facility, spilled, or otherwise released into the environment on or after July 2, 1979, where the concentration of the spill or release was ≥50 ppm, must dispose of it in accordance with either of the following:
(A) In accordance with the PCB Spill Cleanup Policy (Policy) at subpart G of this part, for those PCB remediation wastes that meet the criteria of the Policy. Consult the Policy for a description of the spills it covers and its notification and timing requirements.
(B) In accordance with § 761.61. Complete compliance with § 761.61 does not create a presumption against enforcement action for penalties for any unauthorized PCB disposal.
(iii) The owner or operator of a site containing PCB remediation waste has the burden of proving the date that the waste was placed in a land disposal facility, spilled, or otherwise released into the environment, and the concentration of the original spill.
(4)
PCB bulk product waste
—(i)
General.
Any person disposing of PCB bulk product waste must do so in accordance with § 761.62. PCB bulk product waste, as that term is defined in § 761.3, is waste that was ≥50 ppm when originally removed from service, even if its current PCB concentration is
50 ppm. PCB bulk product waste is regulated for disposal based on the risk from the waste once disposed of. For waste which is land disposed, the waste is regulated based on how readily the waste is released from disposal to the environment, in particular by leaching out from the land disposal unit.
(ii)
Metal surfaces in contact with PCBs.
Any person disposing of metal surfaces in contact with PCBs (e.g., painted metal) may use thermal decontamination procedures in accordance with § 761.79(c)(6) (see § 761.62(a)(6)).
(5)
PCB household waste.
Any person storing or disposing of PCB household waste, as that term is defined in § 761.3, must do so in accordance with § 761.63.
(6)
PCB research and development waste.
Any person disposing of PCB wastes generated during and as a result of research and development for use under § 761.30(j), or for disposal under § 761.60(j), must do so in accordance with § 761.64.
(7)
PCB/Radioactive waste.
(i) Any person storing PCB/radioactive waste ≥50 ppm PCBs must do so taking into account both its PCB concentration and its radioactive properties, except as provided in § 761.65(a)(1), (b)(1)(ii), and (c)(6)(i).
(ii) Any person disposing of PCB/radioactive waste must do so taking into account both its PCB concentration and its radioactive properties. If, taking into account only the properties of the PCBs in the waste (and not the radioactive properties of the waste), the waste meets the requirements for disposal in a facility permitted, licensed, or registered by a State as a municipal or non-municipal non-hazardous waste landfill (e.g., PCB bulk product waste under § 761.62(b)(1)), then the person may dispose of the PCB/radioactive waste, without regard to the PCB component of the waste, on the basis of its radioactive properties in accordance with all applicable requirements for the radioactive component of the waste.
(8)
Porous surfaces.
In most cases a person must dispose of porous surfaces as materials where PCBs have penetrated far beneath the surface, rather than a simple surface contamination. Any person disposing of porous surfaces on which PCBs have been spilled and meeting the definition of PCB remediation waste at § 761.3 must do so in accordance with § 761.61. Any person disposing of porous surfaces which are part of manufactured non-liquid products containing PCBs and meeting the definition of PCB bulk product waste at § 761.3 must do so in accordance with § 761.62. Any person may decontaminate concrete surfaces upon which PCBs have been spilled in accordance with § 761.79(b)(4), if the decontamination procedure is commenced within 72 hours of the initial spill of PCBs to the concrete or portion thereof being decontaminated. Any person may decontaminate porous non-liquid PCBs in contact with non-porous surfaces, such as underground metal fuel tanks coated with fire retardant resin or pitch, for purposes of unrestricted use or disposal in a smelter in accordance with § 761.79(b)(3).
(c)
Storage for disposal.
Any person who holds PCB waste must store it in accordance with § 761.65.

Testing procedures.
(1) Owners or users of mineral oil dielectric fluid electrical equipment may use the following procedures to determine the concentration of PCBs in the dielectric fluid:
(i) Dielectric fluid removed from mineral oil dielectric fluid electrical equipment may be collected in a common container, provided that no other chemical substances or mixtures are added to the container. This common container option does not permit dilution of the collected oil. Mineral oil that is assumed or known to contain at least 50 ppm PCBs must not be mixed with mineral oil that is known or assumed to contain less than 50 ppm PCBs to reduce the concentration of PCBs in the common container. If dielectric fluid from untested, oil-filled circuit breakers, reclosers, or cable is
collected in a common container with dielectric fluid from other oil-filled electrical equipment, the entire contents of the container must be treated as PCBs at a concentration of at least 50 ppm, unless all of the fluid from the other oil-filled electrical equipment has been tested and shown to contain less than 50 ppm PCBs.
(ii) For purposes of complying with the marking and disposal requirements, representative samples may be taken from either the common containers or the individual electrical equipment to determine the PCB concentration, except that if any PCBs at a concentration of 500 ppm or greater have been added to the container or equipment then the total container contents must be considered as having a PCB concentration of 500 ppm or greater for purposes of complying with the disposal requirements of this subpart. For purposes of this subparagraph, representative samples of mineral oil dielectric fluid are either samples taken in accordance with ASTM D 923-86 or ASTM D 923-89 or samples taken from a container that has been thoroughly mixed in a manner such that any PCBs in the container are uniformly distributed throughout the liquid in the container.
(iii) Unless otherwise specified in this part, any person conducting the chemical analysis of PCBs shall do so using gas chromatography. Any gas chromatographic method that is appropriate for the material being analyzed may be used, including EPA Method 608.3, “Organochlorine Pesticides and PCBs” (see 40 CFR part 136, Appendix A), or SW-846 Method 8082A (incorporated by reference in § 761.19); and ASTM D4059-00 (incorporated by reference, see § 761.19).
(2) Owners or users of waste oil may use the following procedures to determine the PCB concentration of waste oil:
(i) Waste oil from more than one source may be collected in a common container, provided that no other chemical substances or mixtures, such as non-waste oils, are added to the container.
(ii) For purposes of complying with the marking and disposal requirements, representative samples may be taken from either the common containers or the individual electrical equipment to determine the PCB concentration. Except, that if any PCBs at a concentration of 500 ppm or greater have been added to the container or equipment then the total container contents must be considered as having a PCB concentration of 500 ppm or greater for purposes of complying with the disposal requirements of this subpart. For purposes of this paragraph, representative samples of mineral oil dielectric fluid are either samples taken in accordance with ASTM D923-86 or ASTM D923-89 (both incorporated by reference, see § 761.19) or samples taken from a container that has been thoroughly mixed in a manner such that any PCBs in the container are uniformly distributed throughout the liquid in the container.
(iii) Unless otherwise specified in this part, any person conducting the chemical analysis of PCBs shall do so using gas chromatography. Any gas chromatographic method that is appropriate for the material being analyzed may be used, including those indicated in paragraph (g)(1)(iii) of this section.
(h) Requirements for export and import of PCBs and PCB Items for disposal are found in subpart F of this part.

§ 761.61
PCB remediation waste.
This section provides cleanup and disposal options for PCB remediation waste. Any person cleaning up and disposing of PCBs managed under this section shall do so based on the concentration at which the PCBs are found. This section does not prohibit any person from implementing temporary emergency measures to prevent, treat, or contain further releases or mitigate migration to the environment of PCBs or PCB remediation waste.
(a)
Self-implementing on-site cleanup and disposal of PCB remediation waste.
EPA designed the self-implementing procedure for a general, moderately-sized site where there should be low residual environmental impact from remedial activities. The procedure may be less practical for larger or environmentally diverse sites. For these other sites, the self-implementing procedure still applies, but an EPA Regional Administrator may authorize more practical procedures through paragraph (c) of this section. Any person may conduct self-implementing cleanup and disposal of PCB remediation waste in accordance with the following requirements without prior written approval from EPA.
(1)
Applicability.
(i) The self-implementing procedures may not be used to clean up:
(A) Surface or ground waters.
(B) Sediments in marine and freshwater ecosystems.
(C) Sewers or sewage treatment systems.
(D) Any private or public drinking water sources or distribution systems.
(E) Grazing lands.
(F) Vegetable gardens.
(ii) The self-implementing cleanup provisions shall not be binding upon cleanups conducted under other authorities, including but not limited to, actions conducted under section 104 or section 106 of CERCLA, or section 3004(u) and (v) or section 3008(h) of RCRA.
(2)
Site characterization.
Any person conducting self-implementing cleanup of PCB remediation waste must characterize the site adequately to be able to provide the information required by paragraph (a)(3) of this section. Subpart N of this part provides a method for collecting new site characterization data or for assessing the sufficiency of existing site characterization data.
(3)
Notification and certification.
(i) At least 30 days prior to the date that the cleanup of a site begins, the person in charge of the cleanup or the owner of the property where the PCB remediation waste is located shall notify, in writing, the EPA Regional Administrator, the Director of the State or Tribal environmental protection agency, and the Director of the county or local environmental protection agency where the cleanup will be conducted. The notice shall include:
(A) The nature of the contamination, including kinds of materials contaminated.
(B) A summary of the procedures used to sample contaminated and adjacent areas and a table or cleanup site map showing PCB concentrations measured in all pre-cleanup characterization samples. The summary must include sample collection and analysis dates. The EPA Regional Administrator may require more detailed information including, but not limited to, additional characterization sampling or all sample identification numbers from all previous characterization activities at the cleanup site.
(C) The location and extent of the identified contaminated area, including topographic maps with sample collection sites cross referenced to the sample identification numbers in the data summary from paragraph (a)(3)(i)(B) of this section.
(D) A cleanup plan for the site, including schedule, disposal technology, and approach. This plan should contain options and contingencies to be used if
unanticipated higher concentrations or wider distributions of PCB remediation waste are found or other obstacles force changes in the cleanup approach.
(E) A written certification, signed by the owner of the property where the cleanup site is located and the party conducting the cleanup, that all sampling plans, sample collection procedures, sample preparation procedures, extraction procedures, and instrumental/chemical analysis procedures used to assess or characterize the PCB contamination at the cleanup site, are on file at the location designated in the certificate, and are available for EPA inspection. Persons using alternate methods for chemical extraction and chemical analysis for site characterization must include in the certificate a statement that such a method will be used and that a comparison study which meets or exceeds the requirements of subpart Q of this part, and for which records are on file, has been completed prior to verification sampling.
(ii) Within 30 calendar days of receiving the notification, the EPA Regional Administrator will respond in writing approving of the self-implementing cleanup, disapproving of the self-implementing cleanup, or requiring additional information. If the EPA Regional Administrator does not respond within 30 calendar days of receiving the notice, the person submitting the notification may proceed with the cleanup according to the information the person provided to the EPA Regional Administrator. If, upon review of the notification, the EPA Regional Administrator determines that the notification does not contain all of the information required by paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section, sufficient to ensure compliance with paragraphs (a)(4) through (9) of this section at the site, they may require the submission of additional information. The cleanup and disposal must comply with all applicable requirements of paragraphs (a)(4) through (9) of this section. Once cleanup is underway, the person conducting the cleanup must provide any proposed changes from the notification to the EPA Regional Administrator in writing no less than 14 calendar days prior to the proposed implementation of the change. The EPA Regional Administrator will determine in their discretion whether to accept the change and will respond to the change notification verbally within 7 calendar days and in writing within 14 calendar days of receiving it. If the EPA Regional Administrator does not respond verbally within 7 calendar days and in writing within 14 calendar days of receiving the change notice, the person who submitted it may proceed with the cleanup according to the information in the change notice provided to the EPA Regional Administrator, subject to the submission of additional information if the Regional Administrator determines it is needed to address the elements of paragraph (a)(3)(i), of this section and in compliance with all applicable requirements of paragraphs (a)(4) through (9) of this section and other applicable requirements of this part.
(iii) Any person conducting a cleanup activity may obtain a waiver of the 30-day notification requirement, if they receive a separate waiver, in writing, from each of the agencies they are required to notify under this section. The person must retain the original written waiver as required in paragraph (a)(9) of this section.
(4)
Cleanup levels.
For purposes of cleaning, decontaminating, or removing PCB remediation waste under this section, there are four general waste categories: bulk PCB remediation waste, non-porous surfaces, porous surfaces, and liquids. Cleanup levels are based on the kind of material and the potential exposure to PCBs left after cleanup is completed.
(i)
Bulk PCB remediation waste.
Bulk PCB remediation waste includes, but is not limited to, the following non-liquid PCB remediation waste: soil, sediments, dredged materials, muds, PCB sewage sludge, and industrial sludge.
(A)
High occupancy areas.
The cleanup level for bulk PCB remediation waste in high occupancy areas is ≤1 ppm without further conditions. High occupancy areas where bulk PCB remediation waste remains at concentrations
1 ppm and ≤10 ppm shall be covered with a cap meeting the requirements of paragraphs (a)(7) and (a)(8) of this section.
(B)
Low occupancy areas.
(
1
) The cleanup level for bulk PCB remediation waste in low occupancy areas is ≤25 ppm unless otherwise specified in this paragraph.
(
2
) Bulk PCB remediation wastes may remain at a cleanup site at concentrations
25 ppm and ≤50 ppm if the site is secured by a fence and marked with a sign including the M
L
mark.
(
3
) Bulk PCB remediation wastes may remain at a cleanup site at concentrations
25 ppm and ≤100 ppm if the site is covered with a cap meeting the requirements of paragraphs (a)(7) and (a)(8) of this section.
(ii)
Non-porous surfaces.
In high occupancy areas, the surface PCB cleanup standard is ≤10 µg/100 cm
2
of surface area. In low occupancy areas, the surface cleanup standard is
100 µg/100 cm
2
of surface area. Select sampling locations in accordance with subpart P of this part or a sampling plan approved under paragraph (c) of this section.
(iii)
Porous surfaces.
In both high and low occupancy areas, any person disposing of porous surfaces must do so based on the levels in paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section. Porous surfaces may be cleaned up for use in accordance with § 761.79(b)(4) or § 761.30(p).
(iv)
Liquids.
In both high and low occupancy areas, cleanup levels are the concentrations specified in § 761.79(b)(1) and (b)(2).
(v)
Change in the land use for a cleanup site.
Where there is an actual or proposed change in use of an area cleaned up to the levels of a low occupancy area, and the exposure of people or animal life in or at that area could reasonably be expected to increase, resulting in a change in status from a low occupancy area to a high occupancy area, the owner of the area shall clean up the area in accordance with the high occupancy area cleanup levels in paragraphs (a)(4)(i) through (a)(4)(iv) of this section.
(vi) The EPA Regional Administrator, as part of his or her response to a notification submitted in accordance with § 761.61(a)(3) of this part, may require cleanup of the site, or portions of it, to more stringent cleanup levels than are otherwise required in this section, based on the proximity to areas such as residential dwellings, hospitals, schools, nursing homes, playgrounds, parks, day care centers, endangered species habitats, estuaries, wetlands, national parks, national wildlife refuges, commercial fisheries, and sport fisheries.
(5)

[63 FR 35452, June 29, 1998]
§ 761.65
Storage for disposal.
This section applies to the storage for disposal of PCBs at concentrations of 50 ppm or greater and PCB Items with PCB concentrations of 50 ppm or greater.
(a)(1)
Storage limitations.
Any PCB waste shall be disposed of as required by subpart D of this part within 1-year from the date it was determined to be PCB waste and the decision was made to dispose of it. This date is the date of removal from service for disposal and the point at which the 1-year time frame for disposal begins. PCB/radioactive waste removed from service for disposal is exempt from the 1-year time limit provided that the provisions at paragraphs (a)(2)(ii) and (a)(2)(iii) of this section are followed and the waste is managed in accordance with all other applicable Federal, State, and local laws and regulations for the management of radioactive material.
(2)
One-year extension.
Any person storing PCB waste that is subject to the 1-year time limit for storage and disposal in paragraph (a)(1) of this section may provide written notification to the EPA Regional Administrator for the Region in which the PCB waste is stored that their continuing attempts to dispose of or secure disposal for their waste within the 1-year time limit have been unsuccessful. Upon receipt of the notice by the EPA Regional Administrator, the time for disposal is automatically extended for 1 additional year (2 years total) if the following conditions are met:
(i) The notification is received by the EPA Regional Administrator at least 30 days before the initial 1-year time limit expires and the notice identifies the storer, the types, volumes, and locations of the waste and the reasons for failure to meet the initial 1-year time limit.
(ii) A written record documenting all continuing attempts to secure disposal is maintained until the waste is disposed of.
(iii) The written record required by paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section is available for inspection or submission if requested by EPA.
(iv) Continuing attempts to secure disposal were initiated within 270 days after the time the waste was first subject to the 1-year time limit requirement, as specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. Failure to initiate and continue attempts to secure disposal throughout the total time the waste is in storage shall automatically disqualify the notifier from receiving an automatic extension under this section.
(3)
Additional extensions.
Upon written request, the EPA Regional Administrator for the Region in which the wastes are stored or the appropriate official at EPA Headquarters, may grant additional extensions beyond the 1-year extension authorized in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. At the time of the request, the requestor must supply specific justification for the additional extension and indicate what measures the requestor is taking to secure disposal of the waste or indicate why disposal could not be conducted during the period of the prior extension. The EPA Regional Administrator or the appropriate official at EPA Headquarters may require, as a condition to granting any extension under this section, specific actions including, but not limited to, marking, inspection, recordkeeping, or financial assurance to ensure that the waste does not pose an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment.
(4)
Storage at an approved facility.
Increased time for storage may be granted as a condition of any TSCA PCB storage or disposal approval, by the EPA Regional Administrator for the Region in which the PCBs or PCB Items are to be stored or disposed of, or by the appropriate official at EPA Headquarters, if EPA determines that there is a demonstrated need or justification for additional time, that the owner or operator of the facility is pursuing relevant treatment or disposal options, and that no unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment will result from the increased storage time. In making this determination,
EPA will consider such factors as absence of any approved treatment technology and insufficient time to complete the treatment or destruction process. EPA may require as a condition of the approval that the owner or operator submit periodic progress reports.
(b) Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(2), (c)(1), (c)(7), (c)(9), and (c)(10) of this section, after July 1, 1978, owners or operators of any facilities used for the storage of PCBs and PCB Items designated for disposal shall comply with the following storage unit requirements:
(1) The facilities shall meet the following criteria:
(i) Adequate roof and walls to prevent rain water from reaching the stored PCBs and PCB Items;
(ii) An adequate floor that has continuous curbing with a minimum 6 inch high curb. The floor and curbing must provide a containment volume equal to at least two times the internal volume of the largest PCB Article or PCB Container or 25 percent of the total internal volume of all PCB Articles or PCB Containers stored there, whichever is greater. PCB/radioactive wastes are not required to be stored in an area with a minimum 6 inch high curbing. However, the floor and curbing must still provide a containment volume equal to at least two times the internal volume of the largest PCB Container or 25 percent of the total internal volume of all PCB Containers stored there, whichever is greater.
(iii) No drain valves, floor drains, expansion joints, sewer lines, or other openings that would permit liquids to flow from the curbed area;
(iv) Floors and curbing constructed of Portland cement, concrete, or a continuous, smooth, non-porous surface as defined at § 761.3, which prevents or minimizes penetration of PCBs.
(v) Not located at a site that is below the 100-year flood water elevation.
(2) No person may store PCBs and PCB Items designated for disposal in a storage unit other than one approved pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section or meeting the design requirements of paragraph (b) of this section, unless the unit meets one of the following conditions:

PCB-Contaminated Electrical Equipment that has been drained of free flowing dielectric fluid is not subject to the storage provisions of § 761.65. Storage under this subparagraph will be permitted only when the storage facility has immediately available unfilled storage space equal to 10 percent of the volume of capacitors and equipment stored outside the facility. The capacitors and equipment temporarily stored outside the facility shall be checked for leaks weekly.
(3) Any storage area subject to the requirements of paragraph (b) or paragraph (c)(1) of this section shall be marked as required in subpart C § 761.40(a)(10).
(4) No item of movable equipment that is used for handling PCBs and PCB Items in the storage units and that comes in direct contact with PCBs shall be removed from the storage unit area unless it has been decontaminated as specified in § 761.79.
(5) All PCB Items in storage shall be checked for leaks at least once every 30 days. Any leaking PCB Items and their contents shall be transferred immediately to properly marked non-leaking containers. Any spilled or leaked materials shall be immediately cleaned up and the materials and residues containing PCBs shall be disposed of in accordance with § 761.61. Records of inspections, maintenance, cleanup and disposal must be maintained in accordance with § 761.180(a) and (b).
(6) Except as provided in paragraphs (c)(6)(i) and (c)(6)(ii) of this section, any container used for the storage of liquid or non-liquid PCB waste shall be in accordance with the requirements set forth in the DOT Hazardous Materials Regulations (HMR) at 49 CFR parts 171 through 180. PCB waste not subject to the HMR (i.e., PCB wastes at concentrations of
20 ppm or
1 pound of PCBs regardless of concentration) must be packaged in accordance with Packaging Group III, unless other hazards associated with the PCB waste cause it to require packaging in accordance with Packaging Groups I or II. For purposes of describing PCB waste not subject to DOT's HMR on a manifest, one may use the term “Non-DOT Regulated PCBs.”
(i) Containers other than those meeting HMR performance standards may be used for storage of PCB/radioactive waste provided the following requirements are met:
(A) Containers used for storage of liquid PCB/radioactive wastes must be non-leaking.
(B) Containers used for storage of non-liquid PCB/ radioactive wastes must be designed to prevent the buildup of liquids if such containers are stored in an area meeting the containment requirements of paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, as well as all other applicable State or Federal regulations or requirements for control of radioactive materials.
(C) Containers used to store both liquid and non-liquid PCB/radioactive wastes must meet all regulations and requirements pertaining to nuclear criticality safety. Acceptable container materials currently include polyethylene and stainless steel provided that the container material is chemically compatible with the wastes being stored. Other containers may be used to store both liquid and non-liquid PCB/radioactive wastes if the users are able to demonstrate, to the appropriate Regional Administrator and other appropriate regulatory authorities (i.e., Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Department of Energy or the Department of Transportation), that the use of such containers is protective of health and the environment as well as public health and safety.
(ii) The following DOT specification containers that conform to the requirements of 49 CFR, chapter I, subchapter C in effect on September 30, 1991, may be used for storage and transportation activities that are not subject to DOT
regulation, and may be used on a transitional basis as permitted at 49 CFR 171.14. For liquid PCBs: Specification 5 container without removable head, Specification 5B container without removable head, Specification 6D overpack with Specification 2S or 2SL polyethylene containers, or Specification 17E container. For non-liquid PCBs: Specification 5 container, Specification 5B container, or Specification 17C container.
(7) Stationary storage containers for liquid PCBs can be larger than the containers specified in paragraph (c)(6) of this section provided that:
(i) The containers are designed, constructed, and operated in compliance with Occupational Safety and Health Standards, 29 CFR 1910.106,
Flammable and combustible liquids.
Before using these containers for storing PCBs, the design of the containers must be reviewed to determine the effect on the structural safety of the containers that will result from placing liquids with the specific gravity of PCBs into the containers (see 29 CFR 1910.106(b)(1)(i)(
f
)).
(ii) The owners or operators of any facility using containers described in paragraph (c)(7)(i) of this section, shall prepare and implement a Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure (SPCC) Plan as described in part 112 of this title. In complying with 40 CFR part 112, the owner or operator shall read “oil(s)” as “PCB(s)” whenever it appears. The exemptions for storage capacity, 40 CFR 112.1(d)(2), and the amendment of SPCC plans by the Regional Administrator, 40 CFR 112.4, shall not apply unless some fraction of the liquids stored in the container are oils as defined by section 311 of the Clean Water Act.
(8) PCB Items shall be dated on the item when they are removed from service for disposal. The storage shall be managed so that the PCB Items can be located by this date. Storage containers provided in paragraph (c)(7) of this section, shall have a record that includes for each batch of PCBs the quantity of the batch and date the batch was added to the container. The record shall also include the date, quantity, and disposition of any batch of PCBs removed from the container.
(9) Bulk PCB remediation waste or PCB bulk product waste may be stored at the clean-up site or site of generation for 180 days subject to the following conditions:
(i) The waste is placed in a pile or non-leaking, covered container designed and operated to control dispersal of the waste by wind, where necessary, by means other than wetting.
(ii) The waste must not generate leachate through decomposition or other reactions.
(iii) The storage site must have:
(A) A liner or container that is designed, constructed, and installed to prevent any migration of wastes off or through the liner or container into the adjacent subsurface soil, ground water or surface water at any time during the active life (including the closure period) of the storage site. The liner or container may be constructed of materials that may allow waste to migrate into the liner or container. The liner or container must be:
(
1
) Constructed of materials that have appropriate chemical properties and sufficient strength and thickness to prevent failure due to pressure gradients (including static head and external hydrogeologic forces), physical contact with the waste or leachate to which they are exposed, climatic conditions, the stress of installation, and the stress of daily operation.
(
2
) Placed upon a foundation or base capable of providing support to the liner or container and resistance to pressure gradients above and below the liner or container to prevent failure of the liner or container due to settlement, compression, or uplift.
(
3
) In the case of liners, installed to cover all surrounding earth likely to be in contact with the waste.
(B) A cover that meets the requirements of paragraph (c)(9)(iii)(A) of this section, is installed to cover all of the stored waste likely to be in contact with precipitation, and is secured so as not to be functionally disabled by winds expected under normal seasonal meteorological conditions at the storage site.
(C) A run-on control system designed, constructed, operated, and maintained such that:
(
1
) It prevents flow onto the stored waste during peak discharge from at least a 25-year storm.
(
2
) It collects and controls at least the water volume resulting from a 24-hour, 25-year storm. Collection and holding facilities (e.g., tanks or basins) must be emptied or otherwise managed expeditiously after storms to maintain design capacity of the system.
(iv) The provisions of this paragraph may be modified under § 761.61(c).

(1) A commercial storer of PCB waste shall have a written closure plan that identifies the steps that the owner or operator of the facility shall take to close the PCB waste storage facility in a manner that eliminates the potential for post-closure releases of PCBs which may present an unreasonable risk to human health or the environment. An acceptable closure plan must include, at a minimum, all of the following:
(i) A description of how the PCB storage areas of the facility will be closed in a manner that eliminates the potential for post-closure releases of PCBs into the environment.
(ii) An identification of the maximum extent of storage operations that will be open during the active life of the facility, including an identification of the extent of PCB storage operations at the facility relative to other wastes that will be handled at the facility.
(iii) An estimate of the maximum inventory of PCB wastes that could be handled at one time at the facility over its active life, and a detailed description of the methods or arrangements to be used during closure for removing, transporting, storing, or disposing of the facility's inventory of PCB waste, including an identification of any off-site facilities that will be used.
(iv) A detailed description of the steps needed to remove or decontaminate PCB waste residues and contaminated containment system components, equipment, structures, and soils during closure in accordance with the levels specified in the PCB Spills Cleanup Policy in subpart G of this part, including a description of the methods for sampling and testing of surrounding soils, and the criteria for determining the extent of removal or decontamination.
(v) A detailed description of other activities necessary during the closure period to ensure that any post-closure releases of PCBs will not present unreasonable risks to human health or the environment. This includes activities such as ground-water monitoring, run-on and run-off control, and facility security.
(vi) A schedule for closure of each area of the facility where PCB waste is stored or handled, including the total time required to close each area of PCB waste storage or handling, and the time required for any intervening closure activities.
(vii) An estimate of the expected year of closure of the PCB waste storage areas, if a trust fund is opted for as the financial mechanism.
(2) A written closure plan determined to be acceptable by EPA under this section shall become a condition of any approval granted under paragraph (d) of this section.
(3) A separate and new closure plan need not be submitted in cases where a facility is currently covered by a TSCA approval or a RCRA permit, upon a showing to the satisfaction of the Regional Administrator (or the appropriate official at EPA Headquarters, if the commercial storage area is ancillary to a disposal facility for which an official at EPA Headquarters has approval authority) that the existing closure plan is substantially equivalent to closure plans required under paragraphs (d) through (g) of this section, and that the plan adequately accounts for PCB waste inventories.
(4) The commercial storer of PCB waste shall submit a written request to the Regional Administrator (or the Director, Office of Resource Conservation and Recovery, if an official at EPA Headquarters approved the closure plan) for a modification to its storage approval to amend its closure plan, whenever:
(i) Changes in ownership, operating plans, or facility design affect the existing closure plan.
(ii) There is a change in the expected date of closure, if applicable.
(iii) In conducting closure activities, unexpected events require a modification of the approved closure plan.
(5) The Regional Administrator or the Director, appropriate official at EPA Headquarters, if an official at EPA Headquarters approved the closure plan, may modify the existing closure plan under the conditions described in paragraph (e)(4) of this section.
(6) Commercial storers of PCB waste shall comply with the following closure schedule:
(i) The commercial storer shall notify in writing the Regional Administrator or the Director, Office of Resource Conservation and Recovery, if an official at EPA Headquarters approved the closure plan, at least 60 days prior to the date on which final closure of its PCB storage facility is expected to begin.
(ii) The date when a commercial storer of PCB waste “expects to begin closure” shall be no later than 30 days after the date on which the storage facility received its final quantities of PCB waste. For good cause shown, EPA may extend the date for commencement of closure for an additional 30-day period.
(iii) Within 90 days after receiving the final quantity of PCB waste for storage, a commercial storer of PCB waste shall remove all PCB waste in storage at the facility from the facility in accordance with the approved closure plan. For good cause shown, EPA may approve a reasonable extension to the period for removal of the PCB waste.
(iv) A commercial storer of PCB waste shall complete closure activities in accordance with the approved closure plan and within 180 days after receiving the final quantity of PCB waste for storage at the facility. For good cause shown, EPA may approve a reasonable extension to the closure period.
(7) During the closure period, all contaminated system component equipment, structures, and soils shall be disposed of in accordance with the disposal requirements of subpart D of this part, or, if applicable, decontaminated in accordance with the levels specified in the PCB Spills Cleanup Policy at subpart G of this part. When PCB waste is removed from the storage facility during closure, the owner or operator becomes a generator of PCB waste subject to the generator requirements of subpart J of this part.
(8) Within 60 days of completion of closure of each facility for the storage of PCB waste, the commercial storer of PCB waste shall submit to the Regional Administrator (or the Director, Office of Resource Conservation and Recovery, if an official at EPA Headquarters approved the closure plan), by registered mail, a certification that the PCB storage facility has been closed in accordance with the approved closure plan. The certification shall be signed by the owner or operator and by an independent registered professional engineer.
(f)
Closure cost estimate.
(1) A commercial storer of PCB wastes shall have a detailed estimate, in current dollars, of the cost of closing the facility in accordance with its approved closure plan. The closure cost estimate shall be in writing, be certified by the person
preparing it (using the certification defined in § 761.3) and comply with all of the following criteria:
(i) The closure cost estimate shall equal the cost of final closure at the point in the PCB storage facility's active life when the extent and manner of PCB storage operations would make closure the most expensive, as indicated by the facility's closure plan.
(ii) The closure cost estimate shall be based on the costs to the owner or operator of hiring a third party to close the facility, and the third party shall not be either a corporate parent or subsidiary of the owner or operator, or member in joint ownership of the facility.
(iii) The owner or operator shall include in the estimate the current market costs for off-site commercial disposal of the facility's maximum estimated inventory of PCB wastes, except that on-site disposal costs may be used if on-site disposal capacity will exist at the facility at all times over the life of the PCB storage facility.
(iv) The closure cost estimate may not incorporate any salvage value that may be realized with the sale of wastes, facility structures or equipment, land, or other assets associated with the facility at the time of closure.
(2) During the active life of the PCB storage facility, the commercial storer of PCB waste shall adjust annually for inflation the closure cost estimate within 60 days prior to the anniversary date of the establishment of the financial instruments used to demonstrate financial responsibility for closure, except that owners or operators who use the financial test or corporate guarantee shall adjust their closure cost estimates for inflation within 30 days after the close of the storer's fiscal year. The adjustment may be made by recalculating the maximum costs of closure in current dollars, or by using an inflation factor derived from the most recent Implicit Price Deflator for Gross National Product published by the U.S. Department of Commerce in its
Survey of Current Business.
The Implicit Price Deflator for Gross National Product is included in a monthly publication titled
Economic Indicators,
which is available from the Superintendent of Documents, Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402. The inflation factor used in the latter method is the result of dividing the latest published annual Deflator by the Deflator for the previous year. The adjustment to the closure cost estimate is then made by multiplying the most recent closure cost estimate by the latest inflation factor.
(3) Where EPA approves a modification to the facility's closure plan, and that modification increases the cost of closure, the owner or operator shall revise the closure cost estimate no later than 30 days after the modification is approved. Any such revision shall also be adjusted for inflation in accordance with paragraph (f)(2) of this section.
(4) The owner or operator of the facility shall keep at the facility during its operating life the most recent closure cost estimate, including any adjustments resulting from inflation or from modifications to the closure plan.
(g)
Financial assurance for closure.
A commercial storer of PCB waste shall establish financial assurance for closure of each PCB storage facility that they own or operate. In establishing financial assurance for closure, the commercial storer of PCB waste may choose from the following financial assurance mechanisms or any combination of mechanisms:
(1) The “closure trust fund,” as specified in § 264.143(a) of this chapter, except for paragraph (a)(3) of § 264.143 and except when the Regional Administrator specifies modifications for the purposes of implementation under TSCA. For purposes of this paragraph, the following provisions also apply:
(i) Payments into the trust fund shall be made annually by the owner or operator over the remaining operating life of the facility as estimated in the closure plan, or over 3 years, whichever period is shorter. This period of time is hereafter referred to as the “pay-in period.” For an existing facility, the first payment must be made within 30 calendar days after EPA has notified the facility of its conditional approval. Interim approval to operate is canceled and the application is denied if EPA does not receive verification that the payment was made in that 30-day period.
(ii) For a new facility, the first payment into the closure trust fund shall be made before EPA grants final approval of the application and before the facility may accept the initial shipment of PCB waste for commercial storage. A receipt from the trustee shall be submitted by the owner or operator to the Regional Administrator (or the Director, Office of Resource Conservation and Recovery, if the commercial storage area is ancillary to a disposal facility approved by an official at EPA Headquarters) before this initial delivery of PCB waste. The first payment shall be at least equal to the current closure cost estimate, divided by the number of years in the pay-in period, except as provided in paragraph (g)(7) of this section for multiple mechanisms. Subsequent payments shall be made no later than 30 days after each anniversary date of the first payment. The amount of each subsequent payment shall be determined by subtracting the current value of the trust fund from the current closure cost estimate, and dividing this difference by the number of years remaining in the pay-in period.
(iii) If an owner or operator of a facility existing on the effective date of this paragraph establishes a trust fund to meet the financial assurance requirements of this paragraph, and the value of the trust fund is less than the current closure cost estimate when a final approval is granted for the facility, the amount of the current closure cost estimate still to be paid into the trust fund shall be paid in over the pay-in period as defined in paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this section. Payments shall continue to be made no later than 30 days after each anniversary date of the first payment made into the trust fund. The amount of each payment shall be determined by subtracting the current value of the trust fund from the current closure cost estimate, and dividing this difference by the number of years remaining in the pay-in period.
(iv) The submission of a trust agreement with the wording specified in § 264.151(a)(1) of this chapter, including any reference to hazardous waste management facilities, shall be deemed to be in compliance with the requirement to submit a trust agreement under this subpart except when the Regional Administrator specifies modifications for the purposes of implementation under TSCA.
(2) The “surety bond guaranteeing payment into a closure trust fund,” as specified in § 264.143(b) of this chapter, including the use of the surety bond instrument specified at § 264.151(b) of this chapter and the standby trust specified at § 264.143(b)(3) of this chapter except when the Regional Administrator specifies modifications for the purposes of implementation under TSCA. The use of the surety bonds, surety bond instruments, and standby trust agreements specified in §§ 264.143(b) and 264.151(b) of this chapter, with any modifications specified by the Regional Administrator, shall be deemed to be in compliance with this subpart.
(3)(i) The “surety bond guaranteeing performance of closure,” as specified at § 264.143(c) of this chapter, except for § 264.143(c)(5) of this chapter and except when the Regional Administrator specifies modifications for the purposes of implementation under TSCA. The submission and use of the surety bond instrument specified at § 264.151(c) of this chapter and the standby trust specified at § 264.143(c)(3) of this chapter, with any modifications specified by the Regional Administrator, shall be deemed to be in compliance with the requirements under this subpart relating to the use of surety bonds and standby trust funds.
(ii) For the purposes of this paragraph, and under the terms of the bond, the surety shall become liable on the bond obligation when the owner or operator fails to perform as guaranteed by the bond. Liability is established by a final administrative determination pursuant to section 16 of TSCA that the owner or operator has failed to perform final closure in accordance with the closure plan and other approval or regulatory requirements when required to do so.
(4)(i) The “closure letter of credit” specified in § 264.143(d) of this chapter, except for paragraph (d)(8) and except when the Regional Administrator specifies modifications for the purposes of implementation under TSCA. The submission and use of the irrevocable letter of credit instrument specified in
§ 264.151(d) of this chapter and the standby trust specified in § 264.143(d)(3) of this chapter, with any modifications specified by the Regional Administrator, shall be deemed to be in compliance with the requirements of this subpart relating to the use of letters of credit and standby trust funds.
(ii) For the purposes of this paragraph, the Regional Administrator (or the appropriate official at EPA Headquarters, if the commercial storage area is ancillary to a disposal facility for which an official at EPA Headquarters has approval authority) may draw on the letter of credit following a final administrative determination pursuant to section 16 of TSCA that the owner or operator has failed to perform final closure in accordance with the closure plan and other approval or regulatory requirements when required to do so.
(5) “Closure insurance,” as specified in § 264.143(e) of this chapter, utilizing the certificate of insurance for closure specified at § 264.151(e) of this chapter except when the Regional Administrator specifies modifications for the purposes of implementation under TSCA. The use of closure insurance as specified in § 264.143(e) of this chapter and the submission and use of the certificate of insurance specified in § 264.151(e) of this chapter, with any modifications specified by the Regional Administrator, shall be deemed to be in compliance with the requirements of this subpart relating to the use of closure insurance.
(6) The “financial test and corporate guarantee for closure,” as described in § 264.143(f) of this chapter except when the Regional Administrator specifies modifications for the purposes of implementation under TSCA, including a letter signed by the owner's or operator's chief financial officer as specified at § 264.151(f) of this chapter and, if applicable, the written corporate guarantee specified at § 264.151(h) of this chapter. The use of the financial test and corporate guarantee specified in § 264.143(f) of this chapter, the submission and use of the letter specified in § 264.151(f) of this chapter, and the submission and use of the written corporate guarantee specified at § 264.151(h) of this chapter, with any modifications specified by the Regional Administrator, shall be deemed to be in compliance with the requirements of this subpart relating to the use of financial tests and corporate guarantees.
(7) The corporate guarantee as specified in § 264.143(f)(10) of this chapter except when the Regional Administrator specifies modifications for the purposes of implementation under TSCA.
(8) The use of multiple financial mechanisms, as specified in § 264.143(g) of this chapter is permitted.
(9) A modification to a facility storing PCB waste that increases the maximum storage capacity indicated in the permit requires that a new financial assurance mechanism be established or an existing one be amended. When such a modification occurs, the Director of the Federal or State issuing authority must be notified in writing no later than 30 days from the completion of the modification. The new or revised financial assurance mechanism must be established and activated no later than 30 days after the Director of the Federal or State issuing authority is notified of the completion of the modification, but prior to the use of the modified portion of the facility.
(h)
Release of owner or operator.
Within 60 days after receiving certifications from the owner or operator and an independent registered professional engineer that final closure has been completed in accordance with the approved closure plan, EPA will notify the owner or operator in writing that the owner or operator is no longer required by this section to maintain financial assurance for final closure of the facility, unless EPA has reason to believe that final closure has not been completed in accordance with the approved closure plan. EPA shall provide the owner or operator with a detailed written statement stating the reasons why EPA believed closure was not conducted in accordance with the approved closure plan.
(i)
Laboratories and samples.
(1) A laboratory is conditionally exempt from the notification and approval requirements for a commercial storer under § 761.65 (d) through (h) when it stores samples held for disposal in a facility that complies with the standards in § 761.65 (b)(1)(i) through (b)(1)(iv).
(2) A laboratory sample is exempt from the manifesting requirements in §§ 761.210 through 761.213 when:
(i) The sample is being transported to a laboratory for the purpose of testing.
(ii) The sample is being transported back to the sample collector after testing.
(iii) The sample is being stored by the sample collector before transport to a laboratory for testing.
(iv) The sample is being stored in a laboratory before testing.
(v) The sample is being stored in a laboratory after testing but before it is returned to the sample collector.
(vi) The sample is being stored temporarily in the laboratory after testing for a specific purpose (for example, until conclusion of a court case or enforcement action where further testing of the sample may be necessary).
(3) In order to qualify for the exemption in paragraph (i)(2)(i) and (i)(2)(ii) of this section, a sample collector shipping samples to a laboratory and a laboratory returning samples to a sample collector must:
(i) Comply with applicable U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) or U.S. Postal Service (USPS) shipping requirements, found respectively in 49 CFR 173.345 and U.S. Postal Regulations 652.2 and 652.3.

§ 761.66
Emergency situations.
This section establishes procedures that may be used for purposes of the cleanup and/or disposal of PCB releases caused by an emergency situation as defined in § 761.3. This section allows the request of a waiver of any of the requirements in §§ 761.60, 761.61, 761.62, or 761.65. Any person conducting activities under these emergency provisions is also responsible for determining and
complying with all other applicable Federal, State, and local laws and regulations. This section does not prohibit any person from implementing temporary emergency measures to prevent, treat, or contain further releases or mitigate migration to the environment of PCBs or PCB remediation waste.
(a)
Applicability.
This section may only be applied to the cleanup and/or disposal of PCB releases caused by an emergency situation as defined in § 761.3.
(b)
Waiver Request.
Any person intending or planning to sample, extract, analyze, clean up, store, and/or dispose of PCBs under this section shall submit a waiver request to the Regional Administrator in the EPA Region where the sampling, extraction, analysis, cleanup, storage, and/or disposal would occur, in writing and/or by email no later than seven (7) days after discovery of the release or implementation of any temporary emergency measures, as applicable. The requestor must also send a copy of the waiver request to the Director of the State or Tribal environmental agency where the sampling, extraction, analysis, cleanup, storage, and/or disposal would occur. If the sampling, extraction, analysis, cleanup, storage, and/or disposal activities in the waiver request would be conducted in more than one Region, then the waiver request must be submitted, in its entirety, to the Regional Administrators for all affected Regions.
(1) This request shall include:
(i) The contact information for the person requesting the waiver.
(ii) Location(s) of the release(s).
(iii) A description of the emergency situation, including information about adverse conditions and the incident(s) that caused them.
(iv) The type(s) of material(s) that are contaminated and the source of the release, if known.
(v) The as-found PCB concentrations in the PCB waste, unless the materials are being managed as if they contain ≥500 ppm PCBs. If actual PCB concentrations have not yet been determined, then estimated concentrations may be provided in the request. Actual PCB concentrations shall be determined before disposal activities commence, unless the waste is being managed as if it contains ≥500 ppm PCBs.
(vi) The provisions of §§ 761.60, 761.61, 761.62, or 761.65 that the person requests to waive or modify (or to use alternative procedures for) and an explanation of why compliance with the existing provisions would be impracticable as a result of the emergency situation.
(vii) The plan for how sampling, extraction, analysis, storage, cleanup, and/or disposal of the PCB waste would be conducted if the waiver were granted. The plan shall provide information to support how the actions described in the plan do not pose an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment. This plan shall be based on the as-found PCB concentrations in the materials unless waste is being managed as if it contains PCBs ≥500 ppm.
(viii) Whether or not the PCB waste is near, or likely to impact, surface waters, ground waters, drinking water sources or distribution systems, wells, sediments, sewers or sewage treatment systems, grazing lands, vegetable gardens, residential dwellings, hospitals, schools, nursing homes, playgrounds, parks, day care centers, endangered species habitats, estuaries, wetlands, national parks, national wildlife refuges, commercial fisheries, or sport fisheries and how those areas and potential impacts will be addressed.
(2) To make changes to submitted information described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the requestor shall submit the new information to the EPA Regional Administrator(s) in writing and/or by email. Changes must also be sent to the Director of the State or Tribal environmental agency or agencies where the request is applicable.
(c)
Approval of waiver requests.
The EPA Regional Administrator may approve the waiver request, request additional information, approve the waiver request with specified changes or additional conditions, or deny the waiver request, in writing, by telephone, or by email. An approval, with or without changes or conditions, shall be based on the Regional Administrator's finding that compliance with the regulatory requirements from which a waiver is sought is impracticable and that the action approved under the
waiver will not pose an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment. At any point, EPA may impose additional sampling, extraction, analysis, cleanup, storage, and/or disposal requirements, or require the requestor to delay acting on their proposed plan, in order to ensure the actions will not pose an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment.
(d)
Steps after approval of waiver request.
Sampling, extraction, analysis, cleanup, storage, and disposal activities as described in the waiver request may begin after the EPA Regional Administrator responds with approval of the waiver request. All sampling, extraction, analysis, cleanup, storage, and disposal activities shall be conducted in compliance with the terms of the approval and all applicable provisions of §§ 761.60, 761.61, 761.62, and 761.65 not expressly waived by the approval.
(e)
As-found concentration.
Sampling, extraction, analysis, cleanup, storage, and disposal activities conducted under this section shall be based on the as-found concentration of the PCB waste unless the materials are being managed as if they contain ≥500 ppm PCBs.
(f)
Records, manifests, and certification.
Recordkeeping and certification are required in accordance with § 761.125(c)(5). The manifesting and reporting requirements in Subpart K apply to waste disposed of under this section. However, if the person requesting a waiver has not previously submitted a notification of PCB activity as described in § 761.205 and the requirements of § 761.205 specify that such notification is required for the cleanup, storage, and/or disposal activity, the requestor shall submit the notification within ten (10) business days of their waiver request. The requestor does not have to wait to obtain their EPA identification number before initiating cleanup and/or disposal activities described in their approved waiver request. While waiting for their identification number, the requestor may use the generic identification “40 CFR PART 761” in lieu of an EPA identification number on manifests for PCB waste. The requestor may alternatively use an EPA identification number they previously obtained from EPA under RCRA or a State or territory under an authorized RCRA program, if they have one. Once the requestor receives an EPA identification number, they shall use it on manifests for PCB waste.

(v) Plasticity Index
15.
(2)
Synthetic membrane liners.
Synthetic membrane liners shall be used when, in the judgment of the Regional Administrator, the hydrologic or geologic conditions at the landfill require such a liner in order to provide at least a permeability equivalent to the soils in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. Whenever a synthetic liner is used at a landfill site, special precautions shall be taken to insure that its integrity is maintained and that it is chemically compatible with PCBs. Adequate soil underlining and soil cover shall be provided to prevent excessive stress on the liner and to prevent rupture of the liner. The liner must have a minimum thickness of 30 mils.
(3)
Hydrologic conditions.
The bottom of the landfill shall be above the historical high groundwater table as provided below. Floodplains, shorelands, and groundwater recharge areas shall be avoided. There shall be no hydraulic connection between the site and standing or flowing surface water. The site shall have monitoring wells and leachate collection. The bottom of the landfill liner system or natural in-place soil barrier shall be at least fifty feet from the historical high water table.
(4)
Flood protection.
(i) If the landfill site is below the 100-year floodwater elevation, the operator shall provide surface water diversion dikes around the perimeter of the landfill site with a minimum height equal to two feet above the 100-year floodwater elevation.
(ii) If the landfill site is above the 100-year floodwater elevation, the operators shall provide diversion structures capable of diverting all of the surface water runoff from a 24-hour, 25-year storm.
(5)
Topography.
The landfill site shall be located in an area of low to moderate relief to minimize erosion and to help prevent landslides or slumping.
(6)
Monitoring systems
—(i)
Water sampling.
(A) For all sites receiving PCBs, the ground and surface water from the disposal site area shall be sampled prior to commencing operations under an approval provided in paragraph (c) of this section for use as baseline data.
(B) Any surface watercourse designated by the Regional Administrator using the authority provided in paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section shall be sampled at least monthly when the landfill is being used for disposal operations.
(C) Any surface watercourse designated by the Regional Administrator using the authority provided in paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section shall be sampled for a time period specified by the Regional Administrator on a frequency of no less than once every six months after final closure of the disposal area.
(ii)
Groundwater monitor wells.
(A) If underlying earth materials are homogenous, impermeable, and uniformly sloping in one direction, only three sampling points shall be necessary. These three points shall be equally spaced on a line through the center of the disposal area and extending from the area of highest water table elevation to the area of the lowest water table elevation on the property.
(B) All monitor wells shall be cased and the annular space between the monitor zone (zone of saturation) and the surface shall be completely backfilled with Portland cement or an equivalent material and plugged with Portland cement to effectively prevent percolation of surface water into the well bore. The well opening at the surface shall have a removable cap to provide access and to prevent entrance of rainfall or stormwater runoff. The well shall be pumped to remove the volume of liquid initially contained in the well before obtaining a sample for analysis. The discharge shall be treated to meet applicable State or Federal discharge standards or recycled to the chemical waste landfill.
(iii)
Water analysis.
As a minimum, all samples shall be analyzed for the following parameters, and all data and records of the sampling and analysis shall be maintained as required in § 761.180(d)(1). Sampling methods and analytical procedures for these parameters shall comply with those specified in 40 CFR part 136 as amended in 41 FR 52779 on December 1, 1976.
(A) PCBs.
(B) pH.
(C) Specific conductance.
(D) Chlorinated organics.
(7)
Leachate collection.
A leachate collection monitoring system shall be installed above the chemical waste landfill. Leachate collection systems shall be monitored monthly for quantity and physicochemical characteristics of leachate produced. The leachate should be either treated to acceptable limits for discharge in accordance with a State or Federal permit or disposed of by another State or Federally approved method. Water analysis shall be conducted as provided in paragraph (b)(6)(iii) of this section. Acceptable leachate monitoring/collection systems shall be any of the following designs, unless a waiver is obtained pursuant to paragraph (c)(4) of this section.
(i)
Simple leachate collection.
This system consists of a gravity flow drainfield installed above the waste disposal unit liner. This design is recommended for use when semi-solid or leachable solid wastes are placed in a lined pit excavated into a relatively thick, unsaturated, homogenous layer of low permeability soil.
(ii)
Compound leachate collection.
This system consists of a gravity flow drainfield installed above the waste disposal unit liner and above a secondary installed liner. This design is recommended for use when semi-liquid or leachable solid wastes are placed in a lined pit excavated into relatively permeable soil.
(iii)
Suction lysimeters.
This system consists of a network of porous ceramic cups connected by hoses/tubing to a vacuum pump. The porous ceramic cups or suction lysimeters are installed along the sides and under the bottom of the waste disposal unit liner. This type of system works best when installed in a relatively permeable unsaturated soil immediately adjacent to the bottom and/or sides of the disposal facility.
(8)
Chemical waste landfill operations.
(i) PCBs and PCB Items shall be placed in a landfill in a manner that will prevent damage to containers or articles. Other wastes placed in the landfill that are not chemically compatible with PCBs and PCB Items including organic solvents shall be segregated from the PCBs throughout the waste handling and disposal process.
(ii) An operation plan shall be developed and submitted to the Regional Administrator for approval as required in paragraph (c) of this section. This plan shall include detailed explanations of the procedures to be used for recordkeeping, surface water handling procedures, excavation and backfilling, waste segregation burial coordinates, vehicle and equipment movement, use of roadways, leachate collection systems, sampling and monitoring procedures, monitoring wells, environmental emergency contingency plans, and security measures to protect against vandalism and unauthorized waste
placements. EPA guidelines entitled “Thermal Processing and Land Disposal of Solid Waste” (39 FR 29337, Aug. 14, 1974) are a useful reference in preparation of this plan. If the facility is to be used to dispose of liquid wastes containing between 50 ppm and 500 ppm PCB, the operations plan must include procedures to determine that liquid PCBs to be disposed of at the landfill do not exceed 500 ppm PCB and measures to prevent the migration of PCBs from the landfill. Bulk liquids not exceeding 500 ppm PCBs may be disposed of provided such waste is pretreated and/or stabilized (e.g., chemically fixed, evaporated, mixed with dry inert absorbant) to reduce its liquid content or increase its solid content so that a non-flowing consistency is achieved to eliminate the presence of free liquids prior to final disposal in a landfill. PCB Container of liquid PCBs with a concentration between 50 and 500 ppm PCB may be disposed of if each container is surrounded by an amount of inert sorbant material capable of absorbing all of the liquid contents of the container.
(iii) Ignitable wastes shall not be disposed of in chemical waste landfills. Liquid ignitable wastes are wastes that have a flash point less than 60 degrees C (140 degrees F) as determined by the following method or an equivalent method: Flash point of liquids shall be determined by a Pensky-Martens Closed Cup Tester, using the protocol specified in ASTM D93-09 or ASTM D8175-18, a Small Scale Closed Cup Tester, using the protocol specified in ASTM D3278-96 (Reapproved 2011) or ASTM D8174-18, or the Setaflash Closed Tester using the protocol specified in ASTM D3278-96 (Reapproved 2011) (all standards incorporated by reference, see § 761.19).
(iv) Records shall be maintained for all PCB disposal operations and shall include information on the PCB concentration in liquid wastes and the three dimensional burial coordinates for PCBs and PCB Items. Additional records shall be developed and maintained as required in § 761.180.
(9)
Supporting facilities.
(i) A six foot woven mesh fence, wall, or similar device shall be placed around the site to prevent unauthorized persons and animals from entering.
(ii) Roads shall be maintained to and within the site which are adequate to support the operation and maintenance of the site without causing safety or nuisance problems or hazardous conditions.
(iii) The site shall be operated and maintained in a manner to prevent safety problems or hazardous conditions resulting from spilled liquids and windblown materials.
(c)
Approval of chemical waste landfills.
Prior to the disposal of any PCBs and PCB Items in a chemical waste landfill, the owner or operator of the landfill shall receive written approval of the Agency Regional Administrator for the Region in which the landfill is located. The approval shall be obtained in the following manner:

(i) Drain the free-flowing MODEF or askarel and allow the residual surfaces to drain for an additional 15 hours.
(ii) Dispose of drained MODEF or askarel according to paragraph (g) of this section.
(iii) Soak the surfaces to be decontaminated in a sufficient amount of clean PODF (containing
2 ppm PCBs) such that there is a minimum of 800 ml of PODF for each 100 cm
2
of contaminated or potentially contaminated surface for at least 15 hours at ≥20 °C.
(iv) Approved PODFs include:
(A) Kerosene.
(B) Diesel fuel.
(C) Terpene hydrocarbons.
(D) Mixtures of terpene hydrocarbons and terpene alcohols.

2
of surface for at least 15 hours at ≥20 °C.
(viii) Drain the PODF from the surfaces.
(ix) Dispose of the drained PODF in accordance with paragraph (g) of this section.
(5) Any person decontaminating piping and air lines in an air compressor system must do so as follows:
(i) Before decontamination proceeds, disconnect or bypass the air compressors and air dryers from the piping and air lines and decontaminate the air compressors and air dryers separately in accordance with paragraphs (b), (c)(1) through (c)(4), or (c)(6) of this section. Dispose of filter media and desiccant in the air dyers based on their existing PCB concentration.
(ii) Test the connecting line and appurtenances of the system to assure that there is no leakage. Test by introducing air into the closed system at from 90 to 100 pounds per square inch (psi). Only if there is a pressure drop of
5 psi in 30 minutes may decontamination take place.
(iii) When there is no leakage, fill the piping and air lines with clean (containing
2 ppm PCBs) solvent. Solvents include PODF, aqueous potassium hydroxide at a pH between 9 and 12, or water containing 5 percent sodium hydroxide by weight.
(iv) Circulate the solvent to achieve turbulent flow through the piping and
air lines in the air compressor system until the total volume of solvent circulated equals 10 times the total volume of the particular article being decontaminated, then drain the solvent. Calculate the total volume of solvent circulated by multiplying the pump rate by the time of pumping. Turbulent flow means a Reynolds number range from 20,000 to 43,000. Refill the system with clean solvent and repeat the circulation and drain process.

# Subpart G—PCB Spill Cleanup Policy

# Source:
52 FR 10705, Apr. 2, 1987, unless otherwise noted.
§ 761.120
Scope.
(a)
General.
This policy establishes criteria EPA will use to determine the adequacy of the cleanup of spills resulting from the release of materials containing PCBs at concentrations of 50 ppm or greater. The policy applies to spills which occur after May 4, 1987.
(1) Existing spills (spills which occurred prior to May 4, 1987, are excluded from the scope of this policy for two reasons:
(i) For old spills which have already been discovered, this policy is not intended to require additional cleanup where a party has already cleaned a spill in accordance with requirements imposed by EPA through its regional offices, nor is this policy intended to interfere with ongoing litigation of enforcement actions which bring into issue PCB spills cleanup.
(ii) EPA recognizes that old spills which are discovered after the effective date of this policy will require site-by-site evaluation because of the likelihood that the site involves more pervasive PCB contamination than fresh spills and because old spills are generally more difficult to clean up than fresh spills (particularly on porous surfaces such as concrete). Therefore, spills which occurred before the effective date of this policy are to be decontaminated to requirements established at the discretion of EPA, usually through its regional offices.
(2) EPA expects most PCB spills subject to the TSCA PCB regulations to conform to the typical spill situations considered in developing this policy. This policy does, however, exclude from application of the final numerical cleanup standards certain spill situations from its scope: Spills directly into surface waters, drinking water, sewers, grazing lands, and vegetable gardens. These types of spills are subject to final cleanup standards to be established at the discretion of the regional office. These spills are, however, subject to the immediate notification
requirements and measures to minimize further environmental contamination.
(3) For all other spills, EPA generally expects the decontamination standards of this policy to apply. Occasionally, some small percentage of spills covered by this policy may warrant more stringent cleanup requirements because of additional routes of exposure or significantly greater exposures than those assumed in developing the final cleanup standards of this policy. While the EPA regional offices have the authority to require additional cleanup in these circumstances, the Regional Administrator must first make a finding based on the specific facts of a spill that additional cleanup must occur to prevent unreasonable risk. In addition, before a final decision is made to require additional cleanup, the Regional Administrator must notify the Director, Office of Resource Conservation and Recovery of his/her finding and the basis for the finding.
(4) There may also be exceptional spill situations that requires less stringent cleanup or a different approach to cleanup because of factors associated with the particular spill. These factors may mitigate expected exposures and risks or make cleanup to these requirements impracticable.
(b)
Spills that may require more stringent cleanup levels.
For spills within the scope of this policy, EPA generally retains, under § 761.135, the authority to require additional cleanup upon finding that, despite good faith efforts by the responsible party, the numerical decontamination levels in the policy have not been met. In addition, EPA foresees the possibility of exceptional spill situations in which site-specific risk factors may warrant additional cleanup to more stringent numerical decontamination levels than are required by the policy. In these situations, the Regional Administrator has the authority to require cleanup to levels lower than those included in this policy upon finding that further cleanup must occur to prevent unreasonable risk. The Regional Administrator will consult with the Director, Office of Resource Conservation and Recovery, prior to making such a finding.
(1) For example, site-specific characteristics, such as short depth to ground water, type of soil, or the presence of a shallow well, may pose exceptionally high potential for ground water contamination by PCBs remaining after cleanup to the standards specified in this policy. Spills that pose such a high degree of potential for ground water contamination have not been excluded from the policy under paragraph (d) of this section because the presence of such potential may not be readily apparent. EPA feels that automatically excluding such spills from the scope of the policy could result in the delay of cleanup—a particularly undesirable outcome if potential ground water contamination is, in fact, a significant concern.
(2) In those situations, the Regional Administrator may require cleanup in addition to that required under § 761.125(b) and (c). However, the Regional Administrator must first make a finding, based on the specific facts of a spill, that additional cleanup is necessary to prevent unreasonable risk. In addition, before making a final decision on additional cleanup, the Regional Administrator must notify the Director, Office of Resource Conservation and Recovery of their finding and the basis for the finding.
(c)
Flexibility to allow less stringent or alternative requirements.
(1) EPA retains the flexibility to allow less stringent or alternative decontamination measures based upon site-specific considerations. EPA will exercise this flexibility if the responsible party demonstrates that cleanup to the numerical decontamination levels is clearly unwarranted because of risk-mitigating factors, that compliance with the procedural requirements or numerical standards in the policy is impracticable at a particular site, or that site-specific characteristics make the costs of cleanup prohibitive. The Regional Administrator will notify the Director, Office of Resource Conservation and Recovery of any decision and the basis for the decision to allow less stringent cleanup. The purpose of this notification is to enable the Director, Office of Resource Conservation and Recovery to ensure consistency of spill cleanup standards
under special circumstances across the regions.
(2) In emergency situations, as defined in § 761.123, the following provisions of this Policy are hereby modified as follows:
(i) For actions taken directly in response to spills caused by emergency situations, responsible parties may use the as-found concentrations in the spill materials when determining whether to manage the spill under §§ 761.125(b) or (c) of this Policy when it is not possible to readily determine the spill source concentration at a site.
(ii) For spills caused by emergency situations, the applicable notifications in § 761.125(a)(1) must be submitted as soon as possible, but no later than 48 hours after the adverse conditions that prevented communication have ended.
(d)
Excluded spills.
(1) Although the spill situations in paragraphs (d)(2) (i) through (vi) of this section are excluded from the automatic application of final decontamination standards under § 761.125 (b) and (c), the general requirements under § 761.125(a) do apply to these spills. In addition, all of these excluded situations require practicable, immediate actions to contain the area of contamination. While these situations may not always require more stringent cleanup measures, the Agency is excluding these scenarios because they will always involve significant factors that may not be adequately addressed by cleanup standards based upon typical spill characteristics.
(2) For the spill situations in paragraphs (d)(2)(i) through (vi) of this section, the responsible party shall decontaminate the spill in accordance with site-specific requirements established by the EPA regional offices.
(i) Spills that result in the direct contamination of surface waters (surface waters include, but are not limited to, “waters of the United States” as defined in part 122 of this chapter, ponds, lagoons, wetlands, and storage reservoirs).
(ii) Spills that result in the direct contamination of sewers or sewage treatment systems.
(iii) Spills that result in the direct contamination of any private or public drinking water sources or distribution systems.
(iv) Spills which migrate to and contaminate surface waters, sewers, or drinking water supplies before cleanup has been completed in accordance with this policy.
(v) Spills that contaminate animal grazing lands.
(vi) Spills that contaminate vegetable gradens.
(e)
Relationship of policy to other statutes.
(1) This policy does not affect cleanup standards or requirements for the reporting of spills imposed, or to be imposed, under other Federal statutory authorities, including but not limited to, the Clean Water Act (CWA), the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), and the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA) as amended by the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (SARA). Where more than one requirement applies, the stricter standard must be met.
(2) The Agency recognizes that the existence of this policy will inevitably result in attempts to apply the standards to situations within the scope of other statutory authorities. However, other statutes require the Agency to consider different or alternative factors in determining appropriate corrective actions. In addition, the types and magnitudes of exposures associated with sites requiring corrective action under other statutes often involve important differences from those expected of the typical, electrical equipment-type spills considered in developing this policy. Thus, cleanups under other statutes, such as RCRA corrective actions or remedial and response actions under SARA may result in different outcomes.

§ 761.123
Definitions.
For purposes of this policy, certain words and phrases are used to denote specific materials, procedures, or circumstances. The following definitions are provided for purposes of clarity and are not to be taken as exhaustive lists
of situations and materials covered by the policy.
Double wash/rinse
means a minimum requirement to cleanse solid surfaces (both impervious and nonimpervious) two times with an appropriate solvent or other material in which PCBs are at least 5 percent soluble (by weight). A volume of PCB-free fluid sufficient to cover the contaminated surface completely must be used in each wash/rinse. The wash/rinse requirement does not mean the mere spreading of solvent or other fluid over the surface, nor does the requirement mean a once-over wipe with a soaked cloth. Precautions must be taken to contain any runoff resulting from the cleansing and to dispose properly of wastes generated during the cleansing.
Emergency situation
means adverse conditions caused by manmade or natural incidents that threaten lives, property, or public health and safety; require prompt responsive action from the local, State, Tribal, territorial, or Federal government; and result in or are reasonably expected to result in: (1) A declaration by either the President of the United States or Governor of the affected State of a natural disaster or emergency; or, (2) an incident funded under FEMA via a Stafford Act disaster declaration or emergency declaration. Examples of emergency situations may include civil emergencies or adverse natural conditions, such as hurricanes, earthquakes, or tornados.
High-concentration PCBs
means PCBs that contain 500 ppm or greater PCBs, or those materials which EPA requires to be assumed to contain 500 ppm or greater PCBs in the absence of testing.
High-contact industrial surface
means a surface in an industrial setting which is repeatedly touched, often for relatively long periods of time. Manned machinery and control panels are examples of high-contact industrial surfaces. High-contact industrial surfaces are generally of impervious solid material. Examples of low-contact industrial surfaces include ceilings, walls, floors, roofs, roadways and sidewalks in the industrial area, utility poles, unmanned machinery, concrete pads beneath electrical equipment, curbing, exterior structural building components, indoor vaults, and pipes.
High-contact residential/commercial surface
means a surface in a residential/commercial area which is repeatedly touched, often for relatively long periods of time. Doors, wall areas below 6 feet in height, uncovered flooring, windowsills, fencing, bannisters, stairs, automobiles, and children's play areas such as outdoor patios and sidewalks are examples of high-contact residential/commercial surfaces. Examples of low-contact residential/commercial surfaces include interior ceilings, interior wall areas above 6 feet in height, roofs, asphalt roadways, concrete roadways, wooden utility poles, unmanned machinery, concrete pads beneath electrical equipment, curbing, exterior structural building components (e.g., aluminum/vinyl siding, cinder block, asphalt tiles), and pipes.
Impervious solid surfaces
means solid surfaces which are nonporous and thus unlikely to absorb spilled PCBs within the short period of time required for cleanup of spills under this policy. Impervious solid surfaces include, but are not limited to, metals, glass, aluminum siding, and enameled or laminated surfaces.
Low-concentration PCBs
means PCBs that are tested and found to contain less than 500 ppm PCBs, or those PCB-containing materials which EPA requires to be assumed to be at concentrations below 500 ppm (i.e., untested mineral oil dielectric fluid).
Nonimpervious solid surfaces
means solid surfaces which are porous and are more likely to absorb spilled PCBs prior to completion of the cleanup requirements prescribed in this policy. Nonimpervious solid surfaces include, but are not limited to, wood, concrete, asphalt, and plasterboard.
Nonrestricted access areas
means any area other than restricted access, outdoor electrical substations, and other restricted access locations, as defined in this section. In addition to residential/commercial areas, these areas include unrestricted access rural areas (areas of low density development and population where access is uncontrolled by either man-made barriers or naturally occurring barriers, such as rough terrain, mountains, or cliffs).
Other restricted access (nonsubstation) locations
means areas other than electrical substations that are at least 0.1 kilometer (km) from a residential/commercial area and limited by man-made barriers (e.g., fences and walls) or substantially limited by naturally occurring barriers such as mountains, cliffs, or rough terrain. These areas generally include industrial facilities and extremely remote rural locations. (Areas where access is restricted but are less than 0.1 km from a residential/commercial area are considered to be residential/commercial areas.)
Outdoor electrical substations
means outdoor, fenced-off, and restricted access areas used in the transmission and/or distribution of electrical power Outdoor electrical substations restrict public access by being fenced or walled off as defined under § 761.30(l)(1)(ii). For purposes of this TSCA policy, outdoor electrical substations are defined as being located at least 0.1 km from a residential/commercial area. Outdoor fenced-off and restricted access areas used in the transmission and/or distribution of electrical power which are located less than 0.1. km from a residential/commercial area are considered to be residential/commercial areas.
PCBs
means polychlorinated biphenyls as defined under § 761.3. As specified under § 761.1(b), no requirements may be avoided through dilution of the PCB concentration.
Requirements and standards
means:
(1) “Requirements” as used in this policy refers to both the procedural responses and numerical decontamination levels set forth in this policy as constituting adequate cleanup of PCBs.
(2) “Standards” refers to the numerical decontamination levels set forth in this policy.
Residential/commercial areas
means those areas where people live or reside, or where people work in other than manufacturing or farming industries. Residential areas include housing and the property on which housing is located, as well as playgrounds, roadways, sidewalks, parks, and other similar areas within a residential community. Commercial areas are typically accessible to both members of the general public and employees and include public assembly properties, institutional properties, stores, office buildings, and transportation centers.
Responsible party
means the owner of the PCB equipment, facility, or other source of PCBs or his/her designated agent (e.g., a facility manager or foreman).
Soil
means all vegetation, soils and other ground media, including but not limited to, sand, grass, gravel, and oyster shells. It does not include concrete and asphalt.
Spill
means both intentional and unintentional spills, leaks, and other uncontrolled discharges where the release results in any quantity of PCBs running off or about to run off the external surface of the equipment or other PCB source, as well as the contamination resulting from those releases. This policy applies to spills of 50 ppm or greater PCBs. The concentration of PCBs spilled is determined by the PCB concentration in the material spilled as opposed to the concentration of PCBs in the material onto which the PCBs were spilled. Where a spill of untested mineral oil occurs, the oil is presumed to contain greater than 50 ppm, but less than 500 ppm PCBs and is subject to the relevant requirements of this policy.
Spill area
means the area of soil on which visible traces of the spill can be observed plus a buffer zone of 1 foot beyond the visible traces. Any surface or object (e.g., concrete sidewalk or automobile) within the visible traces area or on which visible traces of the spilled material are observed is included in the spill area. This area represents the minimum area assumed to be contaminated by PCBs in the absence of precleanup sampling data and is thus the minimum area which must be cleaned.
Spill boundaries
means the actual area of contamination as determined by postcleanup verification sampling or by precleanup sampling to determine actual spill boundaries. EPA can require additional cleanup when necessary to decontaminate all areas within the spill boundaries to the levels required in this policy (e.g., additional cleanup will be required if postcleanup sampling indicates that the area decontaminated by the responsible party, such as the spill area as defined in this
section, did not encompass the actual boundaries of PCB contamination).
Standard wipe test
means, for spills of high-concentration PCBs on solid surfaces, a cleanup to numerical surface standards and sampling by a standard wipe test to verify that the numerical standards have been met. This definition constitutes the minimum requirements for an appropriate wipe testing protocol. A standard-size template (10 centimeters (cm) × 10 cm) will be used to delineate the area of cleanup; the wiping medium will be a gauze pad or glass wool of known size which has been saturated with hexane. It is important that the wipe be performed very quickly after the hexane is exposed to air. EPA strongly recommends that the gauze (or glass wool) be prepared with hexane in the laboratory and that the wiping medium be stored in sealed glass vials until it is used for the wipe test. Further, EPA requires the collection and testing of field blanks and replicates.
[52 FR 10705, Apr. 2, 1987; 52 FR 23397, June 19, 1987, as amended at 88 FR 59692, Aug. 29, 2023]
§ 761.125
Requirements for PCB spill cleanup.
(a)
General.
Unless expressly limited, the reporting, disposal, and precleanup sampling requirements in paragraphs (a) (1) through (3) of this section apply to all spills of PCBs at concentrations of 50 ppm or greater which are subject to decontamination requirements under TSCA, including those spills listed under § 761.120(b) which are excluded from the cleanup standards at paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.
(1)
Reporting requirements.
The reporting in paragraphs (a)(1) (i) through (iv) of this section is required in addition to applicable reporting requirements under the Clean Water Act (CWA) or the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA). For example, under the National Contingency Plan all spills involving 1 pound or more by weight of PCBs must currently be reported to the National Response Center (1-800-424-8802). The requirements in paragraphs (a)(1) (i) through (iv) of this section are designed to be consistent with existing reporting requirements to the extent possible so as to minimize reporting burdens on governments as well as the regulated community.
(i) Where a spill directly contaminates surface water, sewers, or drinking water supplies, as discussed under § 761.120(d), the responsible party shall notify the appropriate EPA regional office and obtain guidance for appropriate cleanup measures in the shortest possible time after discovery, but in no case later than 24 hours after discovery.
(ii) Where a spill directly contaminates grazing lands or vegetable gardens, as discussed under § 761.120(d), the responsible party shall notify the appropriate EPA regional office and proceed with the immediate requirements specified under paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, depending on the source of the spill, in the shortest possible time after discovery, but in no case later than 24 hours after discovery.
(iii) Where a spill exceeds 10 pounds of PCBs by weight and is not addressed in paragraph (a)(1) (i) or (ii) of this section, the responsible party will notify the appropriate EPA regional office and proceed to decontaminate the spill area in accordance with this TSCA policy in the shortest possible time after discovery, but in no case later than 24 hours after discovery.
(iv) Spills of 10 pounds or less, which are not addressed in paragraph (a)(1) (i) or (ii) of this section, must be cleaned up in accordance with this policy (in order to avoid EPA enforcement liability), but notification of EPA is not required.
(2)
Disposal of cleanup debris and materials.
All concentrated soils, solvents, rags, and other materials resulting from the cleanup of PCBs under this policy shall be properly stored, labeled, and disposed of in accordance with the provisions of Subpart D of this part, except that such materials shall not be disposed of in a hazardous waste landfill permitted by EPA under section 3005 of RCRA or by a State or territory authorized under section 3006 of RCRA pursuant to § 761.61(b)(2)(ii)(A).
(3)
Determination of spill boundaries in the absence of visible traces.
For spills where there are insufficient visible traces yet there is evidence of a leak or spill, the boundaries of the spill are to
be determined by using a statistically based sampling scheme.
(b)
Requirements for cleanup of low-concentration spills which involve less than 1 pound of PCBs by weight (less than 270 gallons of untested mineral oil)
—(1)
Decontamination requirements.
Spills of less than 270 gallons of untested mineral oil, low-concentration PCBs, as defined under § 761.123, which involve less than 1 pound of PCBs by weight (e.g., less than 270 gallons of untested mineral oil containing less than 500 ppm PCBs) shall be cleaned in the following manner:
(i) Solid surfaces must be double washed/rinsed (as defined under § 761.123); except that all indoor, residential surfaces other than vault areas must be cleaned to 10 micrograms per 100 square centimeters (10 µg/100 cm
2
) by standard commercial wipe tests.
(ii) All soil within the spill area (i.e., visible traces of soil and a buffer of 1 lateral foot around the visible traces) must be excavated, and the ground be restored to its original configuration by back-filling with clean soil (i.e., containing less than 1 ppm PCBs).
(iii) Requirements of paragraphs (b)(1) (i) and (ii) of this section must be completed within 48 hours after the responsible party was notified or became aware of the spill.
(2)
Effect of emergency or adverse weather.
Completion of cleanup may be delayed beyond 48 hours in case of circumstances including but not limited to, civil emergency, adverse weather conditions, lack of access to the site, and emergency operating conditions. The occurrence of a spill on a weekend or overtime costs are not acceptable reasons to delay response. Completion of cleanup may be delayed only for the duration of the adverse conditions. If the adverse weather conditions, or time lapse due to other emergency, has left insufficient visible traces, the responsible party must use a statistically based sampling scheme to determine the spill boundaries as required under paragraph (a)(3) of this section.
(3)
Records and certification.
At the completion of cleanup, the responsible party shall document the cleanup with records and certification of decontamination. The records and certification must be maintained for a period of 5 years. The records and certification shall consist of the following:
(i) Identification of the source of the spill (e.g., type of equipment).
(ii) Estimated or actual date and time of the spill occurrence.
(iii) The date and time cleanup was completed or terminated (if cleanup was delayed by emergency or adverse weather: the nature and duration of the delay).
(iv) A brief description of the spill location.
(v) Precleanup sampling data used to establish the spill boundaries if required because of insufficient visible traces, and a brief description of the sampling methodology used to establish the spill boundaries.
(vi) A brief description of the solid surfaces cleaned and of the double wash/rinse method used.
(vii) Approximate depth of soil excavation and the amount of soil removed.
(viii) A certification statement signed by the responsible party stating that the cleanup requirements have been met and that the information contained in the record is true to the best of his/her knowledge.
(ix) While not required for compliance with this policy, the following information would be useful if maintained in the records:
(A) Additional pre- or post-cleanup sampling.
(B) The estimated cost of the cleanup by man-hours, dollars, or both.
(c)
Requirements for cleanup of high-concentration spills and low-concentration spills involving 1 pound or more PCBs by weight (270 gallons or more of untested mineral oil).
Cleanup of low-concentration spills involving 1 lb or more PCBs by weight and of all spills of materials other than low-concentration materials shall be considered complete if all of the immediate requirements, cleanup standards, sampling, and recordkeeping requirements of paragraphs (c) (1) through (5) of this section are met.
(1)
Immediate requirements.
The four actions in paragraphs (c)(1) (i) through (iv) of this section must be taken as quickly as possible and within no more than 24 hours (or within 48 hours for PCB Transformers) after the responsible party was notified or became
aware of the spill, except that actions described in paragraphs (c)(1) (ii) through (iv) of this section can be delayed beyond 24 hours if circumstances (e.g., civil emergency, hurricane, tornado, or other similar adverse weather conditions, lack of access due to physical impossibility, or emergency operating conditions) so require for the duration of the adverse conditions. The occurrence of a spill on a weekend or overtime costs are not acceptable reasons to delay response. Owners of spilled PCBs who have delayed cleanup because of these types of circumstances must keep records documenting the fact that circumstances precluded rapid response.
(i) The responsible party shall notify the EPA regional office and the NRC as required by § 761.125(a)(1) or by other applicable statutes.
(ii) The responsible party shall effectively cordon off or otherwise delineate and restrict an area encompassing any visible traces plus a 3-foot buffer and place clearly visible signs advising persons to avoid the area to minimize the spread of contamination as well as the potential for human exposure.
(iii) The responsible party shall record and document the area of visible contamination, noting the extent of the visible trace areas and the center of the visible trace area. If there are no visible traces, the responsible party shall record this fact and contact the regional office of the EPA for guidance in completing statistical sampling of the spill area to establish spill boundaries.
(iv) The responsible party shall initiate cleanup of all visible traces of the fluid on hard surfaces and initiate removal of all visible traces of the spill on soil and other media, such as gravel, sand, oyster shells, etc.
(v) If there has been a delay in reaching the site and there are insufficient visible traces of PCBs remaining at the spill site, the responsible party must estimate (based on the amount of material missing from the equipment or container) the area of the spill and immediately cordon off the area of suspect contamination. The responsible party must then utilize a statistically based sampling scheme to identify the boundaries of the spill area as soon as practicable.
(vi) Although this policy requires certain immediate actions, as described in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section, EPA is not placing a time limit on completion of the cleanup effort since the time required for completion will vary from case to case. However, EPA expects that decontamination will be achieved promptly in all cases and will consider promptness of completion in determining whether the responsible party made good faith efforts to clean up in accordance with this policy.
(2)
Requirements for decontaminating spills in outdoor electrical substations.
Spills which occur in outdoor electrical substations, as defined under § 761.123, shall be decontaminated in accordance with paragraphs (c)(2) (i) and (ii) of this section. Conformance to the cleanup standards under paragraphs (c)(2) (i) and (ii) of this section shall be verified by post-cleanup sampling as specified under § 761.130. At such times as outdoor electrical substations are converted to another use, the spill site shall be cleaned up to the nonrestricted access requirements under paragraph (c)(4) of this section.
(i) Contaminated solid surfaces (both impervious and non-impervious) shall be cleaned to a PCB concentration of 100 micrograms (µg)/100 square centimeters (cm
2
) (as measured by standard wipe tests).
(ii) At the option of the responsible party, soil contaminated by the spill will be cleaned either to 25 ppm PCBs by weight, or to 50 ppm PCBs by weight provided that a label or notice is visibly placed in the area. Upon demonstration by the responsible party that cleanup to 25 ppm or 50 ppm will jeopardize the integrity of the electrical equipment at the substation, the EPA regional office may establish an alternative cleanup method or level and place the responsible party on a reasonably timely schedule for completion of cleanup.
(3)
Requirements for decontaminating spills in other restricted access areas.
Spills which occur in restricted access locations other than outdoor electrical substations, as defined under § 761.123, shall be decontaminated in accordance
with paragraphs (c)(3) (i) through (v) of this section. Conformance to the cleanup standards in paragraphs (c)(3) (i) through (v) of this section shall be verified by postcleanup sampling as specified under § 761.130. At such times as restricted access areas other than outdoor electrical substations are converted to another use, the spill site shall be cleaned up to the nonrestricted access area requirements of paragraph (c)(4) of this section.
(i) High-contact solid surfaces, as defined under § 761.163 shall be cleaned to 10 µg/100 cm
2
(as measured by standard wipe tests).
(ii) Low-contact, indoor, impervious solid surfaces will be decontaminated to 10 µg/100 cm
2
.
(iii) At the option of the responsible party, low-contact, indoor, nonimpervious surfaces will be cleaned either to 10 µg/100 cm
2
or to 100 µg/100 cm
2
and encapsulated. The Regional Administrator, however, retains the authority to disallow the encapsulation option for a particular spill situation upon finding that the uncertainties associated with that option pose special concerns at that site. That is, the Regional Administrator would not permit encapsulation if they determine that if the encapsulation failed the failure would create an imminent hazard at the site.
(iv) Low-contact, outdoor surfaces (both impervious and nonimpervious) shall be cleaned to 100 µg/100 cm
2
.
(v) Soil contaminated by the spill will be cleaned to 25 ppm PCBs by weight.
(4)
Requirements for decontaminating spills in nonrestricted access areas.
Spills which occur in nonrestricted access locations, as defined under § 761.123, shall be decontaminated in accordance with paragraphs (c)(4) (i) through (v) of this section. Conformance to the cleanup standards at paragraphs (c)(4) (i) through (v) of this section shall be verified by postcleanup sampling as specified under § 761.130.
(i) Furnishings, toys, and other easily replaceable household items shall be disposed of in accordance with the provisions of subpart D of this part and replaced by the responsible party.
(ii) Indoor solid surfaces and high-contact outdoor solid surfaces, defined as high contact residential/commercial surfaces under § 761.123, shall be cleaned to 10 µg/100 cm
2
(as measured by standard wipe tests).
(iii) Indoor vault areas and low-contact, outdoor, impervious solid surfaces shall be decontaminated to 10 µg/100 cm
2
.
(iv) At the option of the responsible party, low-contact, outdoor, nonimpervious solid surfaces shall be either cleaned to 10 µg/100 cm
2
or cleaned to 100 µg/100 cm
2
and encapsulated. The Regional Administrator, however, retains the authority to disallow the encapsulation option for a particular spill situation upon finding that the uncertainties associated with that option pose special concerns at that site. That is, the Regional Administrator would not permit encapsulation if they determine that if the encapsulation failed the failure would create an imminent hazard at the site.
(v) Soil contaminated by the spill will be decontaminated to 10 ppm PCBs by weight provided that soil is excavated to a minimum depth of 10 inches. The excavated soil will be replaced with clean soil, i.e., containing less than 1 ppm PCBs, and the spill site will be restored (e.g., replacement of turf).
(5)
Records.
The responsible party shall document the cleanup with records of decontamination. The records must be maintained for a period of 5 years. The records and certification shall consist of the following:
(i) Identification of the source of the spill, e.g., type of equipment.
(ii) Estimated or actual date and time of the spill occurrence.
(iii) The date and time cleanup was completed or terminated (if cleanup was delayed by emergency or adverse weather: the nature and duration of the delay).
(iv) A brief description of the spill location and the nature of the materials contaminated. This information should include whether the spill occurred in an outdoor electrical substation, other restricted access location, or in a nonrestricted access area.
(v) Precleanup sampling data used to establish the spill boundaries if required because of insufficient visible traces and a brief description of the
sampling methodology used to establish the spill boundaries.
(vi) A brief description of the solid surfaces cleaned.
(vii) Approximate depth of soil excavation and the amount of soil removed.
(viii) Postcleanup verification sampling data and, if not otherwise apparent from the documentation, a brief description of the sampling methodology and analytical technique used.
(ix) While not required for compliance with this policy, information on the estimated cost of cleanup (by man-hours, dollars, or both) would be useful if maintained in the records.

§ 761.130
Sampling requirements.
Postcleanup sampling is required to verify the level of cleanup under § 761.125(c) (2) through (4). The responsible party may use any statistically valid, reproducible, sampling scheme (either random samples or grid samples) provided that the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section are satisfied.
(a) The sampling area is the greater of (1) an area equal to the area cleaned plus an additional 1-foot boundary, or (2) an area 20 percent larger than the original area of contamination.
(b) The sampling scheme must ensure 95 percent confidence against false positives.
(c) The number of samples must be sufficient to ensure that areas of contamination of a radius of 2 feet or more within the sampling area will be detected, except that the minimum number of samples is 3 and the maximum number of samples is 40.
(d) The sampling scheme must include calculation for expected variability due to analytical error.
(e) EPA recommends the use of a sampling scheme developed by the Midwest Research Institute (MRI) for use in enforcement inspections: “Verification of PCB Spill Cleanup by Sampling and Analysis.” Guidance for the use of this sampling scheme is available in the MRI report “Field Manual for Grid Sampling of PCB Spill Sites to Verify Cleanup.” Both the MRI sampling scheme and the guidance document are available on EPA's PCB website at
https://www.epa.gov/pcbs,
or from the Program Implementation and Information Division, Office of Resource Conservation and Recovery (5303T), 1200 Pennsylvania Ave. NW, Washington, DC 20460-0001. The major advantage of this sampling scheme is that it is designed to characterize the degree of contamination within the entire sampling area with a high degree of confidence while using fewer samples than any other grid or random sampling scheme. This sampling scheme also allows some sites to be characterized on the basis of composite samples.
(f) EPA may, at its discretion, take samples from any spill site. If EPA's sampling indicates that the remaining concentration level exceeds the required level, EPA will require further cleanup. For this purpose, the numerical level of cleanup required for spills cleaned in accordance with § 761.125(b) is deemed to be the equivalent of numerical cleanup requirements required for cleanups under § 761.125(c) (2) through (4). Using its best engineering judgment, EPA may sample a statistically valid random or grid sampling technique, or both. When using engineering judgment or random “grab” samples, EPA will take into account that there are limits on the power of a grab sample to dispute statistically based sampling of the type required of the responsible party. EPA headquarters will provide guidance to the EPA regions on the degree of certainty associated with various grab sample results.

§ 761.135
Effect of compliance with this policy and enforcement.
(a) Although a spill of material containing 50 ppm or greater PCBs is considered improper PCB disposal, this policy establishes requirements that EPA considers to be adequate cleanup of the spilled PCBs. Cleanup in accordance with this policy means compliance with the procedural as well as the numerical requirements of this policy.
Compliance with this policy creates a presumption against both enforcement action for penalties and the need for further cleanup under TSCA. The Agency reserves the right, however, to initiate appropriate action to compel cleanup where, upon review of the records of cleanup or EPA sampling following cleanup, EPA finds that the decontamination levels in the policy have not been achieved. The Agency also reserves the right to seek penalties where the Agency believes that the responsible party has not made a good faith effort to comply with all provisions of this policy, such as prompt notification of EPA of a spill, recordkeeping, etc.
(b) EPA's exercise of enforcement discretion does not preclude enforcement action under other provisions of TSCA or any other Federal statute. This includes, even in cases where the numerical decontamination levels set forth in this policy have been met, civil or criminal action for penalties where EPA believes the spill to have been the result of gross negligence or knowing violation.

# Subpart K—PCB Waste Disposal Records and Reports

# Source:
54 FR 52752, Dec. 21, 1989, unless otherwise noted.
§ 761.202
EPA identification numbers.
(a)
General.
Any generator, commercial storer, transporter, or disposer of PCB waste who is required to have an EPA identification number under this subpart must notify EPA of his/her PCB waste handling activities, using the notification procedures and form described in § 761.205. EPA will confirm the EPA identification number of facilities already assigned one, and will assign an EPA identification number to facilities that do not have one.
(b)
Prohibitions.
After June 4, 1990:
(1) A generator of PCB waste shall not:
(i) Process, store, dispose of, transport, or offer for transportation PCB waste without having received an EPA identification number from the Agency. A generator of PCB waste who is exempted from notification under § 761.205(c)(1) or who notifies EPA in a timely manner under § 761.205(c)(2)(i), but has not yet received a unique identification number, shall be regarded as having received from EPA the identification number “40 CFR PART 761.”
(ii) Offer the PCB waste to transporters, disposers, or commercial storers of PCB waste who have not received an EPA identification number.
(2) A transporter of PCB waste shall not:
(i) Transport PCB waste without having received an EPA identification number from EPA.
(ii) Deliver PCB waste to transporters, disposers, or commercial storers of PCB waste that have not received an EPA identification number.
(3) A commercial storer of PCB waste shall not accept any PCB waste for storage without having received an EPA identification number from EPA.
(4) A disposer of PCB waste shall not accept any PCB waste for disposal without having received an EPA identification number from EPA. A disposer of PCB waste who owns more than one disposal facility or mobile treatment unit shall not accept waste unless the disposer has received an EPA identification number for each facility or mobile unit.
(c)
PCB waste handled prior to effective date of this subpart.
Generators (other than generators exempt from notification under § 761.205(c)(1)), commercial storers, transporters, and disposers of PCB waste who are required to have EPA identification numbers under this subpart, and who were engaged in PCB waste handling activities on or prior to February 5, 1990, are not subject to the prohibitions of paragraph (b) of this section if they have applied for an EPA identification number in accordance with the applicable notification procedures of § 761.205. Such persons shall use the EPA identification number “40 CFR PART 761,” or a number assigned to the persons by EPA or a State under
RCRA, until EPA issues to such persons a specific identification number under § 761.205(a), (b), or (c).
(d)
PCB waste first handled after effective date of this subpart.
Generators (other than generators exempt from notification under § 761.205(c)(1)), commercial storers, transporters, and disposers of PCB waste who are required to have EPA identification numbers under this subpart, and who first engage in PCB waste activities after February 5, 1990, are subject to the prohibitions in paragraph (b) of this section.
§ 761.205
Notification of PCB waste activity (EPA Form 7710-53).
(a)(1) All commercial storers, transporters, and disposers of PCB waste who were engaged in PCB waste handling activities on or prior to February 5, 1990 shall notify EPA of their PCB waste activities by filing EPA Form 7710-53 with EPA by no later than April 4, 1990. Upon receiving the notification form, EPA will assign an EPA identification number to each entity that notifies.
(2) All generators (other than generators exempt from notification under paragraph (c)(1) of this section), commercial storers, transporters, and disposers of PCB waste who first engage in PCB waste handling activities after February 5, 1990, shall notify EPA of their PCB waste activities by filing EPA Form 7710-53 with EPA prior to engaging in PCB waste handling activities.
(3) Any person required to notify EPA under this section shall file with EPA Form 7710-53. A copy of EPA Form 7710-53 is available on EPA's website at
https://www.epa.gov/pcbs,
or from the Program Implementation and Information Division, Office of Resource Conservation and Recovery (5303T), Environmental Protection Agency, 1200 Pennsylvania Ave. NW, Washington, DC 20460-0001 ATTN: PCB Notification. Descriptive information and instructions for filling in the form are included in paragraphs (a)(4)(i) through (vii) of this section.
(4) All of the following information shall be provided to EPA on Form 7710-53:
(i) The name of the facility, and the name of the owner or operator of the facility.
(ii) EPA identification number, if any, previously issued to the facility.
(iii) The facility's mailing address.
(iv) The location of the facility.
(v) The facility's installation contact, telephone number, and email address.
(vi) The type of PCB waste activity engaged in at the facility.
(vii) Signature of the signer of the certification statement, typed or printed name and official title of signer, and date signed.
(viii) EPA has determined that the information in paragraphs (a)(4)(i) through (a)(4)(vii) of this section shall not be treated as confidential business information. This information will be disclosed to the public without further notice to the submitter unless the submitter provides a written justification (submitted with the notification form) which demonstrates extraordinary reasons why the information should be entitled to confidential treatment.
(b) Generators (other than those generators exempt from notification under paragraph (c)(1) of this section), commercial storers, transporters, and disposers of PCB waste who have previously notified EPA or a State of hazardous waste activities under RCRA shall notify EPA of their PCB waste activities under this part by filing EPA Form 7710-53 with EPA by no later than April 4, 1990. The notification shall include the EPA identification number previously issued by EPA or the State and upon receipt of the notification, EPA shall verify and authorize the use of the previously issued identification number for PCB waste activities.
(c)(1) Generators of PCB waste need not notify EPA and receive unique EPA identification numbers under this section, unless their PCB waste activities are described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. Generators exempted from notifying EPA under this paragraph shall use the generic identification number “40 CFR PART 761” on the manifests, records, and reports which they shall prepare under this subpart, unless such generators elect to use a
unique EPA identification number previously assigned to them under RCRA by EPA or a State.
(2) Generators of PCB waste who use, own, service, or process PCBs or PCB Items shall notify EPA of their PCB waste activities only if they own or operate PCB storage facilities subject to the storage requirements of § 761.65 (b) or (c)(7). Such generators shall notify EPA in the following manner:
(i) Generators storing PCB waste subject to the storage requirements of § 761.65 (b) or (c)(7) shall notify EPA by filing EPA Form 7710-53 with EPA by no later than April 4, 1990.
(ii) Generators who desire to commence storage of PCB waste after February 5, 1990 shall notify EPA and receive an EPA identification number before they may commence storage of PCBs at their facilities established under § 761.65 (b) or (c)(7).
(iii) A separate notification shall be submitted to EPA for each PCB storage facility owned or operated by generators of PCB waste. Upon receiving these notifications, EPA will assign generators unique EPA identification numbers for each storage facility notifying EPA under this section.
(d) Persons required to notify under this section shall file EPA Form 7710-53 with the EPA in accordance with the instructions on the form.
(e) The requirements under this section to notify EPA and obtain EPA identification numbers shall in no case excuse compliance by any person subject to the 1-year limit on storage prior to disposal under § 761.65(a).
(f) When a facility has previously notified EPA of its PCB waste handling activities using EPA Form 7710-53 and those activities change, the facility must resubmit EPA Form 7710-53 to reflect those changes no later than 30 days from when a change is made. Examples of when a PCB waste handler must renotify the Agency include, but are not limited to the following: the company changes location of the facility; or the company had notified solely as engaging in a certain type of PCB waste handling activity and now wishes to engage in another PCB waste activity (e.g., previously only commercially stored PCB waste and now wishes to transport PCB waste).

§ 761.207
The manifest—general requirements.
(a) A generator who transports, or offers for transport, PCB waste for commercial off-site storage or off-site disposal, and a commercial storage or disposal facility who offers for transport a rejected load of PCB waste, must prepare a manifest on EPA Form 8700-22 and, if necessary, a continuation sheet. The generator shall specify:
(1) For each bulk load of PCBs, the identity of the PCB waste, the earliest date of removal from service for disposal, and the weight in kilograms of the PCB waste. (Item 14—Special Handling Instructions box)
(2) For each PCB transformer, the serial number if available, or other identification if there is no serial number; the date of removal from service for disposal; and weight in kilograms of the PCB waste in each PCB transformer. (Item 14—Special Handling Instructions box)
(3) For each PCB Large High or Low Voltage Capacitor, the serial number if available, or other identification if there is no serial number; the date of removal from service for disposal; and weight in kilograms of the PCB waste in each PCB Large High or Low Voltage Capacitor. (Item 14—Special Handling Instructions box)
(4) For each PCB Article Container, the unique identifying number, type of PCB waste (e.g., small capacitors), earliest date of removal from service for disposal, and weight in kilograms of the PCB waste contained therein. (Item 14—Special Handling Instructions box)
(5) For each PCB Container, the unique identifying number, type of PCB waste (e.g., soil, debris, small capacitors), earliest date of removal from service for disposal, and weight in kilograms of the PCB waste contained therein. (Item 14—Special Handling Instructions box)
(6) For each Other item, the type of PCB waste (e.g., small capacitors, circuit breakers, PCB-Contaminated transformers, pipeline), earliest date of removal from service for disposal, and weight in kilograms of the PCB waste.

# Note 1 to paragraph (
a

# ):
EPA Form 8700-22A is not required as the PCB manifest continuation sheet. In practice, form 8700-22A does not have adequate space to list required PCB-specific information for several PCB articles. However, if form 8700-22A fits the needs of the user community, the form is permissible.

# Note 2 to paragraph (
a

# ):
PCB waste handlers should use the EPA Form 8700-22 instructions as a guide, but should defer to the Part 761 manifest regulations whenever there is any difference between the Part 761 requirements and the instructions. The differences should be minimal.

# Note 3 to paragraph (
a

# ):
PCBs are not regulated under RCRA, thus do not have a RCRA waste code. EPA does not require boxes 13 and 31 on forms 8700-22 and 8700-22A (if used), respectively, to be completed for shipments only containing PCB waste. However, some States track PCB wastes as State-regulated hazardous wastes, and assign State hazardous waste codes to these wastes. In such a case, the user should follow the State instructions for completing the waste code fields.
(b) A generator must designate on the manifest one facility which is approved to handle the PCB waste described on the manifest.
(c) A generator may also designate on the manifest one alternate facility which is approved to handle their PCB waste in the event an emergency prevents delivery of the waste to the primary designated facility.
(d) If the transporter is unable to deliver the PCB waste to the designated facility or the alternate facility, the generator must either designate another facility or instruct the transporter to return the PCB waste.
(e) The requirements of this section apply only to PCB wastes as defined in § 761.3. This includes PCB wastes with PCB concentrations below 50 ppm where the PCB concentration below 50 ppm was the result of dilution; these PCB wastes are required under § 761.1(b) to be managed as if they contained PCB concentrations of 50 ppm and above. An example of such a PCB waste is spill cleanup material containing
50 ppm PCBs when the spill involved material containing PCBs at a concentration of ≥50 ppm. However, there is no manifest requirement for material currently below 50 ppm which derives from pre-April 18, 1978, spills of any concentration, pre-July 2, 1979, spills of
500 ppm PCBs, or materials decontaminated in accordance with § 761.79.
(f) The requirements of this subpart do not apply to the transport of PCB wastes on a public or private right-of-way within or along the border of contiguous property under the control of the same person, even if such contiguous property is divided by a public or private right-of-way.
(g)(1)
Electronic manifest.
A person required to prepare a manifest under this section may prepare and use an electronic manifest, provided that the person:
(i) Complies with the requirements in § 262.24 of this chapter for use of electronic manifests; and
(ii) Complies with the requirements of 40 CFR 3.10 for the reporting of electronic documents to the EPA.
(2)
Legal equivalence to paper manifests.
Electronic manifests that are obtained, completed, and transmitted in accordance with § 262.20(a)(3) of this chapter, and used in accordance with §§ 262.20, 262.24, and 262.25 of this chapter in lieu of EPA Forms 8700-22 and 8700-22A, are the legal equivalent of paper manifest forms bearing handwritten signatures, and satisfy for all purposes any requirement in subpart K of this part to obtain, complete, sign, provide, use, or retain a manifest.
(i) Any requirement in subpart K of this part to sign a manifest or manifest certification by hand, or to obtain a handwritten signature, is satisfied by signing with or obtaining a valid and enforceable electronic signature within the meaning of § 262.25 of this chapter.
(ii) Any requirement in subpart K of this part to give, provide, send, forward, or return to another person a copy of the manifest is satisfied when an electronic manifest is transmitted to the other person by submission to the EPA e-Manifest system.
(iii) Any requirement in subpart K of this part for a generator to keep or retain a copy of each manifest is satisfied by retention of a signed electronic manifest in the generator's account on the EPA e-Manifest system, provided
that such copies are readily available for viewing and production if requested by any the EPA or authorized State inspector.
(iv) No generator may be held liable for the inability to produce an electronic manifest for inspection under this section if the generator can demonstrate that the inability to produce the electronic manifest is due exclusively to a technical difficulty with the e-Manifest system for which the generator bears no responsibility.
(v) After facilities have certified that the manifest is complete, by signing it at the time of submission to the EPA e-Manifest system, any post-receipt data corrections may be submitted at any time by any interested person (
e.g.,
waste handler) named on the manifest. If corrections are requested by the Director for portions of the manifest that a generator, transporter, or a commercial storage or disposal facility is required to complete, those PCB waste handlers must address the data correction within 30 days from the date of the request. Data corrections must be made electronically via the post-receipt data corrections process described in § 265.71(l) of this chapter, which applies to corrections made to either paper or electronic manifests. Generators who are not registered with the EPA e-Manifest system must arrange with interested persons shown on the manifest to electronically submit manifest data corrections on their behalf within 30 days of the date of the correction request.

§ 761.208
Obtaining manifests.
(a)(1) A generator may use manifests printed by any source so long as the source of the printed form has received approval from EPA to print the manifest under 40 CFR 262.21 (c) and (e). A registered source may be a:
(i) State agency;
(ii) Commercial printer;
(iii) PCB waste generator, transporter or, designated facility; or
(iv) PCB waste broker or other preparer who prepares or arranges shipments of PCB waste for transportation.
(2) A generator must determine whether the generator state or the consignment state for a shipment regulates PCB waste as a State-regulated hazardous waste. Generators also must determine whether the consignment state or generator state requires the generator to submit any copies of the manifest to these states. In cases where the generator must supply copies to either the generator's state or the consignment state, the generator is responsible for supplying legible photocopies of the manifest to these states.
(b) [Reserved]
[77 FR 54831, Sept. 6, 2012]
§ 761.209
Number of copies of a manifest.
The manifest consists of at least the number of copies which will provide the generator, the transporter, and the owner or operator of the designated facility with one copy each for their records and a copy to be submitted to the EPA e-Manifest system as indicated in the instructions included with EPA form 8700-22. Any requirement in subpart K of this part to give, provide, send, forward, or return to another person a copy of the manifest is satisfied when an electronic manifest is transmitted to the other person by submission to the EPA e-Manifest system. All parties using electronic manifests must do so in accordance with §§ 262.20, 262.24, and 262.25 of this chapter.
[89 FR 60737, July 26, 2024]
§ 761.210

(2) Obtain the signature of the initial transporter and date of acceptance on the manifest; and
(3) Retain one copy, in accordance with § 761.214(a)(1).
(b) The generator must give the transporter the remaining copies of the manifest.
(c) For shipments of PCB waste within the United States solely by water (bulk shipments only), the generator must send three copies of the manifest dated and signed in accordance with this section to the owner or operator of
the designated facility. Copies of the manifest are not required for each transporter.
(d) For rail shipments of PCB waste within the United States which originate at the site of generation, the generator must send at least three copies of the manifest dated and signed in accordance with this section to:
(1) The next non-rail transporter, if any; or
(2) The designated facility if transported solely by rail.
(e) For rejected shipments of PCB waste that are returned to the generator by the designated facility (following the procedures of § 761.215(f)), the generator must:
(1) Sign either:
(i) Item 20 of the new manifest if a new manifest is used for the returned shipment; or
(ii) Item 18c of the original manifest if the original manifest is used for the returned shipment;
(2) Provide the transporter a copy of the manifest;
(3) Within 30 days of delivery of the rejected shipment, send a copy of the manifest to the designated facility that returned the shipment to the generator; and

§ 761.211
Manifest system—Transporter requirements.
(a)(1) A transporter shall not accept PCB waste from a generator unless it is accompanied by a manifest signed by the generator in accordance with § 761.210(a)(1), except that a manifest is not required if any one of the following conditions exists:
(i) The shipment of PCB waste consists solely of PCB wastes with PCB concentrations below 50 ppm, unless the PCB concentration below 50 ppm was the result of dilution, in which case § 761.1(b) requires that the waste be managed as if it contained PCBs at the concentration prior to dilution.
(ii) The PCB waste is accepted by the transporter for transport only to a storage or disposal facility owned or operated by the generator of the PCB waste.
(2) [Reserved]
(b) Before transporting the PCB waste, the transporter must sign and date the manifest acknowledging acceptance of the PCB waste from the generator. The transporter must return a signed copy to the generator before leaving the generator's property.
(c) The transporter shall ensure that the manifest accompanies the PCB waste.
(d) A transporter who delivers PCB waste to another transporter or to the designated facility must:

§ 761.215
Manifest discrepancies.
(a) Manifest discrepancies are:
(1) Significant differences (as defined by paragraph (b) of this section) between the quantity or type of PCB waste designated on the manifest or shipping paper, and the quantity and type of PCB waste a facility actually receives; or
(2) Rejected wastes, which may be a full or partial shipment of PCB waste that the designated facility cannot accept.
(b) Significant differences in quantity are: For bulk waste, variations greater than 10 percent in weight or variations greater than 10 percent in weight of PCB waste in containers; for batch waste, any variation in piece count, such as a discrepancy of one PCB Transformer or PCB Container or PCB Article Container in a truckload. Significant differences in type are obvious differences which can be discovered by inspection or waste analysis, such as the substitution of solids for liquids or the substitution of high concentration PCBs (above 500 ppm) with lower concentration materials.
(c) Upon discovering a significant difference in quantity or type, the owner or operator must attempt to reconcile the discrepancy with the waste generator or transporter (
e.g.,
with telephone conversations). If the discrepancy is not resolved within 20 days after receiving the waste, the owner or operator must:
(1) Immediately submit to the Regional Administrator a letter describing the discrepancy and attempts to reconcile it, and a copy of the manifest or shipping paper at issue.
(2) Beginning on December 1, 2025, immediately submit to the EPA e-Manifest system a Discrepancy Report describing the discrepancy and attempts to reconcile it using forms and procedures defined by the EPA, and a copy of the manifest or shipping paper at issue. Beginning December 1, 2025, the EPA will no longer accept mailed paper Discrepancy Reports from facilities.
(d)(1) Upon rejecting the PCB waste, the facility must consult with the generator prior to forwarding the waste to another facility that can manage the waste. If it is impossible to locate an alternative facility that can receive the waste, the facility may return the rejected waste to the generator. The facility must send the waste to the alternative facility or to the generator within 60 days of the rejection identification.
(2) While the facility is making arrangements for forwarding rejected wastes to another facility under this section, it must ensure that either the delivering transporter retains custody of the waste, or, the facility must provide for secure, temporary custody of the waste, pending delivery of the waste to the first transporter designated on the manifest prepared under paragraph (e) or (f) of this section.

(1) Write the generator's U.S. EPA ID number in Item 1 of the new manifest. Write the generator's name and mailing address in Item 5 of the new manifest. If the mailing address is different from the generator's site address, then write the generator's site address in the designated space for Item 5.
(2) Write the name of the alternate designated facility and the facility's U.S. EPA ID number in the designated facility block (Item 8) of the new manifest.
(3) Copy the manifest tracking number found in Item 4 of the old manifest to the Special Handling and Additional Information Block of the new manifest, and indicate that the shipment is a rejected waste from the previous shipment.
(4) Copy the manifest tracking number found in Item 4 of the new manifest to the manifest reference number line in the Discrepancy Block of the old manifest (Item 18a).
(5) Write the DOT description for the rejected load in Item 9 (U.S. DOT Description) of the new manifest and write the container types, quantity, and volume(s) of waste.
(6) Sign the Generator's/Offeror's Certification to certify, as the offeror of the shipment, that the waste has been properly packaged, marked and labeled and is in proper condition for transportation, and mail a signed copy of the manifest to the generator identified in Item 5 of the new manifest.
(7) For full load rejections that are made while the transporter remains present at the facility, the facility may forward the rejected shipment to the alternate facility by completing Item
18b of the original manifest and supplying the information on the next destination facility in the Alternate Facility space. The facility must retain a copy of this manifest for its records, and then give the remaining copies of the manifest to the transporter to accompany the shipment. If the original manifest is not used, then the facility must use a new manifest and comply with paragraphs (e)(1), (2), (3), (4), (5), and (6) of this section.
(f) Except as provided in paragraph (f)(7) of this section, for rejected wastes that must be sent back to the generator, the facility is required to prepare a new manifest in accordance with § 761.207(a) and the following instructions:
(1) Write the facility's U.S. EPA ID number in Item 1 of the new manifest. Write the facility's name and mailing address in Item 5 of the new manifest. If the mailing address is different from the facility's site address, then write the facility's site address in the designated space for Item 5 of the new manifest.
(2) Write the name of the initial generator and the generator's U.S. EPA ID number in the designated facility block (Item 8) of the new manifest.
(3) Copy the manifest tracking number found in Item 4 of the old manifest to the Special Handling and Additional Information Block of the new manifest, and indicate that the shipment is a rejected waste from the previous shipment.
(4) Copy the manifest tracking number found in Item 4 of the new manifest to the manifest reference number line in the Discrepancy Block of the old manifest (Item 18a).
(5) Write the DOT description for the rejected load in Item 9 (U.S. DOT Description) of the new manifest and write the container types, quantity, and volume(s) of waste.
(6) Sign the Generator's/Offeror's Certification to certify, as offeror of the shipment, that the waste has been properly packaged, marked and labeled and is in proper condition for transportation.
(7) For full load rejections that are made while the transporter remains at the facility, the facility may return the shipment to the generator with the original manifest by completing Item 18a and 18b of the manifest and supplying the generator's information in the Alternate Facility space. The facility must retain a copy for its records and then give the remaining copies of the manifest to the transporter to accompany the shipment. If the original manifest is not used, then the facility must use a new manifest and comply with paragraphs (f)(1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), and (8) of this section.
(8) For full or partial load rejections that are returned to the generator, the facility must also comply with the exception reporting requirements in § 761.217(a).
(g) If a facility rejects a waste after it has signed, dated, and returned a copy of the manifest to the delivering transporter or to the generator, the facility must amend its copy of the manifest to indicate the rejected wastes in the discrepancy space of the amended manifest. The facility must also copy the manifest tracking number from Item 4 of the new manifest to the Discrepancy space of the amended manifest and must re-sign and date the manifest to certify to the information as amended. The facility must retain the amended manifest for at least three years from the date of amendment, and must within 30 days, send a copy of the amended manifest to the transporter and generator that received copies prior to their being amended. Facilities are not required to send the amended manifest to any generator or transporter who is registered in the EPA's e-Manifest system. Registered generators or transporters may obtain the signed and dated copy of a completed manifest from the EPA e-Manifest system in lieu of receiving the manifest through U.S. postal mail.

# Source:
63 FR 35462, June 29, 1998, unless otherwise noted.
§ 761.240
Scope and definitions.
(a) Use these procedures to select surface sampling sites for natural gas pipe to determine its PCB surface concentration for abandonment-in-place or removal and disposal off-site in accordance with § 761.60(b)(5).
(b) “Pipe segment” means a length of natural gas pipe that has been removed from the pipeline system to be disposed of or reused, and that is usually approximately 12.2 meters (40 feet) or shorter in length. Pipe segments are usually linear.
(c) “Pipeline section” means a length of natural gas pipe that has been cut or otherwise separated from the active pipeline, usually for purposes of abandonment, and that is usually longer than 12.2 meters in length. Pipeline sections may be branched.
§ 761.243
Standard wipe sample method and size.
(a) Collect a surface sample from a natural gas pipe segment or pipeline section using a standard wipe test as defined in § 761.123. Detailed guidance for the entire wipe sampling process appears in the document entitled, “Wipe Sampling and Double Wash/Rinse Cleanup as Recommended by the Environmental Protection Agency PCB Spill Cleanup Policy,” dated June 23, 1987, and revised on April 18, 1991. This document is available on EPA's website at

or from the Program Implementation and Information Division, Office of Resource Conservation and Recovery (5303T), Environmental Protection Agency, 1200 Pennsylvania Ave. NW, Washington, DC 20460-0001.
(b) Collect a surface sample from a minimum surface area of 100 cm
2
at each sampling site selected. The EPA Regional Administrator may approve, in writing, requests to collect a sample from smaller surface areas, when
100 cm
2
of surface eligible for sampling is present; e.g., when sampling a small diameter pipe, a small valve, or a small regulator. When smaller surfaces are sampled, convert the measurement to the equivalent measurement for 100 cm
2
for purposes of comparison to standards based on 100 cm

§ 761.247
Sample site selection for pipe segment removal.
(a)
General.
(1) Select the pipe segments to be sampled by following the directions in paragraph (b) of this section.
(2) Locate the proper position along the length of the pipe segment that you have selected for sampling, by following the directions in paragraph (c) of this section.
(3) Select the proper sampling position around the circumference of the pipe segment that you have selected for sampling, by following the directions in paragraph (d) of this section.
(4) Prior to removing pipe from the ground or lifting the pipe from its location during former operations, mark the top side of the pipe.
(5) Do not sample if there are free-flowing liquids in the pipe segment. Free-flowing liquids must be removed prior to sampling.
(b)
Selecting pipe segments to sample.
Select the pipe segment(s) that you will sample from a length of pipe or group of pipe segments, as follows:
(1) Do not sample a pipe segment that is longer than 12.2 meters (40 feet). If a segment is longer than 12.2 meters in length, cut the segment so that all resulting segments are 12.2 meters or less in length.
(2) Determine which pipe segments to sample as follows:
(i) When a length of pipe having seven or fewer segments is removed for purposes of disposal, sample each pipe segment.
(ii) When removing a length of pipe having multiple contiguous segments less than 3 miles in total length, take samples from a total of seven segments.
(A) Sample the first and last segments removed.
(B) Select the five additional segments according to one of the two following procedures:
(
1
) Assign all segments a unique sequential number. Then select five numbers using a random number table or random number generator. If the random number generator or random number table produces either the first pipe segment, the last pipe segment, or any previously selected segment, select another random number until there are seven different numbers, each corresponding to a different pipe segment.
(2)
Divide the total number of segments, save one, by six. The resulting number is the interval between the segments you will sample. Do not round this interval. For example, cut a 2.9-mile length of pipe into segments of no more than 40 feet by first, dividing 2.9 miles (15,312 feet) by 40 feet per segment, resulting in 382.8 total segments. Do not round this result. Subtract 1 from the total number of segments and then divide the remaining number of segments, 381.8, by six. The resulting number in this example is 63.6. Do not round. Add 63.6 to the first segment (number 1) to select segment 64.6. Next, add 63.6 to 64.6 to select segment 128.3. Continue in this fashion to select all seven segments: 1, 64.6, 128.3, 191.9, 255.5, 319.2, and 382.8. Now round these numbers to the nearest whole number to determine which segment to sample: 1, 65, 128, 192, 256, 319, and 383.
(iii) When removing a length of pipe having multiple contiguous segments more than 3 miles in total length for purposes of disposal, take samples of each segment that is
1/2
mile distant from the segment previously sampled. Sample a minimum of seven segments.
(c)
Selecting the sampling position—length.
Select the sampling position along the length of the pipe segment, as follows:
(1) Take samples at the end upstream of the former gas flow of each segment removed.
(2) If the pipe segment is cut with a torch or other high temperature heat source, take the sample at least 15 cm (6 inches) inside the cut end of the pipe segment.
(3) If the pipe segment is cut with a saw or other mechanical device, take the sample at least 2 cm (1 inch) inside the end of the pipe segment.
(4) If the sample site location selected in the procedure at paragraph (c)(2) or (c)(3) of this section is a porous surface (for example, there is significant corrosion so that the wipe material will be shredded), then move the sample site further inside the pipe segment (away from the end of the pipe or pipe segment) until there is no such porous surface. For purposes of this subpart, natural gas pipe with a thin porous corrosion preventive coating is a non-porous surface.
(5) If there is not a non-porous surface accessible by paragraphs (c)(2) and (c)(3) of this section, use one of the following three options:
(i) Sample the downstream end of the pipe segment using the same sample site location procedure as for the upstream end.
(ii) Select another pipe segment using the random selection procedure described in paragraph (b) of this section.
(iii) If there is no other pipe segment in the population to be sampled and both ends of a pipe segment have porous surfaces at all possible sample collection sites, then assume that the pipe segment contains ≥50 ppm PCB but
500 ppm PCB.
(d)
Selecting the sample position—circumference.
Based on the mark on the top of the pipe segment made prior to removing pipe from the ground or lifting the pipe from its location during former operations, sample the inside center of the bottom of the pipe being sampled. Make sure the sample is centered on the bottom of the pipe segment; that is, sample an equal area on both sides of the middle of the bottom of the pipe segment for the entire length of the sample.

§ 761.250
Sample site selection for pipeline section abandonment.
This procedure is for the sample site selection for a pipeline section to be abandoned, in accordance with § 761.60(b)(5)(i)(B).
(a)
General.
(1) Select sample collection sites in the pipeline section(s) by following the directions in paragraph (b) of this section.
(2) Select the proper sampling position along the pipe by following the directions in § 761.247 (c) and (d).
(3) Assure, by visual inspection, the absence of free-flowing liquids in the pipe by affirming no liquids at all liquid collection points and all ends of the pipeline section to be abandoned.
(b)
Selection sample collection sites.
At a minimum, sample all ends of all pipeline sections to be abandoned in place.
(1) If the pipeline section to be abandoned is between the pressure side of one compressor station and the suction side of the next compressor station downstream of the former gas flow, at a minimum, sample all ends of the abandoned pipe.
(2) If the pipeline section to be abandoned is longer than the distance between the pressure side of one compressor station and the suction side of the next compressor station downstream of the former gas flow, divide the pipeline section, for purposes of sampling, into smaller pipeline sections no longer than the distance from the pressure side of one compressor station to the suction side of the next compressor station downstream of the former gas flow. Consider each of the smaller sections to be a separate abandonment and sample each one, at a minimum, at all ends.
(3) Use the following procedure to locate representative sample collection sites in pipeline sections at points other than the suction and pressure side of compressor stations, or the ends of the pipeline section to be abandoned.
(i) First, assign a unique identifying sequential number to each kilometer or fraction of a kilometer length of pipe within the entire pipeline section.
(ii) Use a random number table or a random number generator to select each representative sample collection site from a complete list of the sequential identification numbers.
(iii) Samples may be collected by removing any covering soil, cutting the pipe to gain access to the sampling location, and collecting the surface sample with the pipe in place, rather than completely removing the pipeline sections to collect the surface sample.

§ 761.257
Determining the regulatory status of sampled pipe.
(a) For purposes of removal for disposal of a pipe segment that has been sampled, the sample results for that segment determines its PCB surface concentration. Determine the PCB surface concentration of a segment which was not sampled as follows:
(1) If the unsampled pipe segment is between two pipe segments which have been sampled, assume that the unsampled segment has the same PCB surface concentration as the nearest sampled pipe segment.
(2) If an unsampled pipe segment is equidistant between two pipe segments which have been sampled, assume the PCB surface concentration of the unsampled segment to be the arithmetic mean of the PCB surface concentrations measured in the two equidistant, sampled, pipe segments.
(b) For purposes of abandonment of a pipeline section, assume that the PCB
surface concentration for an entire pipeline section is the arithmetic mean of the PCB surface concentrations measured at the ends of the pipeline section. If additional representative samples were taken in a pipeline section, assume that the PCB surface concentration for the entire pipeline section is the arithmetic mean of the concentrations measured in all representative samples taken.
(c) For purposes of removal for disposal under § 761.60(b)(5)(ii)(A)(
1
) or abandonment under § 761.60(b)(5)(i)(B), if the surface PCB concentration of a pipe segment, determined by direct measurement or in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, or of a pipeline section as determined in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, is
10 µg/100 cm
2
, but
100 µg/100 cm
2
, then that segment or section is PCB-Contaminated.

# Subpart O—Sampling To Verify Completion of Self-Implementing Cleanup and On-Site Disposal of Bulk PCB Remediation Waste and Porous Surfaces in Accordance With § 761.61(a)(6)

# Source:
63 FR 35465, June 29, 1998, unless otherwise noted.
§ 761.280
Application and scope.
Follow the procedures in this subpart when sampling to verify completion of the cleanup for self-implementing, on-site disposal of bulk PCB remediation waste and porous surfaces consistent with the levels of § 761.61(a)(4)(i) and (iii). The objective of this subpart is not to search for new contamination. Confirmation of compliance with the cleanup levels in § 761.61(a)(4) is only verifiable for the area sampled in accordance with this subpart. Do not make conclusions or extrapolations about PCB concentrations outside of the area which has been cleaned up and verified based on the results of this verification sampling.
§ 761.283
Determination of the number of samples to collect and sample collection locations.
This section addresses how to determine the number of samples to collect and sample collection locations for bulk PCB remediation waste and porous surfaces destined to remain at a cleanup site after cleanup.
(a)
Minimum number of samples.
(1) At each separate cleanup site at a PCB remediation waste location, take a minimum of three samples for each type of bulk PCB remediation waste or porous surface at the cleanup site, regardless of the amount of each type of waste that is present. There is no upper limit to the number of samples required or allowed.
(2) This is an example of how to calculate the minimum number of required samples at a PCB remediation waste location. There are three distinct cleanup sites at this example location: a loading dock, a transformer storage lot, and a disposal pit. The minimum number of samples to take appears in parentheses after each type of waste for each cleanup site. The PCB remediation wastes present at the loading dock are concrete (three samples) and clay soil (three samples). The non-liquid PCB remediation wastes present at the transformer storage lot are oily soil (three samples), clay soil (three samples) and gravel (three samples). The PCB remediation wastes present at the disposal pit are sandy soil (three samples), clay soil (three samples), oily soil (three samples), industrial sludge (three samples), and gravel (three samples).
(b)
Selection of sample locations—general.
(1)(i) Use a square-based grid system to overlay the entire area to be sampled. Orient the grid axes on a magnetic north-south line centered in the area and an east-west axis perpendicular to the magnetic north-south axis also centered in the area.
(ii) If the site is recleaned based on the results of cleanup verification conducted in accordance with § 761.61(a)(6), follow the procedures in paragraph (b) of this section for locating sampling points after the recleaning, but reorient the grid axes established in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section by moving the origin one meter in the direction of magnetic north and one meter in the direction east of magnetic north.
(2) Mark out a series of sampling points 1.5 meters apart oriented to the grid axes. The sampling points shall proceed in every direction to the extent sufficient to result in a two-dimensional grid completely overlaying the sampling area.
(3) Collect a sample at each point if the grid falls in the cleanup area. Analyze all samples either individually or according to the compositing schemes provided in the procedures at § 761.289. So long as every sample collected at a grid point is analyzed as either an individual sample or as part of a composite sample, there are no other restrictions on how many samples are analyzed.
(c)
Selection of sample locations—small cleanup sites.
When a cleanup site is sufficiently small or irregularly shaped that a square grid with a grid interval of 1.5 meters will not result in a minimum of three sampling points for each type of bulk PCB remediation waste or porous surface at the cleanup site, there are two options.
(1) Use a smaller square grid interval and the procedures in paragraph (b) of this section.
(2) Use the following coordinate-based random sampling scheme. If the site is recleaned based on the results of cleanup verification conducted in accordance with § 761.61(a)(6), follow the procedures in this section for locating sampling points after the recleaning, but select three new pairs of sampling coordinates.
(i) Beginning in the southwest corner (lower left when facing magnetic north) of the area to be sampled, measure in centimeters (or inches) the maximum magnetic north-south dimension of the area to be sampled. Next, beginning in the southwest corner, measure in centimeters (or inches) the maximum magnetic east-west dimension of the area to be sampled. Designate the north-south and east-west dimensions (describing the west and south boundaries, respectively, of the area to be sampled), as the reference axes of a square-based grid system.
(ii) Use a random number table or random number generator to select a pair of coordinates that will locate the sample within the area to be sampled. The first coordinate in the pair is the measurement on the north-south axis. The second coordinate in the pair is the measurement on the east-west axis. Collect the sample at the intersection of an east-west line drawn through the measured spot on the north-south axis, and a north-south line drawn through the measured spot on the east-west axis. If the cleanup site is irregularly shaped and this intersection falls outside the cleanup site, select a new pair of sampling coordinates. Continue to select pairs of sampling coordinates until three are selected for each type of bulk PCB remediation waste or porous surface at the cleanup site.
(d)
Area of inference.
Analytical results for an individual sample point apply to the sample point and to an area of inference extending to four imaginary lines parallel to the grid axes and one half grid interval distant from the sample point in four different directions. The area of inference forms a square around the sample point. The sides of the square are parallel to the grid axes and one grid interval in length. The sample point is in the center of the square area of inference. The area of inference from a composite sample is the total of the areas of the individual samples included in the composite.
§ 761.286
Sample size and procedure for collecting a sample.
At each selected sampling location for bulk PCB remediation waste or porous surfaces, collect at least 20 milliliters of waste, or a portion of sufficient weight for the chemical analyst to measure the concentration of PCBs and still have sufficient analytical detection sensitivity to reproducibly measure PCBs at the levels designated in § 761.61(a)(4). Use a core sampler having a diameter ≥2 cm and ≤3 cm. Collect waste to a maximum depth of 7.5 cms.
§ 761.289
Compositing samples.
Compositing is a method of combining several samples of a specific type of bulk PCB remediation waste or porous surface from nearby locations for a single chemical analysis. There are two procedures for compositing bulk PCB remediation waste samples. These procedures are based on the method for selecting sampling site locations in § 761.283(b) and (c). The single chemical analysis of a composite sample results in an averaging of the concentrations of its component samples. The area of inference of a composite is determined by the area of inference of each of its component samples as described in § 761.283(d). Compositing is not mandatory. However, if compositing is used, it must be performed in accordance with the following procedures.
(a)
Compositing in the field or in a laboratory.
Compositing may occur either in the field or in a laboratory. Prepare composite samples using equal volumes of each constituent or component sample. Composited samples must be from the same type of bulk PCB remediation waste or porous surface (see the example at § 761.283(a)(2)). Mix composite samples thoroughly. From each well-mixed composite sample, take a portion of sufficient weight for the chemical analyst to measure the concentration of PCBs and still have sufficient analytical detection sensitivity to reproducibly measure PCBs at the levels designated in § 761.61(a)(4).
(b)(1)
Compositing from samples collected at grid points in accordance with § 761.283(b).
There are two kinds of composite sampling procedures depending on the original source of contamination of the site.
(i) The first procedure is for sites with multiple point sources of contamination (such as an old electrical equipment storage area, a scrap yard, or repair shop) or for unknown sources of contamination. Under this compositing scheme, composite a maximum of nine samples for each type of bulk PCB remediation waste or porous surface at the cleanup site. The maximum dimensions of the area enclosing a nine grid point composite is two grid intervals bounded by three collinear grid points (3.0 meters or approximately 10 feet long). Take all samples in the composite at the same depth. Assure that composite sample areas and individually analyzed samples completely overlay the cleanup site.
(ii) The second procedure is for a single point source of contamination, such as discharge into a large containment area (e.g., pit, waste lagoon, or evaporation pond), or a leak onto soil from a single drum or tank. Single point source contamination may be from a one-time or continuous contamination. Composites come from two stages: an initial compositing area centered in the area to be sampled, and subsequent compositing areas forming concentric square zones around the initial compositing area. The center of the initial compositing area and each of the subsequent compositing areas is the origin of the grid axes.
(A)
Definition of the initial compositing area.
The initial compositing area is based on a square that contains nine grid points, is centered on the grid origin, and has sides two grid intervals long. The initial compositing area has the same center as this square and sides one half a grid interval more distant from the center than the square. The initial compositing area has sides three grid intervals long.
(B)
Definition of subsequent compositing areas.
Subsequent composite sampling areas are in concentric square zones one grid interval wide around the initial compositing area and around each successive subsequent compositing area. The inner boundary of the first subsequent compositing area is the outer boundary of the initial compositing area. The outer boundary of the first subsequent compositing area is centered on the grid origin, has sides one grid interval more distant from the grid origin than the inner boundary, and is two grid intervals longer on a side than the inner boundary. The inner boundary of each further subsequent compositing area is the outer boundary of the previous subsequent compositing area. The outer boundary of each further subsequent compositing area is centered on the grid origin, has sides one grid interval more distant from the grid origin than
the inner boundary, and is two grid intervals longer on a side than the inner boundary.
(C)
Taking composite samples from the initial and subsequent compositing areas.
(
1
) Select composite sampling areas from the initial compositing area and subsequent compositing areas such that all grid points in the initial compositing area and subsequent compositing areas are part of a composite or individual sample.
(
2
) A person may include in a single composite sample a maximum of all nine grid points in the initial compositing area. The maximum number of grid points in a composite sample taken from a subsequent compositing area is eight. These eight grid points must be adjacent to one another in the subsequent compositing area, but need not be collinear.
(2)
Compositing from samples taken at grid points or pairs of coordinates in accordance with § 761.283(c).
Samples collected at small sites are based on selecting pairs of coordinates or using the sample site selection procedure for grid sampling with a smaller grid interval.
(i)
Samples collected from a grid having a smaller grid interval.
Use the procedure in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section to composite samples and determine the area of inference for composite samples.
(ii)
Samples collected from pairs of coordinates.
All three samples must be composited. The area of inference for the composite is the entire area sampled.

Chemical extraction and analysis of individual samples and composite samples.
Select applicable method(s) from the following list to extract PCBs and determine the PCB concentration from individual and composite samples of PCB remediation waste: SW-846 Method 3510C, Method 3520C, Method 3535A, Method 3540C, Method 3541, Method 3545A, Method 3546, or Method 8082A (all standards incorporated by reference in § 761.19).

Decisions based on PCB concentration measurements resulting from sampling.
(a) For grid samples which are chemically analyzed individually, the PCB concentration applies to the area of inference as described in § 761.283(d).
(b) For grid samples analyzed as part of a composite sample, the PCB concentration applies to the area of inference of the composite sample as described in § 761.283(d) (i.e., the area of inference is the total of the areas of the individual samples included in the composite).
(c) For coordinate pair samples analyzed as part of a composite sample, in accordance with §§ 761.283(c)(2) and 761.289(b)(2)(ii), the PCB concentration applies to the entire cleanup site.

disposal of non-porous surfaces under § 761.61(a)(6), or verifying that decontamination standards under § 761.79(b)(3) are met, must use these procedures.
§ 761.302
Proportion of the total surface area to sample.
(a)
Large nearly flat surfaces.
Divide the entire surface into approximately 1 meter square portions and mark the portions so that they are clearly identified. Determine the sample location in each portion as directed in § 761.304.
(1) For large nearly flat surfaces contaminated by a single source of PCBs with a uniform concentration, assign each 1 meter square surface a unique sequential number.
(i) For three or fewer 1 meter square areas, sample all of the areas.
(ii) For four or more 1 meter square areas, use a random number generator or table to select a minimum of 10 percent of the areas from the list, or to select three areas, whichever is more.
(2) For other large nearly flat surfaces, sample all of the one meter square areas.
(b)
Small or irregularly shaped surfaces.
For small surfaces having irregular contours, such as hand tools, natural gas pipeline valves, and most exterior surfaces of machine tools, sample the entire surface. Any person may select sampling locations for small, nearly flat surfaces in accordance with § 761.308 with the exception that the maximum area in § 761.308(a) is
1 meter square.
(c)
Preparation of surfaces.
Drain all free-flowing liquids from surfaces and brush off dust or loose grit.
§ 761.304
Determining sample location.
(a) For 1 square meter non-porous surface areas having the same size and shape, it is permissible to sample the same 10 cm by 10 cm location or position in each identical 1 square meter area. This location or position is determined in accordance with § 761.306 or § 761.308.
(b) If some 1 square meter surfaces for a larger non-porous surface area have different sizes and shapes, separately select the 10 cm by 10 cm sampling position for each different 1 square meter surface in accordance with § 761.308.
(c) If non-porous surfaces have been cleaned and the cleaned surfaces do not meet the applicable standards or levels, surfaces may be recleaned and resampled. When resampling surfaces previously sampled to verify cleanup levels, use the sampling procedures in §§ 761.306 through 761.316 to resample the surfaces. If any sample site selected coincides with a previous sampling site, restart the sample selection process until all resampling sites are different from any previous sampling sites.
§ 761.306
Sampling 1 meter square surfaces by random selection of halves.
(a) Divide each 1 meter square portion where it is necessary to collect a surface wipe test sample into two equal (or as nearly equal as possible) halves. For example, divide the area into top and bottom halves or left and right halves. Choose the top/bottom or left/right division that produces halves having as close to the shape of a circle as possible. For example, a square is closer to the shape of a circle than is a rectangle and a rectangle having a length to width ratio of 2:1 is closer to the shape of a circle than a rectangle having a length to width ratio of 3:1.
(b) Assign a unique identifier to each half and then select one of the halves for further sampling with a random number generator or other device (i.e., by flipping a coin).
(c) Continue selecting progressively smaller halves by dividing the previously selected half, in accordance with paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, until the final selected half is larger than or equal to 100 cm
2
and smaller than 200 cm
2
.
(d) Perform a standard PCB wipe test on the final selected halves from each 1 meter square portion.
(e) The following is an example of applying sampling by halves. Assume that the area to sample is a 1 meter square surface area (a square that has sides 1 meter long). Assign each half to one face of a coin. After flipping the coin, the half assigned to the face of the coin that is showing is the half selected.
(1) Selecting the first half:
(i) For a square shape the top/bottom halves have the same shape as the left/right halves when compared to a circle, i.e., regardless of which way the surface is divided, each half is 1 half meter wide by 1 meter long. Therefore, divide the area either top/bottom or left/right. For selecting the first half, this example will select from left/right halves.
(ii) A coin flip selects the left half. The dimensions of this selected surface area are 1 meter high and
1/2
meter wide.
(2) Selecting the second half:
(i) If the next selection of halves was left/right, the halves would be rectangles four times as long as they are wide (
1/4
meter wide and 1 meter high). Halves selected from top/bottom would be square (
1/2
meter on a side). Therefore, select the next halves top/bottom, because the shape of the top/bottom halves (square) is closer to the shape of a circle than the shape of the left/right halves (long narrow rectangles).
(ii) A coin flip selects the top half. The dimensions of this selected surface area are
1/2
meter high and
1/2
meter wide.
(3) Selecting the third half:
(i) Just as for the selection of the first half, which divided the original square area, both the left/right and the top/bottom halves have the same shape when compared to a circle (both are rectangles having the same dimensions). Therefore, choose either left/right or top/bottom halves. This example will select from left/right halves.
(ii) A coin flip selects the right half. The dimensions of this selected surface are
1/4
meter by
1/2
meter.
(4) Selecting the fourth half:
(i) If the next selection of halves was left/right, the halves would be rectangles four times as long as they are wide (
1/8
meter wide and
1/2
meter high. Halves selected from top/bottom would be square (
1/4
meter on a side). Therefore, select the next halves top/bottom, because the shape of the top/bottom halves (square) are closer to the shape of a circle than the shape of the left/right halves (long narrow rectangles).
(ii) A coin flip selects the bottom half. The dimensions of this selected surface area are
1/4
meter high and
1/4
meter wide.
(5) Selecting the fifth half:
(i) Just as for the selection of the first and third halves, both the left/right and the top/bottom halves have the same shape when compared to a circle (both are rectangles having the same dimensions). Therefore, choose either left/right or top/bottom halves. This example will select from left/right halves.
(ii) A coin flip selects the right half. The dimensions of the selected surface are
1/8
meter by
1/4
meter.
(6) Selecting the sixth half:
(i) If the next selection of halves was left/right, the halves would be rectangles four times as long as they are wide (
1/16
meter wide and
1/4
meter high. Halves selected from top/bottom would be square (
1/8
meter on a side). Therefore, select the next halves top/bottom, because the shape of the top/bottom halves (square) are closer to the shape of a circle than the shape of the left/right halves (long narrow rectangles).
(ii) A coin flip selects the top half. The dimensions of this selected surface are
1/8
meter high and
1/8
meter wide or 12.5 cm by 12.5 cm.
(7) Collect a standard wipe test sample in the sixth half. Since the dimensions of half of the sixth half would be 12.5 cm by 6.25 cm, the area (approximately 78 cm
2
) would be less than the required 100 cm
2
minimum area for the standard wipe test. Therefore, no further sampling by halves is necessary. Take the standard wipe test samples of the entire selected sixth half.
§ 761.308
Sample selection by random number generation on any two-dimensional square grid.
(a) Divide the surface area of the non-porous surface into rectangular or square areas having a maximum area of 1 square meter and a minimum dimension of 10 centimeters.
(b) Measure the length and width, in centimeters, of each area created in paragraph (a) of this section. Round off the number of centimeters in the length and the width measurements to the nearest centimeter.
(c) For each 1 square meter area created in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, select two random numbers: one each for the length and width borders measured in paragraph (b) of
this section. An eligible random number can be from zero up to the total width, minus 10 centimeters.
(d) Locate the 10 centimeter by 10 centimeter sample.
(1) Orient the 1 square meter surface area so that, when you are facing the area, the length is left to right and the width is top to bottom. The origin, or reference point for measuring selected random numbers of centimeters to the sampling area, is on the lower left corner when facing the surface.
(2) Mark the random number selected for the length distance, in centimeters, from the origin to the right (at the bottom of the area away from the origin).
(3) From the marked length distance on the bottom of the area, move perpendicularly up from the bottom of the area into the area for the distance randomly selected for the width.
(4) Use the point determined in paragraph (d)(3) of this section as the lower left corner of the 10 centimeter by 10 centimeter sample.
§ 761.310
Collecting the sample.
Use the standard wipe test as defined in § 761.123 to sample one 10 centimeter by 10 centimeter square (100 cm
2
) area to represent surface area PCB concentrations of each square meter or fraction of a square meter of a nearly flat, non-porous surface. For small surfaces, use the same procedure as for the standard wipe test, only sample the entire area, rather than 10 centimeter by 10 centimeter squares.
§ 761.312
Compositing of samples.
For a surface originally contaminated by a single source of PCBs with a uniform concentration, it is permissible to composite surface wipe test samples and to use the composite measurement to represent the PCB concentration of the entire surface. Composite samples consist of more than one sample gauze extracted and chemically analyzed together resulting in a single measurement. The composite measurement represents an arithmetic mean of the composited samples.
(a)
Compositing samples from surfaces to be used or reused.
For small or irregularly shaped surfaces or large nearly flat surfaces, if the surfaces are contaminated by a single source of PCBs with a uniform concentration, composite a maximum of three adjacent samples.
(b)
Compositing samples from surfaces to be disposed of off-site or on-site.
(1) For small or irregularly shaped surfaces, composite a maximum of three adjacent samples.
(2) For large nearly flat surfaces, composite a maximum of 10 adjacent samples.
§ 761.314
Chemical analysis of standard wipe test samples.
Perform the chemical analysis of standard wipe test samples in accordance with § 761.253. Report sample results in micrograms per 100 cm
2
.
[88 FR 59695, Aug. 29, 2023]
§ 761.316
Interpreting PCB concentration measurements resulting from this sampling scheme.
(a) For an individual sample taken from an approximately 1 meter square portion of the entire surface area and not composited with other samples, the status of the portion is based on the surface concentration measured in that sample. If the sample surface concentration is not equal to or lower than the cleanup level, by inference the entire 1 meter area, and not just the immediate area where the sample was taken, is not equal to or lower than the cleanup level.
(b) For areas represented by the measurement results from compositing more than one 10 centimeter by 10 centimeter sample, the measurement for the composite is the measurement for the entire area. For example, when there is a composite of 10 standard wipe test samples representing 9.5 square meters of surface area and the result of the analysis of the composite is 20 µg/100 cm
2
, then the entire 9.5 square meters has a PCB surface concentration of 20 µg/100 cm
2
, not just the area in the 10 cm by 10 cm sampled areas.
(c) For small surfaces having irregular contours, where the entire surface was sampled, measure the surface area. Divide 100 cm
2
by the surface area and multiply this quotient by the total number of micrograms of PCBs on the
surface to obtain the equivalent measurement of micrograms per 100 cm
2
.

# Subpart Q—Self-Implementing Alternative Extraction and Chemical Analysis Procedures for Non-liquid PCB Remediation Waste Samples

# Source:
63 FR 35468, June 29, 1998, unless otherwise noted.
§ 761.320
Applicability.
This subpart describes self-implementing comparison testing requirements for chemical extraction and chemical analysis methods used as an alternative to the methods required in § 761.272 or § 761.292. Any person conducting comparison testing under this subpart must comply with the requirements of § 761.80(i), including notification. Use alternative methods only after successful completion of these comparison testing requirements and after documentation of the results of the testing.
§ 761.323
Sample preparation.
(a) The comparison study requires analysis of a minimum of 10 samples weighing at least 300 grams each. Samples of PCB remediation waste used in the comparison study must meet the following three requirements.
(1) The samples must either be taken from the PCB remediation waste at the cleanup site, or must be the same kind of material as that waste. For example, if the waste at the cleanup site is sandy soil, you must use the same kind of sandy soil in the comparison study. Do not use unrelated materials such as clay soil or dredged sediments in place of sandy soil.
(2) PCB remediation waste may contain interferences which confound or hamper sample extraction and chemical analysis. These interferences may be from chemicals or other attributes preexisting in the waste material, resulting from the PCB contamination source, or resulting from treatment to remove or destroy PCBs. Comparison study samples must also contain these interfering materials to demonstrate successful analysis in their presence. For example, a PCB remediation waste may have been co-disposed with chlorobenzene solvents or chlorinated pesticides. These chlorinated compounds would have to be present in the comparison study compounds at the same levels found, or at the highest levels expected to be found, in the PCB remediation waste. As another example, for PCB remediation waste which had been solvent washed with liquid amines to remove PCBs, comparison study samples would have to contain concentrations of these amines at the same levels found, or at the highest levels expected to be found, in the PCB remediation waste.
(b) Prior to initiating the comparison study, confirm the following PCB concentrations in the comparison study samples using the methods specified in § 761.292. All samples of non-liquid PCB remediation waste must have PCB concentrations between 0.1 and 150 ppm.
(1) A minimum of three comparison study samples must have PCB concentrations above the cleanup level specified for the site in § 761.61(a)(4) and a minimum of three comparison study samples must have PCB concentrations below the specified cleanup level.
(2) At least one comparison study sample must have a PCB concentration ≥90 percent and ≤100 percent of the cleanup level.
(3) At least one comparison study sample must have a PCB concentration ≥100 percent and ≤110 percent of the cleanup level.
(c) If the comparison study samples do not have the concentrations or concentration ranges required by paragraph (b) of this section, for purposes of use in this chemical extraction and chemical analysis comparison study, a person may adjust PCB concentrations by dilution. Any excess material resulting from the preparation of these samples, which is not used as an analytical sample, is regulated as the PCB concentration in the component having the highest PCB concentration of the component materials in the sample.
§ 761.326
Conducting the comparison study.
Extract or analyze the comparison study samples using the alternative method. For an alternative extraction
method or alternative analytical method to be comparable to the methods required in § 761.292, all of the following conditions must be met.
(a) All samples having PCB concentrations greater than or equal to the level of concern, as measured by the methods required in § 761.292, are found to be greater than or equal to the level of concern as measured by the alternative method (no false negatives).
(b) Only one sample which contains PCBs at a level less than the level of concern, as measured by the methods required in § 761.292, is found to have a PCB concentration greater than the level of concern as measured by the alternative method (false positive); and all other samples which contain PCBs at levels less than the level of concern, as measured by the methods required in § 761.292, are found by the alternative method to have PCBs less than the level of concern (there are no additional false positives).

# Subpart R—Sampling Non-Liquid, Non-Metal PCB Bulk Product Waste for Purposes of Characterization for PCB Disposal in Accordance With § 761.62, and Sampling PCB Remediation Waste Destined for Off-Site Disposal, in Accordance With § 761.61

# Source:
63 FR 35469, June 29, 1998, unless otherwise noted.
§ 761.340
Applicability.
Use the procedures specified in this subpart to sample the following types of waste when it is necessary to analyze the waste to determine PCB concentration or leaching characteristics for storage or disposal.
(a) Existing accumulations of non-liquid, non-metal PCB bulk product waste.
(b) Non-liquid, non-metal PCB bulk product waste from processes that continuously generate new waste.
(c) Non-liquid PCB remediation waste from processes that continuously generate new waste, that will be sent off-site for disposal.
§ 761.345
Form of the waste to be sampled.
PCB bulk product waste and PCB remediation waste destined for off-site disposal must be in the form of either flattened or roughly conical piles. This subpart also contains a procedure for contemporaneous sampling of waste as it is being generated.
§ 761.346
Three levels of sampling.
To select a sample of the waste and prepare it for chemical extraction and analysis, there are three required levels of random sampling.
(a) First, select a single 19-liter (5 gallon) portion from a composite accumulated either contemporaneously with the generation of the waste or by sampling an existing pile of waste. Collection procedures for the first level of sampling from existing piles of waste are in § 761.347. Collection procedures for the first level of sampling from a contemporaneous generation of waste are in § 761.348. Compositing requirements and requirements for the subsampling of composite samples to result in a single 19-liter sample are in § 761.350. Send the 19-liter sample to the laboratory for the second and third levels of sampling, including particle size reduction for leach testing and drying as required by § 761.1(b)(4).
(b) Second, at the laboratory, select one quarter of the 19-liter sample. Procedures the laboratory must use for this second level of sample selection appear in § 761.353.
(c) Third, select a 100 gram subsample from the second level subsample. Procedures the laboratory must use for this third level of sample selection appear in § 761.355.
§ 761.347
First level sampling—waste from existing piles.
(a)
General.
Sample piles that are either specifically configured for sampling (see paragraph (b) of this section) or that are of conical shape (see paragraph (c) of this section). If sampling from either of these shapes is not possible, conduct contemporaneous sampling, in accordance with the procedures in § 761.348, or obtain the approval of the Regional Administrator for an alternate sampling plan in accordance with § 761.62(c).
(b)
Specifically configured piles.
A specifically configured pile is a single flattened pile in the shape of a square or rectangle having no restrictions on length or width but restricted to 30 cm (1 foot) in depth. A square shaped pile facilitates sampling site selection for the first level sample. Select eight 19-liter samples from the pile and composite them into one 19-liter sample as follows:
(1) Divide the pile into quarters.
(2) Divide each of the quarter sections into quarters (i.e., into sixteenths of the original pile).
(3) Select two sixteenths from each of the four quarters, according to one of the two following options:
(i) Randomly select the two sixteenths from one quarter and sample the sixteenths occupying the same positions in each of the other three quarters.
(ii) Randomly select two sixteenths from each of the four quarters (i.e., perform a random selection four different times).
(4) At this point the eight selected sixteenths undergo further division and sample selection. Divide each of the eight selected sixteenths into four equal parts. Using a random number generator or random number table, select one of the four equal parts from each of the eight equal areas. If each of the four equal parts has a volume
76 liters when projected downwards 30 cm, continue to divide each selected area into four equal parts, and select one of the parts, until each selected area has a volume of
76 liters but ≥19 liters. When projected to a depth of 30 cm, a square having a 25 cm side or a circle having a diameter of approximately 28.5 cm equals a volume of approximately 19 liters. The volume of 76 liters is equal to the volume enclosed by a square having a side of 50 cm (or other shape having an area of 250 cm
2
) projected to a depth of 30 cm.
(5) Take one sample of approximately 19 unsorted liters of waste from each of the eight selected areas. Place each sample into a separate 19-liter container, allowing only sufficient space at the top of the container to secure the lid.
(6) Composite the eight 19-liter samples in accordance with § 761.350.
(c)
Conical-shaped piles.
If it is necessary to sample a pile which is too large to be spread on the site to a uniform thickness of 1 foot or 30 cm, or if there are too many piles to spread out in the space available, use the following procedure to sample the piles. This procedure assumes that the shape of the piles is analogous to a cone; that is, having a circular base with PCB bulk product waste or PCB remediation waste destined for off-site disposal stacked up uniformly to a peak that is a point centered above the center of the circular base. Collect eight 19-liter samples as follows:
(1)
Collecting samples from more than one pile.
If the PCB bulk product waste or PCB remediation waste consists of more than one pile or container, assign each pile or container an integer number and then generate seven random integer numbers to select the piles from which you will collect samples. It is possible that this random selection procedure will result in selecting the same pile number more than once, even if seven or more piles are present. If so, sample the pile once and restart the sampling collection process to collect additional samples. Do not collect multiple samples from the same location in the pile.
(2)
Collecting samples from a single pile.
If only one pile or container is present, collect all eight samples from the same pile.
(3)
Setting up the sample site selection system from a pile.
Locate a sample in a pile by the use of three parameters: a particular radial direction, “r,” from the peak at the center of the pile to the outer edge at the base of the pile; a point, “s,” along that radial direction between the peak of the pile and the outer edge of the base of the pile; and a depth, “t”, beneath point “s.” The top of the sample material will be below depth
t,
at point
s,
on radius
r.
Use a rod, dowel, stake, or broom handle as a marker. Nail or otherwise fasten to the top of the marker two pieces of string or cord of sufficient length and strength to reach from the top of the marker at the top of the pile to the farthest peripheral edge at the bottom of the pile, when the marker is positioned at the top or apex of the pile. Pound or push the marker into the top
center (apex) of the pile, downward toward the center of the base. Insert the marker for at least 30 cm or one foot until the marker is rigidly standing on its own, even when the cord is pulled tight to the bottom peripheral edge of the pile. Ensure that the marker protrudes from the top of the pile sufficiently to allow the strings to move easily around the pile when they are pulled tight. Select the three parameters and the sampling location as follows:
(i) Determine the radial component (r) of the location for each sample.
(A) Tie to a stake or otherwise fasten one of the strings at “b,” the bottom of the pile, as a reference point for finding
r.
(B) Measure the circumference “c,” the distance around the bottom of the pile. Determine
r
from
b
in one of two ways:
(
1
) Multiply
c
by a randomly generated fraction or percentage of one.
(
2
) Select a random number between one and the total number of centimeters in
c.
(C) Locate
r
by starting at
b,
the place where the fixed string meets the base of the pile, and travel clockwise around the edge of the pile at the base for the distance you selected in paragraph (c)(3)(i)(B) of this section.
(D) Fasten the second string at the selected distance. The second string marks the first parameter
r.
(ii) Determine the second parameter s of the location for each sample.
(A) Measure the distance,
l,
along the string, positioned in paragraph (c)(3)(i)(D) of this section, from the top to the bottom of the pile at the selected radial distance
r.
Determine the distance
s
from
l
in one of two ways:
(
1
) Multiply
l
by a randomly generated fraction or percentage of one.
(
2
) Select a random number between one and the total number of centimeters in
l.
(B) Mark, for example by placing a piece of tape on the string positioned according to paragraph (c)(3)(i)(D) of this section, the distance
s,
up from the bottom of the pile on the string at
r.
(iii) Determine the third and final parameter
t
of the location for each sample.
(A) Mark and number 1 cm intervals from one end of a rigid device, for example a rod, dowel, stake, or broom handle, for measuring the distance from the top of the pile to the bottom at the point
s
selected in paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(B) of this section. The marked and numbered device shall be of sufficient strength to be forced down through the maximum depth of the pile and sufficient length to measure the depth of the waste in the pile at any point.
(B) Take the measuring device, constructed according to paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(A) of this section, and at position s, push the end of the device marked with zero straight down into the pile until it reaches the bottom of the pile or ground level. The vertical distance “v” is the number of centimeters from the surface of the pile at point s on the string to the bottom of the pile or ground level. Read the distance
v
on the measuring device at the surface of the pile. From the distance
v,
determine
t,
in one of two ways:
(
1
) Randomly generate a fraction of one and multiply the fraction times v.
(
2
) Select a random number between zero and the total number of centimeters of the vertical distance
v.
(iv) Dig a hole straight down into the pile for
t
centimeters (inches) from the surface of the pile at
s.
(v) At depth
t,
directly under the s mark on the string, outline the top of the sample container and collect (shovel) all waste under the outline in the following order of preference in paragraphs (c)(3)(v)(A) through (c)(3)(v)(C) of this section. It is possible that some of the eight sampling locations will not provide 19 liters of sample.
(A) For a depth of 30 cm.
(B) Until the container is full.
(C) Until the ground level is reached.
(d)
Compositing the samples.
Composite the eight 19-liter samples and subsample in accordance with § 761.350. Send the subsample to a laboratory for further sampling as described in §§ 761.353 and 761.355 and for chemical extraction and analysis. If there is insufficient sample for a 19-liter sample from the composite sample composed of the eight iterations of sample site selection, according to the procedures in paragraphs (c)(3)(i) through (c)(3)(v)
of this section, select additional sample sites, collect additional samples and composite the additional waste in the samples until a minimum of 19 liters is in the composite.
[63 FR 35469, June 29, 1998, as amended at 64 FR 33762, June 24, 1999]
§ 761.348
Contemporaneous sampling.
Contemporaneous sampling is possible when there is active generation of waste and it is possible to sample the waste stream as it is generated. Collect eight 19-liter samples as follows.
(a) Collect each sample by filling a 19-liter (5 gallon) container at a location where the PCB bulk product waste is released from the waste generator onto a pile or into a receptacle container before the waste reaches the pile or receptacle container.
(b) Determine a sample collection start time using a random number generator or a random number table to select a number between 1 and 60. Collect the first sample at the randomly selected time in minutes after start up of the waste output, or if the waste is currently being generated, after the random time is selected. For example, if the randomly selected time is 35, begin collection 35 minutes after the start up of waste generation. Similarly, if waste output is ongoing and the random start determination occurred at 8:35 a.m., collect the first sample at 9:10 a.m. (35 minutes after the random start determination).
(c) Collect seven more samples, one every 60 minutes after the initial sample is collected. If the waste output process stops, stop the 60-minute interval time clock. When the process restarts, restart the 60-minute interval time clock and complete the incomplete 60-minute interval.
(d) Composite the eight 19-liter samples and subsample in accordance with § 761.350.
§ 761.350
Subsampling from composite samples.
(a)
Preparing the composite.
Composite the samples (eight from a flattened pile; eight or more from a conical pile; eight from waste that is continuously generated) and select a 19-liter subsample for shipment to the chemical extraction and analysis laboratory for further subsampling. There are two options for the preparation of the composite:
(1)
Option one.
Place all of the contents of all 19-liter samples that you collected into a 209 liter (55 gallon) drum or similar sized, cylinder-shaped container. Completely close the container, and roll it 10 or more complete revolutions to mix the contents.
(2)
Option two.
Add the 19-liter samples one at a time to a 209 liter (55 gallon) drum. Between the addition of each 19-liter sample, stir the composite using a broom handle or similar long, narrow, sturdy rod that reaches the bottom of the container. Stir the mixture for a minimum of 10 complete revolutions of the stirring instrument around the container at a distance approximately half way between the outside and center of the container.
(b)
Selecting a 19-liter subsample from the composite.
Once the composite is mixed, pour the mixture of waste out on a plastic sheet and either divide it into 19-liter size piles or make one large pile.
(1) From 19-liter sized piles, use a random number generator or random number table to select one of the piles.
(2) From one large pile, flatten the pile to a depth of 30 cm and divide it into 4 quarters of equal size. Use a random number generator or random number table to select one quarter of the pile. Further divide the selected quarter pile into 19-liter portions and use a random number generator or random number table to select one 19-liter portion. A square having a 25 cm side or a circle having a diameter of approximately 28.5 cm when projected downwards 30 cm equals approximately 19 liters.
(c)
Transferring the sample to the analytical laboratory.
Place the selected 19-liter subsample in a container, approved for shipment of the sample, to the chemical extraction and analysis laboratory, for the next step in sample selection in accordance with § 761.353.
§ 761.353
Second level of sample selection.
The second level of sample selection reduces the size of the 19-liter subsample that was collected according to
either § 761.347 or § 761.348 and subsampled according to § 761.350. The purpose of the sample size reduction is to limit the amount of time required to manually cut up larger particles of the waste to pass through a 9.5 millimeter (mm) screen.
(a)
Selecting a portion of the subsample for particle size reduction.
At the chemical extraction and analysis laboratory, pour the 19-liter subsample onto a plastic sheet or into a pan and divide the subsample into quarters. Use a random number generator or random number table to select one of these quarters.
(b)
Reduction of the particle size by the use of a 9.5 mm screen.
Collect the contents of the selected quarter of waste resulting from conducting the procedures in paragraph (a) of this section and shake the waste in a 9.5 mm screen. Separate the waste material which passes through the screen from the waste material which does not pass through the screen. Manually cut or otherwise reduce the size of all parts of the waste portion which did not pass through the 9.5 mm screen, such that each part of the waste shall pass through the 9.5 mm screen by shaking.
(c) Drying the reduced particle size waste. Dry all of the waste portion resulting from conducting the procedures in paragraph (b) of this section, from 10 to 15 hours in a drying oven at 100 °C. Allow the dried waste to cool to room temperature.
(d)
Mixing the dried waste.
Place all of the waste resulting from conducting the procedures in paragraph (c) of this section in a 19-liter pail or similarly sized, cylinder-shaped container. Mix the dried material according to one of the two following options:
(1)
First mixing option.
Completely close the container and roll the container a minimum of 10 complete revolutions to mix the contents.
(2)
Second mixing option.
Use a sturdy stirring rod, such as a broom handle or other device that reaches the bottom of the container, to stir the waste for a minimum of 10 complete revolutions around the container at a distance approximately half way between the outside and the center of the container.
§ 761.355
Third level of sample selection.
The third level of sample selection further reduces the size of the subsample to 100 grams which is suitable for the chemical extraction and analysis procedure.
(a) Divide the subsample resulting from conducting the procedures in § 761.353 of this part into 100 gram portions.
(b) Use a random number generator or random number table to select one 100 gram size portion as a sample for a procedure used to simulate leachate generation.
(c) Dry the 100 gram sample, selected after conducting the procedure in paragraph (b) of this section, for 10 to 15 hours in a drying oven at 100 °C and cool it to the analytical laboratory room temperature before analysis using a procedure used to simulate leachate generation. This sample was dried previously in the larger quantity sample at the second level of sampling (§ 761.353(c)) and is dried a second time here (in the third level of sample selection). This dried and cooled sample must weigh at least 50 grams.
(d) If the dried and cooled sample weighs
50 grams, select additional 100 gram portions of sample one at a time by repeating the directions in paragraph (b) and (c) of this section, and add each additional 100 gram portion of sample to the first 100 gram portion until at least 50 grams of dried material is in the sample to be analyzed using a procedure used to simulate leachate generation.
§ 761.356
Conducting a leach test.
No method is specified as a procedure used to simulate leachate generation.
§ 761.357
Reporting the results of the procedure used to simulate leachate generation.
Report the results of the procedure used to simulate leachate generation as micrograms PCBs per liter of extract from a 100 gram sample of dry bulk product waste. Divide 100 grams by the grams in the sample and multiply this quotient by the number of micrograms PCBs per liter of extract to obtain the equivalent measurement from a 100 gram sample.
§ 761.358
Determining the PCB concentration of samples of waste.
Select applicable method(s) from the following list to extract PCBs and determine the PCB concentration from individual and composite samples of PCB remediation waste or PCB bulk product waste: SW-846 Method 3540C, Method 3541, Method 3545A, Method 3546, or Method 8082A (all standards incorporated by reference in § 761.19). Modifications to the methods listed in this paragraph or alternative methods not listed may be used if validated under subpart Q of this part or authorized in a §§ 761.61(c) or 761.62(c) approval.

# Subpart S—Double Wash/Rinse Method for Decontaminating Non-Porous Surfaces

# Source:
63 FR 35472, June 29, 1998, unless otherwise noted.
§ 761.360
Background.
The double wash/rinse procedure is used to quickly and effectively remove PCBs on surfaces. It is important to select and use the proper cleanup equipment, to conduct the procedure correctly so as not to redistribute PCBs, and to comply with disposal requirements for all cleanup materials.
§ 761.363
Applicability.
The double wash/rinse procedure includes two washing steps and two rinsing steps. The two washing and rinsing steps are slightly different depending on whether a contaminated surface was relatively clean before the spill (see § 761.372), or whether the surface was coated or covered with dust, dirt, grime, grease or another absorbent material (see § 761.375).
§ 761.366
Cleanup equipment.
(a) Use scrubbers and absorbent pads that are not dissolved by the solvents or cleaners used, and that do not shred, crumble, or leave visible fragments on the surface. Scrubbers and absorbent pads used to wash contaminated surfaces must not be reused. Scrubbers and absorbent pads for rinsing must not contain ≥2 ppm PCBs. Scrubbers and absorbent pads used in the second rinse of contaminated surfaces may be reused to wash contaminated surfaces.
(b) Capture and contain all solvents and cleaners for reuse, decontamination, or disposal. Clean organic solvents contain
2 ppm PCBs. Clean water contains
3 ppb PCBs.
§ 761.369
Pre-cleaning the surface.
If visible PCB-containing liquid is present on the surface to be cleaned, thoroughly wipe or mop the entire surface with absorbent paper or cloth until no liquid is visible on the surface.
§ 761.372
Specific requirements for relatively clean surfaces.
For surfaces that do not appear dusty or grimy before a spill, such as glass, automobile surfaces, newly-poured concrete, and desk tops, use the double wash/rinse procedures in this section.
(a)
First wash.
Cover the entire surface with organic solvent in which PCBs are soluble to at least 5 percent by weight. Contain and collect any runoff solvent for disposal. Scrub rough surfaces with a scrub brush or disposable scrubbing pad and solvent such that each 900 cm
2
(1 square foot) of the surface is always very wet for 1 minute. Wipe smooth surfaces with a solvent-soaked, disposable absorbent pad such that each 900 cm
2
(1 square foot) is wiped for 1 minute. Any surface
1 square foot shall also be wiped for 1 minute. Wipe, mop, and/or sorb the solvent onto absorbent material until no visible traces of the solvent remain.
(b)
First rinse.
Wet the surface with clean rinse solvent such that the entire surfaces is very wet for 1 minute. Drain and contain the solvent from the surface. Wipe the residual solvent off the drained surface using a clean, disposable absorbent pad until no liquid is visible on the surface.
(c)
Second wash.
Repeat the procedures in paragraph (a) of this section. The rinse solvent from the first rinse (paragraph (b) of this section) may be used.
(d)
Second rinse.
Repeat the procedures in paragraph (b) of this section.
§ 761.375
Specific requirements for surfaces coated or covered with dust, dirt, grime, grease, or another absorbent material.
(a)
First wash.
Cover the entire surface with concentrated or industrial strength detergent or non-ionic surfactant solution. Contain and collect all cleaning solutions for proper disposal. Scrub rough surfaces with a scrub brush or scrubbing pad, adding cleaning solution such that the surface is always very wet, such that each 900 cm
2
(1 square foot) is washed for 1 minute. Wipe smooth surfaces with a cleaning solution-soaked disposable absorbent pad such that each 900 cm
2
(1 square foot) is wiped for 1 minute. Wash any surface
1 square foot for 1 minute. Mop up or absorb the residual cleaner solution and suds with a clean, disposable, absorbent pad until the surface appears dry. This cleaning should remove any residual dirt, dust, grime, or other absorbent materials left on the surface during the first wash.
(b)
First rinse.
Rinse off the wash solution with 1 gallon of clean water per square foot and capture the rinse water. Mop up the wet surface with a clean, disposable, absorbent pad until the surface appears dry.
(c)
Second wash.
Follow the procedure in § 761.372(a).
(d)
Second rinse.
Follow the procedure in § 761.372(b).
§ 761.378
Decontamination, reuse, and disposal of solvents, cleaners, and equipment.
(a)
Decontamination.
Decontaminate solvents and non-porous surfaces on equipment in accordance with the standards and procedures in § 761.79(b) and (c).
(b)
Reuse.
A solvent may be reused so long as its PCB concentration is
50 ppm. Decontaminated equipment may be reused in accordance with § 761.30(u). Store solvents and equipment for reuse in accordance with § 761.35.
(c)
Disposal.
Dispose of all solvents, cleaners, and absorbent materials in accordance with § 761.79(g). Dispose of equipment in accordance with § 761.61(a)(5)(v)(A), or decontaminate in accordance with § 761.79(b) or (c). Store for disposal equipment, solvents, cleaners, and absorbent materials in accordance with § 761.65.

# Subpart T—Comparison Study for Validating a New Performance-Based Decontamination Solvent Under § 761.79(d)(4)

# Source:
63 FR 35473, June 29, 1998, unless otherwise noted.
§ 761.380
Background.
This subpart provides self-implementing criteria for validating the conditions for use in performance-based decontamination of solvents other than those listed in § 761.79(c)(3) and (c)(4). Any person may use this subpart for validating either a chemical formulation or a product with a trade name whether or not the constituents of the product are proprietary.
§ 761.383
Applicability.
Use the self-implementing decontamination procedure only on smooth, non-porous surfaces that were once in contact with liquid PCBs. Decontamination procedures under this subpart shall exactly parallel § 761.79(c)(3) and (c)(4), except that the procedures described in § 761.79(c)(3)(iii) and (c)(3)(iv) and (c)(4)(iii), (c)(4)(iv) and (c)(4)(vii) may be revised to contain parameters validated in accordance with this subpart.
§ 761.386
Required experimental conditions for the validation study and subsequent use during decontamination.
The following experimental conditions apply for any solvent:
(a)
Temperature and pressure.
Conduct the validation study and perform decontamination at room temperature (from ≥15 °C to ≤30 °C) and at atmospheric pressure.
(b)
Agitation.
Limit the movement in the solvent to the short-term movement from placing the contaminated surface into the soak solvent and from removing the surface from the soak solvent.
(c)
Time of soak.
Soak the surface for a minimum of 1 hour.
(d)
Surface conditions for the validation study.
Prior to beginning the validation study, ensure that there are no free-flowing liquids on surfaces and that surfaces are dry (i.e., there are no liquids visible without magnification). Also ensure that surfaces are virtually free from non-liquid residues, corrosion, and other defects which would prevent the solvent from freely circulating over the surface.
(e)
Confirmatory sampling for the validation study.
Select surface sample locations using representative sampling or a census. Sample a minimum area of 100 cm
2
on each individual surface in the validation study. Measure surface concentrations using the standard wipe test, as defined in § 761.123, from which a standard wipe sample is generated for chemical analysis. Guidance for wipe sampling appears in the document entitled “Wipe Sampling and Double Wash/Rinse Cleanup as Recommended by the Environmental Protection Agency PCB Spill Cleanup Policy,” available on EPA's website at
https://www.epa.gov/pcbs,
or from the Program Implementation and Information Division, Office of Resource Conservation and Recovery (5303T), Environmental Protection Agency, 1200 Pennsylvania Ave. NW, Washington, DC 20460-0001.
(f)
Concentration of PCBs.
The method validated may be used only to decontaminate surfaces containing PCBs at concentrations on which the validation study was performed and lower concentrations.
[63 FR 35473, June 29, 1998, as amended at 72 FR 57241, Oct. 9, 2007; 74 FR 30235, June 25, 2009; 88 FR 59695, Aug. 29, 2023]
§ 761.389
Testing parameter requirements.
There are no restrictions on the variable testing parameters described in this section which may be used in the validation study. The conditions demonstrated in the validation study for these variables shall become the required conditions for decontamination using the solvent being validated and shall replace the comparable conditions in § 761.79(b)(3) through (b)(6). There are limited potential options for varying a single requirement in this section. If you change one of these variable requirements, change it only in the way listed in this section and do not change any other validated conditions. If you desire to change more than one of the requirements in this section, you must conduct a new study to validate the decontamination under the desired conditions.
(a) The study apparatus is not standardized. Critical components of the study are the PCB material (for example MODEF or some other spiking solution), the volume of the soaking solvent, and the area of the contaminated surface. The EPA study used beakers and shallow dishes as the experimental vessels to contain the surface and solvent during the soaking process. In order to minimize surface-to-volume ratios, it is convenient to utilize flat contaminated surfaces and shallow solvent containers. During the validation study, use the same ratio of contaminated surface area to soak solvent volume as would be used during actual decontamination. It is also permissible to use a smaller surface area to soaking solvent volume than used in the validation study, so long as all other required parameters are used as validated in the confirmation required in § 761.386 (a) through (f), and paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section. Do not use a larger surface-area-to-solvent-volumes ratio or different kind of solvent based on the results of the validation study.
(b) Except for the minimum soak time of 1 hour (as required in § 761.386(c)), the length of soak time is not otherwise restricted in the validation study. The soak time used in the validation study, however, is a use requirement for subsequent decontamination using the solvent being validated. It is permissible to use longer soak times for decontamination than the soak time used in the validation study, if all other parameters required in § 761.386, and paragraphs (a) and (c) of this section are used.
(c) There is no restriction on the kind of material containing PCBs to use to create the surface contamination for the validation study. There is also no restriction on the level of starting PCB surface concentration. It is permissible to use lower concentrations of PCB than the concentration used in the validation study, if all other parameters required in § 761.386
(a) through (f), and paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section are used.
§ 761.392
Preparing validation study samples.
(a)(1) To validate a procedure to decontaminate a surface contaminated with a spill from liquid of a known concentration, contaminate (spike) the surface to be used in the validation study as follows:
(i) Use a spiking solution made of PCBs mixed with a solvent to contaminate clean surfaces. Clean surfaces are surfaces having PCB surface concentrations
1 µg/100 cm
2
before intentionally contaminating the surface.
(ii) Prior to contaminating a surface for the validation study, mark the surface sampling area to assure that it is completely covered with the spiking solution.
(iii) Deliver the spiking solution onto the surface, covering all of the sampling area. Contain any liquids which spill or flow off the surface. Allow the spiking solution to drip drain off into a container and then evaporate the spiking solution off the contaminated surface prior to beginning the validation study. Contaminate a minimum of eight surfaces for a complete validation study.
(iv) As a quality control step, test at least one contaminated surface to determine the PCB concentration to verify that there are measurable surface levels of PCBs resulting from the contamination before soaking the surface in the decontamination solvent. The surface levels of PCBs on the contaminated surfaces must be ≥20 µg/100 cm
2
.
(2) To validate a procedure to decontaminate a specified surface concentrations of PCBs as measured by a standard wipe sample, contaminate a minimum of 10 surfaces. Contaminate all the surfaces identically following the procedures in paragraph (a)(1) of this section and measure the PCB surface concentrations of at least three of the surfaces using a standard wipe test to establish a surface concentration to be included in the standard operating procedure. The surface levels of PCBs on the contaminated surfaces must be ≥20 µg/100 cm
2
.
(b) [Reserved]
§ 761.395
A validation study.
(a) Decontaminate the following prepared sample surfaces using the selected testing parameters and experimental conditions. Take a standard wipe sample of the decontaminated surface.
(1) At least one uncontaminated surface. The surface levels of PCBs on the uncontaminated surface must be
1 µg/100 cm
2
.
(2) At least seven contaminated surfaces.
(b)(1) Select applicable method(s) from the following list to extract PCBs and determine the PCB concentration from the standard wipe sample collection medium: SW-846 Method 3540C, Method 3550C, Method 3541, Method 3545A, Method 3546, or Method 8082A (all standards incorporated by reference in § 761.19). Modifications to the methods listed in this paragraph or alternative methods not listed may be used if validated under subpart Q of this part.
(2) Report all validation study surface sample concentrations on the basis of micrograms of PCBs per 100 cm
2
of surface sampled.
(c) Following completion of the validation study, measurements from the contaminated surfaces must have an arithmetic mean of ≤10 µg/100 cm
2
. If the arithmetic mean is
10 µg/100 cm
2
, then the validation study failed and the solvent may not be used for decontamination under § 761.79(d)(4) according to the parameters tested.

§ 761.398
Reporting and recordkeeping.
(a) Submit validation study results to the Director, Office of Resource Conservation and Recovery (5301P), Environmental Protection Agency, 1200 Pennsylvania Ave., NW., Washington, DC 20460-0001, prior to the first use of a new solvent for alternate decontamination under § 761.79(d)(4). The use of a new solvent is not TSCA Confidential Business Information (CBI). From time to time, EPA will confirm the use of validated new decontamination solvents and publish the new solvents and
validated decontamination procedures in the
Federal Register.
(b) Any person may begin to use solvent validated in accordance with this subpart at the time results are submitted to EPA.
(c) Record all testing parameters and experimental conditions from the successful validation study into a standard operating procedure (SOP) for reference whenever the decontamination procedure is used. Include in the SOP the identity of the soaking solvent, the length of time of the soak, and the ratio of the soak solvent to contaminated surface area during the soaking process. Also include in the SOP the maximum concentration of PCBs in the spilled material and the identity of the spilled material, and/or the measured maximum surface concentration of the contaminated surface used in the validation study. Record and keep the results of the validation study as an appendix to the SOP. Include in this appendix, the solvent used to make the spiking solution, the PCB concentration of the spiking solution used to contaminate the surfaces in the validation study, and all of the validation study testing parameters and experimental conditions.

§ 763.80
Scope and purpose.
(a) This rule requires local education agencies to identify friable and nonfriable asbestos-containing material
(ACM) in public and private elementary and secondary schools by visually inspecting school buildings for such materials, sampling such materials if they are not assumed to be ACM, and having samples analyzed by appropriate techniques referred to in this rule. The rule requires local education agencies to submit management plans to the Governor of their State by October 12, 1988, begin to implement the plans by July 9, 1989, and complete implementation of the plans in a timely fashion. In addition, local education agencies are required to use persons who have been accredited to conduct inspections, reinspections, develop management plans, or perform response actions. The rule also includes recordkeeping requirements. Local education agencies may contractually delegate their duties under this rule, but they remain responsible for the proper performance of those duties. Local education agencies are encouraged to consult with EPA Regional Asbestos Coordinators, or if applicable, a State's lead agency designated by the State Governor, for assistance in complying with this rule.
(b) Local education agencies must provide for the transportation and disposal of asbestos in accordance with EPA's “Asbestos Waste Management Guidance.” For convenience, applicable sections of this guidance are reprinted as appendix D of this subpart. There are regulations in place, however, that affect transportation and disposal of asbestos waste generated by this rule. The transportation of asbestos waste is covered by the Department of Transportation (49 CFR part 173, subpart J) and disposal is covered by the National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) (40 CFR part 61, subpart M).

Miscellaneous material
means interior building material on structural components, structural members or fixtures, such as floor and ceiling tiles, and does not include surfacing material or thermal system insulation.
Nonfriable
means material in a school building which when dry may not be crumbled, pulverized, or reduced to powder by hand pressure.
Operations and maintenance program
means a program of work practices to maintain friable ACBM in good condition, ensure clean up of asbestos fibers previously released, and prevent further release by minimizing and controlling friable ACBM disturbance or damage.
Potential damage
means circumstances in which:
(1) Friable ACBM is in an area regularly used by building occupants, including maintenance personnel, in the course of their normal activities.

(2) In selecting the response action from among those which meet the definitional standards in § 763.83, the local education agency shall determine which of these response actions protects human health and the environment. For purposes of determining which of these response actions are the least burdensome, the local education agency may then consider local circumstances, including occupancy and use patterns within the school building, and its economic concerns, including short- and long-term costs.
(d) If significantly damaged friable surfacing ACM or significantly damaged friable miscellaneous ACM is present in a building the local education agency shall:
(1) Immediately isolate the functional space and restrict access, unless isolation is not necessary to protect human health and the environment.
(2) Remove the material in the functional space or, depending upon whether enclosure or encapsulation would be sufficient to protect human health and the environment, enclose or encapsulate.
(e) If any friable surfacing ACM, thermal system insulation ACM, or friable miscellaneous ACM that has potential for damage is present in a building, the local education agency shall at least implement an operations and maintenance (O
M) program, as described under § 763.91.

2
).
(4) An action may also be considered complete if the volume of air drawn for each of the five samples collected within the affected functional space is equal to or greater than 1,199 L of air for a 25 mm filter or equal to or greater than 2,799 L of air for a 37 mm filter, and the average concentration of asbestos as analyzed by the TEM method in appendix A of this subpart E, for the five air samples does not exceed the filter background level, as defined in appendix A, of 70 structures per square millimeter (70 s/mm
2
). If the average concentration of asbestos of the five air samples within the affected functional space exceeds 70 s/mm
2
, or if the volume of air in each of the samples is less than 1,199 L of air for a 25 mm filter or less than 2,799 L of air for a 37 mm filter, the action shall be considered complete only when the requirements of paragraph (i)(3) or (i)(5), of this section are met.
(5) At any time, a local education agency may analyze air monitoring samples collected for clearance purposes by phase contrast microscopy (PCM) to confirm completion of removal, encapsulation, or enclosure of ACBM that is greater than small-scale, short-duration and less than or equal to 160 square feet or 260 linear feet. The action shall be considered complete when the results of samples collected in the affected functional space and analyzed by phase contrast microscopy using the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) Method 7400 entitled “Fibers” published in the NIOSH Manual of Analytical Methods, 3rd Edition, Second Supplement, August 1987, show that the concentration of fibers for each of the five samples is less than or equal to a limit of quantitation for PCM (0.01 fibers per cubic centimeter (0.01 f/cm
3
) of air). The method is available at the addresses in § 700.17(b)(1) and (2) of this chapter. For information on the availability of this material at NARA, call 202-741-6030, or go to:
http://www.archives.gov/federal_register/code_of_federal_regulations/ibr_locations.html.
This incorporation by reference was approved by the Director of the Federal Register in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51. The method is incorporated as it exists on the effective date of this rule, and a notice of any change to the method will be published in the
Federal Register.

§ 763.99
Exclusions.
(a) A local education agency shall not be required to perform an inspection under § 763.85(a) in any sampling area as defined in 40 CFR 763.103 or homogeneous area of a school building where:
(1) An accredited inspector has determined that, based on sampling records, friable ACBM was identified in that homogeneous or sampling area during an inspection conducted before December 14, 1987. The inspector shall sign and date a statement to that effect with his or her State of accreditation and if applicable, accreditation number and, within 30 days after such determination, submit a copy of the statement to the person designated under § 763.84 for inclusion in the management plan. However, an accredited inspector shall assess the friable ACBM under § 763.88.
(2) An accredited inspector has determined that, based on sampling records, nonfriable ACBM was identified in that homogeneous or sampling area during an inspection conducted before December 14, 1987. The inspector shall sign and date a statement to that effect with his or her State of accreditation and if applicable, accreditation number and, within 30 days after such determination, submit a copy of the statement to the person designated under § 763.84 for inclusion in the management plan. However, an accredited inspector shall identify whether material that was nonfriable has become friable since that previous inspection and shall assess the newly-friable ACBM under § 763.88.
(3) Based on sampling records and inspection records, an accredited inspector has determined that no ACBM is present in the homogeneous or sampling area and the records show that the area was sampled, before December 14, 1987 in substantial compliance with § 763.85(a), which for purposes of this section means in a random manner and with a sufficient number of samples to reasonably ensure that the area is not ACBM.
(i) The accredited inspector shall sign and date a statement, with his or her State of accreditation and if applicable, accreditation number that the homogeneous or sampling area determined not to be ACBM was sampled in substantial compliance with § 763.85(a).
(ii) Within 30 days after the inspector's determination, the local education agency shall submit a copy of the inspector's statement to the EPA Regional Office and shall include the statement in the management plan for that school.
(4) The lead agency responsible for asbestos inspection in a State that has been granted a waiver from § 763.85(a) has determined that, based on sampling records and inspection records, no ACBM is present in the homogeneous or sampling area and the records show that the area was sampled before December 14, 1987, in substantial compliance with § 763.85(a). Such determination shall be included in the management plan for that school.
(5) An accredited inspector has determined that, based on records of an inspection conducted before December 14, 1987, suspected ACBM identified in that homogeneous or sampling area is assumed to be ACM. The inspector shall sign and date a statement to that effect, with his or her State of accreditation and if applicable, accreditation number and, within 30 days of such determination, submit a copy of the statement to the person designated under § 763.84 for inclusion in the management plan. However, an accredited inspector shall identify whether material that was nonfriable suspected ACBM assumed to be ACM has become friable since the previous inspection and shall assess the newly friable material and previously identified friable suspected ACBM assumed to be ACM under § 763.88.
(6) Based on inspection records and contractor and clearance records, an accredited inspector has determined that no ACBM is present in the homogeneous or sampling area where asbestos removal operations have been conducted before December 14, 1987, and shall sign and date a statement to that effect and include his or her State of
accreditation and, if applicable, accreditation number. The local education agency shall submit a copy of the statement to the EPA Regional Office and shall include the statement in the management plan for that school.
(7) An architect or project engineer responsible for the construction of a new school building built after October 12, 1988, or an accredited inspector signs a statement that no ACBM was specified as a building material in any construction document for the building, or, to the best of his or her knowledge, no ACBM was used as a building material in the building. The local education agency shall submit a copy of the signed statement of the architect, project engineer, or accredited inspector to the EPA Regional Office and shall include the statement in the management plan for that school.

The local education agency shall conduct an inspection under § 763.85(a) of all areas inspected before October 17, 1987, that were not sampled or were not assumed to be ACM.
(c) If ACBM is subsequently found in a homogeneous or sampling area of a local education agency that had been identified as receiving an exclusion by an accredited inspector under paragraphs (a) (3), (4), (5) of this section, or an architect, project engineer or accredited inspector under paragraph (a)(7) of this section, the local education agency shall have 180 days following the date of identification of ACBM to comply with this subpart E.
Pt. 763, Subpt. E, App. A

# Appendix A to Subpart E of Part 763—Interim Transmission Electron Microscopy Analytical Methods—Mandatory and Nonmandatory—and Mandatory Section To Determine Completion of Response Actions

# I. Introduction
The following appendix contains three units. The first unit is the mandatory transmission electron microscopy (TEM) method which all laboratories must follow; it is the minimum requirement for analysis of air samples for asbestos by TEM. The mandatory method contains the essential elements of the TEM method. The second unit contains the complete non-mandatory method. The non-mandatory method supplements the mandatory method by including additional steps to improve the analysis. EPA recommends that the non-mandatory method be employed for analyzing air filters; however, the laboratory may choose to employ the mandatory method. The non-mandatory method contains the same minimum requirements as are outlined in the mandatory method. Hence, laboratories may choose either of the two methods for analyzing air samples by TEM.
The final unit of this Appendix A to subpart E defines the steps which must be taken to determine completion of response actions. This unit is mandatory.

# B. Sampling
1. The sampling agency must have written quality control procedures and documents which verify compliance.
2. Sampling operations must be performed by qualified individuals completely independent of the abatement contractor to avoid possible conflict of interest (References 1, 2, 3, and 5 of Unit II.J.).
3. Sampling for airborne asbestos following an abatement action must use commercially available cassettes.
4. Prescreen the loaded cassette collection filters to assure that they do not contain concentrations of asbestos which may interfere with the analysis of the sample. A filter blank average of less than 18 s/mm
2
in an area of 0.057 mm
2
(nominally 10 200-mesh grid openings) and a single preparation with a maximum of 53 s/mm
2
for that same area is acceptable for this method.
5. Use sample collection filters which are either polycarbonate having a pore size less than or equal to 0.4 µm or mixed cellulose ester having a pore size less than or equal to 0.45 µm.
6. Place these filters in series with a 5.0 µm backup filter (to serve as a diffuser) and a support pad. See the following Figure 1:
EC01AP92.001
7. Reloading of used cassettes is not permitted.
8. Orient the cassette downward at approximately 45 degrees from the horizontal.
9. Maintain a log of all pertinent sampling information.
10. Calibrate sampling pumps and their flow indicators over the range of their intended use with a recognized standard. Assemble the sampling system with a representative filter (not the filter which will be used in sampling) before and after the sampling operation.
11. Record all calibration information.
12. Ensure that the mechanical vibrations from the pump will be minimized to prevent transferral of vibration to the cassette.
13. Ensure that a continuous smooth flow of negative pressure is delivered by the pump by damping out any pump action fluctuations if necessary.
14. The final plastic barrier around the abatement area remains in place for the sampling period.
15. After the area has passed a thorough visual inspection, use aggressive sampling conditions to dislodge any remaining dust. (See suggested protocol in Unit III.B.7.d.)
16. Select an appropriate flow rate equal to or greater than 1 liter per minute (L/min) or less than 10 L/min for 25 mm cassettes. Larger filters may be operated at proportionally higher flow rates.
17. A minimum of 13 samples are to be collected for each testing site consisting of the following:
a. A minimum of five samples per abatement area.
b. A minimum of five samples per ambient area positioned at locations representative of the air entering the abatement site.
c. Two field blanks are to be taken by removing the cap for not more than 30 seconds and replacing it at the time of sampling before sampling is initiated at the following places:
i. Near the entrance to each abatement area.
ii. At one of the ambient sites. (DO NOT leave the field blanks open during the sampling period.)
d. A sealed blank is to be carried with each sample set. This representative cassette is not to be opened in the field.
18. Perform a leak check of the sampling system at each indoor and outdoor sampling site by activating the pump with the closed sampling cassette in line. Any flow indicates a leak which must be eliminated before initiating the sampling operation.
19. The following Table I specifies volume ranges to be used:
EC01AP92.002
20. Ensure that the sampler is turned upright before interrupting the pump flow.
21. Check that all samples are clearly labeled and that all pertinent information has been enclosed before transfer of the samples to the laboratory.
22. Ensure that the samples are stored in a secure and representative location.
23. Do not change containers if portions of these filters are taken for other purposes.
24. A summary of Sample Data Quality Objectives is shown in the following Table II:
EC01AP92.003

# C. Sample Shipment
Ship bulk samples to the analytical laboratory in a separate container from air samples.

# D. Sample Receiving
1. Designate one individual as sample coordinator at the laboratory. While that individual will normally be available to receive samples, the coordinator may train and supervise others in receiving procedures for those times when he/she is not available.
2. Bulk samples and air samples delivered to the analytical laboratory in the same container shall be rejected.

# E. Sample Preparation
1. All sample preparation and analysis shall be performed by a laboratory independent of the abatement contractor.
2. Wet-wipe the exterior of the cassettes to minimize contamination possibilities before taking them into the clean room facility.
3. Perform sample preparation in a well-equipped clean facility.

# Note:
The clean area is required to have the following minimum characteristics. The area or hood must be capable of maintaining a positive pressure with make-up air being HEPA-filtered. The cumulative analytical blank concentration must average less than 18 s/mm
2
in an area of 0.057 mm
2
(nominally 10 200-mesh grid openings) and a single preparation with a maximum of 53 s/mm
2
for that same area.
4. Preparation areas for air samples must not only be separated from preparation areas for bulk samples, but they must be prepared in separate rooms.
5. Direct preparation techniques are required. The object is to produce an intact film containing the particulates of the filter surface which is sufficiently clear for TEM analysis.
a. TEM Grid Opening Area measurement must be done as follows:
i. The filter portion being used for sample preparation must have the surface collapsed using an acetone vapor technique.
ii. Measure 20 grid openings on each of 20 random 200-mesh copper grids by placing a grid on a glass and examining it under the PCM. Use a calibrated graticule to measure the average field diameters. From the data, calculate the field area for an average grid opening.
iii. Measurements can also be made on the TEM at a properly calibrated low magnification or on an optical microscope at a magnification of approximately 400X by using an eyepiece fitted with a scale that has been calibrated against a stage micrometer. Optical microscopy utilizing manual or automated procedures may be used providing instrument calibration can be verified.
b. TEM specimen preparation from polycarbonate (PC) filters. Procedures as described in Unit III.G. or other equivalent methods may be used.
c. TEM specimen preparation from mixed cellulose ester (MCE) filters.
i. Filter portion being used for sample preparation must have the surface collapsed using an acetone vapor technique or the Burdette procedure (Ref. 7 of Unit II.J.)
ii. Plasma etching of the collapsed filter is required. The microscope slide to which the collapsed filter pieces are attached is placed in a plasma asher. Because plasma ashers vary greatly in their performance, both from unit to unit and between different positions in the asher chamber, it is difficult to specify the conditions that should be used. Insufficient etching will result in a failure to expose embedded filters, and too much etching may result in loss of particulate from the surface. As an interim measure, it is recommended that the time for ashing of a
known weight of a collapsed filter be established and that the etching rate be calculated in terms of micrometers per second. The actual etching time used for the particulate asher and operating conditions will then be set such that a 1-2 µm (10 percent) layer of collapsed surface will be removed.
iii. Procedures as described in Unit III. or other equivalent methods may be used to prepare samples.

# F. TEM Method
1. An 80-120 kV TEM capable of performing electron diffraction with a fluorescent screen inscribed with calibrated gradations is required. If the TEM is equipped with EDXA it must either have a STEM attachment or be capable of producing a spot less than 250 nm in diameter at crossover. The microscope shall be calibrated routinely for magnification and camera constant.
2.
Determination of Camera Constant and ED Pattern Analysis.
The camera length of the TEM in ED operating mode must be calibrated before ED patterns on unknown samples are observed. This can be achieved by using a carbon-coated grid on which a thin film of gold has been sputtered or evaporated. A thin film of gold is evaporated on the specimen TEM grid to obtain zone-axis ED patterns superimposed with a ring pattern from the polycrystalline gold film. In practice, it is desirable to optimize the thickness of the gold film so that only one or two sharp rings are obtained on the superimposed ED pattern. Thicker gold film would normally give multiple gold rings, but it will tend to mask weaker diffraction spots from the unknown fibrous particulate. Since the unknown d-spacings of most interest in asbestos analysis are those which lie closest to the transmitted beam, multiple gold rings are unnecessary on zone-axis ED patterns. An average camera constant using multiple gold rings can be determined. The camera constant is one-half the diameter of the rings times the interplanar spacing of the ring being measured.
3.
Magnification Calibration.
The magnification calibration must be done at the fluorescent screen. The TEM must be calibrated at the grid opening magnification (if used) and also at the magnification used for fiber counting. This is performed with a cross grating replica (e.g., one containing 2,160 lines/mm). Define a field of view on the fluorescent screen either by markings or physical boundaries. The field of view must be measurable or previously inscribed with a scale or concentric circles (all scales should be metric). A logbook must be maintained, and the dates of calibration and the values obtained must be recorded. The frequency of calibration depends on the past history of the particular microscope. After any maintenance of the microscope that involved adjustment of the power supplied to the lenses or the high-voltage system or the mechanical disassembly of the electron optical column apart from filament exchange, the magnification must be recalibrated. Before the TEM calibration is performed, the analyst must ensure that the cross grating replica is placed at the same distance from the objective lens as the specimens are. For instruments that incorporate a eucentric tilting specimen stage, all specimens and the cross grating replica must be placed at the eucentric position.
4. While not required on every microscope in the laboratory, the laboratory must have either one microscope equipped with energy dispersive X-ray analysis or access to an equivalent system on a TEM in another laboratory.
5. Microscope settings: 80-120 kV, grid assessment 250-1,000X, then 15,000-20,000X screen magnification for analysis.
6. Approximately one-half (0.5) of the predetermined sample area to be analyzed shall be performed on one sample grid preparation and the remaining half on a second sample grid preparation.
7. Individual grid openings with greater than 5 percent openings (holes) or covered with greater than 25 percent particulate matter or obviously having nonuniform loading must not be analyzed.
8. Reject the grid if:
a. Less than 50 percent of the grid openings covered by the replica are intact.
b. The replica is doubled or folded.
c. The replica is too dark because of incomplete dissolution of the filter.
9.
Recording Rules.
a. Any continuous grouping of particles in which an asbestos fiber with an aspect ratio greater than or equal to 5:1 and a length greater than or equal to 0.5 µm is detected shall be recorded on the count sheet. These will be designated asbestos structures and will be classified as fibers, bundles, clusters, or matrices. Record as individual fibers any contiguous grouping having 0, 1, or 2 definable intersections. Groupings having more than 2 intersections are to be described as cluster or matrix. An intersection is a nonparallel touching or crossing of fibers, with the projection having an aspect ratio of 5:1 or greater. See the following Figure 2:
EC01AP92.004
EC01AP92.005
i.
Fiber.
A structure having a minimum length greater than or equal to 0.5 µm and an aspect ratio (length to width) of 5:1 or greater and substantially parallel sides. Note the appearance of the end of the fiber, i.e., whether it is flat, rounded or dovetailed.
ii.
Bundle.
A structure composed of three or more fibers in a parallel arrangement with each fiber closer than one fiber diameter.
iii.
Cluster.
A structure with fibers in a random arrangement such that all fibers are intermixed and no single fiber is isolated from the group. Groupings must have more than two intersections.
iv.
Matrix.
Fiber or fibers with one end free and the other end embedded in or hidden by a particulate. The exposed fiber must meet the fiber definition.
b. Separate categories will be maintained for fibers less than 5 µm and for fibers equal to or greater than 5 µm in length.
c. Record NSD when no structures are detected in the field.
d. Visual identification of electron diffraction (ED) patterns is required for each asbestos structure counted which would cause the
analysis to exceed the 70 s/mm
2
concentration. (Generally this means the first four fibers identified as asbestos must exhibit an identifiable diffraction pattern for chrysotile or amphibole.)
e. The micrograph number of the recorded diffraction patterns must be reported to the client and maintained in the laboratory's quality assurance records. In the event that examination of the pattern by a qualified individual indicates that the pattern has been misidentified visually, the client shall be contacted.
f. Energy Dispersive X-ray Analysis (EDXA) is required of all amphiboles which would cause the analysis results to exceed the 70 s/mm
2
concentration. (Generally speaking, the first 4 amphiboles would require EDXA.)
g. If the number of fibers in the nonasbestos class would cause the analysis to exceed the 70 s/mm
2
concentration, the fact that they are not asbestos must be confirmed by EDXA or measurement of a zone axis diffraction pattern.
h. Fibers classified as chrysotile must be identified by diffraction or X-ray analysis and recorded on a count sheet. X-ray analysis alone can be used only after 70 s/mm
2
have been exceeded for a particular sample.
i. Fibers classified as amphiboles must be identified by X-ray analysis and electron diffraction and recorded on the count sheet. (X-ray analysis alone can be used only after 70 s/mm
2
have been exceeded for a particular sample.)
j. If a diffraction pattern was recorded on film, record the micrograph number on the count sheet.
k. If an electron diffraction was attempted but no pattern was observed, record N on the count sheet.
l. If an EDXA spectrum was attempted but not observed, record N on the count sheet.
m. If an X-ray analysis spectrum is stored, record the file and disk number on the count sheet.
10. Classification Rules.
a.
Fiber.
A structure having a minimum length greater than or equal to 0.5 µm and an aspect ratio (length to width) of 5:1 or greater and substantially parallel sides. Note the appearance of the end of the fiber, i.e., whether it is flat, rounded or dovetailed.
b.
Bundle.
A structure composed of three or more fibers in a parallel arrangement with each fiber closer than one fiber diameter.
c.
Cluster.
A structure with fibers in a random arrangement such that all fibers are intermixed and no single fiber is isolated from the group. Groupings must have more than two intersections.
d.
Matrix.
Fiber or fibers with one end free and the other end embedded in or hidden by a particulate. The exposed fiber must meet the fiber definition.
11. After finishing with a grid, remove it from the microscope, and replace it in the appropriate grid holder. Sample grids must be stored for a minimum of 1 year from the date of the analysis; the sample cassette must be retained for a minimum of 30 days by the laboratory or returned at the client's request.

# G. Sample Analytical Sequence
1. Under the present sampling requirements a minimum of 13 samples is to be collected for the clearance testing of an abatement site. These include five abatement area samples, five ambient samples, two field blanks, and one sealed blank.
2. Carry out visual inspection of work site prior to air monitoring.
3. Collect a minimum of 5 air samples inside the work site and 5 samples outside the work site. The indoor and outdoor samples shall be taken during the same time period.
4. Remaining steps in the analytical sequence are contained in Unit IV of this Appendix.

# H. Reporting
1. The following information must be reported to the client for each sample analyzed:
a. Concentration in structures per square millimeter and structures per cubic centimeter.
b. Analytical sensitivity used for the analysis.
c. Number of asbestos structures.
d. Area analyzed.
e. Volume of air sampled (which must be initially supplied to lab by client).
f. Copy of the count sheet must be included with the report.
g. Signature of laboratory official to indicate that the laboratory met specifications of the method.
h. Report form must contain official laboratory identification (e.g., letterhead).
i. Type of asbestos.

# I. Quality Control/Quality Assurance Procedures (Data Quality Indicators)
Monitoring the environment for airborne asbestos requires the use of sensitive sampling and analysis procedures. Because the test is sensitive, it may be influenced by a variety of factors. These include the supplies used in the sampling operation, the performance of the sampling, the preparation of the grid from the filter and the actual examination of this grid in the microscope. Each of these unit operations must produce a product of defined quality if the analytical result is to be a reliable and meaningful test result. Accordingly, a series of control checks and reference standards are to be performed along with the sample analysis as indicators that the materials used are adequate and the
operations are within acceptable limits. In this way, the quality of the data is defined and the results are of known value. These checks and tests also provide timely and specific warning of any problems which might develop within the sampling and analysis operations. A description of these quality control/quality assurance procedures is summarized in the following Table III:
EC01AP92.006
1. When the samples arrive at the laboratory, check the samples and documentation for completeness and requirements before initiating the analysis.
2. Check all laboratory reagents and supplies for acceptable asbestos background levels.
3. Conduct all sample preparation in a clean room environment monitored by laboratory blanks. Testing with blanks must also be done after cleaning or servicing the room.
4. Prepare multiple grids of each sample.
5. Provide laboratory blanks with each sample batch. Maintain a cumulative average of these results. If there are more than 53 fibers/mm
2
per 10 200-mesh grid openings, the system must be checked for possible sources of contamination.
6. Perform a system check on the transmission electron microscope daily.
7. Make periodic performance checks of magnification, electron diffraction and energy dispersive X-ray systems as set forth in Table III under Unit II.I.
8. Ensure qualified operator performance by evaluation of replicate analysis and standard sample comparisons as set forth in Table III under Unit II.I.
9. Validate all data entries.
10. Recalculate a percentage of all computations and automatic data reduction steps as specified in Table III under Unit II.I.
11. Record an electron diffraction pattern of one asbestos structure from every five samples that contain asbestos. Verify the identification of the pattern by measurement or comparison of the pattern with patterns collected from standards under the same conditions. The records must also demonstrate that the identification of the pattern has been verified by a qualified individual and that the operator who made the identification is maintaining at least an 80 percent correct visual identification based on his measured patterns.
12. Appropriate logs or records must be maintained by the analytical laboratory verifying that it is in compliance with the mandatory quality assurance procedures.

# B. Sampling
1. Sampling operations must be performed by qualified individuals completely independent of the abatement contractor to avoid possible conflict of interest (See References 1, 2, and 5 of Unit III.L.) Special precautions should be taken to avoid contamination of the sample. For example, materials that have not been prescreened for their asbestos background content should not be used; also, sample handling procedures which do not take cross contamination possibilities into account should not be used.
2. Material and supply checks for asbestos contamination should be made on all critical supplies, reagents, and procedures before their use in a monitoring study.
3. Quality control and quality assurance steps are needed to identify problem areas and isolate the cause of the contamination (see Reference 5 of Unit III.L.). Control checks shall be permanently recorded to document the quality of the information produced. The sampling firm must have written quality control procedures and documents which verify compliance. Independent audits by a qualified consultant or firm should be performed once a year. All documentation of compliance should be retained indefinitely to provide a guarantee of quality. A summary of Sample Data Quality Objectives is shown in Table II of Unit II.B.
4. Sampling materials.
a. Sample for airborne asbestos following an abatement action using commercially available cassettes.
b. Use either a cowling or a filter-retaining middle piece. Conductive material may reduce the potential for particulates to adhere to the walls of the cowl.
c. Cassettes must be verified as “clean” prior to use in the field. If packaged filters are used for loading or preloaded cassettes are purchased from the manufacturer or a distributor, the manufacturer's name and lot number should be entered on all field data sheets provided to the laboratory, and are required to be listed on all reports from the laboratory.
d. Assemble the cassettes in a clean facility (See definition of clean area under Unit III.A.).
e. Reloading of used cassettes is not permitted.
f. Use sample collection filters which are either polycarbonate having a pore size of less than or equal to 0.4 µm or mixed cellulose ester having a pore size of less than or equal to 0.45 µm.
g. Place these filters in series with a backup filter with a pore size of 5.0 µm (to serve as a diffuser) and a support pad. See the following Figure 1:
EC01AP92.007
h. When polycarbonate filters are used, position the highly reflective face such that the incoming particulate is received on this surface.
i. Seal the cassettes to prevent leakage around the filter edges or between cassette part joints. A mechanical press may be useful to achieve a reproducible leak-free seal.
Shrink fit gel-bands may be used for this purpose and are available from filter manufacturers and their authorized distributors.
j. Use wrinkle-free loaded cassettes in the sampling operation.
5. Pump setup.
a. Calibrate the sampling pump over the range of flow rates and loads anticipated for the monitoring period with this flow measuring device in series. Perform this calibration using guidance from EPA Method 2A each time the unit is sent to the field (See Reference 6 of Unit III.L.).
b. Configure the sampling system to preclude pump vibrations from being transmitted to the cassette by using a sampling stand separate from the pump station and making connections with flexible tubing.
c. Maintain continuous smooth flow conditions by damping out any pump action fluctuations if necessary.
d. Check the sampling system for leaks with the end cap still in place and the pump operating before initiating sample collection. Trace and stop the source of any flow indicated by the flowmeter under these conditions.
e. Select an appropriate flow rate equal to or greater than 1 L/min or less than 10 L/min for 25 mm cassettes. Larger filters may be operated at proportionally higher flow rates.
f. Orient the cassette downward at approximately 45 degrees from the horizontal.
g. Maintain a log of all pertinent sampling information, such as pump identification number, calibration data, sample location, date, sample identification number, flow rates at the beginning, middle, and end, start and stop times, and other useful information or comments. Use of a sampling log form is recommended. See the following Figure 2:
EC01AP92.008
h. Initiate a chain of custody procedure at the start of each sampling, if this is requested by the client.
i. Maintain a close check of all aspects of the sampling operation on a regular basis.
j. Continue sampling until at least the minimum volume is collected, as specified in the following Table I:
EC01AP92.009
k. At the conclusion of sampling, turn the cassette upward before stopping the flow to minimize possible particle loss. If the sampling is resumed, restart the flow before reorienting the cassette downward. Note the condition of the filter at the conclusion of sampling.
l. Double check to see that all information has been recorded on the data collection forms and that the cassette is securely closed and appropriately identified using a waterproof label. Protect cassettes in individual clean resealed polyethylene bags. Bags are to be used for storing cassette caps when they are removed for sampling purposes. Caps and plugs should only be removed or replaced using clean hands or clean disposable plastic gloves.
m. Do not change containers if portions of these filters are taken for other purposes.
6. Minimum sample number per site. A minimum of 13 samples are to be collected for each testing consisting of the following:
a. A minimum of five samples per abatement area.
b. A minimum of five samples per ambient area positioned at locations representative of the air entering the abatement site.
c. Two field blanks are to be taken by removing the cap for not more than 30 sec and replacing it at the time of sampling before sampling is initiated at the following places:
i. Near the entrance to each ambient area.
ii. At one of the ambient sites.

# (Note:
Do not leave the blank open during the sampling period.)
d. A sealed blank is to be carried with each sample set. This representative cassette is not to be opened in the field.
7. Abatement area sampling.
a. Conduct final clearance sampling only after the primary containment barriers have been removed; the abatement area has been thoroughly dried; and, it has passed visual inspection tests by qualified personnel. (See Reference 1 of Unit III.L.)
b. Containment barriers over windows, doors, and air passageways must remain in place until the TEM clearance sampling and analysis is completed and results meet clearance test criteria. The final plastic barrier remains in place for the sampling period.
c. Select sampling sites in the abatement area on a random basis to provide unbiased and representative samples.
d. After the area has passed a thorough visual inspection, use aggressive sampling conditions to dislodge any remaining dust.
i. Equipment used in aggressive sampling such as a leaf blower and/or fan should be properly cleaned and decontaminated before use.
ii. Air filtration units shall remain on during the air monitoring period.
iii. Prior to air monitoring, floors, ceiling and walls shall be swept with the exhaust of a minimum one (1) horsepower leaf blower.
iv. Stationary fans are placed in locations which will not interfere with air monitoring equipment. Fan air is directed toward the ceiling. One fan shall be used for each 10,000 ft
3
of worksite.
v. Monitoring of an abatement work area with high-volume pumps and the use of circulating fans will require electrical power. Electrical outlets in the abatement area may be used if available. If no such outlets are available, the equipment must be supplied with electricity by the use of extension cords and strip plug units. All electrical power supply equipment of this type must be approved Underwriter Laboratory equipment that has not been modified. All wiring must be grounded. Ground fault interrupters should be used. Extreme care must be taken to clean up any residual water and ensure that electrical equipment does not become wet while operational.
vi. Low volume pumps may be carefully wrapped in 6-mil polyethylene to insulate the pump from the air. High volume pumps cannot be sealed in this manner since the heat of the motor may melt the plastic. The pump exhausts should be kept free.
vii. If recleaning is necessary, removal of this equipment from the work area must be handled with care. It is not possible to completely decontaminate the pump motor and parts since these areas cannot be wetted. To minimize any problems in this area, all equipment such as fans and pumps should be carefully wet wiped prior to removal from the abatement area. Wrapping and sealing low volume pumps in 6-mil polyethylene will provide easier decontamination of this equipment. Use of clean water and disposable wipes should be available for this purpose.
e. Pump flow rate equal to or greater than 1 L/min or less than 10 L/min may be used for 25 mm cassettes. The larger cassette diameters may have comparably increased flow.
f. Sample a volume of air sufficient to ensure the minimum quantitation limits. (See Table I of Unit III.B.5.j.)
8. Ambient sampling.
a. Position ambient samplers at locations representative of the air entering the abatement site. If makeup air entering the abatement site is drawn from another area of the building which is outside of the abatement area, place the pumps in the building, pumps should be placed out of doors located near the building and away from any obstructions that may influence wind patterns. If construction is in progress immediately outside the enclosure, it may be necessary to select another ambient site. Samples should be representative of any air entering the work site.
b. Locate the ambient samplers at least 3 ft apart and protect them from adverse weather conditions.
c. Sample same volume of air as samples taken inside the abatement site.

# C. Sample Shipment
1. Ship bulk samples in a separate container from air samples. Bulk samples and air samples delivered to the analytical laboratory in the same container shall be rejected.
2. Select a rigid shipping container and pack the cassettes upright in a noncontaminating nonfibrous medium such as a bubble pack. The use of resealable polyethylene bags may help to prevent jostling of individual cassettes.
3. Avoid using expanded polystyrene because of its static charge potential. Also avoid using particle-based packaging materials because of possible contamination.
4. Include a shipping bill and a detailed listing of samples shipped, their descriptions
and all identifying numbers or marks, sampling data, shipper's name, and contact information. For each sample set, designate which are the ambient samples, which are the abatement area samples, which are the field blanks, and which is the sealed blank if sequential analysis is to be performed.
5. Hand-carry samples to the laboratory in an upright position if possible; otherwise choose that mode of transportation least likely to jar the samples in transit.
6. Address the package to the laboratory sample coordinator by name when known and alert him or her of the package description, shipment mode, and anticipated arrival as part of the chain of custody and sample tracking procedures. This will also help the laboratory schedule timely analysis for the samples when they are received.

# D. Quality Control/Quality Assurance Procedures (Data Quality Indicators)
Monitoring the environment for airborne asbestos requires the use of sensitive sampling and analysis procedures. Because the test is sensitive, it may be influenced by a variety of factors. These include the supplies used in the sampling operation, the performance of the sampling, the preparation of the grid from the filter and the actual examination of this grid in the microscope. Each of these unit operations must produce a product of defined quality if the analytical result is to be a reliable and meaningful test result. Accordingly, a series of control checks and reference standards is performed along with the sample analysis as indicators that the materials used are adequate and the operations are within acceptable limits. In this way, the quality of the data is defined, and the results are of known value. These checks and tests also provide timely and specific warning of any problems which might develop within the sampling and analysis operations. A description of these quality control/quality assurance procedures is summarized in the text below.
1. Prescreen the loaded cassette collection filters to assure that they do not contain concentrations of asbestos which may interfere with the analysis of the sample. A filter blank average of less than 18 s/mm
2
in an area of 0.057 mm
2
(nominally 10 200-mesh grid openings) and a maximum of 53 s/mm
2
for that same area for any single preparation is acceptable for this method.
2. Calibrate sampling pumps and their flow indicators over the range of their intended use with a recognized standard. Assemble the sampling system with a representative filter—not the filter which will be used in sampling—before and after the sampling operation.
3. Record all calibration information with the data to be used on a standard sampling form.
4. Ensure that the samples are stored in a secure and representative location.
5. Ensure that mechanical calibrations from the pump will be minimized to prevent transferral of vibration to the cassette.
6. Ensure that a continuous smooth flow of negative pressure is delivered by the pump by installing a damping chamber if necessary.
7. Open a loaded cassette momentarily at one of the indoor sampling sites when sampling is initiated. This sample will serve as an indoor field blank.
8. Open a loaded cassette momentarily at one of the outdoor sampling sites when sampling is initiated. This sample will serve as an outdoor field blank.
9. Carry a sealed blank into the field with each sample series. Do not open this cassette in the field.
10. Perform a leak check of the sampling system at each indoor and outdoor sampling site by activating the pump with the closed sampling cassette in line. Any flow indicates a leak which must be eliminated before initiating the sampling operation.
11. Ensure that the sampler is turned upright before interrupting the pump flow.
12. Check that all samples are clearly labeled and that all pertinent information has been enclosed before transfer of the samples to the laboratory.

# E. Sample Receiving
1. Designate one individual as sample coordinator at the laboratory. While that individual will normally be available to receive samples, the coordinator may train and supervise others in receiving procedures for those times when he/she is not available.
2. Adhere to the following procedures to ensure both the continued chain-of-custody and the accountability of all samples passing through the laboratory:
a. Note the condition of the shipping package and data written on it upon receipt.
b. Retain all bills of lading or shipping slips to document the shipper and delivery time.
c. Examine the chain-of-custody seal, if any, and the package for its integrity.
d. If there has been a break in the seal or substantive damage to the package, the sample coordinator shall immediately notify the shipper and a responsible laboratory manager before any action is taken to unpack the shipment.
e. Packages with significant damage shall be accepted only by the responsible laboratory manager after discussions with the client.
3. Unwrap the shipment in a clean, uncluttered facility. The sample coordinator or his or her designee will record the contents, including a description of each item and all identifying numbers or marks. A
Sample Receiving Form to document this information is attached for use when necessary. (See the following Figure 3.)
EC01AP92.010

# Note:
The person breaking the chain-of-custody seal and itemizing the contents assumes responsibility for the shipment and signs documents accordingly.
4. Assign a laboratory number and schedule an analysis sequence.
5. Manage all chain-of-custody samples within the laboratory such that their integrity can be ensured and documented.

# F. Sample Preparation
1. Personnel not affiliated with the Abatement Contractor shall be used to prepare samples and conduct TEM analysis. Wet-wipe the exterior of the cassettes to minimize contamination possibilities before taking them to the clean sample preparation facility.
2. Perform sample preparation in a well-equipped clean facility.

# Note:
The clean area is required to have the following minimum characteristics. The area or hood must be capable of maintaining a positive pressure with make-up air being HEPA filtered. The cumulative analytical blank concentration must average less than 18 s/mm
2
in an area of 0.057 s/mm
2
(nominally 10 200-mesh grid openings) with no more than one single preparation to exceed 53 s/mm
2
for that same area.
3. Preparation areas for air samples must be separated from preparation areas for bulk samples. Personnel must not prepare air samples if they have previously been preparing bulk samples without performing appropriate personal hygiene procedures, i.e., clothing change, showering, etc.
4.
Preparation.
Direct preparation techniques are required. The objective is to produce an intact carbon film containing the particulates from the filter surface which is sufficiently clear for TEM analysis. Currently recommended direct preparation procedures for polycarbonate (PC) and mixed cellulose ester (MCE) filters are described in Unit III.F.7. and 8. Sample preparation is a subject requiring additional research. Variation on those steps which do not substantively change the procedure, which improve filter clearing or which reduce contamination problems in a laboratory are permitted.
a. Use only TEM grids that have had grid opening areas measured according to directions in Unit III.J.
b. Remove the inlet and outlet plugs prior to opening the cassette to minimize any pressure differential that may be present.
c. Examples of techniques used to prepare polycarbonate filters are described in Unit III.F.7.
d. Examples of techniques used to prepare mixed cellulose ester filters are described in Unit III.F.8.
e. Prepare multiple grids for each sample.
f. Store the three grids to be measured in appropriately labeled grid holders or polyethylene capsules.
5. Equipment.
a. Clean area.
b. Tweezers. Fine-point tweezers for handling of filters and TEM grids.
c. Scalpel Holder and Curved No. 10 Surgical Blades.
d. Microscope slides.
e. Double-coated adhesive tape.
f. Gummed page reinforcements.
g. Micro-pipet with disposal tips 10 to 100 µL variable volume.
h. Vacuum coating unit with facilities for evaporation of carbon. Use of a liquid nitrogen cold trap above the diffusion pump will minimize the possibility of contamination of the filter surface by oil from the pumping system. The vacuum-coating unit can also be used for deposition of a thin film of gold.
i.
Carbon rod electrodes.
Spectrochemically pure carbon rods are required for use in the vacuum evaporator for carbon coating of filters.
j.
Carbon rod sharpener.
This is used to sharpen carbon rods to a neck. The use of necked carbon rods (or equivalent) allows the carbon to be applied to the filters with a minimum of heating.
k.
Low-temperature plasma asher.
This is used to etch the surface of collapsed mixed cellulose ester (MCE) filters. The asher should be supplied with oxygen, and should be modified as necessary to provide a throttle or bleed valve to control the speed of the vacuum to minimize disturbance of the filter. Some early models of ashers admit air too rapidly, which may disturb particulates on the surface of the filter during the etching step.
l.
Glass petri dishes, 10 cm in diameter, 1 cm high.
For prevention of excessive evaporation of solvent when these are in use, a good seal must be provided between the base and the lid. The seal can be improved by grinding the base and lid together with an abrasive grinding material.
m. Stainless steel mesh.
n. Lens tissue.
o. Copper 200-mesh TEM grids, 3 mm in diameter, or equivalent.
p. Gold 200-mesh TEM grids, 3 mm in diameter, or equivalent.
q. Condensation washer.
r. Carbon-coated, 200-mesh TEM grids, or equivalent.
s. Analytical balance, 0.1 mg sensitivity.
t. Filter paper, 9 cm in diameter.
u. Oven or slide warmer. Must be capable of maintaining a temperature of 65-70 °C.
v. Polyurethane foam, 6 mm thickness.
w. Gold wire for evaporation.
6. Reagents.
a.
General.
A supply of ultra-clean, fiber-free water must be available for washing of all components used in the analysis. Water
that has been distilled in glass or filtered or deionized water is satisfactory for this purpose. Reagents must be fiber-free.
b. Polycarbonate preparation method—chloroform.
c. Mixed Cellulose Ester (MCE) preparation method—acetone or the Burdette procedure (Ref. 7 of Unit III.L.).
7. TEM specimen preparation from polycarbonate filters.
a.
Specimen preparation laboratory.
It is most important to ensure that contamination of TEM specimens by extraneous asbestos fibers is minimized during preparation.
b. Cleaning of sample cassettes. Upon receipt at the analytical laboratory and before they are taken into the clean facility or laminar flow hood, the sample cassettes must be cleaned of any contamination adhering to the outside surfaces.
c. Preparation of the carbon evaporator. If the polycarbonate filter has already been carbon-coated prior to receipt, the carbon coating step will be omitted, unless the analyst believes the carbon film is too thin. If there is a need to apply more carbon, the filter will be treated in the same way as an uncoated filter. Carbon coating must be performed with a high-vacuum coating unit. Units that are based on evaporation of carbon filaments in a vacuum generated only by an oil rotary pump have not been evaluated for this application, and must not be used. The carbon rods should be sharpened by a carbon rod sharpener to necks of about 4 mm long and 1 mm in diameter. The rods are installed in the evaporator in such a manner that the points are approximately 10 to 12 cm from the surface of a microscope slide held in the rotating and tilting device.
d. Selection of filter area for carbon coating. Before preparation of the filters, a 75 mm × 50 mm microscope slide is washed and dried. This slide is used to support strips of filter during the carbon evaporation. Two parallel strips of double-sided adhesive tape are applied along the length of the slide. Polycarbonate filters are easily stretched during handling, and cutting of areas for further preparation must be performed with great care. The filter and the MCE backing filter are removed together from the cassette and placed on a cleaned glass microscope slide. The filter can be cut with a curved scalpel blade by rocking the blade from the point placed in contact with the filter. The process can be repeated to cut a strip approximately 3 mm wide across the diameter of the filter. The strip of polycarbonate filter is separated from the corresponding strip of backing filter and carefully placed so that it bridges the gap between the adhesive tape strips on the microscope slide. The filter strip can be held with fine-point tweezers and supported underneath by the scalpel blade during placement on the microscope slide. The analyst can place several such strips on the same microscope slide, taking care to rinse and wet-wipe the scalpel blade and tweezers before handling a new sample. The filter strips should be identified by etching the glass slide or marking the slide using a marker insoluble in water and solvents. After the filter strip has been cut from each filter, the residual parts of the filter must be returned to the cassette and held in position by reassembly of the cassette. The cassette will then be archived for a period of 30 days or returned to the client upon request.
e. Carbon coating of filter strips. The glass slide holding the filter strips is placed on the rotation-tilting device, and the evaporator chamber is evacuated. The evaporation must be performed in very short bursts, separated by some seconds to allow the electrodes to cool. If evaporation is too rapid, the strips of polycarbonate filter will begin to curl, which will lead to cross-linking of the surface material and make it relatively insoluble in chloroform. An experienced analyst can judge the thickness of carbon film to be applied, and some test should be made first on unused filters. If the film is too thin, large particles will be lost from the TEM specimen, and there will be few complete and undamaged grid openings on the specimen. If the coating is too thick, the filter will tend to curl when exposed to chloroform vapor and the carbon film may not adhere to the support mesh. Too thick a carbon film will also lead to a TEM image that is lacking in contrast, and the ability to obtain ED patterns will be compromised. The carbon film should be as thin as possible and remain intact on most of the grid openings of the TEM specimen intact.
f. Preparation of the Jaffe washer. The precise design of the Jaffe washer is not considered important, so any one of the published designs may be used. A washer consisting of a simple stainless steel bridge is recommended. Several pieces of lens tissue approximately 1.0 cm × 0.5 cm are placed on the stainless steel bridge, and the washer is filled with chloroform to a level where the meniscus contacts the underside of the mesh, which results in saturation of the lens tissue. See References 8 and 10 of Unit III.L.
g. Placing of specimens into the Jaffe washer. The TEM grids are first placed on a piece of lens tissue so that individual grids can be picked up with tweezers. Using a curved scalpel blade, the analyst excises three 3 mm square pieces of the carbon-coated polycarbonate filter from the filter strip. The three squares are selected from the center of the strip and from two points between the outer periphery of the active surface and the center. The piece of filter is placed on a TEM specimen grid with the shiny side of the TEM grid facing upwards, and the whole assembly is placed boldly onto the saturated lens tissue in the Jaffe washer. If carbon-coated grids are used, the filter should be
placed carbon-coated side down. The three excised squares of filters are placed on the same piece of lens tissue. Any number of separate pieces of lens tissue may be placed in the same Jaffe washer. The lid is then placed on the Jaffe washer, and the system is allowed to stand for several hours, preferably overnight.
h.
Condensation washing.
It has been found that many polycarbonate filters will not dissolve completely in the Jaffe washer, even after being exposed to chloroform for as long as 3 days. This problem becomes more serious if the surface of the filter was overheated during the carbon evaporation. The presence of undissolved filter medium on the TEM preparation leads to partial or complete obscuration of areas of the sample, and fibers that may be present in these areas of the specimen will be overlooked; this will lead to a low result. Undissolved filter medium also compromises the ability to obtain ED patterns. Before they are counted, TEM grids must be examined critically to determine whether they are adequately cleared of residual filter medium. It has been found that condensation washing of the grids after the initial Jaffe washer treatment, with chloroform as the solvent, clears all residual filter medium in a period of approximately 1 hour. In practice, the piece of lens tissue supporting the specimen grids is transferred to the cold finger of the condensation washer, and the washer is operated for about 1 hour. If the specimens are cleared satisfactorily by the Jaffe washer alone, the condensation washer step may be unnecessary.
8. TEM specimen preparation from MCE filters.
a. This method of preparing TEM specimens from MCE filters is similar to that specified in NIOSH Method 7402. See References 7, 8, and 9 of Unit III.L.
b. Upon receipt at the analytical laboratory, the sample cassettes must be cleaned of any contamination adhering to the outside surfaces before entering the clean sample preparation area.
c. Remove a section from any quadrant of the sample and blank filters.
d. Place the section on a clean microscope slide. Affix the filter section to the slide with a gummed paged reinforcement or other suitable means. Label the slide with a water and solvent-proof marking pen.
e. Place the slide in a petri dish which contains several paper filters soaked with 2 to 3 mL acetone. Cover the dish. Wait 2 to 4 minutes for the sample filter to fuse and clear.
f. Plasma etching of the collapsed filter is required.
i. The microscope slide to which the collapsed filter pieces are attached is placed in a plasma asher. Because plasma ashers vary greatly in their performance, both from unit to unit and between different positions in the asher chamber, it is difficult to specify the conditions that should be used. This is one area of the method that requires further evaluation. Insufficient etching will result in a failure to expose embedded filters, and too much etching may result in loss of particulate from the surface. As an interim measure, it is recommended that the time for ashing of a known weight of a collapsed filter be established and that the etching rate be calculated in terms of micrometers per second. The actual etching time used for a particular asher and operating conditions will then be set such that a 1-2 µm (10 percent) layer of collapsed surface will be removed.
ii. Place the slide containing the collapsed filters into a low-temperature plasma asher, and etch the filter.
g. Transfer the slide to a rotating stage inside the bell jar of a vacuum evaporator. Evaporate a 1 mm × 5 mm section of graphite rod onto the cleared filter. Remove the slide to a clean, dry, covered petri dish.
h. Prepare a second petri dish as a Jaffe washer with the wicking substrate prepared from filter or lens paper placed on top of a 6 mm thick disk of clean spongy polyurethane foam. Cut a V-notch on the edge of the foam and filter paper. Use the V-notch as a reservoir for adding solvent. The wicking substrate should be thin enough to fit into the petri dish without touching the lid.
i. Place carbon-coated TEM grids face up on the filter or lens paper. Label the grids by marking with a pencil on the filter paper or by putting registration marks on the petri dish lid and marking with a waterproof marker on the dish lid. In a fume hood, fill the dish with acetone until the wicking substrate is saturated. The level of acetone should be just high enough to saturate the filter paper without creating puddles.
j. Remove about a quarter section of the carbon-coated filter samples from the glass slides using a surgical knife and tweezers. Carefully place the section of the filter, carbon side down, on the appropriately labeled grid in the acetone-saturated petri dish. When all filter sections have been transferred, slowly add more solvent to the wedge-shaped trough to bring the acetone level up to the highest possible level without disturbing the sample preparations. Cover the petri dish. Elevate one side of the petri dish by placing a slide under it. This allows drops of condensed solvent vapors to form near the edge rather than in the center where they would drip onto the grid preparation.

# G. TEM Method
1.
Instrumentation.
a. Use an 80-120 kV TEM capable of performing electron diffraction with a fluorescent screen inscribed with calibrated gradations. If the TEM is equipped with EDXA it must either have a STEM attachment or be capable of producing a spot less than 250 nm
in diameter at crossover. The microscope shall be calibrated routinely (see Unit III.J.) for magnification and camera constant.
b. While not required on every microscope in the laboratory, the laboratory must have either one microscope equipped with energy dispersive X-ray analysis or access to an equivalent system on a TEM in another laboratory. This must be an Energy Dispersive X-ray Detector mounted on TEM column and associated hardware/software to collect, save, and read out spectral information. Calibration of Multi-Channel Analyzer shall be checked regularly for A1 at 1.48 KeV and Cu at 8.04 KeV, as well as the manufacturer's procedures.
i. Standard replica grating may be used to determine magnification (e.g., 2160 lines/mm).
ii. Gold standard may be used to determine camera constant.
c. Use a specimen holder with single tilt and/or double tilt capabilities.
2. Procedure.
a. Start a new Count Sheet for each sample to be analyzed. Record on count sheet: analyst's initials and date; lab sample number; client sample number microscope identification; magnification for analysis; number of predetermined grid openings to be analyzed; and grid identification. See the following Figure 4:
EC01AP92.011
b. Check that the microscope is properly aligned and calibrated according to the manufacturer's specifications and instructions.
c. Microscope settings: 80-120 kV, grid assessment 250-1000X, then 15,000-20,000X screen magnification for analysis.
d. Approximately one-half (0.5) of the predetermined sample area to be analyzed shall be performed on one sample grid preparation and the remaining half on a second sample grid preparation.
e. Determine the suitability of the grid.
i. Individual grid openings with greater than 5 percent openings (holes) or covered with greater than 25 percent particulate matter or obviously having nonuniform loading shall not be analyzed.
ii. Examine the grid at low magnification (
1000X) to determine its suitability for detailed study at higher magnifications.
iii. Reject the grid if:
(1) Less than 50 percent of the grid openings covered by the replica are intact.
(2) It is doubled or folded.
(3) It is too dark because of incomplete dissolution of the filter.
iv. If the grid is rejected, load the next sample grid.
v. If the grid is acceptable, continue on to Step 6 if mapping is to be used; otherwise proceed to Step 7.
f. Grid Map (Optional).
i. Set the TEM to the low magnification mode.
ii. Use flat edge or finder grids for mapping.
iii. Index the grid openings (fields) to be counted by marking the acceptable fields for one-half (0.5) of the area needed for analysis on each of the two grids to be analyzed. These may be marked just before examining each grid opening (field), if desired.
iv. Draw in any details which will allow the grid to be properly oriented if it is reloaded into the microscope and a particular field is to be reliably identified.
g. Scan the grid.
i. Select a field to start the examination.
ii. Choose the appropriate magnification (15,000 to 20,000X screen magnification).
iii. Scan the grid as follows.
(1) At the selected magnification, make a series of parallel traverses across the field. On reaching the end of one traverse, move the image one window and reverse the traverse.

# Note:
A slight overlap should be used so as not to miss any part of the grid opening (field).
(2) Make parallel traverses until the entire grid opening (field) has been scanned.
h. Identify each structure for appearance and size.
i. Appearance and size: Any continuous grouping of particles in which an asbestos fiber within aspect ratio greater than or equal to 5:1 and a length greater than or equal to 0.5 µm is detected shall be recorded on the count sheet. These will be designated asbestos structures and will be classified as fibers, bundles, clusters, or matrices. Record as individual fibers any contiguous grouping having 0, 1, or 2 definable intersections. Groupings having more than 2 intersections are to be described as cluster or matrix. See the following Figure 5:
EC01AP92.012
EC01AP92.013
An intersection is a non-parallel touching or crossing of fibers, with the projection having an aspect ratio of 5:1 or greater. Combinations such as a matrix and cluster, matrix and bundle, or bundle and cluster are categorized by the dominant fiber quality—cluster, bundle, and matrix, respectively. Separate categories will be maintained for fibers less than 5 µm and for fibers greater than or equal to 5 µm in length. Not required, but useful, may be to record the fiber length in 1 µm intervals. (Identify each structure morphologically and analyze it as it enters the “window”.)
(1)
Fiber.
A structure having a minimum length greater than 0.5 µm and an aspect ratio (length to width) of 5:1 or greater and substantially parallel sides. Note the appearance of the end of the fiber, i.e., whether it is flat, rounded or dovetailed, no intersections.
(2)
Bundle.
A structure composed of 3 or more fibers in a parallel arrangement with each fiber closer than one fiber diameter.
(3)
Cluster.
A structure with fibers in a random arrangement such that all fibers are intermixed and no single fiber is isolated from the group; groupings must have more than 2 intersections.
(4)
Matrix.
Fiber or fibers with one end free and the other end embedded in or hidden by a particulate. The exposed fiber must meet the fiber definition.
(5)
NSD.
Record NSD when no structures are detected in the field.
(6)
Intersection.
Non-parallel touching or crossing of fibers, with the projection having an aspect ratio 5:1 or greater.
ii. Structure Measurement.
(1) Recognize the structure that is to be sized.
(2) Memorize its location in the “window” relative to the sides, inscribed square and to other particulates in the field so this exact location can be found again when scanning is resumed.
(3) Measure the structure using the scale on the screen.
(4) Record the length category and structure type classification on the count sheet after the field number and fiber number.
(5) Return the fiber to its original location in the window and scan the rest of the field for other fibers; if the direction of travel is not remembered, return to the right side of the field and begin the traverse again.
i. Visual identification of Electron Diffraction (ED) patterns is required for each asbestos structure counted which would cause the analysis to exceed the 70 s/mm
2
concentration. (Generally this means the first four fibers identified as asbestos must exhibit an identifiable diffraction pattern for chrysotile or amphibole.)
i. Center the structure, focus, and obtain an ED pattern. (See Microscope Instruction Manual for more detailed instructions.)
ii. From a visual examination of the ED pattern, obtained with a short camera length, classify the observed structure as belonging to one of the following classifications: chrysotile, amphibole, or nonasbestos.
(1) Chrysotile: The chrysotile asbestos pattern has characteristic streaks on the layer lines other than the central line and some streaking also on the central line. There will be spots of normal sharpness on the central layer line and on alternate lines (2nd, 4th, etc.). The repeat distance between layer lines is 0.53 nm and the center doublet is at 0.73 nm. The pattern should display (002), (110), (130) diffraction maxima; distances and geometry should match a chrysotile pattern and be measured semiquantitatively.
(2) Amphibole Group [includes grunerite (amosite), crocidolite, anthophyllite, tremolite, and actinolite]: Amphibole asbestos fiber patterns show layer lines formed by very closely spaced dots, and the repeat distance between layer lines is also about 0.53 nm. Streaking in layer lines is occasionally present due to crystal structure defects.
(3) Nonasbestos: Incomplete or unobtainable ED patterns, a nonasbestos EDXA, or a nonasbestos morphology.
iii. The micrograph number of the recorded diffraction patterns must be reported to the client and maintained in the laboratory's quality assurance records. The records must also demonstrate that the identification of the pattern has been verified by a qualified individual and that the operator who made the identification is maintaining at least an 80 percent correct visual identification based on his measured patterns. In the event that examination of the pattern by the qualified individual indicates that the pattern had been misidentified visually, the client shall be contacted. If the pattern is a suspected chrysotile, take a photograph of the diffraction pattern at 0 degrees tilt. If the structure is suspected to be amphibole, the sample may have to be tilted to obtain a simple geometric array of spots.
j. Energy Dispersive X-Ray Analysis (EDXA).
i. Required of all amphiboles which would cause the analysis results to exceed the 70 s/mm
2
concentration. (Generally speaking, the first 4 amphiboles would require EDXA.)
ii. Can be used alone to confirm chrysotile after the 70 s/mm
2
concentration has been exceeded.
iii. Can be used alone to confirm all nonasbestos.
iv. Compare spectrum profiles with profiles obtained from asbestos standards. The closest match identifies and categorizes the structure.
v. If the EDXA is used for confirmation, record the properly labeled spectrum on a computer disk, or if a hard copy, file with analysis data.
vi. If the number of fibers in the nonasbestos class would cause the analysis to exceed the 70 s/mm
2
concentration, their identities must be confirmed by EDXA or measurement of a zone axis diffraction pattern to establish that the particles are nonasbestos.
k. Stopping Rules.
i. If more than 50 asbestiform structures are counted in a particular grid opening, the analysis may be terminated.
ii. After having counted 50 asbestiform structures in a minimum of 4 grid openings, the analysis may be terminated. The grid opening in which the 50th fiber was counted must be completed.
iii. For blank samples, the analysis is always continued until 10 grid openings have been analyzed.
iv. In all other samples the analysis shall be continued until an analytical sensitivity of 0.005 s/cm
3
is reached.
l. Recording Rules. The count sheet should contain the following information:
i. Field (grid opening): List field number.
ii. Record “NSD” if no structures are detected.
iii. Structure information.
(1) If fibers, bundles, clusters, and/or matrices are found, list them in consecutive numerical order, starting over with each field.

(5) Fibers classified as amphiboles must be identified by X-ray analysis and electron diffraction and recorded on the count sheet. (X-ray analysis alone can be used as sole identification only after 70s/mm
2
have been exceeded for a particular sample.)
(6) If a diffraction pattern was recorded on film, the micrograph number must be indicated on the count sheet.
(7) If an electron diffraction was attempted and an appropriate spectra is not observed, N should be recorded on the count sheet.

# J. Calibration Methodology

# Note:
Appropriate implementation of the method requires a person knowledgeable in electron diffraction and mineral identification by ED and EDXA. Those inexperienced laboratories wishing to develop capabilities may acquire necessary knowledge through analysis of appropriate standards and by following detailed methods as described in References 8 and 10 of Unit III.L.
1.
Equipment Calibration.
In this method, calibration is required for the air-sampling equipment and the transmission electron microscope (TEM).
a.
TEM Magnification.
The magnification at the fluorescent screen of the TEM must be calibrated at the grid opening magnification (if used) and also at the magnification used for fiber counting. This is performed with a cross grating replica. A logbook must be maintained, and the dates of calibration depend on the past history of the particular microscope; no frequency is specified. After any maintenance of the microscope that involved adjustment of the power supplied to the lenses or the high-voltage system or the mechanical disassembly of the electron optical column apart from filament exchange, the magnification must be recalibrated. Before the TEM calibration is performed, the analyst must ensure that the cross grating replica is placed at the same distance from the objective lens as the specimens are. For instruments that incorporate an eucentric tilting specimen stage, all speciments and the cross grating replica must be placed at the eucentric position.
b. Determination of the TEM magnification on the fluorescent screen.
i. Define a field of view on the fluorescent screen either by markings or physical boundaries. The field of view must be measurable or previously inscribed with a scale or concentric circles (all scales should be metric).
ii. Insert a diffraction grating replica (for example a grating containing 2,160 lines/mm) into the specimen holder and place into the microscope. Orient the replica so that the grating lines fall perpendicular to the scale on the TEM fluorescent screen. Ensure that the goniometer stage tilt is 0 degrees.
iii. Adjust microscope magnification to 10,000X or 20,000X. Measure the distance (mm) between two widely separated lines on the grating replica. Note the number of spaces between the lines. Take care to measure between the same relative positions on the lines (e.g., between left edges of lines).

# Note:
The more spaces included in the measurement, the more accurate the final calculation. On most microscopes, however, the magnification is substantially constant only within the central 8-10 cm diameter region of the fluorescent screen.
iv. Calculate the true magnification (M) on the fluorescent screen:
M = XG/Y
where:
X = total distance (mm) between the designated grating lines;
G = calibration constant of the grating replica (lines/mm):
Y = number of grating replica spaces counted along X.
c. Calibration of the EDXA System. Initially, the EDXA system must be calibrated by using two reference elements to calibrate the energy scale of the instrument. When this has been completed in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions, calibration in terms of the different types of asbestos can proceed. The EDXA detectors vary in both solid angle of detection and in window thickness. Therefore, at a particular accelerating voltage in use on the TEM, the count rate obtained from specific dimensions of fiber will vary both in absolute X-ray count rate and in the relative X-ray peak heights for different elements. Only a few minerals are relevant for asbestos abatement work, and in this procedure the calibration is specified in terms of a “fingerprint” technique. The EDXA spectra must be recorded from individual fibers of the relevant minerals, and identifications are made on the basis of semiquantitative comparisons with these reference spectra.
d. Calibration of Grid Openings.
i. Measure 20 grid openings on each of 20 random 200-mesh copper grids by placing a grid on a glass slide and examining it under the PCM. Use a calibrated graticule to measure the average field diameter and use this number to calculate the field area for an average grid opening. Grids are to be randomly selected from batches up to 1,000.

# Note:
A grid opening is considered as one field.
ii. The mean grid opening area must be measured for the type of specimen grids in use. This can be accomplished on the TEM at a properly calibrated low magnification or on an optical microscope at a magnification of approximately 400X by using an eyepiece fitted with a scale that has been calibrated against a stage micrometer. Optical microscopy utilizing manual or automated procedures may be used providing instrument calibration can be verified.
e. Determination of Camera Constant and ED Pattern Analysis.
i. The camera length of the TEM in ED operating mode must be calibrated before ED patterns on unknown samples are observed. This can be achieved by using a carbon-coated grid on which a thin film of gold has been
sputtered or evaporated. A thin film of gold is evaporated on the specimen TEM grid to obtain zone-axis ED patterns superimposed with a ring pattern from the polycrystalline gold film.
ii. In practice, it is desirable to optimize the thickness of the gold film so that only one or two sharp rings are obtained on the superimposed ED pattern. Thicker gold film would normally give multiple gold rings, but it will tend to mask weaker diffraction spots from the unknown fibrous particulates. Since the unknown d-spacings of most interest in asbestos analysis are those which lie closest to the transmitted beam, multiple gold rings are unnecessary on zone-axis ED patterns. An average camera constant using multiple gold rings can be determined. The camera constant is one-half the diameter, D, of the rings times the interplanar spacing, d, of the ring being measured.

# K. Quality Control/Quality Assurance Procedures (Data Quality Indicators)
Monitoring the environment for airborne asbestos requires the use of sensitive sampling and analysis procedures. Because the test is sensitive, it may be influenced by a variety of factors. These include the supplies used in the sampling operation, the performance of the sampling, the preparation of the grid from the filter and the actual examination of this grid in the microscope. Each of these unit operations must produce a product of defined quality if the analytical result is to be a reliable and meaningful test result. Accordingly, a series of control checks and reference standards is performed along with the sample analysis as indicators that the materials used are adequate and the operations are within acceptable limits. In this way, the quality of the data is defined and the results are of known value. These checks and tests also provide timely and specific warning of any problems which might develop within the sampling and analysis operations. A description of these quality control/quality assurance procedures is summarized in the following Table III:
EC01AP92.015
1. When the samples arrive at the laboratory, check the samples and documentation for completeness and requirements before initiating the analysis.
2. Check all laboratory reagents and supplies for acceptable asbestos background levels.
3. Conduct all sample preparation in a clean room environment monitored by laboratory blanks and special testing after cleaning or servicing the room.
4. Prepare multiple grids of each sample.
5. Provide laboratory blanks with each sample batch. Maintain a cumulative average of these results. If this average is greater than 53 f/mm
2
per 10 200-mesh grid openings, check the system for possible sources of contamination.
6. Check for recovery of asbestos from cellulose ester filters submitted to plasma asher.
7. Check for asbestos carryover in the plasma asher by including a blank alongside the positive control sample.
8. Perform a systems check on the transmission electron microscope daily.
9. Make periodic performance checks of magnification, electron diffraction and energy dispersive X-ray systems as set forth in Table III of Unit III.K.
10. Ensure qualified operator performance by evaluation of replicate counting, duplicate analysis, and standard sample comparisons as set forth in Table III of Unit III.K.
11. Validate all data entries.
12. Recalculate a percentage of all computations and automatic data reduction steps as specified in Table III.
13. Record an electron diffraction pattern of one asbestos structure from every five samples that contain asbestos. Verify the identification of the pattern by measurement or comparison of the pattern with patterns collected from standards under the same conditions.
The outline of quality control procedures presented above is viewed as the minimum required to assure that quality data is produced for clearance testing of an asbestos abated area. Additional information may be gained by other control tests. Specifics on those control procedures and options available for environmental testing can be obtained by consulting References 6, 7, and 11 of Unit III.L.

# IV. Mandatory Interpretation of Transmission Electron Microscopy Results To Determine Completion of Response Actions

# A. Introduction
A response action is determined to be completed by TEM when the abatement area has been cleaned and the airborne asbestos concentration inside the abatement area is no higher than concentrations at locations outside the abatement area. “Outside” means outside the abatement area, but not necessarily outside the building. EPA reasons that an asbestos removal contractor cannot be expected to clean an abatement area to an airborne asbestos concentration that is lower than the concentration of air entering the abatement area from outdoors or from other parts of the building. After the abatement area has passed a thorough visual inspection, and before the outer containment barrier is removed, a minimum of five air samples inside the abatement area and a minimum of five air samples outside the abatement area must be collected. Hence, the response action is determined to be completed when the average airborne asbestos concentration measured inside the abatement area is not statistically different from the average airborne asbestos concentration measured outside the abatement area.
The inside and outside concentrations are compared by the Z-test, a statistical test that takes into account the variability in the measurement process. A minimum of five samples inside the abatement area and five samples outside the abatement area are required to control the false negative error rate, i.e., the probability of declaring the removal complete when, in fact, the air concentration inside the abatement area is significantly higher than outside the abatement area. Additional quality control is provided by requiring three blanks (filters through which no air has been drawn) to be analyzed to check for unusually high filter contamination that would distort the test results.
When volumes greater than or equal to 1,199 L for a 25 mm filter and 2,799 L for a 37 mm filter have been collected and the average number of asbestos structures on samples inside the abatement area is no greater than 70 s/mm
2
of filter, the response action
may be considered complete without comparing the inside samples to the outside samples. EPA is permitting this initial screening test to save analysis costs in situations where the airborne asbestos concentration is sufficiently low so that it cannot be distinguished from the filter contamination/background level (fibers deposited on the filter that are unrelated to the air being sampled). The screening test cannot be used when volumes of less than 1,199 L for 25 mm filter or 2,799 L for a 37 mm filter are collected because the ability to distinguish levels significantly different from filter background is reduced at low volumes.
The initial screening test is expressed in structures per square millimeter of filter because filter background levels come from sources other than the air being sampled and cannot be meaningfully expressed as a concentration per cubic centimeter of air. The value of 70 s/mm
2
is based on the experience of the panel of microscopists who consider one structure in 10 grid openings (each grid opening with an area of 0.0057 mm
2
) to be comparable with contamination/background levels of blank filters. The decision is based, in part, on Poisson statistics which indicate that four structures must be counted on a filter before the fiber count is statistically distinguishable from the count for one structure. As more information on the performance of the method is collected, this criterion may be modified. Since different combinations of the number and size of grid openings are permitted under the TEM protocol, the criterion is expressed in structures per square millimeter of filter to be consistent across all combinations. Four structures per 10 grid openings corresponds to approximately 70 s/mm
2
.

# B. Sample Collection and Analysis
1. A minimum of 13 samples is required: five samples collected inside the abatement area, five samples collected outside the abatement area, two field blanks, and one sealed blank.
2. Sampling and TEM analysis must be done according to either the mandatory or nonmandatory protocols in Appendix A. At least 0.057 mm
2
of filter must be examined on blank filters.

# C. Interpretation of Results
1. The response action shall be considered complete if either:
a. Each sample collected inside the abatement area consists of at least 1,199 L of air for a 25 mm filter, or 2,799 L of air for a 37 mm filter, and the arithmetic mean of their asbestos structure concentrations per square millimeter of filter is less than or equal to 70 s/mm
2
; or
b. The three blank samples have an arithmetic mean of the asbestos structure concentration on the blank filters that is less than or equal to 70 s/mm
2
and the average airborne asbestos concentration measured inside the abatement area is not statistically higher than the average airborne asbestos concentration measured outside the abatement area as determined by the Z-test. The Z-test is carried out by calculating
EC01AP92.016
where Y
I
is the average of the natural logarithms of the inside samples and Y
O
is the average of the natural logarithms of the outside samples, n
I
is the number of inside samples and n
O
is the number of outside samples. The response action is considered complete if Z is less than or equal to 1.65.

# Note:
When no fibers are counted, the calculated detection limit for that analysis is inserted for the concentration.
2. If the abatement site does not satisfy either (1) or (2) of this Section C, the site must be recleaned and a new set of samples collected.

# D. Sequence for Analyzing Samples
It is possible to determine completion of the response action without analyzing all samples. Also, at any point in the process, a decision may be made to terminate the analysis of existing samples, reclean the abatement site, and collect a new set of samples. The following sequence is outlined to minimize the number of analyses needed to reach a decision.
1. Analyze the inside samples.
2. If at least 1,199 L of air for a 25 mm filter or 2,799 L of air for a 37 mm filter is collected for each inside sample and the arithmetic mean concentration of structures per square millimeter of filter is less than or equal to 70 s/mm
2
, the response action is complete and no further analysis is needed.
3. If less than 1,199 L of air for a 25 mm filter or 2,799 L of air for a 37 mm filter is collected for any of the inside samples, or the arithmetic mean concentration of structures per square millimeter of filter is greater than 70 s/mm
2
, analyze the three blanks.
4. If the arithmetic mean concentration of structures per square millimeter on the blank filters is greater than 70 s/mm
2
, terminate the analysis, identify and correct the source of blank contamination, and collect a new set of samples.
5. If the arithmetic mean concentration of structures per square millimeter on the blank filters is less than or equal to 70 s/mm
2
, analyze the outside samples and perform the Z-test.
6. If the Z-statistic is less than or equal to 1.65, the response action is complete. If the Z-statistic is greater than 1.65, reclean the abatement site and collect a new set of samples.

# Appendix C to Subpart E of Part 763—Asbestos Model Accreditation Plan

# I. Asbestos Model Accreditation Plan for States
The Asbestos Model Accreditation Plan (MAP) for States has eight components:
(A) Definitions
(B) Initial Training
(C) Examinations
(D) Continuing Education
(E) Qualifications
(F) Recordkeeping Requirements for Training Providers
(G) Deaccreditation
(H) Reciprocity
(I) Electronic reporting
A. Definitions
For purposes of Appendix C:
1. “Friable asbestos-containing material (ACM)” means any material containing more than one percent asbestos which has been applied on ceilings, walls, structural members, piping, duct work, or any other part of a building, which when dry, may be crumbled, pulverized, or reduced to powder by hand pressure. The term includes non-friable asbestos-containing material after such previously non-friable material becomes damaged to the extent that when dry it may be crumbled, pulverized, or reduced to powder by hand pressure.
2. “Friable asbestos-containing building material (ACBM)” means any friable ACM that is in or on interior structural members or other parts of a school or public and commercial building.
3. “Inspection” means an activity undertaken in a school building, or a public and commercial building, to determine the presence or location, or to assess the condition of, friable or non-friable asbestos-containing building material (ACBM) or suspected ACBM, whether by visual or physical examination, or by collecting samples of such material. This term includes reinspections of friable and non-friable known or assumed ACBM which has been previously identified. The term does not include the following:
a. Periodic surveillance of the type described in 40 CFR 763.92(b) solely for the purpose of recording or reporting a change in the condition of known or assumed ACBM;
b. Inspections performed by employees or agents of Federal, State, or local government solely for the purpose of determining compliance with applicable statutes or regulations; or
c. visual inspections of the type described in 40 CFR 763.90(i) solely for the purpose of determining completion of response actions.
4. “Major fiber release episode” means any uncontrolled or unintentional disturbance of ACBM, resulting in a visible emission, which involves the falling or dislodging of more than 3 square or linear feet of friable ACBM.
5. “Minor fiber release episode” means any uncontrolled or unintentional disturbance of ACBM, resulting in a visible emission, which involves the falling or dislodging of 3 square or linear feet or less of friable ACBM.
6. “Public and commercial building” means the interior space of any building which is not a school building, except that the term does not include any residential apartment building of fewer than 10 units or detached single-family homes. The term includes, but is not limited to: industrial and office buildings, residential apartment buildings and condominiums of 10 or more dwelling units, government-owned buildings, colleges, museums, airports, hospitals, churches, preschools, stores, warehouses and factories. Interior space includes exterior hallways connecting buildings, porticos, and mechanical systems used to condition interior space.
7. “Response action” means a method, including removal, encapsulation, enclosure, repair, and operation and maintenance, that protects human health and the environment from friable ACBM.
8. “Small-scale, short-duration activities (SSSD)” are tasks such as, but not limited to:
a. Removal of asbestos-containing insulation on pipes.
b. Removal of small quantities of asbestos-containing insulation on beams or above ceilings.
c. Replacement of an asbestos-containing gasket on a valve.
d. Installation or removal of a small section of drywall.
e. Installation of electrical conduits through or proximate to asbestos-containing materials.
SSSD can be further defined by the following considerations:
f. Removal of small quantities of ACM only if required in the performance of another maintenance activity not intended as asbestos abatement.
g. Removal of asbestos-containing thermal system insulation not to exceed amounts greater than those which can be contained in a single glove bag.
h. Minor repairs to damaged thermal system insulation which do not require removal.
i. Repairs to a piece of asbestos-containing wallboard.
j. Repairs, involving encapsulation, enclosure, or removal, to small amounts of friable ACM only if required in the performance of emergency or routine maintenance activity and not intended solely as asbestos abatement. Such work may not exceed amounts greater than those which can be contained in a single prefabricated mini-enclosure. Such an enclosure shall conform spatially and geometrically to the localized work area, in order to perform its intended containment function.

# B. Initial Training
Training requirements for purposes of accreditation are specified both in terms of required subjects of instruction and in terms of length of training. Each initial training course has a prescribed curriculum and number of days of training. One day of training equals 8 hours, including breaks and lunch. Course instruction must be provided by EPA or State-approved instructors. EPA or State instructor approval shall be based upon a review of the instructor's academic credentials and/or field experience in asbestos abatement.
Beyond the initial training requirements, individual States may wish to consider requiring additional days of training for purposes of supplementing hands-on activities or for reviewing relevant state regulations. States also may wish to consider the relative merits of a worker apprenticeship program. Further, they might consider more stringent minimum qualification standards for the approval of training instructors. EPA recommends that the enrollment in any given course be limited to 25 students so that adequate opportunities exist for individual hands-on experience.
States have the option to provide initial training directly or approve other entities to offer training. The following requirements are for the initial training of persons required to have accreditation under TSCA Title II.
Training requirements for each of the five accredited disciplines are outlined below. Persons in each discipline perform a different job function and distinct role. Inspectors identify and assess the condition of ACBM, or suspect ACBM. Management planners use data gathered by inspectors to assess the degree of hazard posed by ACBM in schools to determine the scope and timing of appropriate response actions needed for schools. Project designers determine how asbestos abatement work should be conducted. Lastly, workers and contractor/supervisors carry out and oversee abatement work. In addition, a recommended training curriculum is also presented for a sixth discipline, which is not federally-accredited, that of “Project Monitor.” Each accredited discipline and training curriculum is separate and distinct from the others. A person seeking accreditation in any of the five accredited MAP disciplines cannot attend two or more courses concurrently, but may attend such courses sequentially.
In several instances, initial training courses for a specific discipline (e.g., workers, inspectors) require hands-on training. For asbestos abatement contractor/supervisors and workers, hands-on training should include working with asbestos-substitute materials, fitting and using respirators, use of glovebags, donning protective clothing, and constructing a decontamination unit as well as other abatement work activities.

# 1. Workers
A person must be accredited as a worker to carry out any of the following activities with respect to friable ACBM in a school or public and commercial building: (1) A response action other than a SSSD activity, (2) a maintenance activity that disturbs friable ACBM other than a SSSD activity, or (3) a response action for a major fiber release episode. All persons seeking accreditation as asbestos abatement workers shall complete at least a 4-day training course as outlined below. The 4-day worker training course shall include lectures, demonstrations, at least 14 hours of hands-on training, individual respirator fit testing, course review, and an examination. Hands-on training must permit workers to have actual experience performing tasks associated with asbestos abatement. A person who is otherwise accredited as a contractor/supervisor may perform in the role of a worker without possessing separate accreditation as a worker.
Because of cultural diversity associated with the asbestos workforce, EPA recommends that States adopt specific standards for the approval of foreign language courses for abatement workers. EPA further recommends the use of audio-visual materials to complement lectures, where appropriate.
The training course shall adequately address the following topics:
(a)
Physical characteristics of asbestos.
Identification of asbestos, aerodynamic characteristics, typical uses, and physical appearance, and a summary of abatement control options.
(b)
Potential health effects related to asbestos exposure.
The nature of asbestos-related diseases; routes of exposure; dose-response relationships and the lack of a safe exposure level; the synergistic effect between cigarette smoking and asbestos exposure; the latency periods for asbestos-related diseases; a discussion of the relationship of asbestos exposure to asbestosis, lung cancer, mesothelioma, and cancers of other organs.
(c)
Employee personal protective equipment.
Classes and characteristics of respirator
types; limitations of respirators; proper selection, inspection; donning, use, maintenance, and storage procedures for respirators; methods for field testing of the facepiece-to-face seal (positive and negative-pressure fit checks); qualitative and quantitative fit testing procedures; variability between field and laboratory protection factors that alter respiratory fit (e.g., facial hair); the components of a proper respiratory protection program; selection and use of personal protective clothing; use, storage, and handling of non-disposable clothing; and regulations covering personal protective equipment.
(d)

(e)
Personal hygiene.
Entry and exit procedures for the work area; use of showers; avoidance of eating, drinking, smoking, and chewing (gum or tobacco) in the work area; and potential exposures, such as family exposure.
(f)
Additional safety hazards.
Hazards encountered during abatement activities and how to deal with them, including electrical hazards, heat stress, air contaminants other than asbestos, fire and explosion hazards, scaffold and ladder hazards, slips, trips, and falls, and confined spaces.
(g)

(h)
Air monitoring.
Procedures to determine airborne concentrations of asbestos fibers, focusing on how personal air sampling is performed and the reasons for it.
(i)
Relevant Federal, State, and local regulatory requirements, procedures, and standards.

# 2. Contractor/Supervisors
A person must be accredited as a contractor/supervisor to supervise any of the following activities with respect to friable ACBM in a school or public and commercial building: (1) A response action other than a SSSD activity, (2) a maintenance activity that disturbs friable ACBM other than a SSSD activity, or (3) a response action for a major fiber release episode. All persons seeking accreditation as asbestos abatement contractor/supervisors shall complete at least a 5-day training course as outlined below. The training course must include lectures, demonstrations, at least 14 hours of hands-on training, individual respirator fit testing, course review, and a written examination. Hands-on training must permit supervisors to have actual experience performing tasks associated with asbestos abatement.

# C. Examinations
1. Each State shall administer a closed book examination or designate other entities such as State-approved providers of training courses to administer the closed-book examination to persons seeking accreditation who have completed an initial training course. Demonstration testing may also be included as part of the examination. A person seeking initial accreditation in a specific discipline must pass the examination for that discipline in order to receive accreditation. For example, a person seeking accreditation as an abatement project designer must pass the State's examination for abatement project designer.
States may develop their own examinations, have providers of training courses develop examinations, or use standardized examinations developed for purposes of accreditation under TSCA Title II. In addition, States may supplement standardized examinations with questions about State regulations. States may obtain commercially developed standardized examinations, develop standardized examinations independently, or do so in cooperation with other States, or with commercial or non-profit providers on a regional or national basis. EPA recommends the use of standardized, scientifically-validated testing instruments, which may be beneficial in terms of both promoting competency and in fostering accreditation reciprocity between States.
Each examination shall adequately cover the topics included in the training course for that discipline. Each person who completes a
training course, passes the required examination, and fulfills whatever other requirements the State imposes must receive an accreditation certificate in a specific discipline. Whether a State directly issues accreditation certificates, or authorizes training providers to issue accreditation certificates, each certificate issued to an accredited person must contain the following minimum information:
a. A unique certificate number
b. Name of accredited person
c. Discipline of the training course completed.
d. Dates of the training course.
e. Date of the examination.
f. An expiration date of 1 year after the date upon which the person successfully completed the course and examination.
g. The name, address, and telephone number of the training provider that issued the certificate.
h. A statement that the person receiving the certificate has completed the requisite training for asbestos accreditation under TSCA Title II.
States or training providers who reaccredit persons based upon completion of required refresher training must also provide accreditation certificates with all of the above information, except the examination date may be omitted if a State does not require a refresher examination for reaccreditation.
Where a State licenses accredited persons but has authorized training providers to issue accreditation certificates, the State may issue licenses in the form of photo-identification cards. Where this applies, EPA recommends that the State licenses should include all of the same information required for the accreditation certificates. A State may also choose to issue photo-identification cards in addition to the required accreditation certificates.
Accredited persons must have their initial and current accreditation certificates at the location where they are conducting work.
2. The following are the requirements for examination in each discipline:
a. Worker:
i. 50 multiple-choice questions
ii. Passing score: 70 percent correct
b. Contractor/Supervisor:
i. 100 multiple-choice questions
ii. Passing score: 70 percent correct
c. Inspector:
i. 50 Multiple-choice questions
ii. Passing score: 70 percent correct
d. Management Planner:
i. 50 Multiple-choice questions
ii. Passing score: 70 percent correct
e. Project Designer:
i. 100 multiple-choice questions
ii. Passing score: 70 percent correct

# D. Continuing Education
For all disciplines, a State's accreditation program shall include annual refresher training as a requirement for reaccreditation as indicated below:
1. Workers: One full day of refresher training.
2. Contractor/Supervisors: One full day of refresher training.
3. Inspectors: One half-day of refresher training.
4. Management Planners: One half-day of inspector refresher training and one half-day of refresher training for management planners.
5. Project Designers: One full day of refresher training.
The refresher courses shall be specific to each discipline. Refresher courses shall be conducted as separate and distinct courses and not combined with any other training during the period of the refresher course. For each discipline, the refresher course shall review and discuss changes in Federal, State, and local regulations, developments in state-of-the-art procedures, and a review of key aspects of the initial training course as determined by the State. After completing the annual refresher course, persons shall have their accreditation extended for an additional year from the date of the refresher course. A State may consider requiring persons to pass reaccreditation examinations at specific intervals (for example, every 3 years).
EPA recommends that States formally establish a 12-month grace period to enable formerly accredited persons with expired certificates to complete refresher training and have their accreditation status reinstated without having to re-take the initial training course.

# E. Qualifications
In addition to requiring training and an examination, a State may require candidates for accreditation to meet other qualification and/or experience standards that the State considers appropriate for some or all disciplines. States may choose to consider requiring qualifications similar to the examples outlined below for inspectors, management planners and project designers. States may modify these examples as appropriate. In addition, States may want to include some requirements based on experience in performing a task directly as a part of a job or in an apprenticeship role. They may also wish to consider additional criteria for the approval of training course instructors beyond those prescribed by EPA.
1. Inspectors: Qualifications - possess a high school diploma. States may want to require an Associate's Degree in specific fields (e.g., environmental or physical sciences).
2. Management Planners: Qualifications - Registered architect, engineer, or certified industrial hygienist or related scientific field.
3. Project Designers: Qualifications - registered architect, engineer, or certified industrial hygienist.
4. Asbestos Training Course Instructor: Qualifications - academic credentials and/or field experience in asbestos abatement.
EPA recommends that States prescribe minimum qualification standards for training instructors employed by training providers.

# F. Recordkeeping Requirements for Training Providers
All approved providers of accredited asbestos training courses must comply with the following minimum recordkeeping requirements.
1. Training course materials. A training provider must retain copies of all instructional materials used in the delivery of the classroom training such as student manuals, instructor notebooks and handouts.
2. Instructor qualifications. A training provider must retain copies of all instructors' resumes, and the documents approving each instructor issued by either EPA or a State. Instructors must be approved by either EPA or a State before teaching courses for accreditation purposes. A training provider must notify EPA or the State, as appropriate, in advance whenever it changes course instructors. Records must accurately identify the instructors that taught each particular course for each date that a course is offered.
3. Examinations. A training provider must document that each person who receives an accreditation certificate for an initial training course has achieved a passing score on the examination. These records must clearly indicate the date upon which the exam was administered, the training course and discipline for which the exam was given, the name of the person who proctored the exam, a copy of the exam, and the name and test score of each person taking the exam. The topic and dates of the training course must correspond to those listed on that person's accreditation certificate. States may choose to apply these same requirements to examinations for refresher training courses.
4. Accreditation certificates. The training providers or States, whichever issues the accreditation certificate, shall maintain records that document the names of all persons who have been awarded certificates, their certificate numbers, the disciplines for which accreditation was conferred, training and expiration dates, and the training location. The training provider or State shall maintain the records in a manner that allows verification by telephone of the required information.
5. Verification of certificate information. EPA recommends that training providers of refresher training courses confirm that their students possess valid accreditation before granting course admission. EPA further recommends that training providers offering the initial management planner training course verify that students have met the prerequisite of possessing valid inspector accreditation at the time of course admission.
6. Records retention and access. (a) The training provider shall maintain all required records for a minimum of 3 years. The training provider, however, may find it advantageous to retain these records for a longer period of time.
(b) The training provider must allow reasonable access to all of the records required by the MAP, and to any other records which may be required by States for the approval of asbestos training providers or the accreditation of asbestos training courses, to both EPA and to State Agencies, on request. EPA encourages training providers to make this information equally accessible to the general public.
(c) If a training provider ceases to conduct training, the training provider shall notify the approving government body (EPA or the State) and give it the opportunity to take possession of that providers asbestos training records.

# G. Deaccreditation
1. States must establish criteria and procedures for deaccrediting persons accredited as workers, contractor/supervisors, inspectors, management planners, and project designers. States must follow their own administrative procedures in pursuing deaccreditation actions. At a minimum, the criteria shall include:
(a) Performing work requiring accreditation at a job site without being in physical possession of initial and current accreditation certificates;
(b) Permitting the duplication or use of one's own accreditation certificate by another;
(c) Performing work for which accreditation has not been received; or
(d) Obtaining accreditation from a training provider that does not have approval to offer training for the particular discipline from either EPA or from a State that has a contractor accreditation plan at least as stringent as the EPA MAP.
EPA may directly pursue deaccreditation actions without reliance on State deaccreditation or enforcement authority or actions. In addition to the above-listed situations, the Administrator may suspend or revoke the accreditation of persons who have been subject to a final order imposing a civil penalty or convicted under section 16 of TSCA, 15 U.S.C. 2615 or 2647, for violations of 40 CFR part 763, or section 113 of the Clean
Air Act, 42 U.S.C. 7413, for violations of 40 CFR part 61, subpart M.
2. Any person who performs asbestos work requiring accreditation under section 206(a) of TSCA, 15 U.S.C. 2646(a), without such accreditation is in violation of TSCA. The following persons are not accredited for purposes of section 206(a) of TSCA:
(a) Any person who obtains accreditation through fraudulent representation of training or examination documents;
(b) Any person who obtains training documentation through fraudulent means;
(c) Any person who gains admission to and completes refresher training through fraudulent representation of initial or previous refresher training documentation; or
(d) Any person who obtains accreditation through fraudulent representation of accreditation requirements such as education, training, professional registration, or experience.

# H. Reciprocity
EPA recommends that each State establish reciprocal arrangements with other States that have established accreditation programs that meet or exceed the requirements of the MAP. Such arrangements might address cooperation in licensing determinations, the review and approval of training programs and/or instructors, candidate testing and exam administration, curriculum development, policy formulation, compliance monitoring, and the exchange of information and data. The benefits to be derived from these arrangements include a potential cost-savings from the reduction of duplicative activity and the attainment of a more professional accredited workforce as States are able to refine and improve the effectiveness of their programs based upon the experience and methods of other States.

# I. Electronic Reporting
States that choose to receive electronic documents must include, at a minimum, the requirements of 40 CFR Part 3—(Electronic reporting) in their programs.

# II. EPA Approval Process for State Accreditation Programs
A. States may seek approval for a single discipline or all disciplines as specified in the MAP. For example, a State that currently only requires worker accreditation may receive EPA approval for that discipline alone. EPA encourages States that currently do not have accreditation requirements for all disciplines required under section 206(b)(2) of TSCA, 15 U.S.C. 2646(b)(2), to seek EPA approval for those disciplines the State does accredit. As States establish accreditation requirements for the remaining disciplines, the requested information outlined below should be submitted to EPA as soon as possible. Any State that had an accreditation program approved by EPA under an earlier version of the MAP may follow the same procedures to obtain EPA approval of their accreditation program under this MAP.
B. Partial approval of a State Program for the accreditation of one or more disciplines does not mean that the State is in full compliance with TSCA where the deadline for that State to have adopted a State Plan no less stringent than the MAP has already passed. State Programs which are at least as stringent as the MAP for one or more of the accredited disciplines may, however, accredit persons in those disciplines only.
C. States seeking EPA approval or reapproval of accreditation programs shall submit the following information to the Regional Asbestos Coordinator at their EPA Regional office:
1. A copy of the legislation establishing or upgrading the State's accreditation program (if applicable).
2. A copy of the State's accreditation regulations or revised regulations.
3. A letter to the Regional Asbestos Coordinator that clearly indicates how the State meets the program requirements of this MAP. Addresses for each of the Regional Asbestos Coordinators are shown below:

EPA maintains a listing of all those States that have applied for and received EPA approval for having accreditation requirements that are at least as stringent as the MAP for
one or more disciplines. Any training courses approved by an EPA-approved State Program are considered to be EPA-approved for purposes of accreditation.

# III. Approval of Training Courses
Individuals or groups wishing to sponsor training courses for disciplines required to be accredited under section 206(b)(1)(A) of TSCA, 15 U.S.C. 2646(b)(1)(A), may apply for approval from States that have accreditation program requirements that are at least as stringent as this MAP. For a course to receive approval, it must meet the requirements for the course as outlined in this MAP, and any other requirements imposed by the State from which approval is being sought. Courses that have been approved by a State with an accreditation program at least as stringent as this MAP are approved under section 206(a) of TSCA, 15 U.S.C. 2646(a), for that particular State, and also for any other State that does not have an accreditation program as stringent as this MAP.

# A. Initial Training Course Approval
A training provider must submit the following minimum information to a State as part of its application for the approval of each training course:
1. The course provider's name, address, and telephone number.
2. A list of any other States that currently approve the training course.
3. The course curriculum.
4. A letter from the provider of the training course that clearly indicates how the course meets the MAP requirements for:
a. Length of training in days.
b. Amount and type of hands-on training.
c. Examination (length, format, and passing score).
d. Topics covered in the course.
5. A copy of all course materials (student manuals, instructor notebooks, handouts, etc.).
6. A detailed statement about the development of the examination used in the course.
7. Names and qualifications of all course instructors. Instructors must have academic and/or field experience in asbestos abatement.
8. A description of and an example of the numbered certificates issued to students who attend the course and pass the examination.

# B. Refresher Training Course Approval
The following minimum information is required for approval of refresher training courses by States:
1. The length of training in half-days or days.
2. The topics covered in the course.
3. A copy of all course materials (student manuals, instructor notebooks, handouts, etc.).
4. The names and qualifications of all course instructors. Instructors must have academic and/or field experience in asbestos abatement.
5. A description of and an example of the numbered certificates issued to students who complete the refresher course and pass the examination, if required.

# C. Withdrawal of Training Course Approval
States must establish criteria and procedures for suspending or withdrawing approval from accredited training programs. States should follow their own administrative procedures in pursuing actions for suspension or withdrawal of approval of training programs. At a minimum, the criteria shall include:
(1) Misrepresentation of the extent of a training course's approval by a State or EPA;
(2) Failure to submit required information or notifications in a timely manner;
(3) Failure to maintain requisite records;
(4) Falsification of accreditation records, instructor qualifications, or other accreditation information; or
(5) Failure to adhere to the training standards and requirements of the EPA MAP or State Accreditation Program, as appropriate.
In addition to the criteria listed above, EPA may also suspend or withdraw a training course's approval where an approved training course instructor, or other person with supervisory authority over the delivery of training has been found in violation of other asbestos regulations administered by EPA. An administrative or judicial finding of violation, or execution of a consent agreement and order under 40 CFR 22.18, constitutes evidence of a failure to comply with relevant statutes or regulations. States may wish to adopt this criterion modified to include their own asbestos statutes or regulations. EPA may also suspend or withdraw approval of training programs where a training provider has submitted false information as a part of the self-certification required under Unit V.B. of the revised MAP.
Training course providers shall permit representatives of EPA or the State which approved their training courses to attend, evaluate, and monitor any training course without charge. EPA or State compliance inspection staff are not required to give advance notice of their inspections. EPA may suspend or withdraw State or EPA approval of a training course based upon the criteria specified in this Unit III.C.

# IV. EPA Procedures for Suspension or Revocation of Accreditation or Training Course Approval.
A. If the Administrator decides to suspend or revoke the accreditation of any person or suspend or withdraw the approval of a training course, the Administrator will notify the affected entity of the following:
1. The grounds upon which the suspension, revocation, or withdrawal is based.
2. The time period during which the suspension, revocation, or withdrawal is effective, whether permanent or otherwise.
3. The conditions, if any, under which the affected entity may receive accreditation or approval in the future.
4. Any additional conditions which the Administrator may impose.
5. The opportunity to request a hearing prior to final Agency action to suspend or revoke accreditation or suspend or withdraw approval.
B. If a hearing is requested by the accredited person or training course provider pursuant to the preceding paragraph, the Administrator will:
1. Notify the affected entity of those assertions of law and fact upon which the action to suspend, revoke, or withdraw is based.
2. Provide the affected entity an opportunity to offer written statements of facts, explanations, comments, and arguments relevant to the proposed action.
3. Provide the affected entity such other procedural opportunities as the Administrator may deem appropriate to ensure a fair and impartial hearing.
4. Appoint an EPA attorney as Presiding Officer to conduct the hearing. No person shall serve as Presiding Officer if he or she has had any prior connection with the specific case.
C. The Presiding Officer appointed pursuant to the preceding paragraph shall:
1. Conduct a fair, orderly, and impartial hearing, without unnecessary delay.
2. Consider all relevant evidence, explanation, comment, and argument submitted pursuant to the preceding paragraph.
3. Promptly notify the affected entity of his or her decision and order. Such an order is a final Agency action.
D. If the Administrator determines that the public health, interest, or welfare warrants immediate action to suspend the accreditation of any person or the approval of any training course provider, the Administrator will:
1. Notify the affected entity of the grounds upon which the emergency suspension is based;
2. Notify the affected entity of the time period during which the emergency suspension is effective.
3. Notify the affected entity of the Administrator's intent to suspend or revoke accreditation or suspend or withdraw training course approval, as appropriate, in accordance with Unit IV.A. above. If such suspension, revocation, or withdrawal notice has not previously been issued, it will be issued at the same time the emergency suspension notice is issued.
E. Any notice, decision, or order issued by the Administrator under this section, and any documents filed by an accredited person or approved training course provider in a hearing under this section, shall be available to the public except as otherwise provided by section 14 of TSCA or by 40 CFR part 2. Any such hearing at which oral testimony is presented shall be open to the public, except that the Presiding Officer may exclude the public to the extent necessary to allow presentation of information which may be entitled to confidential treatment under section 14 of TSCA or 40 CFR part 2.

# V. Implementation Schedule
The various requirements of this MAP become effective in accordance with the following schedules:

# A. Requirements applicable to State Programs
1. Each State shall adopt an accreditation plan that is at least as stringent as this MAP within 180 days after the commencement of the first regular session of the legislature of the State that is convened on or after April 4, 1994.
2. If a State has adopted an accreditation plan at least as stringent as this MAP as of April 4, 1994, the State may continue to:
a. Conduct TSCA training pursuant to this MAP.
b. Approve training course providers to conduct training and to issue accreditation that satisfies the requirements for TSCA accreditation under this MAP.
c. Issue accreditation that satisfies the requirements for TSCA accreditation under this MAP.
3. A State that had complied with an earlier version of the MAP, but has not adopted an accreditation plan at least as stringent as this MAP by April 4, 1994, may:
a. Conduct TSCA training which remains in compliance with the requirements of Unit V.B. of this MAP. After such training has been self-certified in accordance with Unit V.B. of this MAP, the State may issue accreditation that satisfies the requirement for TSCA accreditation under this MAP.
b. Sustain its approval for any training course providers to conduct training and issue TSCA accreditation that the State had approved before April 4, 1994, and that remain in compliance with Unit V.B. of this MAP.
c. Issue accreditation pursuant to an earlier version of the MAP that provisionally
satisfies the requirement for TSCA accreditation until October 4, 1994.
Such a State may not approve new TSCA training course providers to conduct training or to issue TSCA accreditation that satisfies the requirements of this MAP until the State adopts an accreditation plan that is at least as stringent as this MAP.
4. A State that had complied with an earlier version of the MAP, but fails to adopt a plan as stringent as this MAP by the deadline established in Unit V.A.1., is subject to the following after that deadline date:
a. The State loses any status it may have held as an EPA-approved State for accreditation purposes under section 206 of TSCA, 15 U.S.C. 2646.
b. All training course providers approved by the State lose State approval to conduct training and issue accreditation that satisfies the requirements for TSCA accreditation under this MAP.
c. The State may not:
i. Conduct training for accreditation purposes under section 206 of TSCA, 15 U.S.C. 2646.
ii. Approve training course providers to conduct training or issue accreditation that satisfies the requirements for TSCA accreditation; or
iii. Issue accreditation that satisfies the requirement for TSCA accreditation.
EPA will extend EPA-approval to any training course provider that loses State approval because the State does not comply with the deadline, so long as the provider is in compliance with Unit V.B. of this MAP, and the provider is approved by a State that had complied with an earlier version of the MAP as of the day before the State loses its EPA approval.
5. A State that does not have an accreditation program that satisfies the requirements for TSCA accreditation under either an earlier version of the MAP or this MAP, may not:
a. Conduct training for accreditation purposes under section 206 of TSCA, 15 U.S.C. 2646;
b. Approve training course providers to conduct training or issue accreditation that satisfies the requirements for TSCA accreditation; or
c. Issue accreditation that satisfies the requirement for TSCA accreditation.

# B. Requirements applicable to Training Courses and Providers
As of October 4, 1994, an approved training provider must certify to EPA and to any State that has approved the provider for TSCA accreditation, that each of the provider's training courses complies with the requirements of this MAP. The written submission must document in specific detail the changes made to each training course in order to comply with the requirements of this MAP and clearly state that the provider is also in compliance with all other requirements of this MAP, including the new recordkeeping and certificate provisions. Each submission must include the following statement signed by an authorized representative of the training provider: “Under civil and criminal penalties of law for the making or submission of false or fraudulent statements or representations (18 U.S.C. 1001 and 15 U.S.C. 2615), I certify that the training described in this submission complies with all applicable requirements of Title II of TSCA, 40 CFR part 763, Appendix C to subpart E, as revised, and any other applicable Federal, state, or local requirements.” A consolidated self-certification submission from each training provider that addresses all of its approved training courses is permissible and encouraged.
The self-certification must be sent via registered mail, to EPA Headquarters at the following address: Attn. Self-Certification Program, Field Programs Branch, Chemical Management Division (7404), Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics, Environmental Protection Agency, 1200 Pennsylvania Ave., NW., Washington, DC 20460. A duplicate copy of the complete submission must also be sent to any States from which approval had been obtained.
The timely receipt of a complete self-certification by EPA and all approving States shall have the effect of extending approval under this MAP to the training courses offered by the submitting provider. If a self-certification is not received by the approving government bodies on or before the due date, the affected training course is not approved under this MAP. Such training providers must then reapply for approval of these training courses pursuant to the procedures outlined in Unit III.

# C. Requirements applicable to Accredited Persons.
Persons accredited by a State with an accreditation program no less stringent than an earlier version of the MAP or by an EPA-approved training provider as of April 3, 1994, are accredited in accordance with the requirements of this MAP, and are not required to retake initial training. They must continue to comply with the requirements for annual refresher training in Unit I.D. of the revised MAP.

# D. Requirements applicable to Non-Accredited Persons.
In order to perform work requiring accreditation under TSCA Title II, persons who are not accredited by a State with an accreditation program no less stringent than an earlier version of the MAP or by an EPA-approved training provider as of April 3, 1994,
must comply with the upgraded training requirements of this MAP by no later than October 4, 1994. Non-accredited persons may obtain initial accreditation on a provisional basis by successfully completing any of the training programs approved under an earlier version of the MAP, and thereby perform work during the first 6 months after this MAP takes effect. However, by October 4, 1994, these persons must have successfully completed an upgraded training program that fully complies with the requirements of this MAP in order to continue to perform work requiring accreditation under section 206 of TSCA, 15 U.S.C. 2646.

# Appendix D to Subpart E of Part 763—Transport and Disposal of Asbestos Waste
For the purposes of this appendix, transport is defined as all activities from receipt of the containerized asbestos waste at the generation site until it has been unloaded at the disposal site. Current EPA regulations state that there must be no visible emissions to the outside air during waste transport. However, recognizing the potential hazards and subsequent liabilities associated with exposure, the following additional precautions are recommended.
Recordkeeping.
Before accepting wastes, a transporter should determine if the waste is properly wetted and containerized. The transporter should then require a chain-of-custody form signed by the generator. A chain-of-custody form may include the name and address of the generator, the name and address of the pickup site, the estimated quantity of asbestos waste, types of containers used, and the destination of the waste. The chain-of-custody form should then be signed over to a disposal site operator to transfer responsibility for the asbestos waste. A copy of the form signed by the disposal site operator should be maintained by the transporter as evidence of receipt at the disposal site.
Waste handling.
A transporter should ensure that the asbestos waste is properly contained in leak-tight containers with appropriate labels, and that the outside surfaces of the containers are not contaminated with asbestos debris adhering to the containers. If there is reason to believe that the condition of the asbestos waste may allow significant fiber release, the transporter should not accept the waste. Improper containerization of wastes is a violation of the NESHAPs regulation and should be reported to the appropriate EPA Regional Asbestos NESHAPs contact below:

Once the transporter is satisfied with the condition of the asbestos waste and agrees to handle it, the containers should be loaded into the transport vehicle in a careful manner to prevent breaking of the containers. Similarly, at the disposal site, the asbestos waste containers should be transferred carefully to avoid fiber release.
Waste transport.
Although there are no regulatory specifications regarding the transport vehicle, it is recommended that vehicles used for transport of containerized asbestos waste have an enclosed carrying compartment or utilize a canvas covering sufficient to contain the transported waste, prevent damage to containers, and prevent fiber release. Transport of large quantities of asbestos waste is commonly conducted in a 20-cubic-yard “roll off” box, which should also be covered. Vehicles that use compactors to reduce waste volume should not be used because these will cause the waste containers to rupture. Vacuum trucks used to transport waste slurry must be inspected to ensure that water is not leaking from the truck.
Disposal involves the isolation of asbestos waste material in order to prevent fiber release to air or water. Landfilling is recommended as an environmentally sound isolation method because asbestos fibers are virtually immobile in soil. Other disposal techniques such as incineration or chemical treatment are not feasible due to the unique properties of asbestos. EPA has established asbestos disposal requirements for active and inactive disposal sites under NESHAPs (40 CFR Part 61, subpart M) and specifies general requirements for solid waste disposal under RCRA (40 CFR Part 257). Advance EPA notification of the intended disposal site is required by NESHAPs.
Selecting a disposal facility.
An acceptable disposal facility for asbestos wastes must adhere to EPA's requirements of no visible emissions to the air during disposal, or minimizing emissions by covering the waste within 24 hours. The minimum required cover is 6 inches of nonasbestos material, normally soil, or a dust-suppressing chemical. In addition to these Federal requirements, many state or local government agencies require more stringent handling procedures. These agencies usually supply a list of “approved” or licensed asbestos disposal sites upon request. Solid waste control agencies are listed in local telephone directories under state, county, or city headings. A list of state solid waste agencies may be obtained by calling the RCRA hotline: 1-800-424-9346 (382-3000 in Washington, DC). Some landfill owners or operators place special requirements on asbestos waste, such as placing all bagged waste into 55-gallon metal drums. Therefore, asbestos removal contractors should contact the intended landfill before arriving with the waste.
Receiving asbestos waste.
A landfill approved for receipt of asbestos waste should require notification by the waste hauler that the load contains asbestos. The landfill operator should inspect the loads to verify that asbestos waste is properly contained in leak-tight containers and labeled appropriately. The appropriate EPA Regional Asbestos NESHAPs Contact should be notified if the landfill operator believes that the asbestos waste is in a condition that may cause significant fiber release during disposal. In situations when the wastes are not properly containerized, the landfill operator should thoroughly soak the asbestos with a water spray prior to unloading, rinse out the truck, and immediately cover the wastes with nonasbestos material prior to compacting the waste in the landfill.
Waste deposition and covering.
Recognizing the health dangers associated with asbestos exposure, the following procedures are recommended to augment current federal requirements:
• Designate a separate area for asbestos waste disposal. Provide a record for future landowners that asbestos waste has been buried there and that it would be hazardous to attempt to excavate that area. (Future regulations may require property deeds to identify the location of any asbestos wastes and warn against excavation.)
• Prepare a separate trench to receive asbestos wastes. The size of the trench will depend upon the quantity and frequency of asbestos waste delivered to the disposal site. The trenching technique allows application of soil cover without disturbing the asbestos waste containers. The trench should be ramped to allow the transport vehicle to back into it, and the trench should be as narrow as possible to reduce the amount of cover required. If possible, the trench should be aligned perpendicular to prevailing winds.
• Place the asbestos waste containers into the trench carefully to avoid breaking them. Be particularly careful with plastic bags because when they break under pressure asbestos particles can be emitted.
• Completely cover the containerized waste within 24 hours with a minimum of 6 inches of nonasbestos material. Improperly containerized waste is a violation of the NESHAPs and EPA should be notified.
However, if improperly containerized waste is received at the disposal site, it should be covered immediately after unloading. Only after the wastes, including properly containerized wastes, are completely covered, can the wastes be compacted or other heavy equipment run over it. During compacting, avoid exposing wastes to the air or tracking asbestos material away from the trench.
• For final closure of an area containing asbestos waste, cover with at least an additional 30 inches of compacted nonasbestos
material to provide a 36-inch final cover. To control erosion of the final cover, it should be properly graded and vegetated. In areas of the United States where excessive soil erosion may occur or the frost line exceeds 3 feet, additional final cover is recommended. In desert areas where vegetation would be difficult to maintain, 3-6 inches of well graded crushed rock is recommended for placement on top of the final cover.
Controlling public access.
Under the current NESHAPs regulation, EPA does not require that a landfill used for asbestos disposal use warning signs or fencing if it meets the requirement to cover asbestos wastes. However, under RCRA, EPA requires that access be controlled to prevent exposure of the public to potential health and safety hazards at the disposal site. Therefore, for liability protection of operators of landfills that handle asbestos, fencing and warning signs are recommended to control public access when natural barriers do not exist. Access to a landfill should be limited to one or two entrances with gates that can be locked when left unattended. Fencing should be installed around the perimeter of the disposal site in a manner adequate to deter access by the general public. Chain-link fencing, 6-ft high and topped with a barbed wire guard, should be used. More specific fencing requirements may be specified by local regulations. Warning signs should be displayed at all entrances and at intervals of 330 feet or less along the property line of the landfill or perimeter of the sections where asbestos waste is deposited. The sign should read as follows:
ASBESTOS WASTE DISPOSAL SITE
BREATHING ASBESTOS DUST MAY CAUSE LUNG DISEASE AND CANCER
Recordkeeping.
For protection from liability, and considering possible future requirements for notification on disposal site deeds, a landfill owner should maintain documentation of the specific location and quantity of the buried asbestos wastes. In addition, the estimated depth of the waste below the surface should be recorded whenever a landfill section is closed. As mentioned previously, such information should be recorded in the land deed or other record along with a notice warning against excavation of the area.

Bulk samples of building materials taken for asbestos identification are first examined for homogeneity and preliminary fiber identification at low magnification. Positive identification of suspect fibers is made by analysis of subsamples with the polarized light microscope.
The principles of optical mineralogy are well established.
1 2
A light microscope equipped with two polarizing filters is used to observe specific optical characteristics of a sample. The use of plane polarized light allows the determination of refractive indices along specific crystallographic axes. Morphology and color are also observed. A retardation plate is placed in the polarized light path for determination of the sign of elongation using orthoscopic illumination. Orientation of the two filters such that their vibration planes are perpendicular (crossed polars) allows observation of the birefringence and extinction characteristics of anisotropic particles.
Quantitative analysis involves the use of point counting. Point counting is a standard technique in petrography for determining the relative areas occupied by separate minerals in thin sections of rock. Background information on the use of point counting
2
and the interpretation of point count data
3
is available.
This method is applicable to all bulk samples of friable insulation materials submitted for identification and quantitation of asbestos components.

# 1.2 Range
The point counting method may be used for analysis of samples containing from 0 to 100 percent asbestos. The upper detection limit is 100 percent. The lower detection limit is less than 1 percent.

# 1.3 Interferences
Fibrous organic and inorganic constituents of bulk samples may interfere with the identification and quantitation of the asbestos mineral content. Spray-on binder materials may coat fibers and affect color or obscure optical characteristics to the extent of masking fiber identity. Fine particles of other materials may also adhere to fibers to an extent sufficient to cause confusion in identification. Procedures that may be used for the removal of interferences are presented in Section 1.7.2.2.

# 1.4 Precision and Accuracy
Adequate data for measuring the accuracy and precision of the method for samples with various matrices are not currently available. Data obtained for samples containing a single asbestos type in a simple matrix are available in the EPA report

# 1.7 Procedures

# Note:
Exposure to airborne asbestos fibers is a health hazard. Bulk samples submitted for analysis are usually friable and may release fibers during handling or matrix reduction steps. All sample and slide preparations should be carried out in a ventilated hood or glove box with continuous airflow (negative pressure). Handling of samples without these precautions may result in exposure of the analyst and contamination of samples by airborne fibers.

# 1.7.1 Sampling
Samples for analysis of asbestos content shall be taken in the manner prescribed in Reference 5 and information on design of sampling and analysis programs may be found in Reference 6. If there are any questions about the representative nature of the sample, another sample should be requested before proceeding with the analysis.

# 1.7.2 Analysis

# 1.7.2.1 Gross Examination
Bulk samples of building materials taken for the identification and quantitation of asbestos are first examined for homogeneity at low magnification with the aid of a stereomicroscope. The core sample may be examined in its container or carefully removed from the container onto a glassine transfer paper or clean glass plate. If possible, note is made of the top and bottom orientation. When discrete strata are identified, each is treated as a separate material so that fibers are first identified and quantified in that layer only, and then the results for each layer are combined to yield an estimate of asbestos content for the whole sample.

# 1.7.2.2 Sample Preparation
Bulk materials submitted for asbestos analysis involve a wide variety of matrix materials. Representative subsamples may not be readily obtainable by simple means in heterogeneous materials, and various steps may be required to alleviate the difficulties encountered. In most cases, however, the best preparation is made by using forceps to sample at several places from the bulk material. Forcep samples are immersed in a refractive index liquid on a microscope slide, teased apart, covered with a cover glass, and
observed with the polarized light microscope.
Alternatively, attempts may be made to homogenize the sample or eliminate interferences before further characterization. The selection of appropriate procedures is dependent upon the samples encountered and personal preference. The following are presented as possible sample preparation steps.
A mortar and pestle can sometimes be used in the size reduction of soft or loosely bound materials though this may cause matting of some samples. Such samples may be reduced in a Wylie mill. Apparatus should be clean and extreme care exercised to avoid cross-contamination of samples. Periodic checks of the particle sizes should be made during the grinding operation so as to preserve any fiber bundles present in an identifiable form. These procedures are not recommended for samples that contain amphibole minerals or vermiculite. Grinding of amphiboles may result in the separation of fiber bundles or the production of cleavage fragments with aspect ratios greater than 3:1. Grinding of vermiculite may also produce fragments with aspect ratios greater than 3:1.
Acid treatment may occasionally be required to eliminate interferences. Calcium carbonate, gypsum, and bassanite (plaster) are frequently present in sprayed or trowelled insulations. These materials may be removed by treatment with warm dilute acetic acid. Warm dilute hydrochloric acid may also be used to remove the above materials. If acid treatment is required, wash the sample at least twice with distilled water, being careful not to lose the particulates during decanting steps. Centrifugation or filtration of the suspension will prevent significant fiber loss. The pore size of the filter should be 0.45 micron or less. Caution: prolonged acid contact with the sample may alter the optical characteristics of chrysotile fibers and should be avoided.
Coatings and binding materials adhering to fiber surfaces may also be removed by treatment with sodium metaphosphate.
7
Add 10 mL of 10g/L sodium metaphosphate solution to a small (0.1 to 0.5 mL) sample of bulk material in a 15-mL glass centrifuge tube. For approximately 15 seconds each, stir the mixture on a vortex mixer, place in an ultrasonic bath and then shake by hand. Repeat the series. Collect the dispersed solids by centrifugation at 1000 rpm for 5 minutes. Wash the sample three times by suspending in 10 mL distilled water and recentrifuging. After washing, resuspend the pellet in 5 mL distilled water, place a drop of the suspension on a microscope slide, and dry the slide at 110 °C.
In samples with a large portion of cellulosic or other organic fibers, it may be useful to ash part of the sample and view the residue. Ashing should be performed in a low temperature asher. Ashing may also be performed in a muffle furnace at temperatures of 500 °C or lower. Temperatures of 550 °C or higher will cause dehydroxylation of the asbestos minerals, resulting in changes of the refractive index and other key parameters. If a muffle furnace is to be used, the furnace thermostat should be checked and calibrated to ensure that samples will not be heated at temperatures greater than 550 °C.
Ashing and acid treatment of samples should not be used as standard procedures. In order to monitor possible changes in fiber characteristics, the material should be viewed microscopically before and after any sample preparation procedure. Use of these procedures on samples to be used for quantitation requires a correction for percent weight loss.

# 1.7.2.3 Fiber Identification
Positive identification of asbestos requires the determination of the following optical properties.
• Morphology
• Color and pleochroism
• Refractive indices
• Birefringence
• Extinction characteristics
• Sign of elongation
Table 1-1 lists the above properties for commercial asbestos fibers. Figure 1-1 presents a flow diagram of the examination procedure. Natural variations in the conditions under which deposits of asbestiform minerals are formed will occasionally produce exceptions to the published values and differences from the UICC standards. The sign of elongation is determined by use of the compensator plate and crossed polars. Refractive indices may be determined by the Becke line test. Alternatively, dispersion staining may be used. Inexperienced operators may find that the dispersion staining technique is more easily learned, and should consult Reference 9 for guidance. Central stop dispersion staining colors are presented in Table 1-2. Available high-dispersion (HD) liquids should be used.

# 1.7.2.4 Quantitation of Asbestos Content
Asbestos quantitation is performed by a point-counting procedure or an equivalent estimation method. An ocular reticle (cross-hair or point array) is used to visually superimpose a point or points on the microscope field of view. Record the number of points positioned directly above each kind of particle or fiber of interest. Score only points directly over asbestos fibers or nonasbestos matrix material. Do not score empty points for the closest particle. If an asbestos fiber and a matrix particle overlap so that a point is superimposed on their visual intersection, a point is scored for both categories. Point counting provides a determination of the area percent asbestos. Reliable conversion of area percent to percent of dry weight is not currently feasible unless the specific gravities and relative volumes of the materials are known.
For the purpose of this method, “asbestos fibers” are defined as having an aspect ratio greater than 3:1 and being positively identified as one of the minerals in Table 1-1.
A total of 400 points superimposed on either asbestos fibers or nonasbestos matrix material must be counted over at least eight different preparations of representative subsamples. Take eight forcep samples and mount each separately with the appropriate refractive index liquid. The preparation should not be heavily loaded. The sample should be uniformly dispersed to avoid overlapping particles and allow 25-50 percent empty area within the fields of view. Count 50 nonempty points on each preparation, using either
• A cross-hair reticle and mechanical stage; or
• A reticle with 25 points (Chalkley Point Array) and counting at least 2 randomly selected fields.
For samples with mixtures of isotropic and anisotropic materials present, viewing the sample with slightly uncrossed polars or the addition of the compensator plate to the polarized light path will allow simultaneous discrimination of both particle types. Quantitation should be performed at 100X or at the lowest magnification of the polarized light microscope that can effectively distinguish the sample components. Confirmation of the quantitation result by a second analyst on some percentage of analyzed samples should be used as standard quality control procedure.
The percent asbestos is calculated as follows:
% asbestos = (a/n) 100%
where
a = number of asbestos counts,
n = number of nonempty points counted (400).
If a = 0, report “No asbestos detected.” If 0
a≤3, report “
1% asbestos”.
The value reported should be rounded to the nearest percent.

# Section 2. X-Ray Powder Diffraction

# 2.1 Principle and Applicability
The principle of X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) analysis is well established.
1 2
Any solid, crystalline material will diffract an impingent beam of parallel, monochromatic X-rays whenever Bragg's Law,
λ = 2d sin θ,
is satisfied for a particular set of planes in the crystal lattice, where
λ = the X-ray wavelength, Å;
d = the interplanar spacing of the set of reflecting lattice planes, Å; and
θ = the angle of incidence between the X-ray beam and the reflecting lattice planes.
By appropriate orientation of a sample relative to the incident X-ray beam, a diffraction pattern can be generated that, in most cases, will be uniquely characteristic of both the chemical composition and structure of the crystalline phases present.
Unlike optical methods of analysis, however, XRD cannot determine crystal morphology. Therefore, in asbestos analysis, XRD does not distinguish between fibrous and nonfibrous forms of the serpentine and amphibole minerals (Table 2-1). However, when used in conjunction with optical methods such as polarized light microscopy (PLM), XRD techniques can provide a reliable analytical method for the identification and characterization of asbestiform minerals in bulk materials.
For
qualitative analysis
by XRD methods, samples are initially scanned over limited diagnostic peak regions for the serpentine (~7.4 Å) and amphibole (8.2-8.5 Å) minerals (Table 2-2). Standard slow-scanning methods for bulk sample analysis may be used for materials shown by PLM to contain significant amounts of asbestos (
5-10 percent). Detection of minor or trace amounts of asbestos may require special sample preparation and step-scanning analysis. All samples that exhibit diffraction peaks in the diagnostic regions for asbestiform minerals are submitted to a full (5°-60° 2θ; 1° 2θ/min) qualitative XRD scan, and their diffraction patterns are compared with standard reference powder diffraction patterns
3
to verify initial peak assignments and to identify possible matrix interferences when subsequent quantitative analysis will be performed.

Accurate
quantitative analysis
of asbestos in bulk samples by XRD is critically dependent on particle size distribution, crystallite size, preferred orientation and matrix absorption effects, and comparability of standard reference and sample materials. The most intense diffraction peak that has been shown to be free from interference by prior qualitative XRD analysis is selected for quantitation of each asbestiform mineral. A “thin-layer” method of analysis
5 6
is recommended in which, subsequent to comminution of the bulk material to ~10 µm by suitable cryogenic milling techniques, an accurately known amount of the sample is deposited on a silver membrane filter. The
mass of asbestiform material is determined by measuring the integrated area of the selected diffraction peak using a step-scanning mode, correcting for matrix absorption effects, and comparing with suitable calibration standards. Alternative “thick-layer” or bulk methods,
7 8
may be used for
semiquantitative analysis.
This XRD method is applicable as a confirmatory method for identification and quantitation of asbestos in bulk material samples that have undergone prior analysis by PLM or other optical methods.

# 2.2 Range and Sensitivity
The range of the method has not been determined.
The sensitivity of the method has not been determined. It will be variable and dependent upon many factors, including matrix effects (absoprtion and interferences), diagnostic reflections selected, and their relative intensities.

# 2.3 Limitations

# 2.3.1 Interferences
Since the fibrous and nonfibrous forms of the serpentine and amphibole minerals (Table 2-1) are indistinguishable by XRD techniques unless special sample preparation techniques and instrumentation are used,
9
the presence of nonasbestiform serpentines and amphiboles in a sample will pose severe interference problems in the identification and quantitative analysis of their asbestiform analogs.
The use of XRD for identification and quantitation of asbestiform minerals in bulk samples may also be limited by the presence of other interfering materials in the sample. For naturally occurring materials the commonly associated asbestos-related mineral interferences can usually be anticipated. However, for fabricated materials the nature of the interferences may vary greatly (Table 2-3) and present more serious problems in identification and quantitation.
10
Potential interferences are summarized in Table 2-4 and include the following:
•
Chlorite
has major peaks at 7.19 Å and 3.58 Å That interfere with both the primary (7.36 Å) and secondary (3.66 Å) peaks for chrysotile. Resolution of the primary peak to give good quantitative results may be possible when a step-scanning mode of operation is employed.
•
Halloysite
has a peak at 3.63 Å that interferes with the secondary (3.66 Å) peak for chrysotile.
•
Kaolinite
has a major peak at 7.15 Å that may interfere with the primary peak of chrysotile at 7.36 Å when present at concentrations of
10 percent. However, the secondary chrysotile peak at 3.66 Å may be used for quantitation.
•
Gypsum
has a major peak at 7.5 Å that overlaps the 7.36 Å peak of chrysotile when present as a major sample constituent. This may be removed by careful washing with distilled water, or be heating to 300 °C to convert gypsum to plaster of paris.
•
Cellulose
has a broad peak that partially overlaps the secondary (3.66 Å) chrysotile peak.
8
• Overlap of major diagnostic peaks of the amphibole asbestos minerals, amosite, anthophyllite, crocidolite, and tremolite, at approximately 8.3 Å and 3.1 Å causes mutual interference when these minerals occur in the presence of one another. In some instances, adequate resolution may be attained by using step-scanning methods and/or by decreasing the collimator slit width at the X-ray port.

may also interfere with quantitative analysis of the amphibole asbestos minerals, amosite, anthophyllite, crocidolite, and tremolite. Calcium carbonate (CaCO

) has a peak at 3.035 Å that overlaps major amphibole peaks at approximately 3.1 Å when present in concentrations of
5 percent. Removal of carbonates with a dilute acid wash is possible; however, if present, chrysotile may be partially dissolved by this treatment.

• A major
talc
peak at 3.12 Å interferes with the primary tremolite peak at this same position and with secondary peaks of crocidolite (3.10 Å), amosite (3.06 Å), and anthophyllite (3.05 Å). In the presence of talc, the major diagnostic peak at approximately 8.3 Å should be used for quantitation of these asbestiform minerals.
The problem of intraspecies and matrix interferences is further aggravated by the variability of the silicate mineral powder diffraction patterns themselves, which often makes definitive identification of the asbestos minerals by comparison with standard reference diffraction patterns difficult. This variability results from alterations in the crystal lattice associated with differences in isomorphous substitution and degree of crystallinity. This is especially true for the amphiboles. These minerals exhibit a wide variety of very similar chemical compositions, with the result being that their diffraction patterns are chracterized by having major (110) reflections of the monoclinic amphiboles and (210) reflections of the orthorhombic anthophyllite separated by less than 0.2 Å.
12

# 2.3.2 Matrix Effects
If a copper X-ray source is used, the presence of iron at high concentrations in a sample will result in significant X-ray fluorescence, leading to loss of peak intensity along with increased background intensity and an overall decrease in sensitivity. This situation may be corrected by choosing an X-ray source other than copper; however, this is often accompanied both by loss of intensity and by decreased resolution of closely spaced reflections. Alternatively, use of a diffracted beam monochromator will reduce background fluorescent raditation, enabling weaker diffraction peaks to be detected.
X-ray absorption by the sample matrix will result in overall attenuation of the diffracted beam and may seriously interfere with quantitative analysis. Absorption effects may be minimized by using sufficiently “thin” samples for analysis.
5 13 14
However, unless absorption effects are known to be the same for both samples and standards, appropriate corrections should be made by referencing diagnostic peak areas to an internal standard

or filter substrate (Ag) peak.

Because the intensity of diffracted X-radiation is particle-size dependent, it is essential for accurate quantitative analysis that both sample and standard reference materials have similar particle size distributions. The optimum particle size range for quantitative analysis of asbestos by XRD has been reported to be 1 to 10 µm.
15
Comparability of sample and standard reference material particle size distributions should be verified by optical microscopy (or another suitable method) prior to analysis.

# 2.3.4 Preferred Orientation Effects
Preferred orientation of asbestiform minerals during sample preparation often poses a serious problem in quantitative analysis by XRD. A number of techniques have been developed for reducing preferred orientation effects in “thick layer” samples.
7 8 15
However, for “thin” samples on membrane filters, the preferred orientation effects seem to be both reproducible and favorable to enhancement of the principal diagnostic reflections of asbestos minerals, actually increasing the overall sensitivity of the method.
12 14
(Further investigation into preferred orientation effects in both thin layer and bulk samples is required.)

# 2.3.5 Lack of Suitably Characterized Standard Materials
The problem of obtaining and characterizing suitable reference materials for asbestos analysis is clearly recognized. NIOSH has
recently directed a major research effort toward the preparation and characterization of analytical reference materials, including asbestos standards;
16 17
however, these are not available in large quantities for routine analysis.
In addition, the problem of ensuring the comparability of standard reference and sample materials, particularly regarding crystallite size, particle size distribution, and degree of crystallinity, has yet to be adequately addressed. For example, Langer et al.
18
have observed that in insulating matrices, chrysotile tends to break open into bundles more frequently than amphiboles. This results in a line-broadening effect with a resultant decrease in sensitivity. Unless this effect is the same for both standard and sample materials, the amount of chrysotile in the sample will be underestimated by XRD analysis. To minimize this problem, it is recommended that standardized matrix reduction procedures be used for both sample and standard materials.

10

# 2.7.2 Analysis
All samples must be analyzed initially for asbestos content by PLM. XRD should be used as an auxiliary method when a second, independent analysis is requested.

# Note:
Asbestos is a toxic substance. All handling of dry materials should be performed in an operating fume hood.

# 2.7.2.1 Sample Preparation
The method of sample preparation required for XRD analysis will depend on: (1) The condition of the sample received (sample size, homogeneity, particle size distribution, and overall composition as determined by PLM); and (2) the type of XRD analysis to be performed (qualitative, quantitative, thin layer or bulk).
Bulk materials are usually received as inhomogeneous mixtures of complex composition with very wide particle size distributions. Preparation of a homogeneous, representative sample from asbestos-containing materials is particularly difficult because the fibrous nature of the asbestos minerals inhibits mechanical mixing and stirring, and because milling procedures may cause adverse lattice alterations.
A discussion of specific matrix reduction procedures is given below. Complete methods of sample preparation are detailed in Sections 2.7.2.2 and 2.7.2.3.

# Note:
All samples should be examined microscopically before and after each matrix reduction step to monitor changes in sample particle size, composition, and crystallinity, and to ensure sample representativeness and homogeneity for analysis.
2.7.2.1.1
Milling—
Mechanical milling of asbestos materials has been shown to decrease fiber crystallinity, with a resultant decrease in diffraction intensity of the specimen; the degree of lattice alteration is related to the duration and type of milling process.
19 22
Therefore, all milling times should be kept to a minimum.
For
qualitative analysis,
particle size is not usually of critical importance and initial characterization of the material with a minimum of matrix reduction is often desirable to document the composition of the sample as received. Bulk samples of very large particle size (
2-3 mm) should be comminuted to ~100 µm. A mortar and pestle can sometimes be used in size reduction of soft or loosely bound materials though this may cause matting of some samples. Such samples may be reduced by cutting with a razor blade in a mortar, or by grinding in a suitable mill (e.g., a microhammer mill or equivalent). When using a mortar for grinding or cutting, the sample should be moistened with ethanol, or some other suitable wetting agent, to minimize exposures.
For accurate, reproducible
quantitative analysis,
the particle size of both sample and standard materials should be reduced to ~10 µm (see Section 2.3.3). Dry ball milling at liquid nitrogen temperatures (e.g., Spex Freezer Mill, or equivalent) for a maximum time of 10 min. is recommended to obtain satisfactory particle size distributions while protecting the integrity of the crystal lattice.
5
Bulk samples of very large particle size may require grinding in two stages for full matrix reduction to
10 µm.
8 16
Final particle size distributions should always be verified by optical microscopy or another suitable method.
2.7.2.1.2
Low temperature ashing
—For materials shown by PLM to contain large amounts of gypsum, cellulosic, or other organic materials, it may be desirable to ash the samples prior to analysis to reduce background radiation or matrix interference. Since chrysotile undergoes dehydroxylation at temperatures between 550 °C and 650 °C, with subsequent transformation to forsterite,
23 24
ashing temperatures should be kept below 500 °C. Use of a low temperature asher is recommended. In all cases, calibration of the oven is essential to ensure that a maximum ashing temperature of 500 °C is not exceeded.
2.7.2.1.3
Acid leaching
—Because of the interference caused by gypsum and some carbonates in the detection of asbestiform minerals by XRD (see Section 2.3.1), it may be necessary to remove these interferents by a simple acid leaching procedure prior to analysis (see Section 1.7.2.2).

# 2.7.2.2 Qualitative Analysis
2.7.2.2.1
Initial screening of bulk material—
Qualitative analysis should be performed on a representative, homogeneous portion of the sample with a minimum of sample treatment.
1. Grind and mix the sample with a mortar and pestle (or equivalent method, see Section 2.7.2.1.1.) to a final particle size sufficiently small (~100 µm) to allow adequate packing into the sample holder.
2. Pack the sample into a standard bulk sample holder. Care should be taken to ensure that a representative portion of the milled sample is selected for analysis. Particular care should be taken to avoid possible size segregation of the sample. (Note: Use of a back-packing method
25
of bulk sample preparation may reduce preferred orientation effects.)
3. Mount the sample on the diffractometer and scan over the diagnostic peak regions for
the serpentine (~67.4 Å) and amphibole (8.2-8.5 Å) minerals (see Table 2-2). The X-ray diffraction equipment should be optimized for intensity. A slow scanning speed of 1° 2
θ
/min is recommended for adequate resolution. Use of a sample spinner is recommended.
4. Submit all samples that exhibit diffraction peaks in the diagnostic regions for asbestiform minerals to a full qualitative XRD scan (5°-60° 2
θ
; 1°2
θ
/min) to verify initial peak assignments and to identify potential matrix interferences when subsequent quantitative analysis is to be performed.
5. Compare the sample XRD pattern with standard reference powder diffraction patterns (i.e., JCPDS powder diffraction data
3
or those of other well-characterized reference materials). Principal lattice spacings of asbestiform minerals are given in Table 2-2; common constituents of bulk insulation and wall materials are listed in Table 2-3.
2.7.2.2.2
Detection of minor or trace constituents—
Routine screening of bulk materials by XRD may fail to detect small concentrations (
5 percent) of asbestos. The limits of detection will, in general, be improved if matrix absorption effects are minimized, and if the sample particle size is reduced to the optimal 1 to 10 µm range, provided that the crystal lattice is not degraded in the milling process. Therefore, in those instances where confirmation of the presence of an asbestiform mineral at very low levels is required, or where a negative result from initial screening of the bulk material by XRD (see Section 2.7.2.2.1) is in conflict with previous PLM results, it may be desirable to prepare the sample as described for quantitative analysis (see Section 2.7.2.3) and step-scan over appropriate 2
θ
ranges of selected diagnostic peaks (Table 2-2). Accurate transfer of the sample to the silver membrane filter is not necessary unless subsequent quantitative analysis is to be performed.

# 2.7.2.3 Quantitative Analysis
The proposed method for quantitation of asbestos in bulk samples is a modification of the NIOSH-recommended thin-layer method for chrysotile in air.
5
A thick-layer or bulk method involving pelletizing the sample may be used for semiquantitative analysis;
7 8
however, this method requires the addition of an internal standard, use of a specially fabricated sample press, and relatively large amounts of standard reference materials. Additional research is required to evaluate the comparability of thin- and thick-layer methods for quantitative asbestos analysis.
For quantitative analysis by thin-layer methods, the following procedure is recommended:
1. Mill and size all or a substantial representative portion of the sample as outlined in Section 2.7.2.1.1.
2. Dry at 100 °C for 2 hr; cool in a desiccator.
3. Weigh accurately to the nearest 0.01 mg.
4. Samples shown by PLM to contain large amounts of cellulosic or other organic materials, gypsum, or carbonates, should be submitted to appropriate matrix reduction procedures described in Sections 2.7.2.1.2 and 2.7.2.1.3. After ashing and/or acid treatment, repeat the drying and weighing procedures described above, and determine the percent weight loss; L.
5. Quantitatively transfer an accurately weighed amount (50-100 mg) of the sample to a 1-L volumetric flask with approximately 200 mL isopropanol to which 3 to 4 drops of surfactant have been added.
6. Ultrasonicate for 10 min at a power density of approximately 0.1 W/mL, to disperse the sample material.
7. Dilute to volume with isopropanol.
8. Place flask on a magnetic stirring plate. Stir.
9. Place a silver membrane filter on the filtration apparatus, apply a vacuum, and attach the reservoir. Release the vacuum and add several milliliters of isopropanol to the reservoir. Vigorously hand shake the asbestos suspension and immediately withdraw an aliquot from the center of the suspension so that total sample weight, W
T
, on the filter will be approximately 1 mg. Do not adjust the volume in the pipet by expelling part of the suspension; if more than the desired aliquot is withdrawn, discard the aliquot and resume the procedure with a clean pipet. Transfer the aliquot to the reservoir. Filter rapidly under vacuum. Do not wash the reservoir walls. Leave the filter apparatus under vacuum until dry. Remove the reservoir, release the vacuum, and remove the filter with forceps. (Note: Water-soluble matrix interferences such as gypsum may be removed at this time by careful washing of the filtrate with distilled water. Extreme care should be taken not to disturb the sample.)
10. Attach the filter to a flat holder with a suitable adhesive and place on the diffractometer. Use of a sample spinner is recommended.
11. For each asbestos mineral to be quantitated select a reflection (or reflections) that has been shown to be free from interferences by prior PLM or qualitative XRD analysis and that can be used unambiguously as an index of the amount of material present in the sample (see Table 2-2).
12. Analyze the selected diagnostic reflection(s) by step scanning in increments of 0.02° 2
θ
for an appropriate fixed time and integrating the counts. (A fixed count scan may be used alternatively; however, the method chosen should be used consistently for all samples and standards.) An appropriate scanning interval should be selected for each peak, and background corrections made. For a fixed time scan, measure the
background on each side of the peak for one-half the peak-scanning time. The net intensity, I
a
, is the difference between the peak integrated count and the total background count.
13. Determine the net count, I
Ag
, of the filter 2.36 Å silver peak following the procedure in step 12. Remove the filter from the holder, reverse it, and reattach it to the holder. Determine the net count for the unattenuated silver peak, I
A
g.
Scan times may be
less
for measurement of silver peaks than for sample peaks; however, they should be
constant
throughout the analysis.
14. Normalize all raw, net intensities (to correct for instrument instabilities) by referencing them to an external standard (e.g., the 3.34 Å peak of an α-quartz reference crystal). After each unknown is scanned, determine the net count, I
r
, of the reference specimen following the procedure in step 12. Determine the normalized intensities by dividing the peak intensities by I

# 2.8 Calibration

# 2.8.1 Preparation of Calibration Standards
1. Mill and size standard asbestos materials according to the procedure outlined in Section 2.7.2.1.1.
Equivalent, standardized matrix reduction and sizing techniques should be used for both standard and sample materials.
2. Dry at 100 °C for 2 hr; cool in a desiccator.
3. Prepare two suspensions of each standard in isopropanol by weighing approximately 10 and 50 mg of the dry material to the nearest 0.01 mg. Quantitatively transfer each to a 1-L volumetric flask with approximately 200 mL isopropanol to which a few drops of surfactant have been added.
4. Ultrasonicate for 10 min at a power density of approximately 0.1 W/mL, to disperse the asbestos material.
5. Dilute to volume with isopropanol.
6. Place the flask on a magnetic stirring plate. Stir.
7. Prepare, in triplicate, a series of at least five standard filters to cover the desired analytical range, using appropriate aliquots of the 10 and 50 mg/L suspensions and the following procedure.
Mount a silver membrane filter on the filtration apparatus. Place a few milliliters of isopropanol in the reservoir. Vigorously hand shake the asbestos suspension and immediately withdraw an aliquot from the center of the suspension. Do not adjust the volume in the pipet by expelling part of the suspension; if more than the desired aliquot is withdrawn, discard the aliquot and resume the procedure with a clean pipet. Transfer the aliquot to the reservoir. Keep the tip of the pipet near the surface of the isopropanol. Filter rapidly under vacuum. Do not wash the sides of the reservoir. Leave the vacuum on for a time sufficient to dry the filter. Release the vacuum and remove the filter with forceps.

# 2.8.2 Analysis of Calibration Standards
1. Mount each filter on a flat holder. Perform step scans on selected diagnostic reflections of the standards and reference specimen using the procedure outlined in Section 2.7.2.3, step 12, and the same conditions as those used for the samples.
2. Determine the normalized intensity for each peak measured, Î
s
td
, as outlined in Section 2.7.2.3, step 14.

# 2.9 Calculations
For each asbestos reference material, calculate the exact weight deposited on each standard filter from the concentrations of the standard suspensions and aliquot volumes. Record the weight, w, of each standard. Prepare a calibration curve by regressing Î2
s
td
on w. Poor reproducibility (±15 percent RSD) at any given level indicates problems in the sample preparation technique, and a need for new standards. The data should fit a straight line equation.
Determine the slope, m, of the calibration curve in counts/microgram. The intercept, b, of the line with the Î
s
td
axis should be approximately zero. A large negative intercept indicates an error in determining the background. This may arise from incorrectly measuring the baseline or from interference by another phase at the angle of background measurement. A large positive intercept indicates an error in determining the baseline or that an impurity is included in the measured peak.
Using the normalized intensity, Î
Ag
, for the attenuated silver peak of a sample, and the corresponding normalized intensity from the unattenuated silver peak, Î
A
g
, of the sample filter, calculate the transmittance, T, for each sample as follows:

Subpart F [Reserved]

# Subpart G—Asbestos Worker Protection

# Source:
65 FR 69216, Nov. 15, 2000, unless otherwise noted.
§ 763.120
What is the purpose of this subpart?
This subpart protects certain State and local government employees who are not protected by the Asbestos Standards of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). This subpart applies the OSHA Asbestos Standards in 29 CFR 1910.1001 and 29 CFR 1926.1101 to these employees.
§ 763.121
Does this subpart apply to me?
If you are a State or local government employer and you are not subject to a State asbestos standard that OSHA has approved under section 18 of the Occupational Safety and Health Act or a State asbestos plan that EPA has exempted from the requirements of this subpart under § 763.123, you must follow the requirements of this subpart to protect your employees from occupational exposure to asbestos.
§ 763.122
What does this subpart require me to do?
If you are a State or local government employer whose employees perform:
(a) Construction activities identified in 29 CFR 1926.1101(a), you must:
(1) Comply with the OSHA standards in 29 CFR 1926.1101.
(2) Submit notifications required for alternative control methods to the Director, National Program Chemicals Division (7404), Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics, Environmental Protection Agency, 1200 Pennsylvania Ave., NW., Washington, DC 20460.
(b) Custodial activities not associated with the construction activities identified in 29 CFR 1926.1101(a), you must comply with the OSHA standards in 29 CFR 1910.1001.
(c) Repair, cleaning, or replacement of asbestos-containing clutch plates and brake pads, shoes, and linings, or removal of asbestos-containing residue from brake drums or clutch housings, you must comply with the OSHA standards in 29 CFR 1910.1001.
§ 763.123
May a State implement its own asbestos worker protection plan?
This section describes the process under which a State may be exempted from the requirements of this subpart.
(a)
States seeking an exemption.
If your State wishes to implement its own asbestos worker protection plan, rather than complying with the requirements of this subpart, your State must apply for and receive an exemption from EPA.
(1)
What must my State do to apply for an exemption?
To apply for an exemption from the requirements of this subpart, your State must send to the Director of EPA's Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics (OPPT) a copy of its asbestos worker protection regulations and a detailed explanation of how your State's asbestos worker protection plan meets the requirements of TSCA section 18 (15 U.S.C. 2617).
(2)
What action will EPA take on my State's application for an exemption?
EPA will review your State's application and make a preliminary determination whether your State's asbestos worker protection plan meets the requirements of TSCA section 18.
(i) If EPA's preliminary determination is that your State's plan does meet the requirements of TSCA section 18, EPA will initiate a rulemaking, including an opportunity for public comment, to exempt your State from the requirements of this subpart. After considering any comments, EPA will issue a final rule granting or denying the exemption.
(ii) If EPA's preliminary determination is that the State plan does not meet the requirements of TSCA section 18, EPA will notify your State in writing and will give your State a reasonable opportunity to respond to that determination.
(iii) If EPA does not grant your State an exemption, then the State and local government employers in your State are subject to the requirements of this subpart.
(b)
States that have been granted an exemption.
If EPA has exempted your State from the requirements of this subpart, your State must update its asbestos worker protection regulations as necessary to implement changes to meet the requirements of this subpart, and must apply to EPA for an amendment to its exemption.
(1)
What must my State do to apply for an amendment to its exemption?
To apply for an amendment to its exemption, your State must send to the Director of OPPT a copy of its updated asbestos worker protection regulations and a detailed explanation of how your State's updated asbestos worker protection plan meets the requirements of TSCA section 18. Your State must submit its application for an amendment within 6 months of the effective date of any changes to the requirements of this subpart, or within a reasonable time agreed upon by your State and OPPT.
(2)
What action will EPA take on my State's application for an amendment?
EPA will review your State's application for an amendment and make a preliminary determination whether your State's updated asbestos worker protection plan meets the requirements of TSCA section 18.
(i) If EPA determines that the updated State plan does meet the requirements of TSCA section 18, EPA will issue your State an amended exemption.
(ii) If EPA determines that the updated State plan does not meet the requirements of TSCA section 18, EPA will notify your State in writing and will give your State a reasonable opportunity to respond to that determination.
(iii) If EPA does not grant your State an amended exemption, or if your State does not submit a timely request for amended exemption, then the State and local government employers in your State are subject to the requirements of this subpart.

[59 FR 33209, June 28, 1994]
§ 763.173
Exemptions.
(a) Persons who are subject to the prohibitions imposed by § 763.165, § 763.167, or § 763.169 may file an application for an exemption. Persons whose exemption applications are approved by the Agency may manufacture, import, process, or distribute in commerce the banned product as specified in the Agency's approval of the application. No applicant for an exemption may continue the banned activity that is the subject of an exemption application after the effective date of the ban unless the Agency has granted the exemption or the applicant receives an extension under paragraph (b)(4) or (5) of this section.
(b) Application filing dates. (1) Applications for products affected by the prohibitions under §§ 763.165(a) and 763.167(a) may be submitted at any time and will be either granted or denied by EPA as soon as is feasible.
(2) Applications for products affected by the ban under § 763.169(a) may be submitted at any time and will be either granted or denied by EPA as soon as is feasible.
(3) Applications for products affected by the ban under §§ 763.165(b) and 763.167(b) may not be submitted prior to February 27, 1995. Complete applications received after that date, but before August 25, 1995, will be either granted or denied by the Agency prior to the effective date of the ban for the product. Applications received after August 25, 1995, will be either granted or denied by EPA as soon as is feasible.
(4) Applications for products affected by the ban under § 763.169(b) may not be submitted prior to February 26, 1996. Complete applications received after that date, but before August 26, 1996, will be either granted or denied by the Agency prior to the effective date of the ban for the product. Applications received after August 26, 1996, will be either granted or denied by EPA as soon as is feasible.
(5) The Agency will consider an application for an exemption from a ban under § 763.169 for a product at the same time the applicant submits an application for an exemption from a ban under § 763.165 or § 763.167 for that product. EPA will grant an exemption at that time from a ban under § 763.169 if the Agency determines it appropriate to do so.
(6) If the Agency denies an application less than 30 days before the effective date of a ban for a product, the applicant can continue the activity for 30 days after receipt of the denial from the Agency.
(7) If the Agency fails to meet the deadlines stated in paragraphs (b)(3) and (b)(4) of this section for granting or denying a complete application in instances in which the deadline is before the effective date of the ban to which the application applies, the applicant will be granted an extension of 1 year from the Agency's deadline date. During this extension period the applicant may continue the activity that is the subject of the exemption application. The Agency will either grant or deny the application during the extension period. The extension period will terminate either on the date the Agency grants the application or 30 days after the applicant receives the Agency's denial of the application. However, no extension will be granted if the Agency is scheduled to grant or deny an application at some date after the effective date of the ban, pursuant to the deadlines stated in paragraphs (b)(3) and (b)(4) of this section.
(c) Where to file. All applications must be submitted to the following location: TSCA Docket Receipts Office (7407), Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Rm E-G99, 1200 Pennsylvania Ave., NW., Washington, DC 20460, ATTENTION: Asbestos Exemption. For information regarding the submission of exemptions containing information claimed as confidential business information (CBI), see § 763.179.
(d) Content of application and criteria for decisionmaking.
(1) Content of application. Each application must contain the following:
(i) Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant.
(ii) Description of the manufacturing, import, processing, and/or distribution in commerce activity for which an exemption is requested, including a description of the asbestos-containing product to be manufactured, imported, processed, or distributed in commerce.
(iii) Identification of locations at which the exempted activity would take place.
(iv) Length of time requested for exemption (maximum length of an exemption is 4 years).
(v) Estimated amount of asbestos to be used in the activity that is the subject of the exemption application.
(vi) Data demonstrating the exposure level over the life cycle of the product that is the subject of the application.
(vii) Data concerning:
(A) The extent to which non-asbestos substitutes for the product that is the subject of the application fall significantly short in performance under necessary product standards or requirements, including laws or ordinances mandating product safety standards.
(B) The costs of non-asbestos substitutes relative to the costs of the asbestos-containing product and, in the case in which the product is a component of another product, the effect on the cost of the end use product of using the substitute component.
(C) The extent to which the product or use serves a high-valued use.
(viii) Evidence of demonstrable good faith attempts by the applicant to develop and use a non-asbestos substance or product which may be substituted for the asbestos-containing product or the asbestos in the product or use that is the subject to the application.
(ix) Evidence, in addition to that provided in the other information required with the application, showing that the continued manufacture, importation,
processing, distribution in commerce, and use, as applicable, of the product will not present an unreasonable risk of injury to human health.
(2) Criteria for decision (existing products). After considering all the information provided by an applicant under paragraphs (d)(1) and (e) of this section, and any other information available to EPA, EPA will grant an exemption from the prohibitions in § 763.165, § 763.167, or § 763.169 for an applicant's asbestos-containing product only if EPA determines both of the following:
(i) The applicant has made good faith attempts to develop and use a non-asbestos substance or product which may be substituted for the asbestos-containing product or the asbestos in the product or use, and those attempts have failed to produce a substitute or a substitute that results in a product that can be economically produced.
(ii) Continued manufacturing, processing, distribution in commerce, and use, as applicable, of the product will not present an unreasonable risk of injury to human health.
(3) Criteria for decision (new products). Requests to develop and use an asbestos substance or product will be treated as a petition pursuant to section 21 of TSCA.
(e) The Agency reserves the right to request further information from an exemption applicant if necessary to complete the Agency's evaluation of an application.
(f) Upon receipt of a complete application, the Agency will issue a notice in the
Federal Register
announcing its receipt and invite public comments on the merits of the application.
(g) If the application does not include all of the information required in paragraph (d) of this section, the Agency will return it to the applicant as incomplete and any resubmission of the application will be considered a new application for purposes of the availability of any extension period. If the application is substantially inadequate to allow the Agency to make a reasoned judgment on any of the information required in paragraph (d) of this section and the Agency chooses to request additional information from the applicant, the Agency may also determine that an extension period provided for in paragraph (b)(5) of this section is unavailable to the applicant.
(h) When denying an application, the Agency will notify the applicant by registered mail of its decision and rationale. Whenever possible, the Agency will send this letter prior to the appropriate ban. This letter will be considered a final Agency action for purposes of judicial review. A notice announcing the Agency's denial of the application will be published in the
Federal Register.
(i) If the Agency proposes to approve an exemption, it will issue a notice in the
Federal Register
announcing this intent and invite public comments. If, after considering any timely comments received, the Agency approves an exemption, its decision will be published in the
Federal Register.
This notice will be considered a final Agency action for purposes of judicial review.
(j) The length of an exemption period will be specified by the agency when it approves the exemption. To extend an exemption period beyond the period stipulated by EPA, applicants must submit a new application to the Agency, following the application procedures described in this section. Applications may not be submitted prior to 15 months before the expiration of the exemption period, unless stated otherwise in the notice granting the exemption. Applications received between 15 months and 1 year before the end of the exemption period will be either granted or denied by the Agency before the end of the exemption period. Applications received after the date 1 year prior to the end of the exemption period will be either granted or denied by the Agency as soon as is feasible. Applicants may not continue the activity that is the subject of the renewal application after the date of the end of the exemption period.

[54 FR 29507, July 12, 1989, as amended at 54 FR 46898, Nov. 8, 1989; 58 FR 34205, June 23, 1993]
§ 763.179
Confidential business information claims.
(a) Applicants for exemptions under § 763.173 may assert a Confidential Business Information (CBI) claim for information in an exemption application or supplement submitted to the Agency under this subpart only if the claim is asserted in accordance with this section, and release of the information would reveal trade secrets or confidential commercial or financial information, as provided in section 14(a) of the Act. Information covered by a CBI claim will be treated in accordance with the procedures set forth in 40 CFR part 2, subpart B. The Agency will place all information not claimed as CBI in the manner described in this section in a public file without further notice to the applicant.
(b) Applicants may assert CBI claims only at the time they submit a completed exemption application and only in the specified manner. If no such claim accompanies the information when it is received by the Agency, the information may be made available to the public without further notice to the applicant. Submitters that claim information as business confidential must do so by writing the word “Confidential” at the top of the page on which the information appears and by underlining, circling, or placing brackets ([ ]) around the information claimed CBI.
(c) Applicants who assert a CBI claim for submitted information must provide the Agency with two copies of their exemption application. The first copy must be complete and contain all
information being claimed as CBI. The second copy must contain only information not claimed as CBI. The Agency will place the second copy of the submission in a public file. Failure to furnish a second copy of the submission when information is claimed as CBI in the first copy will be considered a presumptive waiver of the claim of confidentiality. The Agency will notify the applicant by certified mail that a finding of a presumptive waiver of the claim of confidentiality has been made. The applicant has 30 days from the date of receipt of notification to submit the required second copy. Failure to submit the second copy will cause the Agency to place the first copy in a public file.
(d) Applicants must substantiate all claims of CBI at the time the applicant asserts the claim, i.e., when the exemption application or supplement is submitted, by responding to the questions in paragraph (e) of this section. Failure to provide substantiation of a claim at the time the applicant submits the application will result in a waiver of the CBI claim, and the information may be disclosed to the public without further notice to the applicant.
(e) Applicants who assert any CBI claims must substantiate all claims by providing detailed responses to the following:
(1) Is this information subject to a patent or patent application in the United States or elsewhere? If so, why is confidentiality necessary?
(2) For what period do you assert a claim of confidentiality? If the claim is to extend until a certain event or point in time, please indicate that event or time period. Explain why such information should remain confidential until such point.
(3) Has the information that you are claiming as confidential been disclosed to persons outside of your company? Will it be disclosed to such persons in the future? If so, what restrictions, if any, apply to use or further disclosure of the information?
(4) Briefly describe measures taken by your company to guard against undesired disclosure of the information you are claiming as confidential to others.
(5) Does the information claimed as confidential appear or is it referred to in advertising or promotional materials for the product or the resulting end product, safety data sheets or other similar materials for the product or the resulting end product, professional or trade publications, or any other media available to the public or to your competitors? If you answered yes, indicate where the information appears.
(6) If the Agency disclosed the information you are claiming as confidential to the public, how difficult would it be for the competitor to enter the market for your product? Consider in your answer such constraints as capital and marketing cost, specialized technical expertise, or unusual processes.
(7) Has the Agency, another Federal agency, or a Federal court made any confidentiality determination regarding this information? If so, provide copies of such determinations.
(8) How would your company's competitive position be harmed if the Agency disclosed this information? Why should such harm be considered substantial? Describe the causal relationship between the disclosure and harm.
(9) In light of section 14(b) of TSCA, if you have claimed information from a health and safety study as confidential, do you assert that disclosure of this information would disclose a process used in the manufacturing or processing of a product or information unrelated to the effects of asbestos on human health and the environment? If your answer is yes, explain.

§ 766.14
Contents of protocols.
Protocols should include all parts of the
Quality Assurance Plan for Measurement of Brominated or Chlorinated Dibenzofurans and Dibenzodioxins,
as stated in the Guidelines. For each chemical substance and each process, the manufacturer must submit a statement of how many grades of the chemical substance it produces, a justification for selection of the specific grade of chemical substance for testing, specific plans for collection of samples from the process stream, naming the point of collection, the method of collecting the sample, and an estimate of how well the samples will represent the material to be characterized; a description of how control samples (blanks) and HDD/HDF-reinforced control samples, or isotopically labeled compounds (standards) and duplicate samples will be handled; a description of the chemical extraction and clean up procedures to be used; how extraction efficiency and measurement efficiency will be established; and a description of instrument hardware and operating conditions, including type and source of columns, carrier gas and flow rate, operating temperature range, and ion source temperature.
§ 766.16
Developing the analytical test method.
Because of the matrix differences of the chemicals listed for testing, no one method for sample selection, preparation, extraction and clean up is prescribed. For analysis, High Resolution Gas Chromatography (HRGC) with High Resolution Mass Spectrometry (HRMS) is the method of choice, but other methods may be used if they can be demonstrated to reach the target LOQs as well as HRGC/HRMS.
(a)
Sample selection.
The chemical product to be tested should be sampled so that the specimens collected for analysis are representative of the whole. Additional guidance for sample selection is provided under § 766.12.
(b)
Sample preparation.
The sample must be mechanically homogenized and subsampled as necessary. Subsamples must be spiked or reinforced with surrogate compounds or with standard stock solutions, and the surrogates or standards must be thoroughly incorporated by mechanical agitation. Additional guidance is provided under § 766.12.
(c)
Sample extraction and cleanup.
The spiked samples must be treated to separate the HDDs/HDFs from the sample matrix. Methods are reviewed in the Guidelines under § 766.12, but the final method or methods are left to the discretion of the analyst, provided the instrumental response of the surrogates meets the criteria listed in the
Quality Assurance Plan for Measurement of Brominated or Chlorinated Dibenzofurans and Dibenzodioxins,
Appendixes B and C of the Guidelines. Cleanup techniques are described in the Guidelines. These
are chosen at the discretion of the analyst to meet the requirements of the chemical matrix.
(d)
Analysis.
The method of choice is High Resolution Gas Chromatographic/High Resolution Mass Spectrometric Determination, (HRGC/HRMS) but alternate methods may be used if the manufacturer can demonstrate that the method will reach the target LOQs as well as HRGC/HRMS. Specific operating requirements are found in the Guidelines.
§ 766.18
Method sensitivity.
The target level of quantitation required under § 766.27 for each HDD/HDF congener is the level which must be attempted for each resolved HRGC peak for that congener. For at least one product sample, at least two analyses of the same isotopically labeled HDD/HDF internal calibration standards spiked to a final product concentration equal to the LOQ for that congener must be reproducibly extracted, cleaned up, and quantified to within ±20 percent of each other. For each spiked product sample, the signal to noise ratio for the calibration standard peaks after complete extraction and cleanup must be 10:1 or greater. The recovery of the internal calibration standards in the extracted and cleaned up product samples must be within 50 to 150 percent of the amount spiked, and the results must be corrected for recovery.

# Subpart B—Specific Chemical Testing/Reporting Requirements
§ 766.20
Who must test.
(a) Any person who manufactures, imports, or processes a chemical substance listed in § 766.25 must test that chemical substance and must submit appropriate information to EPA according to the schedules described in § 766.35. Chemical substances manufactured, imported or processed between January 1, 1984 and the date of promulgation of this part are subject to testing upon the effective date of this part. All other chemical substances are subject to testing immediately upon manufacture, import or processing. EPA expects that only manufacturers and importers will perform testing, and that the cost of testing will be passed on to processors through the pricing mechanism, thereby enabling them to share in the cost of testing. However, processors will be called upon to sponsor testing should manufacturers and importers fail to do so. A processor may apply for an exemption from testing upon certification to EPA that a manufacturer or importer is testing the chemical substance which that person processes.
(b) If no manufacturer or importer described in § 766.20 submits a letter of intent to perform testing within the period described under § 766.35(a), or an exemption application under § 790.45(a), or a request for an exclusion or waiver under § 766.32, EPA will issue a notice in the
Federal Register
to notify all processors of that chemical substance. The notice will state that EPA has not received any of the documents described in the previous sentence, and that current processors will have 30 days to submit either a letter of intent to perform the test or submit an exemption application.
(c) If no manufacturer, importer or processor submits a letter of intent to perform testing of a specific chemical substance produced by a specific process, EPA will notify all manufacturers, importers, and processors, either by notice in the
Federal Register
or by letter, that all exemption applications will be denied and that within 30 days all manufacturers, importers, and processors will be in violation of this part until a proposed study plan is submitted for required testing.
(d) Manufacturers, importers, and processors who are subject to this part must comply with the test rule development and exemption procedures in part 790 of this chapter, except as modified in this part.

§ 766.28
Expert review of protocols.
EPA will gather a panel of experts in analysis of chemical matrices for HDDs/HDFs to review the protocols for testing submitted to EPA. The panel members will be employees of EPA and/or of other U.S. Government agencies who have had experience in analysis of chemical matrices and/or chemical wastes for HDDs/HDFs. The panel will recommend to the Director, EPA Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics, whether the protocol submitted is likely to allow analysis down to the target LOQs, or if not, whether the protocol represents a good faith effort on the part of the tester to achieve the
lowest possible LOQs. The final determination to accept or reject the protocol will be made by the Director, Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics. EPA will review the submitted protocols as rapidly as possible and will complete the review within 90 days after receipt. EPA may require submission of revised protocols. Comments and recommendations will be transmitted to the submitter, and if revisions are required, a final protocol must be submitted to EPA within 90 days after EPA transmits such recommendations.
§ 766.32
Exclusions and waivers.
(a)
Reasons for exclusions and waivers.
Any person subject to the testing requirements of this part may request an exclusion or waiver from testing for any one of the following reasons:
(1)
Exclusions may be granted if.
(i) Testing of the appropriate grade of the chemical substance has already been carried out, either analytical testing at the lowest LOQ possible, with appropriate QA/QC, or a well-designed bioassay with appropriate QA/QC or;
(ii) Process and reaction conditions of the chemical substance such that no HDDs/HDFs could be produced under those conditions;
(2)
Waivers may be granted if.
(i) A responsible company official certifies that the chemical substance is produced only in quantities of 100 kilograms or less per year, only for research and development purposes; or
(ii) In the judgement of EPA, the cost of testing would drive the chemical substance off the market, or prevent resumption of manufacture or import of the chemical substance, if it is not currently manufactured, and the chemical substance will be produced so that no unreasonable risk will occur due to its manufacture, import, processing, distribution, use, or disposal. (In this case, the manufacturer must submit to EPA all data supporting the determination.)
(iii) Waivers may be appropriately conditioned with respect to such factors as time and conditions of manufacture or use. The grade of decabromodiphenyl oxide produced by Dow Chemical Company (Dow) for the National Toxicology Program (NTP) bioassay on that chemical is excluded from the testing requirement under this part. Provided, however, that this exclusion will not apply if Dow fails to supply to EPA within 60 days of the effective date of this section evidence showing which grade was used for the NTP bioassay.
(b)
Timing.
Exclusion or waiver requests and detailed supporting data must be submitted to EPA within 60 days from the effective date of this part for persons manufacturing, importing or processing a chemical substance as of the date of promulgation, or 60 days prior to the date of resumption of manufacture or import for a chemical substance produced by a specific process if the chemical substance is not manufactured, imported or processed as of the date of promulgation.
(c)
Publication.
Within 10 days of receipt of any exclusion or waiver request, EPA will issue in the
Federal Register
a notice of such receipt. EPA will also issue a notice of its decision on each exclusion or waiver request within 60 days of receipt.
(d)
Decision.
The EPA Director of the Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics will make the decision to grant or deny waivers or exclusions.

(viii) A description of the TPC's experience with test method ASTM E1333-14 and/or ASTM D6007-14, if used, (incorporated by reference, see § 770.99), and experience evaluating correlation between test methods. Applicant TPCs that have experience with test method ASTM D6007-14 only, must be contracting testing with a laboratory that has a large chamber and describe its experience with ASTM E1333-14; and
(ix) If not a domestic entity, the name and address of an agent for service located in the United States. Service on this agent constitutes service on the TPC or any of its officers or employees for any action by EPA or otherwise by the United States related to the requirements of this part. TPCs may share an agent for service.
(3)
Impartiality.
EPA TSCA Title VI TPCs must act impartially in accordance with their accreditation when performing activities under the EPA TSCA Title VI Third-Party Certification Program. To demonstrate impartiality, TPCs must:
(i) Not also be, or have a financial interest in a panel producer, fabricator, laminated product producer, importer, designer, distributor or retailer of composite wood products;
(ii) Ensure that TPC management personnel and TPC personnel involved in the review and certification decision-making process for composite wood products are not involved in activities within the same or separate legal entity that may compromise the impartiality of its certification decision-making process, such as advocacy or consulting activities;
(iii) Ensure that TPC management personnel and TPC personnel of the same or separate legal entity involved in activities such as advocacy or consulting are not involved in the management of the certification body, the review, or the certification decisions; and
(iv) Ensure that TPC management personnel and TPC personnel certifying composite wood products sign a conflict of interest statement attesting that they will receive no financial benefit from the outcome of certification.
(4)
Responsibilities.
Each EPA TSCA Title VI TPC has the following responsibilities under the EPA TSCA Title VI Third-Party Certification Program:
(i)
Certification.
EPA TSCA Title VI TPCs certify composite wood products that are produced in accordance with this part and that comply with the emission standards of TSCA Title VI and this part, in accordance with ISO/IEC 17065:2012(E) (incorporated by reference, see § 770.99). For each panel producer making composite wood products certified by the TPC, the EPA TSCA Title VI TPC must:
(A) Verify that each panel producer has adequate quality assurance and quality control procedures and is complying with the applicable quality assurance and quality control requirements of this part;
(B) Verify each panel producer's quality control test results compared with test results from ASTM E1333-14 and ASTM D6007-14, if used, (incorporated by reference, see § 770.99) by having the
TPC laboratory conduct quarterly tests and evaluate test method equivalence and correlation as required under § 770.20;
(C) In consultation with the panel producer, establish quality control limits (QCLs) for formaldehyde emissions, and, if applicable, shipping quality control limits or other formaldehyde emission limits, for each panel producer and product type;
(D) Establish, for each panel producer, the process that will be used to determine if products are exceeding the applicable QCL;
(E) Provide its CARB or EPA TPC number to each panel producer for labeling and recordkeeping; and
(F) Inspect each panel producer, its products, and its records at least quarterly in conformance with ISO/IEC 17020:2012(E) as required under ISO/IEC 17065:2012(E) section 6.2.1 and section 6.2.2 (incorporated by reference, see § 770.99).
(G) In the event a government entity has identified the existence of unsafe conditions (e.g., natural disasters, outbreaks, political unrest, epidemics, and pandemics) in the area of a composite wood product manufacturing panel producer that would prevent the required quarterly inspections from being conducted in-person on-site, a TPC may opt to perform a remote quarterly inspection in lieu of the in-person on-site inspection. Such a remote inspection may occur only during the period of the unsafe conditions. For such a remote inspection during the period of the unsafe conditions, the TPC must conduct a remote quarterly inspection via live remote technology (e.g., video/teleconference) operating as directed by the TPC to satisfy the requirements of paragraph (c)(4)(i)(F) of this section, and work with the panel producer quality control manager at that time to select, package, sign, and ship the TPC panels/samples for the quarterly test according to § 770.20(c). TPCs and panel producers must remain in close communication with each other to ensure any changes or developments that might affect the panel producer or product type certification are managed according to the TSCA Title VI regulations in this part. The standard practice for a TPC providing certification services for composite wood panel producers remains that a TPC conducts in-person quarterly inspections and sample collection, packaging, signature, and shipping for quality control testing.
(ii)
Laboratories.
For quarterly testing, each EPA TSCA Title VI TPC must use only laboratories that have been accredited by an EPA TSCA Title VI Laboratory AB and that either participate in the CARB interlaboratory comparison for formaldehyde emissions when offered or in an EPA-recognized proficiency or interlaboratory program, if available.
(iii)
NAF and ULEF.
For panel producers that do not receive approval for NAF or ULEF third-party certification exemptions or ULEF reduced testing from CARB, EPA TSCA Title VI TPCs must review applications for NAF or ULEF third-party certification exemptions or ULEF reduced testing. Each EPA TSCA Title VI TPC must approve these applications within 90 calendar days of receipt if the panel producer demonstrates that the requirements for third-party certification exemption under § 770.17 or § 770.18 or reduced testing under § 770.18 are met.
(iv)
Reduced testing for medium-density fiberboard or fiberboard.
EPA TSCA Title VI TPCs must review applications from panel producers to reduce the number of quality control tests for particleboard and medium-density fiberboard, and approve these applications within 90 calendar days of receipt if the panel producer demonstrates that the requirements for reduced testing under § 770.20(b)(2)(ii) are met.
(v)
Notifications to EPA.
Each EPA TSCA Title VI TPC must provide, in accordance with § 770.8, the following notifications to EPA, as applicable:
(A) Notification of an approved or rejected application, including a renewal application, for a NAF or ULEF third-party certification exemption or ULEF reduced testing within five calendar days of the approval or rejection with copies of all approved applications forwarded to EPA within 30 calendar days of approval.
(B) Notification of an approved or rejected application, including a renewal application, for reduced testing for medium-density fiberboard or
particleboard within five calendar days of the approval or rejection with copies of all approved applications forwarded to EPA within 30 calendar days of approval.
(C) Notification of a panel producer exceeding its established QCL for three consecutive quality control tests within 72 hours of the time that the TPC becomes aware of the third consecutive exceedance. The notice must include the product type, dates of the quality control tests that exceeded the QCL, quality control test results, ASTM E1333-14 (incorporated by reference, see § 770.99) or ASTM D6007-14 method (incorporated by reference, see § 770.99) correlative equivalent values in accordance with § 770.20(d), the established QCL value(s) and the quality control method used.
(D) Notification of each failed quarterly test, that is any sample that exceeds the applicable formaldehyde emission standard in § 770.10, within 72 hours. Information in this notification is not eligible for treatment as confidential business information.
(E) Notification of a change in a non-domestic TPC's agent for service within five calendar days.
(F) Notification of a loss of accreditation or notification that the TPC has discontinued its participation in the EPA TSCA Title VI Third-Party Certification Program must be provided within 72 hours.
(vi)
Other notifications.
Each EPA TSCA Title VI TPC must provide the following notifications, if applicable:
(A) Notification of each failed quarterly test, that is any sample that exceeds the applicable formaldehyde emission standard in § 770.10, to the panel producer in writing within 72 hours. Information in this notification is not eligible for treatment as confidential business information.

(iv) Composite wood products that have been approved by an EPA TSCA Title VI TPC or CARB for reduced testing under § 770.18(b) through (c) must be tested at least once per week per product type and, for particle board and medium-density fiberboard, per production line, for products produced that week, except that hardwood plywood panel producers who qualify for less frequent testing under paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(D) of this section may continue to perform quality control testing under that provision.
(3)
Results.
Any test result that exceeds the QCL established pursuant to § 770.7(c)(4)(i)(C) must be reported to the EPA TSCA Title VI TPC in writing within 72 hours. The panel producer must comply with § 770.22 with respect to any lot represented by a quality control sample that exceeds the QCL. Where multiple products are grouped in a single product type for testing, this includes all products in the group represented by the sample.
(c)
Quarterly testing.
Quarterly testing must be supervised by EPA TSCA Title VI TPCs and performed by TPC laboratories.
(1)
Allowable methods.
Quarterly testing must be performed using ASTM E1333-14 (incorporated by reference, see § 770.99) or, with a showing of equivalence pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section, ASTM D6007-14 (incorporated by reference, see § 770.99).
(2)
Sample selection.
(i) Samples must be randomly chosen by an EPA TSCA Title VI TPC.
(ii) Samples must be selected from each certified product type for quarterly testing purposes. For hardwood plywood samples, the samples must be randomly selected from products that represent the range of formaldehyde emissions of products produced by the panel producer.
(iii) Samples must not include the top or the bottom composite wood product of a bundle.
(iv) Test results may represent a single chamber value or, if using the ASTM D6007-14 apparatus, the average value of testing nine specimens representing evenly distributed portions of an entire panel. The nine specimens must be tested in groups of three specimens, resulting in three data points, which must be averaged to represent one test value for the panel those specimens represent.
(3)
Sample handling.
Samples must be closely stacked or air-tight wrapped between the time of sample selection and the start of test conditioning. Samples must be labeled as such, signed by the EPA TSCA Title VI TPC, bundled air-tight, wrapped in polyethylene, protected by cover sheets, and promptly shipped to the TPC laboratory. Conditioning must begin as soon as possible, but no later than 30 calendar days after the samples were produced.

Results.
Any sample that exceeds the applicable formaldehyde emission standard in § 770.10 must be reported by the EPA TSCA Title VI TPC to the panel producer in writing and to EPA, in accordance with § 770.8, within 72 hours. The panel producer must comply with § 770.22 with respect to any lot represented by a sample result that exceeds the applicable formaldehyde emission standard. Where multiple products are grouped in a single product type for testing, this includes all products in the group represented by the sample.
(5)
Reduced testing frequency.
Composite wood products that have been approved by an EPA TSCA Title VI TPC or CARB for reduced testing under § 770.18(c) need only undergo quarterly testing every six months.
(d)
Equivalence or correlation.
Equivalence between ASTM E1333-14 (incorporated by reference, see § 770.99) and ASTM D6007-14 (incorporated by reference, see § 770.99) must be demonstrated by EPA TSCA Title VI TPCs at least once each year or whenever there is a significant change in equipment, procedure, or the qualifications of testing personnel, or reason to believe that the equivalence is no longer valid. Equivalence may be demonstrated between several similar model or size and construction ASTM E1333-14 (incorporated by reference, see § 770.99) and ASTM D6007-14 (incorporated by reference, see § 770.99) apparatuses located in the same EPA TSCA Title VI TPC laboratory. Once equivalence has been established for three consecutive years, equivalence must be demonstrated every two years or whenever there is a significant change in equipment, procedure, or the qualifications of testing personnel. Correlation between ASTM E1333-14 (incorporated by reference, see § 770.99) or, upon a showing of equivalence in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section, ASTM D6007-14 (incorporated by reference, see § 770.99) and any other test method used for quality control testing must be demonstrated by EPA TSCA Title VI TPCs or panel producers, respectively, before the certification of composite wood products, and then whenever there is a significant change in equipment, procedure, the qualifications of testing personnel, or reason to believe that the correlation is no longer valid. Correlation may be established between several similar model or size and construction mill quality control test methods defined in paragraph (b)(1) of this section located at any one physical mill quality control testing laboratory to the EPA TSCA Title VI TPC's laboratory's ASTM E1333-14 (incorporated by reference, see § 770.99) and/or ASTM D6007-14 (incorporated by reference, see § 770.99) apparatus. If the TPC laboratory's ASTM E1333-14 or equivalent ASTM D6007-14 test chamber is used for panel producer quality control testing, no correlation as determined in paragraph (d)(2) of this section would be required. Equivalence and correlation sample selection should be conducted in accordance with paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section.
(1)
Equivalence between ASTM E1333-14 and ASTM D6007-14 when used by the TPC for quarterly testing.
Equivalence must be demonstrated for at least five comparison sample sets in each range tested by the TPC, which compare the results of the two methods. Equivalence must be demonstrated for any ranges listed in paragraph (d)(1)(iv) of
this section that represent the formaldehyde emissions of composite wood products tested by the TPC.
(i)
Samples.
(A) For the ASTM E1333-14 method (incorporated by reference, see § 770.99), each comparison sample must consist of the result of testing panels, using the applicable loading ratios specified in the ASTM E1333-14 method (incorporated by reference, see § 770.99), from similar panels of the same product type tested by the ASTM D6007-14 method (incorporated by reference, see § 770.99).
(B) For the ASTM D6007-14 method (incorporated by reference, see § 770.99), each comparison sample shall consist of testing specimens representing portions of panels similar to the panels tested in the ASTM E1333-14 method (incorporated by reference, see § 770.99) and matched to their respective ASTM E1333-14 method (incorporated by reference, see § 770.99) comparison sample result. The ratio of air flow to sample surface area specified in ASTM D6007-14 (incorporated by reference, see § 770.99) must be used.
(C) The five comparison sample must consist of testing a minimum of five sample sets as measured by the ASTM E1333-14 method (incorporated by reference, see § 770.99).
(ii)
Average and standard deviation.
The arithmetic mean,
x,
and standard deviation,
S,
of the difference of all comparison sets must be calculated as follows:
ER07FE18.001
Where
x
= arithmetic mean;
S
= standard deviation;
n
= number of sets;
D
i = difference between the ASTM E1333-14 and ASTM D6007-14 method (incorporated by reference, see § 770.99) values for the
i
th set; and
i
ranges from 1 to
n.
(iii)
Equivalence determination.
The ASTM D6007-14 method (incorporated by reference, see § 770.99) is considered equivalent to the ASTM E1333-14 method (incorporated by reference, see § 770.99) if the following condition is met:
|
X
| + 0.88
S
≤
C
Where
C
is equal to:
0.026 for the lower range;
0.038 for the intermediate range; and
0.052 for the upper range.
(iv)
Equivalence Ranges.
EPA TSCA Title VI TPCs must demonstrate equivalence in at least two of the three formaldehyde emission ranges listed in paragraphs (d)(1)(iv)(A) through (C) of this section unless the EPA TSCA Title VI TPC will only certify hardwood plywood products in the low range. If the EPA TSCA Title VI TPC will only certify hardwood plywood products in the low range, the EPA TSCA Title VI TPC may demonstrate equivalence in only that range and would then be restricted to only certifying those composite wood products in that range. Equivalence in one range must be demonstrated for at least five comparison sample sets in that range which compare the two methods.
(A)
Lower Range:
Less than, or equal to 0.05 ppm.
(B)
Intermediate Range:
Greater than 0.05 ppm to less than or equal to 0.15 ppm.
(C)
Upper Range:
Greater than 0.15 ppm.
(2)
Correlation between ASTM E-1333-14 (incorporated by reference, see § 770.99), or equivalent ASTM D6007-14 (incorporated by reference, see § 770.99), and any quality control test method.
Correlation must be demonstrated by establishing an acceptable correlation coefficient (“r” value) or following the threshold approach at paragraph (d)(2)(i)(B) of this section.
(i)
Correlation.
The correlation must be based on a minimum sample size of
five data pairs and a simple linear regression (unless the threshold approach at paragraph (d)(2)(i)(B) of this section is used) where the dependent variable (Y-axis) is the quality control test value and the independent variable (X-axis) is the ASTM E1333-14 (incorporated by reference, see § 770.99) test value or, upon a showing of equivalence in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section, the equivalent ASTM D6007-14 (incorporated by reference, see § 770.99) test value. Either composite wood products or formaldehyde emissions reference materials can be used to establish the correlation.
(A)
Cluster Approach.
A panel producer may work with its EPA TSCA Title VI TPC to develop a correlation and linear regression between the TPC's ASTM E1333-14 (incorporated by reference, see § 770.99) or equivalent ASTM D6007-14 (incorporated by reference, see § 770.99) test method and the panel producer's quality control method under paragraph (b) of this section. In the event of clustered test results, a panel producer may fit a line through a point near the origin (the intersection of the X and Y axes) and the average value of the clustered data pairs. The point near the origin should represent the value for the EPA TSCA Title VI TPC's ASTM E1333-14 (incorporated by reference, see § 770.99) or equivalent ASTM D6007-14 (incorporated by reference, see § 770.99) test method and the panel producer's quality control method under § 770.20(b) when each testing apparatus is empty or when a very low emitting sample is tested. The average value of the clustered data pairs represents the average of a minimum of five data pairs that compare the test results of the EPA TSCA Title VI TPC's ASTM E1333-14 (incorporated by reference, see § 770.99) or equivalent ASTM D6007-14 (incorporated by reference, see § 770.99) test method with the panel producer's quality control method under paragraph (b) of this section. The line between the point near the origin and the average value of the cluster provides the linear regression. This line may be used by the panel producer and TPC to develop a quality control limit for the product.
(B)
Threshold Approach.
As an alternative to the linear regression and cluster approaches, a panel producer may use the average value of the clustered data pairs from the EPA TSCA Title VI TPC's ASTM E1333-14 (incorporated by reference, see § 770.99) or equivalent ASTM D6007-14 (incorporated by reference, see § 770.99) test method and the panel producer's quality control method under paragraph (b) of this section as the quality control limit for the product. In this approach, no linear regression line is established. The average value would be assigned as the upper quality control limit for production of the subject composite wood product and must be below the applicable emission standard.
(ii)
Minimum acceptable correlation coefficients (“r” values).
The minimum acceptable correlation coefficients are as follows, where “n” is equal to the number of data pairs, and “r” is the correlation coefficient:
Degrees of freedom
(n-2)
“r” value
3
0.878
4
0.811
5
0.754
6
0.707
7
0.666
8
0.632
9
0.602
10 or more
0.576
(iii)
Variation from previous results.
If data from an EPA TSCA Title VI TPC's quarterly test results and a panel producer's quality control test results do not fit the previously established correlation, the panel producer must have its TPC establish a new correlation and new QCLs.
(iv)
Failed quarterly tests.
If a panel producer fails two quarterly tests in a row for the same product type, the panel producer must have its TPC establish a new correlation curve.
(e)
Quality assurance and quality control requirements for panel producers.
Panel producers are responsible for product compliance with the applicable emission standards.

Labeling.
(a) Panels or bundles of panels that are imported, sold, supplied, or offered for sale in the United States must be labeled with the panel producer's name, the lot number, the number of the EPA TSCA Title VI TPC, and a statement that the products are TSCA Title VI certified. If a composite wood panel is not individually labeled, the panel producer, importer, distributor, fabricator, or retailer must have a method (e.g., color-coded edge marking) sufficient to identify the supplier of the panel and linking the information on the label to the products. This information must be made available to
potential customers upon request. The label may be applied as a stamp, tag, or sticker.
(1) A panel producer number may be used instead of a name to protect identity, so long as the identity of the panel producer can be determined at the request of EPA.
(2) Only panels or bundles of panels manufactured in accordance with § 770.17 may also be labeled that they were made with no-added formaldehyde-based resins in addition to the other information required by this section.
(3) Only panels or bundles of panels manufactured in accordance with § 770.18 may also be labeled that they were made with ultra low-emitting formaldehyde resins in addition to the other information required by this section.
(b) Panels imported into or transported across the United States for quarterly or quality control testing purposes in accordance with § 770.20 must be labeled “For TSCA Title VI testing only, not for sale in the United States.” The panels may be re-labeled if test results are below the applicable emission standards in this subpart.
(c) Fabricators of finished goods containing composite wood products must label every finished good they produce or every box or bundle containing finished goods. If a finished good (including component parts sold separately to end users) is not individually labeled, the importer, distributor, or retailer must retain a copy of the label, be able to identify the products associated with that label, and make the label information available to potential customers upon request.
(1) The label may be applied as a stamp, tag, or sticker.
(2) The label must include, at a minimum, in legible English text, the fabricator's name, the date the finished good was produced (in month/year format), and a statement that the finished goods are TSCA Title VI compliant.
(3) Finished goods made from panels manufactured in accordance with § 770.17 and/or § 770.18 may also be labeled that they were made with no-added formaldehyde-based resins, or ultra low-emitting formaldehyde resins in addition to the other information required by this section. They may be labeled as being made with a combination of compliant composite wood, no-added formaldehyde-based resins, and ultra low-emitting formaldehyde resins, if this is accurate.
(4) Fabricators may substitute the name of a responsible downstream fabricator, importer, distributor, or retailer for their name on the label if they obtain and maintain written consent from the downstream entity.
(d) Importers, distributors, and retailers must leave intact labels on finished goods, including component parts sold separately to end users.
(e) Finished goods, including component parts sold separately to end users, containing only a
de minimis
amount of regulated composite wood product are excepted from the labeling requirements. A finished good, including component parts sold directly to consumers, contains a
de minimis
amount of regulated composite wood product if its regulated composite wood product content does not exceed 144 square inches, based on the surface area of its largest face. The exception does not apply to finished goods or component parts that are designed to be used in combination or in multiples to create larger surfaces, finished goods, or component parts.
(f) All panels (or bundles of panels) and finished goods (or boxes or bundles containing finished goods) must be properly labeled pursuant to paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section before being imported into the United States, except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section.
