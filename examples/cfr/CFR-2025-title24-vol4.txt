# Explanation
The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.
Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:
Title 1 through Title 16
as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27
as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41
as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50
as of October 1
The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.

# LEGAL STATUS
The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

# HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS
The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, April 1, 2025), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

# EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES
Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.

# OMB CONTROL NUMBERS
The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request.
Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.

# PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE
Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.

# “[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY
The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not dropped in error.

# INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE
What is incorporation by reference?
Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.
What is a proper incorporation by reference?
The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:
(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.
(b) The matter incorporated is adequately summarized in the preamble of the final rule and is available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.
(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?
If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or email fr.inspection@nara.gov.

# CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES
A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR
Index and Finding Aids.
This volume contains the Parallel Table of Authorities and Rules. A list of CFR titles, chapters, subchapters, and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in this volume.
An index to the text of “Title 3—The President” is carried within that volume.
The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. This index is based on a consolidation of the “Contents” entries in the daily Federal Register.
A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

# REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL
There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing in the Code of Federal Regulations.

§ 700.100
Purpose.
The requirements of this part augment the requirements of section 802 of the National Affordable Housing Act of 1990 (approved November 28, 1990, Public Law 101-625) (42 U.S.C. 8011), (hereinafter, section 802), as amended by the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 (Public Law 102-550, approved October 28, 1992), which authorizes the Congregate Housing Services Program (hereinafter, CHSP or Program).
§ 700.105
Definitions.
In addition to the definitions in section 802(k), the following definitions apply to CHSP:
Activity of Daily Living (ADL)
means an activity regularly necessary for personal care.
(1) The minimum requirements of ADLs include:
(i) Eating (may need assistance with cooking, preparing or serving food, but must be able to feed self);
(ii) Dressing (must be able to dress self, but may need occasional assistance);
(iii) Bathing (may need assistance in getting in and out of the shower or tub, but must be able to wash self);
(iv) Grooming (may need assistance in washing hair, but must be able to take care of personal appearance);
(v) Getting in and out of bed and chairs, walking, going outdoors, using the toilet; and
(vi) Household management activities (may need assistance in doing housework, grocery shopping or laundry, or getting to and from one location to another for activities such as going to the doctor and shopping, but must be mobile. The mobility requirement does not exclude persons in wheelchairs or those requiring mobility devices.)
(2) Each of the Activities of Daily Living noted in paragraph (1) of this definition includes a requirement that a person must be able to perform at a specified minimal level (
e.g.,
to satisfy the eating ADL, the person must be able to feed himself or herself). The determination of whether a person meets this minimal level of performance must include consideration of those services that will be performed by a person's spouse, relatives or other attendants to be provided by the individual. For example, if a person requires assistance with cooking, preparing or serving food plus assistance in feeding himself or herself, the individual would meet the minimal performance level and thus satisfy the eating ADL, if a spouse, relative or attendant provides assistance with feeding the person. Should such assistance become unavailable at any time, the owner is not obligated at any time to provide individualized services beyond those offered to the resident population in general. The Activities of Daily Living analysis is relevant only with regard to determination of a person's eligibility to receive
supportive services
paid for by CHSP and is not a determination of eligibility for occupancy;
Adjusted income
means adjusted income as defined in 24 CFR parts 813 or 913.
Applicant
means a State, Indian tribe, unit of general local government, public housing authority (PHA), Indian housing authority (IHA) or local nonprofit housing sponsor. A State, Indian tribe, or unit of general local government may apply on behalf of a local
nonprofit housing sponsor or a for-profit owner of eligible housing for the elderly.
Area agency on aging
means the single agency designated by the State Agency on Aging to administer the program described in Title III of the Older Americans Act of 1965 (45 CFR chapter 13).
Assistant Secretary
means the HUD Assistant Secretary for Housing-Federal Housing Commissioner or the HUD Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing.
Case management
means implementing the processes of: establishing linkages with appropriate agencies and service providers in the general community in order to tailor the needed services to the program participant; linking program participants to providers of services that the participant needs; making decisions about the way resources are allocated to an individual on the basis of needs; developing and monitoring of case plans in coordination with a formal assessment of services needed; and educating participants on issues, including, but not limited to, supportive service availability, application procedures and client rights.
Eligible housing for the elderly
means any eligible project including any building within a mixed-use project that was designated for occupancy by elderly persons, or persons with disabilities at its inception or, although not so designated, for which the eligible owner or grantee gives preference in tenant selection (with HUD approval) for all units in the eligible project (or for a building within an eligible mixed-use project) to eligible elderly persons, persons with disabilities, or temporarily disabled individuals. For purposes of this part, this term does not include projects assisted under the Low-Rent Housing Homeownership Opportunity program (Turnkey III (24 CFR part 905, subpart G)).
Eligible owner
means an owner of an eligible housing project.
Excess residual receipts
mean residual receipts of more than $500 per unit in the project which are available and not committed to other uses at the time of application to HUD for CHSP. Such receipts may be used as matching funds and may be spent down to a minimum of $500/unit.
For-profit owner of eligible housing for the elderly
means an owner of an eligible housing project in which some part of the project's earnings lawfully inure to the benefit of any private shareholder or individual.
Grantee
or
Grant recipient
means the recipient of funding under CHSP. Grantees under this Program may be states, units of general local government, Indian tribes, PHAs, IHAs, and local nonprofit housing sponsors.
Local nonprofit housing sponsor
means an owner or borrower of eligible housing for the elderly; no part of the net earnings of the owning organization shall lawfully inure to the benefit of any shareholder or individual.
Nonprofit
includes a public housing agency as that term is defined in section 3(b)(6) of the United States Housing Act of 1937.
Person with disabilities
means a household composed of one or more persons, at least one of whom is an adult who has a disability.
(1) A person shall be considered to have a disability if such person is determined under regulations issued by the Secretary to have a physical, mental, or emotional impairment which:
(i) Is expected to be of long-continued and indefinite duration;
(ii) Substantially impedes his or her ability to live independently; and
(iii) Is of such a nature that the person's ability could be improved by more suitable housing conditions.
(2) A person shall also be considered to have a disability if the person has a developmental disability as defined in section 102(5) of the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act (42 U.S.C. 6001-7). Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this paragraph, the terms “person with disabilities” or “temporarily disabled” include two or more persons with disabilities living together, one or more such persons living with another person who is determined (under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of HUD) to be essential to their care or well-being, and the surviving member or members of any household where at least one or more persons was an adult with a disability who was living, in a

§ 700.120
Eligible supportive services.
(a) Supportive services or funding for such services may be provided by state, local, public or private providers and CHSP funds. A CHSP under this section shall provide meal and other qualifying services for program participants (and other residents and nonresidents, as described in § 700.125(a)) that are coordinated on site.
(b) Qualifying supportive services are those listed in section 802(k)(16) and in section 700.105.
(c) Meal services shall meet the following guidelines:
(1)
Type of service.
At least one meal a day must be served in a group setting for some or all of the participants; if more than one meal a day is provided, a combination of a group setting and carry-out meals may be utilized.
(2)
Hot meals.
At least one meal a day must be hot. A hot meal for the purpose of this program is one in which the principal food item is hot at the time of serving.
(3)
Special menus.
Grantees shall provide special menus as necessary for meeting the dietary needs arising from the health requirements of conditions such as diabetes and hypertension. Grantees should attempt to meet the dietary needs of varying religious and ethnic backgrounds.
(4)
Meal service standards.
Grantees shall plan for and provide meals which are wholesome, nutritious, and each of which meets a minimum of one-third of the minimum daily dietary allowances as established by the Food and Nutrition Board of the National Academy of Sciences-National Research Council (or State or local standards, if these standards are higher). Grantees must have an annual certification, prepared and signed by a registered dietitian, which states that each meal provided under CHSP meets the minimum daily dietary allowances.
(5)
Food stamps and agricultural commodities.
In providing meal services grantees must apply for and use food stamps and agricultural commodities as set forth in section 802(d)(2)(A).
(6)

Eligibility for services.
(a)
Participants, other residents, and nonresidents.
Such individuals are eligible either to participate in CHSP or to receive CHSP services, if they qualify under section 802(e)(1), (4) and (5). Under this paragraph, temporarily disabled persons are also eligible.
(b)
Economic need.
In providing services under CHSP, grantees shall give priority to very low income individuals, and shall consider their service needs in selecting program participants.

(c) The service coordinator may be employed directly by the grantee, or employed under a contract with a case management agency on a fee-for-service basis, and may serve less than full-time. The service coordinator or the case management agency providing service coordination shall not provide supportive services under a CHSP grant or have a financial interest in a service provider agency which intends to provide services to the grantee for CHSP.
(d) The service coordinator shall:
(1) Provide general case management and referral services to all potential participants in CHSP. This involves intake screening, upon referral from the grantee of potential program participants, and preliminary assessment of frailty or disability, using a commonly accepted assessment tool. The service coordinator then will refer to the professional assessment committee (PAC) those individuals who appear eligible for CHSP;
(2) Establish professional relationships with all agencies and service providers in the community, and develop a directory of providers for use by program staff and program participants;

(e) The service coordinator shall tailor each participant's case plan to the individual's particular needs. The service coordinator shall work with community agencies, the grantee and third party service providers to ensure that the services are provided on a regular, ongoing, and satisfactory basis, in accordance with the case plan approved by the PAC and the participant.
(f) Service coordinators shall not serve as members of the PAC.
§ 700.135
Professional assessment committee.
(a)
General.
(1) A professional assessment committee (PAC), as described in this section, shall recommend services appropriate to the functional abilities and needs of each eligible project resident. The PAC shall be either a voluntary committee appointed by the project management or an agency in the community which provides assessment services and conforms to section 802(e)(3)(A) and (B). PAC members are subject to the conflict of interest provisions in section 700.175(b).
(2) The PAC shall utilize procedures that ensure that the process of determining eligibility of individuals for congregate services affords individuals fair treatment, due process, and a right
of appeal of the determination of eligibility, and shall ensure the confidentiality of personal and medical records.
(3) The dollar value of PAC members' time spent on regular assessments after initial approval of program participants may be counted as match. If a community agency discharges the duties of the PAC, staff time is counted as its imputed value, and if the members are volunteers, their time is counted as volunteer time, according to sections 700.145(c)(2) (ii) and (iv).
(b)
Duties of the PAC.
The PAC is required to:
(1) Perform a formal assessment of each potential elderly program participant to determine if the individual is frail. To qualify as frail, the PAC must determine if the elderly person is deficient in at least three ADLs, as defined in section 700.105. This assessment shall be based upon the screening done by the service coordinator, and shall include a review of the adequacy of the informal support network (
i.e.,
family and friends available to the potential participant to assist in meeting the ADL needs of that individual), and may include a more in-depth medical evaluation, if necessary;
(2) Determine if non-elderly disabled individuals qualify under the definition of person with disabilities under section 700.105. If they do qualify, this is the acceptance criterion for them for CHSP. Persons with disabilities do not require an assessment by the PAC;
(3) Perform a regular assessment and updating of the case plan of all participants;
(4) Obtain and retain information in participant files, containing such information and maintained in such form, as HUD or RHS shall require;
(5) Replace any members of the PAC within 30 days after a member resigns. A PAC shall not do formal assessments if its membership drops below three, or if the qualified medical professional leaves the PAC and has not been replaced.
(6) Notify the grantee or eligible owner and the program participants of any proposed modifications to PAC procedures, and provide these parties with a process and reasonable time period in which to review and comment, before adoption of a modification;
(7) Provide assurance of nondiscrimination in selection of CHSP participants, with respect to race, religion, color, sex, national origin, familial status or type of disability;
(8) Provide complete confidentiality of information related to any individual examined, in accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974;
(9) Provide all formal information and reports in writing.
(c)
Prohibitions relating to the PAC.
(1) At least one PAC member shall not have any direct or indirect relationship to the grantee.
(2) No PAC member may be affiliated with organizations providing services under the grant.
(3) Individuals or staff of third party organizations that act as PAC members may not be paid with CHSP grant funds.
(d)
Eligibility and admissions.
(1) Before selecting potential program participants, each grantee (with PAC assistance) shall develop a CHSP application form. The information in the individual's application is crucial to the PAC's ability to determine the need for further physical or psychological evaluation.
(2) The PAC, upon completion of a potential program participant's initial assessment, must make a recommendation to the service coordinator for that individual's acceptance or denial into CHSP.
(3) Once a program participant is accepted into CHSP, the PAC must provide a supportive services case plan for each participant. In developing this plan, the PAC must take into consideration the participant's needs and wants. The case plan must provide the minimum supportive services necessary to maintain independence.
(e)
Transition-out procedures.
The grantee or PAC must develop procedures for providing for an individual's transition out of CHSP to another setting. Transition out is based upon the degree of supportive services needed by an individual to continue to live independently. If a program participant leaves the program, but wishes to retain supportive services, he or she may do so, as long as he or she continues to live in an eligible project, pays the full
cost of services provided, and management agrees (section 802(e)(4) and (5)). A participant can be moved out of CHSP if he or she:
(1) Gains physical and mental health and is able to function without supportive services, even if only for a short time (in which case readmission, based upon reassessment to determine the degree of frailty or the disability, is acceptable);
(2) Requires a higher level of care than that which can be provided under CHSP; or
(3) Fails to pay services fees.
(f)
Procedural rights of participants.
(1) The PAC must provide an informal process that recognizes the right to due process of individuals receiving assistance. This process, at a minimum, must consist of:
(i) Serving the participant with a written notice containing a clear statement of the reasons for termination;
(ii) A review of the decision, in which the participant is given the opportunity to present written or oral objections before a person other than the person (or a subordinate of that person) who made or approved the termination decision; and
(iii) Prompt written notification of the final decision to the participant.
(2) Procedures must ensure that any potential or current program participant, at the time of initial or regular assessment, has the option of refusing offered services and requesting other supportive services as part of the case planning process.
(3) In situations where an individual requests additional services, not initially recommended by the PAC, the PAC must make a determination of whether the request is legitimately a needs-based service that can be covered under CHSP subsidy. Individuals can pay for services other than those recommended by the PAC as long as the additional services do not interfere with the efficient operation of the program.
§ 700.140
Participatory agreement.
(a) Before actual acceptance into CHSP, potential participants must work with the PAC and the service coordinator in developing supportive services case plans. A participant has the option of accepting any of the services under the case plan.
(b) Once the plan is approved by the PAC and the program participant, the participant must sign a participatory agreement governing the utilization of the plan's supportive services and the payment of supportive services fees. The grantee annually must renegotiate the agreement with the participant.
§ 700.145
Cost distribution.
(a)
General.
(1) Grantees, the Secretary concerned, and participants shall all contribute to the cost of providing supportive services according to section 802(i)(A)(i). Grantees must contribute at least 50 percent of program cost, participants must contribute fees that in total are at least 10 percent of program cost, and the Secretary concerned will provide funds in an amount not to exceed 40 percent.
(2) Section 802(i)(1)(B)(ii) creates a cost-sharing provision between grantee and the Secretary concerned if total participant fees collected over a year are less than 10 percent of total program cost. This provision is subject to availability of appropriated grant funds. If funds are not available, the grantee must assume the funding shortfall.
(b)
Prohibition on substitution of funds and maintenance of existing supportive services.
Grantees shall maintain existing funding for and provision of supportive services prior to the application date, as set forth in section 802(i)(1)(D). The grantee shall ensure that the activities provided to the project under a CHSP grant will be in addition to, and not in substitution for, these previously existing services. The value of these services do not qualify as matching funds. Such services must be maintained either for the time the participant remains in CHSP, or for the duration of CHSP grant. The grantee shall certify compliance with this paragraph to the Secretary concerned.
(c)
Eligible matching funds.
(1) All sources of matching funds must be directly related to the types of supportive services prescribed by the PAC or used for administration of CHSP.
(2) Matching funds may include:
(i) Cash (which may include funds from Federal, State and local governments, third party contributions, available payments authorized under Medicaid for specific individuals in CHSP, Community Development Block Grants or Community Services Block Grants, Older American Act programs or excess residual funds with the approval of the Secretary concerned),
(ii) The imputed dollar value of other agency or third party-provided direct services or staff who will work with or provide services to program participants; these services must be justified in the application to assure that they are the new or expanded services of CHSP necessary to keep the program participants independent. If services are provided by the state, Indian tribe, unit of general local government, or local nonprofit housing sponsor, IHA, PHA, or for-profit or not-for-profit owner, any salary paid to staff from governmental sources to carry out the program of the grantee and any funds paid to residents employed by the Program (other than from amounts under a contract under section 700.155) is allowable match.
(iii) In-kind items (these are limited to 10 percent of the 50 percent matching amount), such as the current market value of donated common or office space, utility costs, furniture, material, supplies, equipment and food used in direct provision of services. The applicant must provide an explanation for the estimated donated value of any item listed.
(iv) The value of services performed by volunteers to CHSP, at the rate of $5.00 an hour.
(d)
Limitation.
(1) The following are not eligible for use as matching funds:
(i) PHA operating funds;
(ii) CHSP funds;
(iii) Section 8 funds other than excess residual receipts;
(iv) Funds under section 14 of the U.S. Housing Act of 1937, unless used for service coordination or case management; and
(v) Comprehensive grant funds unless used for service coordination or case management;
(2) Local government contributions are limited by section 802(i)(1)(E).
(e)
Annual review of match.
The Secretary concerned will review the infusion of matching funds annually, as part of the program or budget review. If there are insufficient matching funds available to meet program requirements at any point after grant start-up, or at any time during the term of the grant (
i.e.,
if matching funds from sources other than program participant fees drop below 50 percent of total supportive services cost), the Secretary concerned may decrease the federal grant share of supportive services funds accordingly.
§ 700.150
Program participant fees.
(a)
Eligible program participants.
The grantee shall establish fees consistent with section 700.145(a). Each program participant shall pay CHSP fees as stated in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section, up to a maximum of 20 percent of the program participant's adjusted income. Consistent with section 802(d)(7)(A), the Secretary concerned shall provide for the waiver of fees for individuals who are without sufficient income to provide for any payment.
(b)
Fees shall include:
(1) Cash contributions of the program participant;
(2) Food Stamps; and
(3) Contributions or donations to other eligible programs acceptable as matching funds under section 700.145(c).
(c)
Older Americans Act programs.
No fee may be charged for any meals or supportive services under CHSP if that service is funded under an Older Americans Act Program.
(d)
Meals fees:
(1) For full meal services, the fees for residents receiving more than one meal per day, seven days per week, shall be reasonable and shall equal between 10 and 20 percent of the adjusted income of the project resident, or the cost of providing the services, whichever is less.
(2) The fees for residents receiving meal services less frequently than as described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section shall be in an amount equal to 10 percent of the adjusted income of the project resident, or the cost of providing the services, whichever is less.
(e)
Other service fees.
The grantee may also establish fees for other supportive services so that the total fees collected
from all participants for meals and other services is at least 10 percent of the total cost of CHSP. However, no program participants may be required to pay more than 20 percent of their adjusted incomes for any combination of services.
(f)
Other residents and nonresidents.
Fees shall be established for residents of eligible housing projects (other than eligible project residents) and for nonresidents who receive meals and other services from CHSP under section 700.125(a). These fees shall be in an amount equal to the cost of providing the services.

§ 761.1
Purpose and scope.
This part 761 contains the regulatory requirements for the Assisted Housing Drug Elimination Program (AHDEP) and the Public Housing Drug Elimination Program (PHDEP). The purposes of these programs are to:
(a) Eliminate drug-related and violent crime and problems associated with it in and around the premises of Federally assisted low-income housing, and public and Indian housing developments;
(b) Encourage owners of Federally assisted low-income housing, public housing agencies and Indian housing authorities (collectively referred to as HAs), and resident management corporations to develop a plan that includes initiatives that can be sustained over a period of several years for addressing drug-related and violent crime and problems associated with it in and around the premises of housing proposed for funding under this part; and
(c) Make available Federal grants to help owners of Federally assisted low-income housing, HAs, and RMCs carry out their plans.
[61 FR 13987, Mar. 28, 1996, as amended at 64 FR 49917, Sept. 14, 1999]
§ 761.5
Public housing; encouragement of resident participation.
For the purposes of the Public Housing Drug Elimination Program, the elimination of drug-related and violent crime within public housing developments requires the active involvement and commitment of public housing residents and their organizations. To enhance the ability of PHAs to combat drug-related and violent crime within their developments, Resident Councils (RCs), Resident Management Corporations (RMCs), and Resident Organizations (ROs) will be permitted to undertake management functions specified in this part, notwithstanding the otherwise applicable requirements of part 964 of this title.

# Subpart B—Grant Funding
§ 761.13
Amount of funding.
(a)
PHDEP formula funding
—(1)
Funding share formula
—(i)
Per unit amount.
Subject to the availability of funding, the amount of funding made available each FFY to an applicant that qualifies for funding in accordance with § 761.15(a) is based upon the applicant's share of the total number of units of all applicants that qualify for funding, with a maximum award of $35 million and a minimum award of $25,000, except that qualified applicants with less than 50 units will not receive more than $500 per unit.
(ii)
Calculation of number of units.
For purposes of determining the number of units counted for purposes of the PHDEP formula, HUD shall count as one unit each existing rental and Section 23 bond-financed unit under the ACC. Units that are added to a PHA's inventory will be added to the overall unit count so long as the units are under ACC amendment and have reached DOFA by the date HUD establishes for the Federal Fiscal Year in which the PHDEP formula is being run (hereafter called the “reporting date”). Any such increase in units shall result in an adjustment upwards in the number of units under the PHDEP formula. New units reaching DOFA after this date will be counted for PHDEP formula purposes as of the following Federal Fiscal Year. Federalized units that are eligible for operating subsidy will be counted for PHDEP formula purposes based on the unit count reflected on the PHA's most recently approved Operating Budget (Form HUD-52564) and/or subsidy calculation (Form HUD-52723), or successor form submitted for that program. Units approved for demolition/disposition continue to be counted for PHDEP formula funding purposes until actual demolition/disposition of the unit.
(2)
Consortium funding.
The amount of funding made available to a consortium will be the total of the amounts that each individual member would otherwise qualify to receive under the PHDEP funding formula in accordance with paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
(3)
Adjustments to funding.
The amount of funding made available each FFY to an applicant in accordance with paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section may be adjusted as follows:
(i) An applicant must submit a PHDEP plan that meets the requirements of § 761.21, as required by § 761.15(a)(5), each FFY year to receive that FFY's funding. An applicant that does not submit a PHDEP plan for a FFY as required will not receive that FFY's funding.
(ii) Ineligible activities, described at § 761.17(b), are not eligible for funding. Activities proposed for funding in an applicant's PHDEP plan that are determined to be ineligible will not be funded, and the applicant's funding for that FFY may be reduced accordingly.
(iii) In accordance with § 761.15(a)(6), an applicant that does not meet the performance requirements of § 761.23 will be subject to the sanctions listed in § 761.30(f)(2).
(iv) Both the amount of and continuing eligibility for funding is subject to the sanctions in § 761.30(f).
(v) Any amounts that become available because of adjustments to an applicant's funding will be distributed to every other applicant that qualifies for funding in accordance with paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section.
(b)
AHDEP funding.
Information concerning funding made available under AHDEP for a given FFY will be contained in Notices of Funding Availability (NOFAs) published in the
Federal Register.
[64 FR 49918, Sept. 14, 1999]
§ 761.15
Qualifying for funding.
(a)
Qualifications for PHDEP funding
—(1)
Eligible applicants.
The following are eligible applicants for PHDEP funding:
(i) A PHA;
(ii) An RMC; and
(iii) A consortium of PHAs.
(2)
Preference PHAs.
A PHA that successfully competed for PHDEP funding under at least one of the PHDEP NOFAs for FFY 1996, FFY 1997 or FFY 1998 qualifies to receive PHDEP funding.
(3)
Needs qualification for funding.
An eligible applicant that does not qualify to receive PHDEP funding under paragraph (a)(2) of this section must be in one of the following needs categories to qualify for funding:
(i) The eligible applicant must be in the top 50% of the unit-weighted distribution of an index of a rolling average rate of violent crimes of the community, as computed for each Federal Fiscal Year (FFY). The crime rate used in this needs determination formula is the rate, from the most recent years feasible, of FBI violent crimes per 10,000 residents of the community (or communities). If this information is not available for a particular applicant's community, HUD will use the average of data from recipients of a comparable State and size category of PHA (less than 500 units, 500 to 1249 units, and more than 1250 units). If fewer than five PHAs have data for a given size category within a State, then the average of PHAs for a given size category within the census region will be used; or
(ii) The eligible applicant must have qualified for PHDEP funding, by receiving an application score of 70 or more points under any one of the PHDEP NOFAs for FFY 1996, FFY 1997 or FFY 1998, but not have received an award because of the unavailability of funds.
(4)
Consortium of eligible applicants.
Eligible applicants may join together and form a consortium to apply for funding, whether or not each member would individually qualify for PHDEP funding under paragraphs (a)(2) or (a)(3) of this section. The act of two or more eligible applicants joining together to form a consortium, and identifying related crime problems and eligible activities to address those problems pursuant to a consortium PHDEP plan, qualifies the consortium for PHDEP funding of an amount as determined under § 761.13(a)(2).
(5)
PHDEP plan requirement.

§ 761.40
Other Federal requirements.
In addition to the nondiscrimination and equal opportunity requirements set forth in 24 CFR part 5, subpart A, use of grant funds requires compliance with the following Federal requirements:
(a)
Labor standards.
(1) When grant funds are used to undertake physical improvements to increase security under § 761.15(b)(3), the following labor standards apply:
(i) The grantee and its contractors and subcontractors must pay the following prevailing wage rates, and must comply with all related rules, regulations and requirements:
(A) For laborers and mechanics employed in the program, the wage rate determined by the Secretary of Labor pursuant to the Davis-Bacon Act (40 U.S.C. 276a
et seq.
) to be prevailing in the locality with respect to such trades;
(B) For laborers and mechanics employed in carrying out nonroutine maintenance in the program, the HUD-determined prevailing wage rate. As used in paragraph (a) of this section, nonroutine maintenance means work items that ordinarily would be performed on a regular basis in the course of upkeep of a property, but have become substantial in scope because they have been put off, and that involve expenditures that would otherwise materially distort the level trend of maintenance expenses. Nonroutine maintenance may include replacement of equipment and materials rendered unsatisfactory because of normal wear
and tear by items of substantially the same kind. Work that constitutes reconstruction, a substantial improvement in the quality or kind of original equipment and materials, or remodeling that alters the nature or type of housing units is not nonroutine maintenance.

# Subpart D—Allocation of Budget Authority for Housing Assistance
§ 791.401
General.
This subpart D establishes the procedures for allocating budget authority under section 213(d) of the Act for the programs identified in § 791.101. It describes the allocation of budget authority by the appropriate Assistant Secretary to the applicable Program Office Director in the HUD field office, and by the Program Office Director to allocation areas within their jurisdiction.
[61 FR 10849, Mar. 15, 1996, as amended at 64 FR 26639, May 14, 1999]
§ 791.402
Determination of low-income housing needs.
(a) Before budget authority is allocated, the Assistant Secretary for Policy Development and Research shall determine the relative need for low-income housing assistance in each HUD field office jurisdiction. This determination shall be based upon data from the most recent, available decennial census and, where appropriate, upon more recent data from the Bureau of the Census or other Federal agencies, or from the American Housing Survey.
(b) Except for paragraph (c) of this section, the factors used to determine the relative need for assistance shall be based upon the following criteria:
(1)
Population.
The renter population;
(2)
Poverty.
The number of renter households with annual incomes at or below the poverty level, as defined by the Bureau of the Census;
(3)
Housing overcrowding.
The number of renter-occupied housing units with an occupancy ratio of 1.01 or more persons per room;
(4)
Housing vacancies.
The number of renter housing units that would be required to maintain vacancies at levels typical of balanced market conditions;
(5)
Substandard housing.
The number of housing units built before 1940 and occupied by renter households with annual incomes at or below the poverty level, as defined by the Bureau of the Census; and
(6)
Other objectively measurable conditions.
Data indicating potential need for rental housing assistance, such as the number of renter households with incomes below specified levels and paying a gross rent of more than 30 percent of household income.
(c) For the section 202 elderly program, the data used shall reflect relevant characteristics of the elderly population. The data shall use the criteria specified in paragraph (b)(1) and (6) of this section, as modified to apply specifically to the needs of the elderly population.
(d) Based on the criteria in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, the Assistant Secretary for Policy Development and Research shall establish housing needs factors for each county and independent city in the field office jurisdiction, and shall aggregate the factors for such jurisdiction. The field office total for each factor is then divided by the respective national total for that factor. The resulting housing needs ratios under paragraph (b) of this section are then weighted to provide housing needs percentages for each field office, using the following weights: population—20 percent; poverty—20 percent; housing overcrowding—10 percent; housing vacancies—10 percent; substandard housing—20 percent; other objectively measurable conditions—20 percent. For the section 202 elderly program, the two criteria described in paragraph (c) of this section are weighted equally.
(e) The Assistant Secretary for Policy Development and Research shall
adjust the housing needs percentages derived in paragraph (d) of this section to reflect the relative cost of providing housing among the field office jurisdictions.
[61 FR 10849, Mar. 15, 1996, as amended at 64 FR 26639, May 14, 1999]
§ 791.403
Allocation of housing assistance.
(a) The total budget authority available for any fiscal year shall be determined by adding any available unreserved budget authority from prior fiscal years to any newly appropriated budget authority for each housing program.
(b) Budget authority available for the fiscal year, except for that retained pursuant to § 791.407, shall be allocated to the field offices as follows:
(1) Budget authority shall be allocated as needed for uses that the Secretary determines are incapable of geographic allocation by formula, including—
(i) Amendments of existing contracts, renewal of assistance contracts, assistance to families that would otherwise lose assistance due to the decision of the project owner to prepay the project mortgage or not to renew the assistance contract, assistance to prevent displacement or to provide replacement housing in connection with the demolition or disposition of public housing, assistance in support of the property disposition and loan management functions of the Secretary;
(ii) Assistance which is—
(A) The subject of a line item identification in the HUD appropriations law, or in the table customarily included in the Conference Report on the appropriation for the Fiscal Year in which the funds are to be allocated;
(B) Reported in the Operating Plan submitted by HUD to the Committees on Appropriations; or
(C) Included in an authorization statute where the nature of the assistance, such as a prescribed set-aside, is, in the determination of the Secretary, incapable of geographic allocation by formula,
(iii) Assistance determined by the Secretary to be necessary in carrying out the following programs authorized by the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act: the Homeownership and Opportunity Through HOPE Act under title IV and HOPE for Elderly Independence under section 803.
(2) Budget authority remaining after carrying out allocation steps outlined in paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall be allocated in accordance with the housing needs percentages calculated under paragraphs (b), (c), (d), and (e) of § 791.402. HUD may allocate assistance under this paragraph in such a manner that each State shall receive not less than one-half of one percent of the amount of funds available for each program referred to in § 791.101(a) in each fiscal year. If the budget authority for a particular program is insufficient to fund feasible projects, or to promote meaningful competition, at the field office level, budget authority may be allocated among the ten geographic areas of the country. The funds so allocated will be assigned by Headquarters to the field office(s) with the highest ranked applications within the ten geographic areas.
(c) At least annually HUD will publish a notice in the
Federal Register
informing the public of all allocations under § 791.403(b)(2).
[61 FR 10849, Mar. 15, 1996, as amended at 64 FR 26640, May 14, 1999]
§ 791.404
Field Office allocation planning.
(a)
General objective.
The allocation planning process should provide for the equitable distribution of available budget authority, consistent with the relative housing needs of each allocation area within the field office jurisdiction.
(b)
Establishing allocation areas.
Allocation areas, consisting of one or more counties or independent cities, shall be established by the field office in accordance with the following criteria:
(1) Each allocation shall be to the smallest practicable area, but of sufficient size so that at least three eligible entities are viable competitors for funds in the allocation area, and so that all applicable statutory requirements can be met. (It is expected that in many instances individual MSAs will be established as metropolitan allocation areas.) For the section 202 program for the elderly, the allocation
area must include sufficient units to promote a meaningful competition among disparate types of providers of such housing (e.g., local as well as national sponsors, minority as well as non-minority sponsors). The preceding sentence shall not apply to projects acquired from the Resolution Trust Corporation under section 21A(c) of the Federal Home Loan Bank Act.
(2) Each allocation area shall also be of sufficient size, in terms of population and housing need, that the amount of budget authority being allocated to the area will support at least one feasible program or project.
(3) In establishing allocation areas, counties and independent cities within MSAs should not be combined with counties that are not in MSAs.
(c)
Determining the amount of budget authority.
Where the field office establishes more than one allocation area, it shall determine the amount of budget authority to be allocated to each allocation area, based upon a housing needs percentage which represents the needs of that area relative to the field office jurisdiction. For each program, a composite housing needs percentage developed under § 791.402 for those counties and independent cities comprising the allocation area shall be aggregated into allocation area totals.
(d)
Planning for the allocation.
The field office should develop an allocation plan which reflects the amount of budget authority determined for each allocation area in paragraph (c). The plan should include a map or maps clearly showing the allocation areas within the field office jurisdiction. The relative share of budget authority by individual program type need not be the same for each allocation area, so long as the total amount of budget authority made available to the allocation area is not significantly reduced.
[61 FR 10849, Mar. 15, 1996, as amended at 64 FR 26640, May 14, 1999]
§ 791.405
Reallocations of budget authority.
(a) The field office shall make every reasonable effort to use the budget authority made available for each allocation area within such area. If the Program Office Director determines that not all of the budget authority allocated for a particular allocation area is likely to be used during the fiscal year, the remaining authority may be allocated to other allocation areas where it is likely to be used during that fiscal year.
(b) If the Assistant Secretary determines that not all of the budget authority allocated to a field office is likely to be used during the fiscal year, the remaining authority may be reallocated to another field office where it is likely to be used during that fiscal year.
(c) Any reallocations of budget authority among allocation areas or field offices shall be consistent with the assignment of budget authority for the specific program type and established set-asides.
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section, budget authority shall not be reallocated for use in another State unless the Program Office Director or the Assistant Secretary has determined that other allocation areas within the same State cannot use the available authority during the fiscal year.
§ 791.406
Competition.
(a) All budget authority allocated pursuant to § 791.403(b)(2) shall be reserved and obligated pursuant to a competition. Any such competition shall be conducted pursuant to specific criteria for the selection of recipients of assistance. These criteria shall be contained in a regulation promulgated after notice and public comment or, to the extent authorized by law, a notice published in the
Federal Register.
(b) This section shall not apply to assistance referred to in §§ 791.403(b)(1) and 791.407.
§ 791.407
Headquarters Reserve.
(a) A portion of the budget authority available for the housing programs listed in § 791.101(a), not to exceed an amount equal to five percent of the total amount of budget authority available for the fiscal year for programs under the United States Housing Act of 1937 listed in § 791.101(a), may be retained by the Assistant Secretary for subsequent allocation to specific areas and communities, and may only be used for:
(1) Unforeseen housing needs resulting from natural and other disasters, including hurricanes, tornadoes, storms, high water, wind driven water, tidal waves, tsunamis, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, landslides, mudslides, snowstorms, drought, fires, floods, or explosions, which in the determination of the Secretary cause damage of sufficient severity and magnitude to warrant Federal housing assistance;
(2) Housing needs resulting from emergencies, as certified by the Secretary, other than disasters described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. Emergency housing needs that can be certified are only those that result from unpredictable and sudden circumstances causing housing deprivation (such as physical displacement, loss of Federal rental assistance, or substandard housing conditions) or causing an unforeseen and significant increase in low-income housing demand in a housing market (such as influx of refugees or plant closings);
(3) Housing needs resulting from the settlement of litigation; and
(4) Housing in support of desegregation efforts.
(b) Applications for funds retained under paragraph (a) of this section shall be made to the field office, which will make recommendations to Headquarters for approval or rejection of the application. Applications generally will be considered for funding on a first-come, first-served basis. Specific instructions governing access to the Headquarters Reserve shall be published by notice in the
Federal Register,
as necessary.
(c) Any amounts retained in any fiscal year under paragraph (a) of this section that are not reserved by the end of such fiscal year shall remain available for the following fiscal year in the program under § 791.101(a) from which the amount was retained. Such amounts shall be allocated pursuant to § 791.403(b)(2).

# Subpart A—General Provisions
§ 792.101
Purpose.
The purpose of this part is to encourage public housing agencies (PHAs) to investigate and pursue instances of tenant and owner fraud and abuse in the operation of the Section 8 housing assistance payments programs.
[64 FR 26640, May 14, 1999]
§ 792.102
Applicability.
(a) This part applies to a PHA acting as a contract administrator under an annual contributions contract with HUD in any section 8 housing assistance payments program. To be eligible to retain section 8 tenant or owner fraud recoveries, the PHA must be the principal party initiating or sustaining an action to recover amounts from families.
(b) This part applies only to those instances when a tenant or owner committed fraud, and the fraud recoveries are obtained through litigation brought by the PHA (including settlement of the lawsuit), a court-ordered restitution pursuant to a criminal proceeding, or an administrative repayment agreement with the family or owner as a result of a PHA administrative grievance procedure pursuant to, or incorporating the requirements of, § 982.555 of this title. This part does not apply to cases of owner fraud in PHA-
owned or controlled units, or where incorrect payments were made or benefits received because of calculation errors instead of willful fraudulent activities.
(c) This part applies to all tenant and owner fraud recoveries resulting from litigation brought by the PHA (including settlement of the lawsuit), or a court-ordered restitution pursuant to a criminal proceeding obtained on or after October 8, 1986, and to all tenant and owner fraud recoveries obtained through administrative repayment agreements signed on or after October 28, 1992.
[59 FR 9409, Feb. 28, 1994, as amended at 64 FR 26640, May 14, 1999]
§ 792.103
Definitions.
Fraud and abuse.
Fraud and abuse means a single act or pattern of actions:
(1) That constitutes false statement, omission, or concealment of a substantive fact, made with intent to deceive or mislead; and
(2) That results in payment of section 8 program funds in violation of section 8 program requirements.
The terms
Public Housing Agency (PHA)
and
Indian Housing Authority (IHA)
are defined in 24 CFR part 5.
Judgment.
Judgment means a provision for recovery of section 8 program funds obtained through fraud and abuse, by order of a court in litigation or by a settlement of a claim in litigation, whether or not stated in a court order.
Litigation.
A lawsuit brought by a PHA to recover section 8 program funds obtained as a result of fraud and abuse.
Principal party in initiating or sustaining an action to recover.
Principal party in initiating or sustaining an action to recover means the party that incurs more than half the costs incurred in:
(1) Recertifying tenants who fraudulently obtained section 8 rental assistance;
(2) Recomputing the correct amounts owed by tenants; and
(3) Taking needed actions to recoup the excess benefits received, such as initiating litigation.
Costs incurred to detect potential excessive benefits in the routine day-to-day operations of the program are excluded in determining the principal party in initiating or sustaining an action to recover. For example, the cost of income verification during an annual recertification would not be counted in determining the principal party in initiating or sustaining an action to recover.
Public housing agency (PHA).
A public housing agency as defined in § 791.102.
Repayment agreement.
Repayment agreement means a formal document signed by a tenant or owner and provided to a PHA in which a tenant or owner acknowledges a debt, in a specific amount, and agrees to repay the amount due at specific time period(s).
[59 FR 9409, Feb. 28, 1994, as amended at 61 FR 5212, Feb. 9, 1996; 64 FR 26640, May 14, 1999]

# Subpart B—Recovery of Section 8 Funds
§ 792.201
Conduct of litigation.
The PHA must obtain HUD approval before initiating litigation in which the PHA is requesting HUD assistance or participation.
§ 792.202
PHA retention of proceeds.
(a) Where the PHA is the principal party initiating or sustaining an action to recover amounts from tenants that are due as a result of fraud and abuse, the PHA may retain, the greater of:
(1) Fifty percent of the amount it actually collects from a judgment, litigation (including settlement of lawsuit) or an administrative repayment agreement pursuant to, or incorporating the requirements of, § 982.555 of this title; or
(2) Reasonable and necessary costs that the PHA incurs related to the collection from a judgment, litigation (including settlement of lawsuit) or an administrative repayment agreement pursuant to, or incorporating the requirements of, § 982.555 of this title. Reasonable and necessary costs include the costs of the investigation, legal fees and collection agency fees.
(b) If HUD incurs costs on behalf of the PHA in obtaining the judgment,
these costs must be deducted from the amount to be retained by the PHA.
[59 FR 9409, Feb. 28, 1994, as amended at 64 FR 26640, May 14, 1999]
§ 792.203
Application of amounts recovered.
(a) The PHA may only use the amount of the recovery it is authorized to retain in support of the section 8 program in which the fraud occurred.
(b) The remaining balance of the recovery proceeds (i.e., the portion of recovery the PHA is not authorized to retain) must be applied as directed by HUD.
§ 792.204
Recordkeeping and reporting.
To permit HUD to audit amounts retained under this part, an PHA must maintain all records required by HUD, including:
(a) Amounts recovered on any judgment or repayment agreement;
(b) The nature of the judgment or repayment agreement; and

§ 811.103
General.
(a) In order for obligations to be tax-exempt under this subpart the obligations must be issued by a PHA in connection with a low-income housing project approved by HUD under the Act and the applicable Section 8 regulations.
(1) Except as needed for a resident manager or similar requirement, all dwelling units in a low-income housing project that is to be financed with obligations issued pursuant to this subpart must be Section 8 contract units.
(2) A low-income housing project that is to be financed with obligations issued pursuant to this subpart may include necessary appurtenances. Such appurtenances may include commercial space not to exceed 10% of the total net rentable area.
(b) Where the parent entity PHA is not the owner of the project, the parent entity PHA or other PHA approvable under § 811.104 must agree to administer the contract pursuant to an ACC with HUD, and such a PHA must agree that in the event there is a default under the contract it will pursue all available remedies to achieve correction of the default, including operation and possession of the project, if called upon by HUD to do so. If the field office finds that the PHA does not have the capacity to perform these functions, the Assistant Secretary may approve alternative contractual arrangements for performing these functions.
§ 811.104
Approval of Public Housing Agencies (other than agency or instrumentality PHAS).
(a)(1) An application to the field office for approval as a Public Housing Agency, other than an agency or instrumentality PHA, for purposes of this subpart shall be supported by evidence satisfactory to HUD to establish that:

(b) The charter or other organic document establishing the applicant shall limit the activities to be performed by the applicant, and funds and assets connected therewith, to carrying out or assisting in carrying out Section 8 projects and other low-income housing projects approved by the Secretary. Such organic documents shall provide that the applicant shall receive no compensation in connection with the financing of a project, except for its expenses. Such expenses shall be subject to approval by HUD in determining the development cost, cost of issuance and servicing fee, as appropriate. Should the applicant receive any compensation in excess of such expenses, the excess is to be placed in the debt service reserve.
(c) The documents submitted by the applicant shall include the following with respect to the relationship between the parent entity PHA and the agency or instrumentality PHA:
(1) Provisions requiring approval by the parent entity PHA of the charter or other organic instrument and of the bylaws of the applicant, which organic instrument and bylaws shall specify that any amendments are subject to approval by the parent entity PHA and by HUD.
(2) Provisions requiring approval by the parent entity PHA of each project and of the program and expenditures of the applicant.

§ 811.106
Default under the contract.
If HUD finds there is a default under the Contract, the field office shall so notify the trustee and give the trustee a specified reasonable time to take action to require the owner to correct such default prior to any suspension or termination of payments under the contract. In the event of a default under the contract, HUD may terminate or suspend payments under the contract, may seek specific performance of the contract and may pursue other remedies.
[44 FR 12360, Mar. 6, 1979, as amended at 61 FR 14461, Apr. 1, 1996]
§ 811.107
Financing documents and data.
(a) The financing agency shall assure that any official statement or prospectus or other disclosure statement prepared in connection with the financing shall state on the first page that:
(1) In addition to any security cited in the statement, the bonds may be secured by a pledge of an Annual Contributions Contract and a Housing Assistance Payments Contract, executed by HUD;
(2) The faith of the United States is solemnly pledged to the payment of annual contributions pursuant to the Annual Contributions Contact or to the payment of housing assistance payments pursuant to the Housing Assistance Payments Contract, and funds have been obligated by HUD for such payments;
(3) Except as provided in any contract of mortgage insurance, the bonds are not insured by HUD;
(4) The bonds are not to be construed as a debt or indebtedness of HUD or the United States, and payment of the bonds is not guaranteed by the United States;
(5) Nothing in the text of a disclosure statement is to be interpreted to conflict with the above; and
(6) HUD has not reviewed or approved and bears no responsibility for the content of disclosure statements.
(b) The financing agency shall retain in its files the documentation relating to the financing. A copy of this documentation shall be furnished to HUD upon request.
[61 FR 14461, Apr. 1, 1996]
§ 811.108
Debt service reserve.
(a)
FHA-Insured projects.
(1) The debt service reserve shall be invested and the income used to pay principal and interest on that portion of the obligations which is attributable to the funding of the debt service reserve. Any excess investment income shall be added to the debt service reserve. In the event such investment income is insufficient, surplus cash or residual receipts, to the extent approved by the field office, may be used to pay such principal and interest costs.
(2) The debt service reserve and its investment income shall be available only for the purpose of paying principal or interest on the obligations. The use of the debt service reserve for this purpose shall not be a cure for any failure by the owner to make required payments.
(3) Upon full payment of the principal and interest on the obligations (including that portion of the obligations attributable to the funding of the debt service reserve), any funds remaining in the debt service reserve shall be remitted to HUD.
(b)
Non-FHA-insured projects.
(1) Investment income from the debt service reserve, up to the amount required for debt service on the bonds attributable to the debt service reserve, shall be credited toward the owner's debt service payment. Any excess investment income shall be added to and become part of the debt service reserve.
(2) The debt service reserve and investment income thereon shall be available only for the purpose of paying principal or interest on the obligations. The use of the debt service reserve for this purpose shall not be a cure for any failure by the owner to make required payments.
(3) Upon full payment of the principal and interest on the obligations (including that portion of the obligations attributable to the funding of the debt service reserve), any funds remaining in the debt service reserve shall be remitted to HUD.
[61 FR 14461, Apr. 1, 1996]
§ 811.109
Trust indenture provisions.
Obligations shall be prepaid only under such conditions as HUD shall require, including reduction of contract rents and continued operation of the project for the housing of low-income families.
[44 FR 12360, Mar. 6, 1979. Redesignated at 61 FR 14461, Apr. 1, 1996]
§ 811.110
Refunding of obligations issued to finance Section 8 projects.
(a) This section states the terms and conditions under which HUD will approve refunding or defeasance of certain outstanding debt obligations which financed new construction or substantial rehabilitation of Section 8 projects, including fully and partially assisted projects.
(b) In the case of bonds issued by State Agencies qualified under 24 CFR part 883 to refund bonds which financed projects assisted pursuant to 24 CFR part 883, HUD requires compliance with the prohibition on duplicative fees contained in 24 CFR part 883 and with paragraphs (f) and (h) of this section, as applicable to the projects to be refunded.
(c) No agency shall issue obligations to refund outstanding 11(b) obligations until the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Housing sends the financing agency a Notification of Tax Exemption based on approval of the proposed refunding's terms and conditions as conforming to this part's requirements, including continued operation of the project as housing for low-income families, and where possible, reduction of Section 8 assistance payments through lower contract rents or an equivalent cash rebate to the U.S. Treasury (i.e. Trustee Sweep). The agency shall submit such documentation as HUD determines is necessary for review and approval of the refunding transaction. Upon conclusion of the closing of refunding bonds, written confirmation must be sent to the Office of Multifamily Housing by bond counsel, or other acceptable closing participant, including a schedule of the specific amount of savings in Section 8 assistance where applicable, CUSIP number information, and a final statement of Sources and Uses.
(d)(1) HUD approval of the terms and conditions of a Section 8 refunding proposal requires evaluation by HUD's Office of Multifamily Housing of the reasonableness of the terms of the Agency's proposed financing plan, including projected reductions in project debt service where warranted by market conditions and bond yields. This evaluation shall determine that the proposed amount of refunding obligations is the amount needed to: pay off outstanding bonds; fund a debt service reserve to the extent required by credit enhancers or bond rating agencies, or bond underwriters in the case of unrated refunding bonds; pay credit enhancement fees acceptable to HUD; and
pay transaction costs as approved by HUD according to a sliding scale ceiling based on par amount of refunding bond principal. Exceptions may be approved by HUD, if consistent with applicable statutes, in the event that an additional issue amount is required for project purposes.
(2) The stated maturity of the refunding bonds may not exceed by more than one year the remaining term of the project mortgage, or in the case of an uninsured loan, the later of expiration date of the Housing Assistance Payments Contract (the “HAPC”) or final maturity of the refunded bonds.
(3) The bond yield may not exceed by more than 75 basis points the 20 Bond General Obligation Index published by the Daily Bond Buyer for the week immediately preceding the sale of the bonds, except as otherwise approved by HUD. An amount not to exceed one-fourth of one percent annually of the bonds' outstanding principal balance may be allowed for servicing and trustee fees.
(e) For projects for which the Agreement to enter into the HAPC was executed between January 1, 1979, and December 31, 1984 (otherwise known as “McKinney Act Projects”), for which a State or local agency initiates a refunding, the Secretary shall make available to an eligible issuing agency 50 percent of the Section 8 savings of a refunding, as determined by HUD on a project-by-project basis, to be used by the agency in accordance with the terms of a Refunding Agreement executed by the Agency and HUD which incorporates the Agency's Housing Plan for use of savings to provide decent, safe, and sanitary housing for very low-income households. In determining the amount of savings recaptured on a project-by-project basis, as authorized by section 1012(b) of the McKinney Act, HUD will take into account the physical condition of the projects participating in the refunding which generate the McKinney Act savings and, if necessary, HUD will finance in refunding bond debt service correction of existing deficiencies which cannot be funded completely by existing project replacement reserves or by a portion of reserves released from the refunded bond's indenture. For McKinney Act refundings of projects which did not receive a Financing Adjustment Factor (“FAF”), HUD will allow up to 50 percent of debt service savings to be allocated to the project account; in which case, the remainder will be shared equally by the Agency and the U.S. Treasury.
(f) For refundings of Section 8 projects other than McKinney Act Projects, and for all transactions which substitute collateral for, but do not redeem, outstanding obligations, and for which a HUD approval is needed (such as assignment of a HAPC or insured mortgage note), the Office of Multifamily Housing in consultation with HUD Field Office Counsel will review the HAPC, the Trust Indenture for the outstanding obligations, applicable HUD regulations, and reasonableness of proposed financing terms. In particular, HUD review should be obtained for the release of reserves from the trust indenture of the outstanding 11(b) bonds that are being refunded, defeased, or pre-paid. A proposal to distribute to a non-Federal entity the benefits of a refinancing, such as debt service savings and/or balances in reserves held under the original Trust Indenture, should be referred to the Office of Multifamily Housing for further review. In proposals submitted for HUD approval, HUD will consent to release reserves, as provided by the Trust Indenture, in an amount remaining after correction of project physical deficiencies and/or replenishment of replacement reserves, where needed. In the case of a refunding of 11(b) bonds by a public agency issuer which is the owner of the project and is entitled to reserves held under the Trust Indenture, HUD requires execution by the project owner of a use agreement, and amendment of a regulatory agreement, if applicable, to extend low-income tenant occupancy for ten years after expiration of the original HAPC term. In the case of HAP contracts with renewable 5-year terms, the Use Agreement shall extend for 10 years after the project owners first opt-out date. The Use Agreement may also be required of private entity owners, unless the refunding is incidental to a transfer of project ownership or a transaction which provides a substantial public
benefit, as determined by the Office of Multifamily Housing. Proposed use of benefits shall be consistent with applicable appropriations law, the HAPC, and other requirements applicable to the original project financing, and the proposed financing terms must be reasonable in relation to bond market yields and transaction fees, as approved by the HUD Office of Multifamily Housing.
(g) Agencies shall have wide latitude in the design of specific delivery vehicles for use of McKinney Act savings, subject to HUD audit of each Agency's performance in serving the targeted income eligible population. Savings may be used for shelter costs of providing housing, rental, or owner-occupied, to very low-income households through new construction, rehabilitation, repairs, and acquisition with or without rehab, including assistance to very low-income units in mixed-income developments. These include programs designed to assist in obtaining shelter, such as rent or homeownership subsidies. Self-sufficiency services in support of very low-income housing are also eligible, and may include, but are not limited to, homeownership counseling, additional security measures in high-crime areas, construction job training for residents' repair of housing units occupied by very low-income families, and empowerment activities designed to support formation and growth of resident entities. Except for the cost of providing third-party program audit reports to HUD, eligible costs exclude consultant fees or reimbursement of Agency staff expenses, but may include fees for professional services required in the Agency's McKinney Act programs of assistance to very low-income families. Unless otherwise specified by HUD in a McKinney Agreement, savings shall be subject to the above use requirements for 10 years from the date of receipt of the savings.
(h) Refunding bonds, including interest thereon, approved under this Section shall be exempt from all taxation now or hereafter imposed by the United States, and the notification of approval of tax exemption shall not be subject to revocation by HUD. Whether refunding bonds approved under this section meet the requirements of Section 103 or any other provisions of the Internal Revenue Code is not within the responsibilities of HUD to determine. Such bonds shall be prepaid during the HAPC term only under such conditions as HUD shall require.

§ 850.1
Applicability and savings clause.
(a)
Applicability.
This part implements the Housing Development Grant Program contained in section 17 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437o). The Program authorized the Secretary to make housing development grants to support the new construction or substantial rehabilitation of real property to be used primarily for residential rental purposes. Section 289(b)(1) of the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 12839) repealed section 17 effective October 1, 1991. Section 289(a) prohibited new grants under the Housing Development Grant Program except for projects for which binding commitments had been entered into prior to October 1, 1991.
(b)
Savings clause.
Any grant made pursuant to a binding commitment entered into before October 1, 1991 will continue to be governed by subparts A
through E of this part in effect immediately before April 1, 1996, and by subpart F of this part as currently in effect.
[61 FR 7944, Feb. 29, 1996]
Subparts B-E [Reserved]

# Subpart F—Project Management
§ 850.151
Project restrictions.
(a)
Owner-grantee agreement.
The grantee and the owner must enter into an agreement that requires the owner (including its successors in interest) to carry out the requirements of this section and of the grant agreement, as appropriate. The grantee-owner agreement must require the grantee to monitor (where required) and to take appropriate legal action to enforce compliance with the owner's responsibilities thereunder. The owner's compliance with its obligations under this section must be secured by a mortgage or other security instrument meeting the requirements of § 850.155. Nothing in this section shall preclude enforcement by the Federal government of grant agreement provisions, civil rights statutes, or other provisions of law that apply to the Housing Development Grant Program.
(b)
Restriction on conversion.
The owner shall not convert the units in the project to condominium ownership or to a form of cooperative ownership that is not eligible to receive a housing development grant, during the 20-year period from the date on which the units in the project are available for occupancy.
(c)
Tenant selection.
The owner shall determine the eligibility of applicants for lower income units in accordance with the requirements of 24 CFR parts 812 and 813, including the provisions of these parts concerning citizenship or eligible immigration status and income limits, and certain assistance to mixed families (families whose members include those with eligible immigration status, and those without eligible immigration status.). The owner shall not, during the 20-year period from the date on which the units in the project are available for occupancy, discriminate against prospective tenants on the basis of their receipt of, or eligibility for, housing assistance under any Federal, State, or local housing assistance program or, except for an elderly housing project, on the basis that they have a minor child or children who will be living with them.
(d)
Restriction on leasing assisted units.
The owner shall assure that the percentage of low-income units specified in the grant agreement is occupied, or is available for occupancy, by low-income households during the period beginning on the date on which the units in the project are available for occupancy through 20 years from the date on which 50 percent of the units are occupied. The owner may lease a low-income unit only to a tenant that is a low-income household at the time of its initial occupancy. An owner may continue to lease a low-income unit to a tenant that ceases to qualify as a low-income household only as provided in paragraph (f) of this section.
(e)
Low-income unit rent.
(1) Section 17(d)(8)(A) of the U.S. Housing Act of 1937 prohibits the rents for low-income units from exceeding “30 per centum of the adjusted income of a family whose income equals 50 per centum of the median income for the area, as determined by the Secretary with adjustments for smaller and larger families.” This paragraph describes how these maximum rent determinations are made.
(2) The maximum rents that may be charged for low-income units are based on the size of the unit by number of bedrooms, and are calculated in accordance with the following procedure. For each unit size, HUD will provide the Section 8 very low-income limits. HUD will also provide income adjustments for each unit size, consistent with 24 CFR part 813. An adjusted income amount for each unit size is calculated by the owner or grantee by subtracting the income adjustment from the Section 8 limit. The adjusted income amount is multiplied by 30 percent and divided by 12 to obtain the maximum monthly gross rent for each low-income unit. A monthly allowance for the utilities and services (excluding telephone) to be paid by the tenant is subtracted from the maximum monthly gross rent to obtain the maximum
monthly rent that may be charged for low-income units. Information to be provided by HUD will be available from the responsible HUD Field Office.
(3) The initial monthly allowance for utilities and services to be paid by the tenant must be approved by HUD. Subsequent calculations of this allowance must be approved by the grantee in connection with its review and approval of rent schedules under paragraph (e)(4) of this section. The maximum monthly rent must be recalculated annually, and may change as changes in the Section 8 very low-income limit, the income adjustments, or the monthly allowance for utilities and services warrant.
(4) The grantee must review and approve any schedule of rents proposed by the owner for low-income units. Any schedule submitted by an owner within the permissible maximum will be deemed approved, unless the grantee informs the owner, within 60 days after receiving the schedule, that it is disapproved.
(5) Any increase in rents for low-income units is subject to the provisions of outstanding leases, in any event, the owner must provide tenants of those units not less than 30 days prior written notice before implementing any increase in rents.
(f)
Reexamination of tenant income and composition.
(1) The owner shall reexamine the income of each tenant household living in low-income units at least once a year. At the first regular reexamination after June 19, 1995 the owner shall follow the requirements of 24 CFR part 812 concerning obtaining and processing evidence of citizenship or eligible immigration status of all family members. Thereafter, at each regular reexamination, the owner shall follow the requirements of 24 CFR part 812 concerning verification of the immigration status of any new family member.
(2) If this reexamination indicates that the tenant no longer qualifies as a low-income household, the owner must take one of the following actions, as appropriate: (i) If the unit occupied by the tenant must be leased to a low- income household to maintain the percentage of low-income units specified in the grant agreement, the owner must notify the tenant that it must move when the current lease expires or six months after the date of the notification, whichever is later; (ii) If the owner can meet this percentage without the unit occupied by the tenant (for example, by designating another comparable unit as a low-income unit), the owner may continue to lease to that tenant, but is free to renegotiate the rent at the expiration of the current lease.
(3) For provisions related to termination of assistance for failure to establish citizenship or eligible immigration status, see 24 CFR 812.9, and also 24 CFR 812.10 for provisions related to certain assistance to mixed families (families whose members include those with eligible immigration status, and those without eligible immigration status) in lieu of termination of assistance, and for provisions related to deferral of termination of assistance.
(g)
Affirmative fair housing marketing.
Marketing must be done in accordance with the HUD-approved Affirmative Fair Housing Marketing Plan, Form HUD-935.2, and all fair housing and equal opportunity requirements. The purpose of the Plan and the requirements is to provide for affirmative marketing through the provision of information regarding the availability of units in projects assisted. Affirmative marketing steps consist of good faith efforts to provide information and otherwise attract eligible persons from all racial, ethnic and gender groups in the housing market area to the available housing.
(h)
Management and maintenance functions.
The owner must perform all management and maintenance functions in compliance with equal opportunity requirements. These functions include selection of tenants, reexamination of family income, evictions and other terminations of tenancy, and all ordinary and extraordinary maintenance and repairs, including replacement of capital items.
(i)
Residency preferences.
Local residency requirements are prohibited. Local residency preferences may be applied in selecting tenants only to the extent that they are not inconsistent with affirmative fair housing marketing objectives and the owner's HUD-
approved AFHM Plan. With respect to any residency preference, persons expected to reside in the community as a result of current or planned employment will be treated as residents.
[49 FR 24641, June 14, 1984, as amended at 60 FR 14841, Mar. 20, 1995]
§ 850.153
Rent control.
A project constructed or substantially rehabilitated with a housing development grant is not subject to State or local rent control unless the rent control requirements or agreements (a) (1) were entered into under a State law or local ordinance of general applicability that was enacted and in effect in the jurisdiction before November 30, 1983 and (2) apply generally to rental housing projects not assisted under the Housing Development Grant Program, or (b) are imposed under this subpart. State and local rent controls expressly preempted by this section include, but are not limited to, rent laws or ordinances, rent regulating agreements, rent regulations, occupancy agreements, or financial penalties for failure to achieve certain occupancy or rent projections.
§ 850.155
Securing owner's responsibilities.
Assistance provided under this part shall constitute a debt of the owner (including its successors in interest) to the grantee, and shall be secured by a mortgage or other security instrument. The debt shall be repayable in the event of a substantive, uncorrected violation by an owner of the obligations contained in paragraphs (b), (c), (d) and (e) of § 850.151. The instruments securing this debt shall provide for repayment to the grantee in an amount equal to the total amount of housing development grant assistance outstanding, plus interest which is determined by the Secretary by adding two percent to the average yield on outstanding marketable long-term obligations of the United States during the month preceding the date on which assistance was made available. The amount to be repaid shall be reduced by 10 percent for each full year in excess of 10 years that intervened between the beginning of the term of the owner-grantee agreement and the violation.

§ 880.205
Limitation on distributions.
(a) Non-profit owners are not entitled to distributions of project funds.
(b) For the life of the Contract, project funds may only be distributed to profit-motivated owners at the end of each fiscal year of project operation following the effective date of the Contract after all project expenses have been paid, or funds have been set aside for payment, and all reserve requirements have been met. The first year's distribution may not be made until cost certification, where applicable, is completed. Distributions may not exceed the following maximum returns:
(1) For projects for elderly families, the first year's distribution will be limited to 6 percent on equity. The Assistant Secretary may provide for increases in subsequent years' distributions on an annual or other basis so that the permitted return reflects a 6 percent return on the value in subsequent years, as determined by HUD, of the approved initial equity. Any such adjustment will be made by Notice in the
Federal Register.
(2) For projects for non-elderly families, the first year's distribution will be limited to 10 percent on equity. The Assistant Secretary may provide for increases in subsequent years' distributions on an annual or other basis so that the permitted return reflects a 10 percent return on the value in subsequent years, as determined by HUD, of the approved initial equity. Any such adjustment will be made by Notice in the
Federal Register.
(c) For the purpose of determining the allowable distribution, an owner's equity investment in a project is deemed to be 10 percent of the replacement cost of the part of the project attributable to dwelling use accepted by HUD at cost certification (see § 880.405) unless the owner justifies a higher equity contribution by cost certification documentation in accordance with HUD mortgage insurance procedures.
(d) Any short-fall in return may be made up from surplus project funds in future years.
(e) If HUD determines at any time that project funds are more than the amount needed for project operations, reserve requirements and permitted
distribution, HUD may require the excess to be placed in an account to be used to reduce housing assistance payments or for other project purposes. Upon termination of the Contract, any excess funds must be remitted to HUD.
(f) Owners of small projects or partially-assisted projects are exempt from the limitation on distributions contained in paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section.
(g) In the case of HUD-insured projects, the provisions of this section will apply instead of the otherwise applicable mortgage insurance program provisions.
(h) HUD may permit increased distributions of surplus cash, in excess of the amounts otherwise permitted, to profit-motivated owners who participate in a HUD-approved initiative or program to preserve below-market housing stock. The increased distributions will be limited to a maximum amount based on market rents and calculated according to HUD instructions. Funds that the owner is authorized to retain under section 236(g)(2) of the National Housing Act are not considered distributions to the owner.
(i) Any State or local law or regulation that restricts distributions to an amount lower than permitted by this section or permitted by the Commissioner under this paragraph (i) is preempted to the extent provided by section 524(f) of the Multifamily Assisted Housing Reform and Affordability Act of 1997.

(c)
Pledge of Contracts.
An owner may pledge, or offer as security for any loan or obligation, an Agreement, Contract or ACC entered into pursuant to this part:

§ 880.501
The contract.

and duties of the owner and the contract administrator with respect to the project and the housing assistance payments. The owner and contract administrator execute the Contract in the form prescribed by HUD upon satisfactory completion of the project.
(b) [Reserved]
(c)
Housing Assistance Payments to Owners under the Contract.
The housing assistance payments made under the Contract are:
(1) Payments to the owner to assist eligible families leasing assisted units, and
(2) Payments to the owner for vacant assisted units (“vacancy payments”) if the conditions specified in § 880.610 are satisfied.
The housing assistance payments are made monthly by the contract administrator upon proper requisition by the owner, except payments for vacancies of more than 60 days, which are made semi-annually by the contract administrator upon requisition by the owner.
(d)
Amount of Housing Assistance Payments to Owner.
(1) The amount of the housing assistance payment made to the owner of a unit being leased by an eligible family is the difference between the contract rent for the unit and the tenant rent payable by the family.
(2) A housing assistance payment will be made to the owner for a vacant assisted unit in an amount equal to 80 percent of the contract rent for the first 60 days of vacancy, subject to the conditions in § 880.611. If the owner collects any tenant rent or other amount for this period which, when added to this vacancy payment, exceeds the contract rent, the excess must be repaid as HUD directs.
(3) For a vacancy that exceeds 60 days, a housing assistance payment for the vacant unit will be made, subject to the conditions in § 880.611, in an amount equal to the principal and interest payments required to amortize that portion of the debt attributable to the vacant unit for up to 12 additional months.
(e)
Payment of utility reimbursement.
Where applicable, the owner will pay a utility reimbursement in accordance with § 5.632 of this title. HUD will provide funds for the utility reimbursement to the owner in trust solely for the purpose of paying the utility reimbursement.
[44 FR 59410, Oct. 15, 1979, as amended at 49 FR 19943, May 10, 1984; 61 FR 13587, Mar. 27, 1996; 65 FR 16722, Mar. 29, 2000]
§ 880.502
Term of contract.
(a)
Term (except for Manufactured Home Parks).
The term of the contract will be as follows:
(1) For assisted units in a project financed with the aid of a loan insured or co-insured by the Federal government or a loan made, guaranteed or intended for purchase by the Federal government, the term will be 20 years.
(2) For assisted units in a project financed other than as described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the term will be the lesser of (i) the term of the project's financing (but not less than 20 years), or (ii) 30 years, or 40 years if (A) the project is owned or financed by a loan or loan guarantee from a state or local agency, (B) the project is intended for occupancy by non-elderly families and (C) the project is located in an area designated by HUD as one requiring special financing assistance.
(b)
Term for Manufactured Home Parks.
For manufactured home units or spaces in newly constructed manufactured home parks, the term of the Contract will be 20 years.
(c)
Staged Projects.
If the project is completed in stages, the term of the Contract must relate separately to the units in each stage. The total Contract term for the units in all stages, beginning with the effective date of the Contract for the first stage, may not exceed the overall maximum term allowable for any one unit under this section, plus two years.
[44 FR 59410, Oct. 15, 1979, as amended at 45 FR 18924, Mar. 24, 1980; 48 FR 12705, Mar. 28, 1983; 49 FR 17449, Apr. 24, 1984]
§ 880.503
Maximum annual commitment and project account.
(a)
Maximum Annual Commitment.
Where HUD is the contract administrator, the maximum annual amount that may be committed under the Contract is the total of the contract rents and utility allowances for all assisted units in the project. Where the PHA is
the contract administrator, the maximum annual contribution that may be contracted for in the ACC is the total of the contract rents and utility allowances for all assisted units plus an administrative fee for the PHA as approved by HUD.
(b)
Project Account.
(1) A project account will be established and maintained by HUD as a specifically identified and segregated account for each project. The account will be established out of the amounts by which the maximum annual commitment exceeds the amount actually paid out under the Contract or ACC each year. Payments will be made from this account for housing assistance payments (and fees for PHA administration, if appropriate) when needed to cover increases in contract rents or decreases in tenant rents and for other cost specifically approved by the Secretary.
(2) Whenever a HUD-approved estimate of required annual payments under the Contract or ACC for a fiscal year exceeds the maximum annual commitment and would cause the amount in the project account to be less than 40 percent of the maximum, HUD will, within a reasonable period of time, take such additional steps authorized by Section 8(c)(6) of the U.S. Housing Act of 1937, as may be necessary, to assure that payments under the Contract or ACC will be adequate to cover increases in Contract rents and decreases in tenant rents.
§ 880.504
Leasing to eligible families.
(a)
Availability of units for occupancy by Eligible Families.
During the term of the Contract, an owner shall make available for occupancy by eligible families the total number of units for which assistance is committed under the Contract. For purposes of this section, making units available for occupancy by eligible families means that the owner: (1) Is conducting marketing in accordance with § 880.601(a); (2) has leased or is making good faith efforts to lease the units to eligible and otherwise acceptable families, including taking all feasible actions to fill vacancies by renting to such families; and (3) has not rejected any such applicant family except for reasons acceptable to the contract administrator. If the owner is temporarily unable to lease all units for which assistance is committed under the Contract to eligible families, one or more units may be leased to ineligible families with the prior approval of the contract administrator in accordance with HUD guidelines. Failure on the part of the owner to comply with these requirements is a violation of the Contract and grounds for all available legal remedies, including specific performance of the Contract, suspension or debarment from HUD programs, and reduction of the number of units under the Contract as set forth in paragraph (b) of this section.
(b)
Reduction of number of units covered by Contract
—(1)
Part 880 and 24 CFR part 881 projects.
HUD (or the PHA at the direction of HUD, as appropriate) may reduce the number of units covered by the Contract to the number of units available for occupancy by eligible families if:
(i) The owner fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section; or
(ii) Notwithstanding any prior approval by the contract administrator to lease such units to ineligible families, HUD (or the PHA at the direction of HUD, as appropriate) determines that the inability to lease units to eligible families is not a temporary problem.
(2)
For 24 CFR part 883 projects.
HUD and the Agency may reduce the number of units covered by the Contract to the number of units available for occupancy by eligible families if:
(i) The owner fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section; or
(ii) Notwithstanding any prior approval by the Agency to lease such units to ineligible families, HUD and the Agency determine that the inability to lease units to eligible families is not a temporary problem.
(c)
Restoration.
For this part 880 and 24 CFR part 881 projects, HUD will agree to an amendment of the ACC or the Contract, as appropriate, to provide for subsequent restoration of any reduction made pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, and for 24 CFR part 883 projects, HUD will agree to an amendment of the ACC and the Agency
may agree to an amendment to the Contract to provide for subsequent restoration of any reduction made pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, if:
(1) HUD determines (for 24 CFR part 883 projects, HUD and the Agency determine) that the restoration is justified by demand,
(2) The owner otherwise has a record of compliance with his obligations under the Contract, and
(3) Contract and budget authority is available.
(d)
Applicability.
In accordance with section 555 of the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act of 1990, paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section apply to all Contracts. An owner who had leased an assisted unit to an ineligible family consistent with the regulations in effect at the time will continue to lease the unit to that family. However, the owner must make the unit available for occupancy by an eligible family when the ineligible family vacates the unit.
(e)
Termination of assistance for failure to submit evidence of citizenship or eligible immigration status.
If an owner who is subject to paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section is required to terminate housing assistance payments for the family in accordance with 24 CFR part 5 because the owner determines that the entire family does not have U.S. citizenship or eligible immigration status, the owner may allow continued occupancy of the unit by the family without Section 8 assistance following the termination of assistance, or if the family constitutes a mixed family, as defined in 24 CFR part 5, the owner shall comply with the provisions of 24 CFR part 5 concerning assistance to mixed families, and deferral of termination of assistance.

§ 880.505
Contract administration and conversions.
(a)
Contract administration.
For private-owner/PHA projects, the PHA is primarily responsible for administration of the Contract, subject to review and audit by HUD. For private-owner/HUD and PHA-owner/HUD projects, HUD is responsible for administration of the Contract. The PHA or HUD may contract with another entity for the performance of some or all of its contract administration functions.
(b)
PHA fee for Contract administration.
A PHA will be entitled to a reasonable fee, determined by HUD, for administering a Contract except under certain circumstances (see 24 CFR part 883) where a state housing finance agency is the PHA and finances the project.
(c)
Conversion of Projects from one Ownership/Contractual arrangement to another.
Any project may be converted from one ownership/contractual arrangement to another (for example, from a private-owner/HUD to a private-owner/PHA project) if:
(1) The owner, the PHA and HUD agree,
(2) HUD determines that conversion would be in the best interest of the project, and
(3) In the case of conversion from a private-owner/HUD to a private-owner/PHA project, contract authority is available to cover the PHA fee for administering the Contract.
§ 880.506
Default by owner (private-owner/HUD and PHA-owner/HUD projects).
The Contract will provide:
(a) That if HUD determines that the owner is in default under the Contract, HUD will notify the owner and the lender of the actions required to be taken to cure the default and of the remedies to be applied by HUD including specific performance under the
Contract, reduction or suspension of housing assistance payments and recovery of overpayments, where appropriate; and
(b) That if the owner fails to cure the default, HUD has the right to terminate the Contract or to take other corrective action.
§ 880.507
Default by PHA and/or owner (private-owner/PHA projects).
(a)
Rights of Owner if PHA defaults under Agreement or Contract.
The ACC, the Agreement and the Contract will provide that, in the event of failure of the PHA to comply with the Agreement or Contract with the owner, the owner will have the right, if he is not in default, to demand that HUD investigate. HUD will first give the PHA a reasonable opportunity to take corrective action. If HUD determines that a substantial default exists, HUD will assume the PHA's rights and obligations under the Agreement or Contract and meet the obligations of the PHA under the Agreement or Contract including the obligations to enter into the Contract.
(b)
Rights of HUD if PHA defaults under ACC.
The ACC will provide that, if the PHA fails to comply with any of its obligations, HUD may determine that there is a substantial default and require the PHA to assign to HUD all of its rights and interests under the Contract; however, HUD will continue to pay annual contributions in accordance with the terms of the ACC and the Contract. Before determining that a PHA is in substantial default, HUD will give the PHA a reasonable opportunity to take corrective action.
(c)
Rights of PHA and HUD if Owner defaults under Contract.
(1) The Contract will provide that if the PHA determines that the owner is in default under the Contract, the PHA will notify the owner and lender, with a copy to HUD, (i) of the actions required to be taken to cure the default, (ii) of the remedies to be applied by the PHA including specific performance under the Contract, abatement of housing assistance payments and recovery of overpayments, where appropriate, and (iii) that if he fails to cure the default, the PHA has the right to terminate the Contract or to take other corrective action, in its discretion or as directed by HUD.
(2) If the PHA is the lender, the Contract will also provide that HUD has an independent right to determine whether the owner is in default and to take corrective action and apply appropriate remedies, except that HUD will not have the right to terminate the Contract without proceeding in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.
§ 880.508
Notice upon contract expiration.
(a) The Contract will provide that the owner will notify each assisted family, at least 90 days before the end of the Contract term, of any increase in the amount the family will be required to pay as rent which may occur as a result of its expiration. If the Contract is to be renewed but with a reduction in the number of units covered by it, this notice shall be given to each family who will no longer be assisted under the Contract.
(b) The notice provided for in paragraph (a) of this section shall be accomplished by: (1) Sending a letter by first class mail, properly stamped and addressed, to the family at its address at the project, with a proper return address; and (2) serving a copy of the notice on any adult person answering the door at the leased dwelling unit, or if no adult responds, by placing the notice under or through the door, if possible, or else by affixing the notice to the door. Service shall not considered to be effective until both required notices have been accomplished. The date on which the notice shall be considered to be received by the family shall be the date on which the owner mails the first class letter provided for in this paragraph, or the date on which the notice provided for in this paragraph is properly given, whichever is later.
(c) The notice shall advise each affected family that, after the expiration date of the Contract, the family will be required to bear the entire cost of the rent and that the owner will be free (to the extent the project is not otherwise regulated by HUD) to alter the rent without HUD approval, but subject to any applicable requirements or restrictions under the lease or under State or local law. The notice shall also state:
(1) The actual (if known) or the estimated rent which will be charged following the expiration of the Contract; (2) the difference between the rent and the Total Tenant Payment toward rent under the Contract; and (3) the date the Contract will expire.
(d) The owner shall give HUD a certification that families have been notified in accordance with this section with an example of the text of the notice attached.
(e) This section applies to all Contracts entered into pursuant to an Agreement executed on or after October 1, 1981, or entered into pursuant to an Agreement executed before October 1, 1981, but renewed or amended on or after October 1, 1984.

§ 880.602
Replacement reserve.
(a) A replacement reserve must be established and maintained in an interest-bearing account to aid in funding extraordinary maintenance and repair and replacement of capital items.
(1)
Part 880 and 24 CFR part 881 projects.

[61 FR 13588, Mar. 27, 1996]
§ 880.603
Selection and admission of assisted tenants.
(a)
Application.
The owner must accept applications for admission to the project in the form prescribed by HUD. Both the owner (or designee) and the applicant must complete and sign the application. For this part 880 and 24 CFR part 881 projects, on request, the owner must furnish copies of all applications to HUD and the PHA, if applicable. For 24 CFR part 883 projects, on request, the owner must furnish to the Agency or HUD copies of all applications received.
(b)
Determination of eligibility and selection of tenants.
The owner is responsible for obtaining and verifying information related to income eligibility in accordance with 24 CFR part 5, subpart F, and evidence related to citizenship and eligible immigration status in accordance with 24 CFR part 5, subpart E, to determine whether the applicant is eligible for assistance in accordance with the requirements of 24 CFR part 5, and to select families for admission to the program, which includes giving selection preferences in accordance with 24 CFR part 5, subpart D.
(1) If the owner determines that the family is eligible and is otherwise acceptable and units are available, the owner will assign the family a unit of the appropriate size in accordance with HUD standards. If no suitable unit is available, the owner will place the family on a waiting list for the project and notify the family of when a suitable unit may become available. If the waiting list is so long that the applicant would not be likely to be admitted for the next 12 months, the owner may advise the applicant that no additional applications are being accepted for that reason, provided the owner complies with the procedures for informing applicants about admission preferences as provided in 24 CFR part 5, subpart D.
(2) If the owner determines that an applicant is ineligible on the basis of income or family composition, or because of failure to meet the disclosure and verification requirements for Social Security Numbers (as provided by 24 CFR part 5), or because of failure by an applicant to sign and submit consent forms for the obtaining of wage and claim information from State Wage Information Collection Agencies (as provided by 24 CFR parts 5 and 813), or that the owner is not selecting the applicant for other reasons, the owner will promptly notify the applicant in writing of the determination and its reasons, and that the applicant has the right to meet with the owner or managing agent in accordance with HUD requirements. Where the owner is a PHA, the applicant may request an informal hearing. If the PHA determines that the applicant is not eligible, the PHA will notify the applicant and inform the applicant that he or she has the right to request HUD review of the PHA's determination. The applicant may also exercise other rights if the applicant believes that he or she is being discriminated against on the basis of race, color, creed, religion, sex, or national origin. See 24 CFR part 5 for the informal review provisions for the denial of a Federal preference or the failure to establish citizenship or eligible immigration status and for notice requirements where assistance is terminated, denied, suspended, or reduced based on wage and claim information obtained by HUD from a State Wage Information Collection Agency.
(3) Records on applicants and approved eligible families, which provide racial, ethnic, gender and place of previous residency data required by HUD,
must be maintained and retained for three years.
(c)
Reexamination of family income and composition
—(1)
Regular reexaminations.
The owner must reexamine the income and composition of all families at least every 12 months. After consultation with the family and upon verification of the information, the owner must make appropriate adjustments in the Total Tenant Payment in accordance with part 5 of this title and determine whether the family's unit size is still appropriate. The owner must adjust Tenant Rent and the Housing Assistance Payment to reflect any change in Total Tenant Payment and must carry out any unit transfer required by HUD. At the time of the annual reexamination of family income and composition, the owner must require the family to disclose the verify Social Security Numbers, as provided by 24 CFR part 5. For requirements regarding the signing and submitting of consent forms by families for the obtaining of wage and claim information from State Wage Information Collection Agencies, see 24 CFR part 5. At the first regular reexamination after June 19, 1995, the owner shall follow the requirements of 24 CFR part 5 concerning obtaining and processing evidence of citizenship or eligible immigration status of all family members. Thereafter, at each regular reexamination, the owner shall follow the requirements of 24 CFR part 5 and verify the immigration status of any new family member.
(2)
Interim reexaminations.
The family must comply with provisions in its lease regarding interim reporting of changes in income. If the owner receives information concerning a change in the family's income or other circumstances between regularly scheduled reexaminations, the owner must consult with the family and make any adjustments determined to be appropriate. Any change in the family's income or other circumstances that results in an adjustment in the Total Tenant Payment, Tenant Rent and Housing Assistance Payment must be verified. See 24 CFR part 5 for the requirements for the disclosure and verification of Social Security Numbers at interim reexaminations involving new family members. For requirements regarding the signing and submitting of consent forms for the obtaining of wage and claim information from State Wage Information Collection Agencies, see 24 CFR part 5. At any interim reexamination after June 19, 1995, when a new family member has been added, the owner shall follow the requirements of 24 CFR part 5 concerning obtaining and processing evidence of the citizenship or eligible immigration status of any new family member.
(3)
Continuation of housing assistance payments.
A family's eligibility for Housing Assistance Payments continues until the Total Tenant Payment equals the contract rent plus any utility allowance. The termination of eligibility at such point will not affect the family's other rights under its lease, nor will such termination preclude the resumption of payments as a result of later changes in income, rents, or other relevant circumstances during the term of the Contract. However, eligibility also may be terminated in accordance with HUD requirements, for such reasons as failure to submit requested verification information, including failure to meet the disclosure and verification requirements for Social Security Numbers, as provided by 24 CFR part 5, or failure to sign and submit consent forms for the obtaining wage and claim information from State Wage Information Collection Agencies, as provided by 24 CFR part 5. See 24 CFR part 5 for provisions requiring termination of assistance for failure to establish citizenship or eligible immigration status and also for provisions concerning certain assistance for mixed families (families whose members include those with eligible immigration status, and those without eligible immigration status) in lieu of termination of assistance, and for provisions concerning deferral of termination of assistance.
(4)
Streamlined income determination.
An owner may elect to follow the provisions of 24 CFR 5.657(d).

Tenant rent.
The eligible Family pays the Tenant Rent directly to the Owner.
[49 FR 19943, May 10, 1984]
§ 880.605
Overcrowded and underoccupied units.
If the contract administrator determines that because of change in family size an assisted unit is smaller than appropriate for the eligible family to which it is leased, or that the unit is larger than appropriate, housing assistance payments with respect to the unit will not be reduced or terminated until the eligible family has been relocated to an appropriate alternative unit. If possible, the owner will, as promptly as possible, offer the family an appropriate unit. The owner may receive vacancy payments for the vacated unit if he complies with the requirements of § 880.611.
§ 880.606
Lease requirements.
(a)
Term of Lease.
The term of the lease will be for not less than one year. The lease may, or in the case of a lease for a term of more than one year must, contain a provision permitting termination on 30 days advance written notice by the family.
(b)
Notification for nonpayment of rent.

Where the termination notice is based on material noncompliance with the lease or material failure to carry out obligations under a State landlord and tenant act pursuant to paragraph (b)(1)(i) or (b)(1)(ii) of this section, the time of service must be in accord with the lease and State law.
(3) In any judicial action instituted to evict the family, the owner may not rely on any grounds which are different from the reasons set forth in the notice.

(d)
Modification of Lease form.
The owner, with the prior approval of HUD or, for a 24 CFR part 883 project, the Agency, may modify the terms and conditions of the lease form effective at the end of the initial term or a successive term, by serving an appropriate notice on the family, together with the offer of a revised lease or an addendum revising the existing lease.

§ 880.608
Security deposits.
(a) At the time of the initial execution of the lease, the owner will require each family to pay a security deposit in an amount equal to one month's Total Tenant Payment or $50, whichever is greater. The family is expected to pay the security deposit from its own resources and/or other public sources. The owner may collect the security deposit on an installment basis.
(b) The owner must place the security deposits in a segregated, interest-bearing account. The balance of this account must at all times be equal to the total amount collected from the families then in occupancy, plus any accrued interest. The owner must comply with any applicable State and local laws concerning interest payments on security deposits.
(c) In order to be considered for the return of the security deposit, a family which vacates its unit will provide the owner with its forwarding address or arrange to pick up the refund.
(d) The owner, subject to State and local law and the requirements of this paragraph, may use the security deposit, plus any accrued interest, as reimbursement for any unpaid family contribution or other amount which the family owes under the lease. Within 30 days (or shorter time if required by State, or local law) after receiving notification of the family's forwarding address, the owner must:
(1) Refund to a family owing no rent or other amount under the lease the full amount of the security deposit, plus accrued interest;
(2) Provide to a family owing rent or other amount under the lease a list itemizing any unpaid rent, damages to the unit, and estimated costs for repair, along with a statement of the family's rights under State and local law. If the amount which the owner claims is owed by the family is less than the amount of the security deposit, plus accrued interest, the owner must refund the unused balance to the family. If the owner fails to provide the list, the family will be entitled to the refund of the full amount of the security deposit plus accrued interest.
(e) In the event a disagreement arises concerning reimbursement of the security deposit, the family will have the right to present objections to the owner in an informal meeting. The owner must keep a record of any disagreements and meetings in a tenant file for inspection by the contract administrator. The procedures of this paragraph do not preclude the family from exercising its rights under State and local law.
(f) If the security deposit, including any accrued interest, is insufficient to reimburse the owner for any unpaid tenant rent or other amount which the family owes under the lease, and the owner has provided the family with the list required by paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the owner may claim reimbursement from the contract administrator, as appropriate, for an amount not to exceed the lesser of:
(1) The amount owed the owner, or
(2) One month's contract rent, minus the amount of the security deposit plus accrued interest. Any reimbursement under this section will be applied first toward any unpaid tenant rent due under the lease. No reimbursement may be claimed for unpaid rent for the period after termination of the tenancy.

§ 880.609
Adjustment of contract rents.
(a)
Automatic annual adjustment of Contract Rents.
Upon request from the owner to the contract administrator, contract rents will be adjusted on the anniversary date of the contract in accordance with 24 CFR part 888.
(b)
Special additional adjustments.
For all projects, special additional adjustments will be granted, to the extent determined necessary by HUD (for 24 CFR part 883 projects, by the Agency and HUD), to reflect increases in the actual and necessary expenses of owning and maintaining the assisted units which have resulted from substantial general increases in real property taxes, assessments, utility rates, and utilities not covered by regulated rates, and which are not adequately compensated for by annual adjustments under paragraph (a) of this section. The owner must submit to the contract administrator required supporting data, financial statements and certifications.
(c)
Overall limitation.
Any adjustments of contract rents for a unit after Contract execution or cost certification, where applicable, must not result in material differences between the rents charged for assisted units and comparable unassisted units except to the extent that the differences existed with respect to the contract rents set
at Contract execution or cost certification, where applicable.

§ 880.610
Adjustment of utility allowances.
In connection with annual and special adjustments of contract rents, the owner must submit an analysis of the project's Utility Allowances. Such data as changes in utility rates and other facts affecting utility consumption should be provided as part of this analysis to permit appropriate adjustments in the Utility Allowances. In addition, when approval of a utility rate change would result in a cumulative increase of 10 percent or more in the most recently approved Utility Allowances, the project owner must advise the contract administrator and request approval of new Utility Allowances. Whenever a Utility Allowance for a unit is adjusted, the owner will promptly notify affected families and make a corresponding adjustment of the tenant rent and the amount of the housing assistance payment for the unit.

[87 FR 37997, June 27, 2022]
§ 880.612a
Preference for occupancy by elderly families.
(a)
Election of preference for occupancy by elderly families
—(1)
Election by owners of eligible projects.
(i) An owner of a project assisted under this part (including a partially assisted project) that was originally designed primarily for occupancy by elderly families (an “eligible project”) may, at any time, elect to give preference to elderly families in selecting tenants for assisted, vacant units in the project, subject to the requirements of this section.
(ii) For purposes of this section, a project eligible for the preference provided by this section, and for which the owner makes an election to give preference in occupancy to elderly families is referred to as an “elderly project.” “Elderly families” refers to families whose heads of household, their spouses or sole members are 62 years or older.
(iii) An owner who elects to provide a preference to elderly families in accordance with this section is required to notify families on the waiting list who are not elderly that the election has been made and how the election may affect them if:
(A) The percentage of disabled families currently residing in the project who are neither elderly nor near-elderly (hereafter, collectively referred to as “non-elderly disabled families”) is equal to or exceeds the minimum required percentage of units established for the elderly project in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section, and therefore non-elderly families on the waiting list (including non-elderly disabled families) may be passed over for covered section 8 units; or
(B) The project, after making the calculation set forth in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, will have no units set aside for non-elderly disabled families.
(iv) An owner who elects to give a preference for elderly families in accordance with this section shall not remove an applicant from the project's waiting list on the basis of having made the election.
(2)
HUD approval of election not required.
(i) An owner is not required to solicit or obtain the approval of HUD before exercising the election of preference for occupancy provided in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. The owner, however, if challenged on the issue of eligibility of the project for the election provided in paragraph (a)(1) of this section must be able to support the project's eligibility through the production of all relevant documentation in the possession of the owner that pertains to the original design of the project.
(ii) The Department reserves the right at any time to review and make determinations regarding the accuracy of the identification of the project as an elderly project. The Department can make such determinations as a result of ongoing monitoring activities, or the conduct of complaint investigations under the Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 3601 through 3619), or compliance reviews and complaint investigations under section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794) and other applicable statutes.
(b)
Determining projects eligible for preference for occupancy by elderly families
—(1)
Evidence supporting project eligibility.
Evidence that a project assisted under this part (or portion of a project) was originally designed primarily for occupancy by elderly families, and is therefore eligible for the election of occupancy preference provided by this section, shall consist of at least one item from the sources (“primary” sources) listed in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, or at least two items from the sources (“secondary” sources) listed in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section:
(i)
Primary sources.
Identification of the project (or portion of a project) as serving elderly (seniors) families in at least one primary source such as: The application in response to the notice of funding availability; the terms of the notice of funding availability under which the application was solicited; the regulatory agreement; the loan commitment; the bid invitation; the owner's management plan, or any underwriting or financial document collected at or before loan closing;
or
(ii)
Secondary sources.
Two or more sources of evidence such as: lease records from the earliest two years of occupancy for which records are available showing that occupancy has been restricted primarily to households where the head, spouse or sole member is 62 years of age or older; evidence that services for elderly persons have been provided, such as services funded by the Older Americans Act, transportation to senior citizen centers, or programs coordinated with the Area Agency on Aging; project unit mix with more than fifty percent of efficiency and one-bedroom units [a secondary source particularly relevant to distinguishing elderly projects under the previous section 3(b) definition (in which disabled families were included in the definition of “elderly families”) from non-elderly projects and which in combination with other factors (such as the number of accessible units) may be useful in distinguishing projects for seniors from those serving the broader definition of “elderly families” which includes disabled families]; or any other relevant type of historical data, unless clearly contradicted by other comparable evidence.
(2)
Sources in conflict.
If a primary source establishes a design contrary to that established by the primary source upon which the owner would base support that the project is an eligible project (as defined in this section), the owner cannot make the election of preferences for elderly families as provided by this section based upon primary sources alone. In any case where primary sources do not provide
clear evidence
of original design of the project for occupancy primarily by elderly families, including those cases where primary sources conflict, secondary sources may be used to establish the use for which the project was originally designed.
(c)
Reservation of units in elderly projects for non-elderly disabled families.
The owner of an elderly project is required to reserve, at a minimum, the number of units specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section for occupancy by non-elderly disabled families.
(1)
Minimum number of units to be reserved for non-elderly disabled families.
The number of units in an elderly project required to be reserved for occupancy by non-elderly disabled families, shall be, at a minimum, the lesser of:
(i) The number of units equivalent to the higher of—
(A) The percentage of units assisted under this part in the elderly project that were occupied by non-elderly disabled families on October 28, 1992; and
(B) The percentage of units assisted under this part in the elderly project that were occupied by non-elderly disabled families upon January 1, 1992;
or
(ii) 10 percent of the number of units assisted under this part in the eligible project.
(2)
Option to reserve greater number of units for non-elderly disabled families.
The owner, at the owner's option, and at any time, may reserve a greater number of units for non-elderly disabled families than that provided for in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. The option to provide a greater number of units to non-elderly disabled families will not obligate the owner to always provide that greater number to non-elderly disabled families. The number of
units required to be provided to non-elderly disabled families at any time in an elderly project is that number determined under paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
(d)
Secondary preferences.
An owner of an elderly project also may elect to establish secondary preferences in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (d) of this section.
(1)
Preference for near-elderly disabled families in units reserved for elderly families.
If the owner of an elderly project determines, in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section, that there are an insufficient number of elderly families who have applied for occupancy to fill all the vacant units in the elderly project reserved for elderly families (that is, all units except those reserved for the non-elderly disabled families as provided in paragraph (c) of this section), the owner may give preference for occupancy of such units to disabled families who are near-elderly families.
(2)
Preference for near-elderly disabled families in units reserved for non-elderly disabled families.
If the owner of an elderly project determines, in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section, that there are an insufficient number of non-elderly disabled families to fill all the vacant units in the elderly project reserved for non-elderly disabled families as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, the owner may give preference for occupancy of these units to disabled families who are near-elderly families.
(e)
Availability of units to families without regard to preference.
An owner shall make vacant units in an elderly project generally available to otherwise eligible families who apply for housing, without regard to the preferences and reservation of units provided in this section if either:
(1) The owner has adopted the secondary preferences and there are an insufficient number of families for whom elderly preference, reserve preference, and secondary preference has been given, to fill all the vacant units; or
(2) The owner has
not
adopted the secondary preferences and there are an insufficient number of families for whom elderly preference, and reserve preference has been given to fill all the vacant units.
(f)
Determination of insufficient number of applicants qualifying for preference.
To make a determination that there are an insufficient number of applicants who qualify for the preferences, including secondary preferences, provided by this section, the owner must:
(1) Conduct marketing in accordance with § 880.601(a) to attract applicants qualifying for the preferences and reservation of units set forth in this section; and
(2) Make a good faith effort to lease to applicants who qualify for the preferences provided in this section, including taking all feasible actions to fill vacancies by renting to such families.
(g)
Prohibition of evictions.
An owner may not evict a tenant without good cause, or require that a tenant vacate a unit, in whole or in part because of any reservation or preference provided in this section, or because of any action taken by the Secretary pursuant to subtitle D (sections 651 through 661) of title VI of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 (42 U.S.C. 13611 through 13620).
[59 FR 65850, Dec. 21, 1994, as amended at 61 FR 9046, Mar. 6, 1996; 65 FR 16722, Mar. 29, 2000]
§ 880.613
Emergency transfers for victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking.
(a) Covered housing providers must develop and implement an emergency transfer plan that meets the requirements in 24 CFR 5.2005(e).
(b) In order to facilitate emergency transfers for victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking, covered housing providers have discretion to adopt new, and modify any existing, admission preferences or transfer waitlist priorities.
(c) In addition to following requirements in 24 CFR 5.2005(e), when a safe unit is not immediately available for a victim of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking who qualifies for an emergency transfer, covered housing providers must:
(1) Review the covered housing provider's existing inventory of units and determine when the next vacant unit may be available; and
(2) Provide a listing of nearby HUD subsidized rental properties, with or without preference for persons of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking, and contact information for the local HUD field office.
(d) Each year, covered housing providers must submit to HUD data on all emergency transfers requested under 24 CFR 5.2005(e), including data on the outcomes of such requests.

§ 881.205
Limitation on distributions.
(a) Non-profit owners are not entitled to distributions of project funds.
(b) For the life of the Contract, project funds may only be distributed to profit-motivated owners at the end of each fiscal year of project operation
following the effective date of the Contract after all project expenses have been paid, or funds have been set aside for payment, and all reserve requirements have been met. The first year's distribution may not be made until cost certification, where applicable, is completed. Distributions may not exceed the following maximum returns:
(1) For projects for elderly families, the first year's distribution will be limited to 6 percent on equity. The Assistant Secretary may provide for increases in subsequent years' distributions on an annual or other basis so that the permitted return reflects a 6 percent return on the value in subsequent years, as determined by HUD, of the approved initial equity. Any such adjustment will be made by Notice in the
Federal Register.
(2) For projects for non-elderly families, the first year's distribution will be limited to 10 percent on equity. The Assistant Secretary may provide for increases in subsequent years' distributions on an annual or other basis so that the permitted return reflects a 10 percent return on the value in subsequent years, as determined by HUD, of the approved initial equity. Any such adjustment will be made by Notice in the
Federal Register.
(c) For the purpose of determining the allowable distribution, an owner's equity investment in a project is deemed to be 10 percent of the replacement cost of the part of the project attributable to dwelling use accepted by HUD at cost certification (see § 881.405), unless the owner justifies a higher equity contribution by cost certification documentation in accordance with HUD mortgage insurance procedures.
(d) Any short-fall in return may be made up from surplus project funds in future years.
(e) If HUD determines at any time that project funds are more than the amount needed for project operations, reserve requirements and permitted distribution, HUD may require the excess to be placed in an account to be used to reduce housing assistance payments or for other project purposes. Upon termination of the Contract, any excess funds must be remitted to HUD.
(f) Owners of small projects or partially-assisted projects are exempt from the limitation on distributions contained in paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section.
(g) In the case of HUD-insured projects, the provisions of this section will apply instead of the otherwise applicable mortgage insurance program provisions.
(h) HUD may permit increased distributions of surplus cash, in excess of the amounts otherwise permitted, to profit-motivated owners who participate in a HUD-approved initiative or program to preserve below-market housing stock. The increased distributions will be limited to a maximum amount based on market rents and calculated according to HUD instructions. Funds that the owner is authorized to retain under section 236(g)(2) of the National Housing Act are not considered distributions to the owner.
(i) Any State or local law or regulation that restricts distributions to an amount lower than permitted by this section or permitted by the Commissioner under this paragraph (i) is preempted to the extent provided by section 524(f) of the Multifamily Assisted Housing Reform and Affordability Act of 1997.

(c)
Pledge of contracts.
An owner may pledge, or offer as security for any loan or obligation, an Agreement, Contract or ACC entered into pursuant to this part:
Provided, however,
That such financing is in connection with a project constructed pursuant to this part and approved by HUD. Any pledge of the Agreement, Contract, or ACC, or payments thereunder, will be limited to the amounts payable under the Contract or ACC in accordance with its terms. If the pledge or other document provides that all payments will be paid directly to the mortgagee or the trustee for bondholders, the mortgagee or trustee will make all payments or deposits required under the mortgage, trust indenture of HUD regulations and remit any excess to the owner.

(a) The location of the new construction or substantial rehabilitation makes installation of broadband infrastructure infeasible;
(b) The cost of installing broadband infrastructure would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of its program or activity or in an undue financial burden; or

The following terms are defined in part 5, subpart A of this title:

Housing Assistance Payments Contract
(“Contract”). A written contract between a PHA and an Owner for the purpose of providing housing assistance payments to the Owner on behalf of an eligible Family.

(a)-(d) [Reserved]
(e)
Section 23 policies for units planned for conversion on or before September 30, 1981.
(1) PHAs shall not enter into new leases with owners for additional units nor shall they renew or extend leases with owners except consistent with the conversion schedules.
(2) Subject to the rights of families under existing leases, PHAs may continue to lease units to families under Section 23 only on a month-to-month basis.
(3) PHAs shall conduct annual inspections of all units to determine whether the units are decent, safe and sanitary.
(4) PHAs shall certify with their requisitions to HUD for payments under the ACC that the units are decent, safe and sanitary, or the PHA shall furnish HUD with a report of the nature of the deficiencies of the units which are not so certified. If an owner's units are not decent, safe and sanitary.
(i) Where the owner is responsible under the terms of the lease for correcting the deficiencies, the PHA shall send the owner written notification requiring the owner to take specified corrective action within a specified time. The notification shall also state that, if the owner fails to comply, rent payments will be suspended. If the owner fails to comply with the first notification, he shall be notified by the PHA of the noncompliance and rent payments shall be suspended immediately. In the event of such suspension of rent payments, the PHA shall requisition a correspondingly lower ACC payment.
(ii) Where the PHA is responsible under the terms of the lease for correcting the deficiencies, the Field Office shall send written notification requiring the PHA to take specified corrective action within a specified time. The notification shall also state that, if the PHA fails to comply, HUD will make reduced payments to the PHA only in the amount of the rent due the owner.

(h)
Request for rent increases.
An owner may submit to the PHA a request for rent increase because of increases in operating cost, when the rents to the owner, after adjustments based on provisions in the lease, are insufficient to provide decent, safe and sanitary housing. Such a request shall be supported by an audited financial statement, and the data shall clearly show that failure to obtain additional revenue will result in deterioriation of units and loss of decent, safe and sanitary housing for low-income families. The PHA shall inspect the units to determine whether the units are decent, safe and sanitary. Where the need for an adjustment under this paragraph is shown:
(1) Subject to available contract authority and prior approval by the HUD Field Office, the PHA may grant an adjustment to the extent documented and justified for those items of expenses (excluding debt service) for which the owner is responsible under the lease.
(2) The amount of the adjustment must be reasonable when compared with similar items under the Section 8 Existing Housing program.
(3) The adjusted amount for expenses shall not exceed the result of applying the appropriate Section 8 Existing Housing Annual Adjustment Factor (24 CFR part 888) most recently published by HUD in the
Federal Register
to the appropriate expense base in effect under the lease prior to this adjustment.
(4) The adjustment shall not be retroactive to pay for costs that the owner had previously incurred.
(5) The adjustment shall be effective for a period not to exceed one year.

(2) When a HUD-approved estimate of required payments under the ACC for a fiscal year exceeds the maximum annual commitment, and would cause the amount in the project account to be less than 40 percent of the maximum, HUD will, within a reasonable period of time, take such additional steps authorized by Section 8(c)(6) of the U.S. Housing Act of 1937, as may be necessary, to assure that payments under the ACC will be adequate to cover increases in Contract Rents and decreases in Gross Family Contributions.
(c)
Term of Housing Assistance Payments Contract.
The Contract for any unit rehabilitated in accordance with the Program must be for a term of 15 years.
(d)
Term of Lease.
(1) The initial lease between the family and the Owner must be for at least one year or the term of the HAP contract, whichever is shorter. In cases where there is less than one year remaining on the HAP contract, the owner and the PHA may mutually agree to terminate the unit from the HAP contract instead of leasing the unit to an eligible family.
(2) Any renewal or extension of the lease term for any unit must in no case extend beyond the remaining term of the HAP contract.

[81 FR 80812, Nov. 16, 2016]
§ 882.408
Initial contract rents.
(a)
Fair Market Rent limitation.
The Fair Market Rent Schedule for Moderate Rehabilitation is 120 percent of the Existing Housing Fair Market Rent Schedule, except that the Fair Market Rent limitation applicable to single room occupancy housing is 75 percent of the Moderate Rehabilitation Fair Market Rent for a 0-bedroom unit. The initial Gross Rent for any Moderate Rehabilitation unit must not exceed
the Moderate Rehabilitation Fair Market Rent applicable to the unit on the date that the Agreement is executed except by up to 10 percent as provided in paragraph (b) of this section. Additionally, to the extent provided in paragraph (d) of this section, the PHA may approve changes in the Contract Rent subsequent to execution of the Agreement which result in an initial Gross Rent which exceeds the Moderate Rehabilitation Fair Market Rent applicable to the unit by up to 20 percent.
(b)
Exception rents.
With HUD Field Office approval, the PHA may approve initial Gross Rents which exceed the applicable Moderate Rehabilitation Fair Market Rents by up to 10 percent for all units of a given size in specified areas where HUD has determined that the rents for standard units suitable for the Existing Housing Program are more than 10 percent higher than the Existing Housing Fair Market Rents. The PHA must submit documentation demonstrating the necessity for such exception rents in the area to the HUD Field Office. In areas where HUD has approved the use of exception rents for 0-bedroom units, the single room occupancy housing exception rent will be 75 percent of the exception rent applicable to Moderate Rehabilitation 0-bedroom units.
(c)
Determination Initial Contract Rents.
(1) The initial Contract Rent and base rent for each unit must be computed in accordance with HUD requirements. These amounts may be determined in accordance with paragraph (c)(2), or in accordance with an alternative method prescribed by HUD. However, the initial Contract Rent may in no event be more than—
(i) The Moderate Rehabilitation Fair Market Rent or exception rent applicable to the unit on the date that the Agreement is executed, minus
(ii) Any applicable allowance for utilities and other services attributable to the unit.
(2) When the initial Contract Rent is computed under this paragraph, the rent will be equal to the base rent plus the monthly cost of a rehabilitation loan (but not more than the maximum stated in paragraph (c)(1)). The base rent must be calculated using the rent charged for the unit or the estimated costs to the Owner of owning, managing and maintaining the rehabilitated unit. The monthly cost of a rehabilitation loan must be calculated using:
(i) The actual interest rate on the portion of the rehabilitation costs borrowed by the Owner,
(ii) The HUD-FHA maximum interest rate for multifamily housing (or another rate prescribed by HUD) for rehabilitation costs paid by the Owner out of nonborrowed funds, and
(iii) At least a 15 year loan term, except that if the total amount of rehabilitation is less than $15,000, the actual loan term will be used for the portion of the rehabilitation costs borrowed by the Owner. (HUD Field Offices may authorize loan terms which differ from the above in accordance with HUD requirements.)
(d)
Changes in Initial Contract Rents during rehabilitation.
(1) The initial Contract Rents established pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section will be the Contract Rents on the effective date of the Contract except under the following circumstances:
(i) When, during rehabilitation, work items (including substantial and necessary design changes) which (A) could not reasonably have been anticipated or are necessitated by a change in local codes or ordinances, and (B) were not listed in the work write-up prepared or approved by the PHA, are subsequently required and approved by the PHA.
(ii) When the actual cost of the rehabilitation performed is less than that estimated in the calculation of Contract Rents for the Agreement or the actual, certified costs are more than estimated due to unforeseen factors beyond the owner's control (e.g., strikes, weather delays or unexpected delays caused by local governments).
(iii) When the PHA (or HUD) approves changes in financing.
(iv) When the actual relocation payments made by the Owner to temporarily relocated Families varies from the cost estimated in the calculation of Contract Rents for the Agreement.
(v) When necessary to correct errors in computation of the base and Contract Rents to comply with the HUD requirements.
(2) Should changes occur as specified in paragraph (d)(1) (either an increase or decrease), the PHA will approve any necessary change in work and amendment of the work write-up and cost estimate, recalculate the initial Contract Rents in accordance with paragraph (d)(3) of this section, and amend the Contract or Agreement, as appropriate, to reflect the revised rents.
(3) In establishing the revised Contract Rents, the PHA must determine that the resulting Gross Rents do not exceed the Moderate Rehabilitation Fair Market Rent or the exception rent in effect at the time of execution of the Agreement. The Fair Market Rent or exception rent, as appropriate, may only be exceeded when the PHA determines in accordance with paragraph (d)(1) of this section that it will be necessary for the revised Gross Rent to exceed the Moderate Rehabilitation Fair Market Rent or exception rent. Should this determination be made, the PHA may not execute a revised Agreement or Contract for Gross Rents exceeding the Fair Market Rents by more than 10 percent until it receives HUD Field Office approval. The HUD Field Office may approve revised Gross Rents which exceed the Fair Market Rents by up to 20 percent for reasons specified in paragraph (d)(1) of this section upon proper justification by the PHA of the necessity for the increase.
[47 FR 34379, Aug. 9, 1982, as amended at 52 FR 19725, May 27, 1987]
§ 882.409
Contract rents at end of rehabilitation loan term.
For a Contract where the initial Contract Rent was based upon a loan term shorter than 15 years, the Contract must provide for reduction of the Contract Rent effective with the rent for the month following the end of the term of the rehabilitation loan. The amount of the reduction will be the monthly cost of amortization of the rehabilitation loan. This reduction should result in a new Contract Rent equal to the base rent established pursuant to § 882.408(c) plus all subsequent adjustments.
§ 882.410
Rent adjustments.
(a)
Annual and special adjustments.
Contract Rents will be adjusted as provided in paragraphs (a) (1) and (2) of this section upon submittal to the PHA by the Owner of a revised schedule of Contract Rents, provided that the unit is in decent, safe, and sanitary condition and that the Owner is otherwise in compliance with the terms of the Lease and Contract. Subject to the foregoing, adjustments of Contract Rents will be as follows:
(1) The Annual Adjustment Factors which are published annually by HUD (see Schedule C, 24 CFR part 888) will be utilized. On or after each annual anniversary date of the Contract, the Contract Rents may be adjusted in accordance with HUD procedures, effective for the month following the submittal by the Owner of a revised schedule of Contract Rents. The changes in rent as a result of the adjustment cannot exceed the amount established by multiplying the Annual Adjustment Factor by the base rents. However, if the amounts borrowed to finance the rehabilitation costs or to finance purchase of the property are subject to a variable rate or are otherwise renegotiable, Contract Rents may be adjusted in accordance with other procedures as prescribed by HUD, and specified in the Contract, provided that the adjusted Contract Rents cannot exceed the rents established by multiplying the Annual Adjustment Factor by the Contract Rents. Adjusted Contract Rents must then be examined in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section and may be adjusted accordingly. Contract Rents may be adjusted upward or downward, as may be appropriate.
(2)
Special Adjustments.
(i) A special adjustment, to the extent determined by HUD to reflect increases in the actual and necessary expenses of owning and maintaining the unit which have resulted from substantial general increases in real property taxes, assessments, utility rates and utilities not covered by regulated rates, may be recommended by the PHA for approval by HUD. Subject to appropriations, a special adjustment may also be recommended by the PHA for approval by HUD when HUD determines that a project is located in a community where drug-related criminal activity is generally prevalent, and not specific to a particular project, and the project's
operating, maintenance, and capital repair expenses have substantially increased primarily as a result of the prevalence of such drug-related activity. HUD may, on a project-by-project basis, provide adjustments to the maximum monthly rents, to a level no greater than 120 percent of the current gross rents for each unit size under a Housing Assistance Payments Contract, to cover the costs of maintenance, security, capital repairs and reserves required for the Owner to carry out a strategy acceptable to HUD for addressing the problem of drug-related criminal activity. Prior to approval of a special adjustment to cover the cost of physical improvements, HUD will perform an environmental review to the extent required by HUD's environmental regulations at 24 CFR part 50, including the applicable related authorities at 24 CFR 50.4.
(ii) The aforementioned special rent adjustments will only be approved if and to the extent the Owner clearly demonstrates that these general increases have caused increases in the owners operating costs which are not adequately compensated for by annual adjustments.
(iii) The Owner must submit financial information to the PHA which clearly supports the increase. For Contracts of more than twenty units, the Owner must submit audited financial information.
(b)
Overall limitation.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this part, adjustments as provided in this section must not result in material differences between the rents charged for assisted and comparable unassisted units, as determined by the PHA (and approved by HUD in the case of adjustments under paragraph (a)(2) of this section). However, unless the rents have been adjusted in accordance with § 882.409, this limitation should not be construed to prohibit differences in rents between assisted and comparable unassisted units to the extent that differences existed with respect to the initial Contract Rents.

§ 882.411
Payments for vacancies.
(a)
Vacancies from execution of Contract to initial occupancy.
If a Contract unit which has been rehabilitated in accordance with this Program is not leased within 15 days of the effective date of the Contract, the Owner will be entitled to housing assistance payments in the amount of 80 percent of the Contract Rent for the unit for a vacancy period not exceeding 60 days from the effective date of the Contract, provided that the Owner (1) has complied with §§ 882.506(d) and 882.508(c); (2) has taken and continues to take all feasible actions to fill the vacancy; and (3) has not rejected any eligible applicant except for good cause acceptable to the PHA.
(b)
Vacancies after initial occupancy.
(1) If an Eligible Family vacates its unit (other than as a result of action by the Owner which is in violation of the Lease or the Contract or any applicable law), the Owner may receive the housing assistance payments due under the Contract for so much of the month in which the Family vacates the unit as the unit remains vacant. Should the unit continue to remain vacant, the Owner may receive from the PHA a housing assistance payment in the amount of 80 percent of the Contract Rent for a vacancy period not exceeding an additional month. However, if the Owner collects any of the Family's share of the rent for this period, the payment must be reduced to an amount which, when added to the Family's payment, does not exceed 80 percent of the Contract Rent. Any such excess must be reimbursed by the Owner to the PHA. The Owner will not be entitled to any payment under this paragraph (b)(1) of this section unless the Owner:
(i) Immediately upon learning of the vacancy, has notified the PHA of the vacancy or prospective vacancy, and
(ii) has taken and continues to take all feasible actions specified in paragraphs (a) (2) and (3) of this section.
(2) If the Owner evicts an Eligible Family, the Owner will not be entitled to any payment under paragraph (b)(1) of this section unless the PHA determines that the Owner complied with all requirements of the Contract.
(c)
Prohibition of double compensation for vacancies.
The Owner will not be entitled to housing assistance payments with respect to vacant units under this section if the Owner is entitled to payments from other sources (for example, payments for losses of rental income incurred for holding units vacant for relocatees pursuant to Title I of the HCD Act of 1974 or payments for unpaid rent under § 882.414 (Security and Utility Deposits)).

§ 882.412
Subcontracting of owner services.
(a)
General.
Any Owner may contract with any private or public entity to perform for a fee the services required by the Agreement, Contract or Lease, provided that such contract may not shift any of the Owner's responsibilities or obligations.
(b)
PHA management.
If the Owner and a PHA wish to enter into a management contract, they may do so provided that:
(1) The Housing Assistance Payments Contract with respect to the housing involved is administered by another PHA, or
(2) Should another PHA not be available and willing to administer the Housing Assistance Payments Contract and no other management alternative exists, the HUD Field Office may authorize PHA management of units administered by the PHA in accordance with specified criteria.
(3) Notwithstanding the provisions of § 882.408 (b) and (c), a PHA may not approve, without prior HUD approval, rents which exceed the appropriate Moderate Rehabilitation Fair Market Rent for a unit for which it provides the management functions under this section.
§ 882.413
Responsibility of the Family.
(a) A family receiving housing assistance under this Program must fulfill all of its obligations under the Lease and Statement of Family Responsibility.
(b) No family member may engage in drug-related criminal activity or violent criminal activity. Failure of the Family to meet its responsibilities under the Lease, the Statement of Family Responsibility, or this section shall constitute rounds for termination of assistance by the PHA. Should the PHA determine to terminate assistance to the Family, the provisions of § 882.514(f) must be followed.
[55 FR 28546, July 11, 1990, as amended at 63 FR 23855, Apr. 30, 1998]
§ 882.414
Security and utility deposits.
(a) If at the time of the initial execution of the Lease the Owner wishes to collect a security deposit, the maximum amount shall be the greater of one month's Total Tenant Payment or $50. However, this amount shall not exceed the maximum amount allowable under State or local law. For units leased in place, security deposits collected prior to the execution of a Contract which are in excess of this maximum amount do not have to be refunded until the Family vacates the unit subject to the lease terms. The Family is expected to pay security deposits and utility deposits from its resources and/or other public or private sources.
(b) If a Family vacates the unit, the Owner, subject to State and local law, may use the security deposit as reimbursement for any unpaid Tenant Rent or other amount which the Family owes under the Lease. If a Family vacates the unit owing no rent or other amount under the Lease consistent with State or local law or if such amount is less than the amount of the security deposit, the Owner shall refund the full amount or the unused balance to the Family.
(c) In those jurisdictions where interest is payable by the Owner on security deposits, the refunded amount shall include the amount of interest payable. The Owner shall comply with all State and local laws regarding interest payments on security deposits.
(d) If the security deposit is insufficient to reimburse the Owner for the unpaid Tenant Rent or other amounts which the Family owes under the Lease, or if the Owner did not collect a security deposit, the Owner may claim reimbursement from the PHA for an amount not to exceed the lesser of:
(1) The amount owed the Owner, or
(2) Two month's Contract Rent; minus, in either case, the greater of the security deposit actually collected or the amount of security deposit the Owner could have collected under the program (pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section). Any reimbursement under this section must be applied first toward any unpaid Tenant Rent due under the Lease and then to any other amounts owed. No reimbursement may be claimed for unpaid rent for the period after the Family vacates.

The Owner must notify the PHA when the work is completed and submit to the PHA the evidence of completion and certifications described in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.
(b)
Evidence of completion.
Completion of the unit(s) must be evidenced by furnishing the PHA with the following:
(1) A certificate of occupancy and/or other official approvals as required by the locality.
(2) A certification by the Owner that:
(i) The unit(s) has been completed in accordance with the requirements of the Agreement;
(ii) The unit(s) is in good and tenantable condition;
(iii) The unit(s) has been rehabilitated in accordance with the applicable zoning, building, housing and other codes, ordinances or regulations, as modified by any waivers obtained from the appropriate officials;
(iv) The unit(s) are in compliance with part 35, subparts A, B, H, and R of this title.
(iv) Any unit(s) built prior to 1973 are in compliance with § 882.404(c)(3) and § 882.404(c)(4).
(v) If applicable, the Owner has complied with the provisions of the Agreement relating to the payment of not less than prevailing wage rates and that to the best of the Owner's knowledge and belief there are no claims of underpayment concerning alleged violations of said provisions of the Agreement. In the event there are any such pending claims to the knowledge of the Owner, PHA or HUD, the Owner will be required to place sufficient amount in escrow, as determined by the PHA or HUD, to assure such payments.
(c)
Actual cost and rehabilitation loan certifications.
The Owner must provide the PHA with a certification of the costs incurred for the rehabilitation and any temporary relocation as well as the interest rate and term of any rehabilitation loan. The Owner must certify that these are the actual costs, interest rate, and term.
The PHA must review for completeness and accuracy and accept these certifications subject to the right of post audit. The PHA must then establish the Contract Rents as provided in § 882.408 which will be subject to reduction based on a post audit.
(d)
Review and inspections.
The PHA must review the evidence of completion for compliance with paragraph (b) of this section. The PHA also must inspect the unit(s) to be assisted to determine that the unit(s) has been completed in accordance with the Agreement and meets the Housing Quality Standards or other standards approved by HUD for the Program. If the inspection discloses defects or deficiencies, the inspector must report these in detail.
(e)
Acceptance.
(1) If the PHA determines from the review and inspection that the unit(s) has been completed in accordance with the Agreement, the unit(s) will be accepted.
(2) If there are any items of delayed completion which are minor items or which are incomplete because of weather conditions, and in any case which do not preclude or affect occupancy, and all other requirements of the Agreement have been met, the unit(s) must be accepted. An escrow fund determined by the PHA to be sufficient to assure completion for items
of delayed completion must be required, as well as a written agreement between the PHA and the Owner, to be included as an exhibit to the Contract, specifying the schedule for completion. If the items are not completed within the agreed time period, the PHA may terminate the Contract or exercise other rights under the Contract.
(3) If other deficiencies exist, the PHA must determine whether and to what extent the deficiencies are correctable, and whether the Contract Rents should be reduced. The Owner must be notified of the PHA's decision. If the corrections required by the PHA are possible, the PHA and the Owner must enter into an agreement for the correction of the deficiencies within a specified time. If the deficiencies are corrected within the agreed period of time, the PHA must accept the unit(s).
(4) Otherwise, the unit(s) may not be accepted, and the Owner must be notified with a statement of the reasons for nonacceptance.

§ 882.508
[Reserved]
§ 882.509
Overcrowded and under occupied units.
If the PHA determines that a Contract unit is not decent, safe, and sanitary by reason of increase in Family size, or that a Contract unit is larger than appropriate for the size of the Family in occupancy, housing assistance payments with respect to the unit will not be abated;
However,
the Owner must offer the Family a suitable alternative unit should one be available and the Family will be required to move. If the Owner does not have a suitable available unit, the PHA must assist the Family in locating other standard housing in the locality within the Family's ability to pay and require the Family to move to such a unit as soon as possible. In no case will a Family be forced to move nor will housing assistance payments under the Contract be terminated unless the Family rejects without good reason the offer of a unit which the PHA judges to be acceptable.
§ 882.510
Adjustment of utility allowance.
The PHA must determine, at least annually, whether an adjustment is required in the Utility Allowance applicable to the dwelling units in the Program, on grounds of changes in utility rates or other change of general applicability to all units in the Program. The PHA may also establish a separate schedule of allowances for each building of 20 or more assisted units, based upon at least one year's actual utility consumption data following rehabilitation under the Program. If the PHA determines that an adjustment should be made in its Schedule of Allowances or if it establishes a separate schedule for a building which will change the allowance, the PHA must then determine the amounts of adjustments to be made in the amount of rent to be paid by affected Families and the amount of housing assistance payments and must notify the Owners and Families accordingly. Any adjustment to the Allowance must be implemented no later than at the Family's next reexamination or at lease renewal, whichever is earlier.

§ 882.511
Lease and termination of tenancy.
(a)
Lease.
(1) The lease must include all provisions required by HUD, and must not include any provisions prohibited by HUD.
(2) The lease must provide that drug-related criminal activity engaged in on or near the premises by any tenant, household member, or guest, and any such activity engaged in on the premises by any other person under the tenant's control is grounds for the owner to terminate tenancy. In addition, the lease must provide that the owner may terminate the tenancy of a family when the owner determines that a household member is illegally using a drug or when the owner determines that a pattern of illegal use of a drug interferes with the health, safety, or right to peaceful enjoyment of the premises by other residents.
(b)
Applicability.
The provisions of this section apply to decisions by an Owner to terminate the tenancy of a
Family during or at the end of the Family's lease term.
(c)
Grounds for termination of or refusal to renew the lease.
The Owner must not terminate or refuse to renew the lease except upon the following grounds:
(1) Serious or repeated violation of the terms and conditions of the lease.
(2) Violation of applicable Federal, State or local law.
(3) Other good cause.
(d)
Notice of termination of tenancy.
(1) The Owner must serve a written notice of termination of tenancy on the Family which states the date the tenancy shall terminate. Such date must be in accordance with the following:
(i) When termination is based on failure to pay rent, the date of termination must be not less than five working days after the Family's receipt of the notice; or, if the Secretary determines that tenants must be provided with adequate notice to secure Federal funding that is available due to a Presidential declaration of a national emergency, the date of termination must be not less than 30 days after the Family's receipt of the notice.
(ii) When termination is based on serious or repeated violation of the terms and conditions of the lease or on violation of applicable Federal, State or local law, the date of termination must be in accordance with State and local law.
(iii) When termination is based on other good cause, the date of termination must be no earlier than 30 days after the notice is served on the Family.
(2) The notice of termination must:
(i) State the reasons for such termination with enough specificity to enable the Family to prepare a defense.
(ii) Advise the Family that if a judicial proceeding for eviction is instituted, the tenant may present a defense in that proceeding.
(iii) Be served on the Family by sending a prepaid first class properly addressed letter (return receipt requested) to the tenant at the dwelling unit or by delivering a copy of the notice to the dwelling unit.
(iv) Include such information to tenants during a national emergency, as required by the Secretary.
(3)
Substitution of State and local requirements.
In the case of failure to pay rent, a notice of termination which is issued pursuant to State or local law or is common practice in the locality and which satisfies paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section may be substituted for or run concurrently with the notice required herein.
(e)
Eviction.
All evictions must be carried out through judical process under State and local law. “Eviction” means the dispossession of the Family from the dwelling unit pursuant to State or local court action.
(f)
Lease.
The requirements of this section shall be incorporated into the dwelling lease between the Owner and the Family.
(g) In actions or potential actions to terminate tenancy, the owner shall follow 24 CFR part 5, subpart L (Protection for Victims of Domestic Violence, Dating Violence, Sexual Assault, or Stalking).

§ 882.512
Reduction of number of units covered by contract.
(a)
Limitation on leasing to ineligible Families.
Owners must lease all assisted units under Contract to Eligible Families. Leasing of vacant, assisted units to ineligible tenants is a violation of the Contract and grounds for all available legal remedies, including suspension or debarment from HUD programs and reduction of the number of units under the Contract, as set forth in paragraph (b) of this section. Once the PHA has determined that a violation exists, the PHA must notify HUD of its determination and the suggested remedies. At the direction of HUD, the PHA must take the appropriate action.
(b)
Reduction for failure to lease to Eligible Families.
If, at any time beginning six months after the effective date of the Contract, the Owner fails for a period of six continuous months to have at least 90 percent of the assisted units leased or available for leasing by Eligible Families (because families initially eligible have become ineligible), the PHA may, on at least 30 days' notice,
reduce the number of units covered by the Contract. The PHA may reduce the number of units to the number of units actually leased or available for leasing by Eligible Families plus 10 percent (rounded up). If the Owner has only one unit under Contract and if one year has elapsed since the date of the last housing assistance payment, the Contract may be terminated with the consent of the Owner.
(c)
Restoration.
The PHA will agree to an amendment of the Contract, to provide for subsequent restoration of any reduction made pursuant to paragraph (b) if:
(1) The PHA determines that the restoration is justified by demand,
(2) The Owner otherwise has a record of compliance with obligations under the Contract, and
(3) Contract authority is available.
§ 882.513
Public notice to low-income families; waiting list.
(a)
Public notice to low-income Families.
(1) If the PHA does not have a waiting list which is sufficient to provide applicants for the units under the Moderate Rehabilitation Program, the PHA must, promptly after receiving the executed ACC, make known to the public the availability of the Program.
(i) The notice must state that assistance under this Program will be available only in specified units which have been rehabilitated under the Program.
(ii) The notice must be made in accordance with the PHA's HUD-approved application and with the HUD guidelines for fair housing requiring the use of the equal housing opportunity logotype, statement and slogan.
(b)
Waiting list.
The PHA must maintain a waiting list for applicants for the Moderate Rehabilitation Program. This requirement may be met through the use of waiting lists for other subsidized housing programs such as the Existing Housing Program.
§ 882.514
Family participation.
(a)
Initial determination of family eligibility.
(1) The PHA is responsible for receipt and review of applications, and determination of family eligibility for participation in accordance with HUD regulations (see 24 CFR parts 5, 750 and 760). The PHA is responsible for verifying the sources and amount of the family's income and other information necessary for determining income eligibility and the amount of the assistance payments.
(2) PHA records on applicants and Families selected to participate must be maintained so as to provide HUD with racial, gender, and ethnic data.
(b)
Selection of Families for participation.
When vacancies occur, the PHA will refer to the Owner one or more appropriate size Families on its waiting list. The PHA must select Families for participation in accordance with the provisions of the Program and in accordance with the PHA's application, including any PHA requirement or preferences as approved by HUD. The PHA must select Families eligible for housing assistance payments currently residing in units that are designated for rehabilitation under the Program without requiring that these Families be placed on the waiting list. Notwithstanding the fact that the PHA may not be accepting additional applications for participation because of the length of the waiting list, the PHA may not refuse to place an applicant on the waiting list if the applicant is otherwise eligible for partcipation and claims that he or she qualifies for a Federal preference as provided in 24 CFR part 5, unless the PHA determines, on the basis of the number of applicants who are already on the waiting list and who claim a Federal preference, and the anticipated number of admissions under this part, that—
(1) There is an adequate pool of applicants who are likely to qualify for a Federal preference and
(2) It is unlikely that, on the basis of the PHA's system for applying the Federal preferences, the preference or preferences that the applicant claims, and the preferences claimed by applicants on the waiting list, the applicant would qualify for assistance before other applicants on the waiting list.
(c)
Owner selection of Families.
All vacant units under Contract must be rented to Eligible Families referred by the PHA from its waiting list. However, if the PHA is unable to refer a sufficient number of interested applicants on the waiting list to the Owner
within 30 days of the Owner's notification to the PHA of a vacancy, the Owner may advertise or solicit applications from Low-Income Families and refer such Families to the PHA to determine eligibility. Since the Owner is responsible for tenant selection, the Owner may refuse any family, provided that the Owner does not unlawfully discriminate.However, the owner must not deny program assistance or admission to an applicant based on the fact that the applicant is or has been a victim of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking, if the applicant otherwise qualifies for assistance or admission. Should the Owner reject a Family, and should the Family believe that the Owner's rejection was the result of unlawful discrimination, the Family may request the assistance of the PHA in resolving the issue. If the issue cannot be resolved promptly, the Family may file a complaint with HUD, and the PHA may refer the Family to the next available Moderate Rehabilitation unit.
(d)
Briefing of Families.
(1) When a Family is initially determined to be eligible for housing assistance payments or is selected for participation in accordance with this section, the PHA must provide the Family with information as to the Tenant Rent and the PHA's schedule of Utility Allowances. Each Family must also, either in group or individual sessions, be provided with a full explanation of the following:
(i) Family and Owner responsibilities under the Lease and Contract;
(ii) Significant aspects of the applicable State and local laws;
(iii) Significant aspects of Federal, State and local fair housing laws;
(iv) The fact that the subsidy is tied to the unit and the Family must occupy a unit rehabilitated under the Program;
(v) The Family's options under the Program should the Family be required to move due to an increase or decrease in Family size; and
(vi) The advisability and availability of blood lead level screening for children under 6 years of age and HUD's lead-based paint requirements in part 35, subparts A, B, H, and R of this title.
(2) For all Families to be temporarily relocated, the briefing must include a discussion of the relocation policies.
(e)
Continued participation of Family when Contract is terminated.
If an Owner evicts an assisted family in violation of the Contract or otherwise breaches the Contract, and the Contract for the unit is terminated, and if the Family was not at fault and is eligible for continued assistance, the Family may continue to receive housing assistance through the conversion of the Moderate Rehabilitation assistance to tenant-based assistance under the Section 8 voucher program. The Family must then be issued a voucher, and treated as any participant in the tenant-based programs under 24 CFR part 982, and must be assisted by the PHA in finding a suitable unit. All requirements of 24 CFR part 982 will be applicable except that the term of any housing assistance payments contract may not extend beyond the term of the initial Moderate Rehabilitation Contract. If the Family is determined ineligible for continued assistance, the voucher may be offered to the next Family on the PHA's waiting list. The unit will remain under the Moderate Rehabilitation ACC which provides for such a conversion of the units; therefore no amendment to the ACC will be necessary to convert to the Section 8 tenant-based assistance programs.
(f)
Families determined by the PHA to be ineligible.
If a Family is determined to be ineligible in accordance with the PHA's HUD-approved application, either at the application stage or after assistance has been provided on behalf of the Family, the PHA shall promptly notify the Family by letter of the determination and the reasons for it and the letter shall state that the Family has the right within a reasonable time (specified in the letter) to request an informal hearing. If, after conducting such an informal hearing, the PHA determines, based on a preponderance of the evidence, that the Family is ineligible, it shall notify the Family in writing. The procedures of this paragraph do not preclude the Family from exercising its other rights if it believes it is being discriminated against on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, age, handicap, familial status, or national
origin. The informal review provisions for the denial of a Federal selection preference under § 882.517 are contained in paragraph (k) of that section. The informal hearing requirements for denial and termination of assistance on the basis of ineligible immigration status are contained in 24 CFR part 5.

§ 882.515
Reexamination of family income and composition.
(a)
Regular reexaminations.
The PHA must reexamine the income and composition of all families at least once every 12 months. After consultation with the family and upon verification of the information, the PHA must make appropriate adjustments in the Total Tenant Payment in accordance with part 813 of this chapter and determine whether the family's unit size is still appropriate (see § 882.213). The PHA must adjust Tenant Rent and the Housing Assistance Payment to reflect any change in Total Tenant Payment. At the time of the annual reexamination of family income and composition, the PHA must require the family to disclose and verify Social Security Numbers. For requirements regarding the signing and submitting of consent forms by families for the obtaining of wage and claim information from State Wage Information Collection Agencies, see part 5, subpart B, of this title. At the first regular reexamination after June 19, 1995, the PHA shall follow the requirements of 24 CFR part 5 concerning obtaining and processing evidence of citizenship or eligible immigration status of all family members. Thereafter, at each regular reexamination, the PHA shall follow the requirements of 24 CFR part 5 concerning verification of immigration status of any new family member. For a family with net family assets (as the term is defined in § 5.603 of this title) equal to or less than $50,000, which amount will be adjusted annually by HUD in accordance with the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers, a PHA may accept, for purposes of recertification of income, a family's declaration under § 5.618(b) of this title, except that the PHA must obtain third-party verification of all family assets every 3 years.
(b)
Interim reexaminations.
(1) A family may request an interim determination of family income or composition because of any changes since the last determination. The PHA must conduct any interim reexamination within a reasonable period of time after the family request or when the PHA becomes aware of an increase in family adjusted income under paragraph (b)(3) of this section. What qualifies as a “reasonable time” may vary based on the amount of time it takes to verify information, but generally should not be longer than 30 days after changes in income are reported.
(2) The PHA may decline to conduct an interim reexamination of family income if the PHA estimates the family's adjusted income will decrease by an amount that is less than ten percent of the family's annual adjusted income (or a lower amount established by HUD through notice), or a lower threshold established by the PHA.
(3) The PHA must conduct an interim reexamination of family income when the PHA becomes aware that the family's adjusted income (§ 5.611 of this title) has changed by an amount that the PHA estimates will result in an increase of ten percent or more in annual adjusted income or such other amount established by HUD through notice, except:
(i) The PHA may not consider any increase in the earned income of the family when estimating or calculating whether the family's adjusted income has increased, unless the family has previously received an interim reduction under paragraph (c)(1) of this section during the certification period; and
(ii) The PHA may choose not to conduct an interim reexamination in the last three months of a certification period.
(4)(i) If the family has reported a change in family income or composition in a timely manner according to
the PHA's policies, the PHA must provide the family with 30 days advance notice of any increase in the Total Tenant Payment and Tenant Rent, and such increases will be effective the first day of the month beginning after the end of that 30-day period. Total Tenant Payment and Tenant Rent decreases will be effective on the first day of the first month after the date of the actual change leading to the interim reexamination of family income.
(ii) If the family has failed to report a change in family income or composition in a timely manner according to the PHA's policies, PHAs must implement any resulting Total Tenant Payment and Tenant Rent increases retroactively to the first of the month following the date of the change leading to the interim reexamination of family income. Any resulting Total Tenant Payment and Tenant Rent decrease must be implemented no later than the first rent period following completion of the reexamination. However, a PHA may apply a Total Tenant Payment and Tenant Rent decrease retroactively at the discretion of the PHA, in accordance with the conditions established by the PHA in the administrative plan and subject to paragraph (c)(4)(iii) of this section.
(iii) A retroactive Total Tenant Payment and Tenant Rent decrease may not be applied prior to the later of the first of the month following:
(A) The date of the change leading to the interim reexamination of family income; or
(B) The effective date of the family's most recent previous interim or annual reexamination (or initial examination if that was the family's last examination).
(5) The PHA must adopt policies consistent with this section prescribing how to determine the effective date of a change in the housing assistance payment resulting from an interim redetermination.
(c)
Obligation to supply information.
The family must supply such certification, release, information or documentation as the PHA or HUD determine to be necessary, including submission of required evidence of citizenship or eligible immigration status, submission of social security numbers and verifying documentation, submission of signed consent forms for the obtaining of wage and claim information from State Wage Information Collection Agencies, and submissions required for an annual or interim reexamination of family income and composition. See 24 CFR part 5.
(d)
Continuation of housing assistance payments.
A family's eligibility for Housing Assistance Payments shall continue until the Total Tenant Payment equals the Gross Rent. The termination of eligibility at such point will not affect the family's other rights under its lease, nor will such termination preclude the resumption of payments as a result of later changes in income, rents or other relevant circumstances during the term of the Contract. However, eligibility also may be terminated in accordance with HUD requirements for such reasons as failure to submit requested verification information, including failure to meet the disclosure and verification requirements for Social Security Numbers, as provided by part 5, subpart B, of this title, failure to sign and submit consent forms for the obtaining of wage and claim information from State Wage Information Collection Agencies, as provided by part 5, subpart B, of this title, or because of the restrictions on net assets and property ownership as provided by § 5.618 of this title. For provisions requiring termination of assistance when the PHA determines that a family member is not a U.S. citizen or does not have eligible immigration status, see 24 CFR parts 5 and 982 for provisions concerning certain assistance for mixed families (families whose members include those with eligible immigration status, and those without eligible immigration status) in lieu of termination of assistance, and for provisions concerning deferral of termination of assistance.
(e)
Family reporting of change.
The PHA must adopt policies consistent with this section prescribing when and under what conditions the family must report a change in family income or composition.
(f)
Accuracy of family income data.
The PHA must establish procedures that are appropriate and necessary to assure that income data provided by applicant
or participant families is complete and accurate. The PHA will not be considered out of compliance with the requirements in this section solely due to de minimis errors in calculating family income but is still obligated to correct errors once the PHA becomes aware of the errors. A de minimis error is an error where the PHA determination of family income deviates from the correct income determination by no more than $30 per month in monthly adjusted income ($360 in annual adjusted income).
(1) The PHA must take any corrective action necessary to credit or repay a family if the family has been overcharged for their Tenant Rent or Total Tenant Payment as a result of an error (including a de minimis error) in the income determination. Families will not be required to repay the PHA in instances where the PHA has miscalculated income resulting in a family being undercharged for Tenant Rent or Total Tenant Payment.
(2) HUD may revise the amount of de minimis error in this paragraph (f) through a notice published in the
Federal Register
for public comment.

§ 882.516
Maintenance, operation, and inspections.
(a)
Maintenance and operation.
The Owner must provide all the services, maintenance and utilities as agreed to under the Contract, subject to abatement of housing assistance payments or other applicable remedies if the Owner fails to meet these obligations.
(b)
Periodic inspection.
In addition to the inspections required prior to execution of the Contract, the PHA must inspect or cause to be inspected the contract units in accordance with the physical inspection requirements under 24 CFR part 5, subpart G, at least annually, and at such other times as may be necessary to assure that the Owner is meeting the obligations to maintain the units so they are compliant with 24 CFR part 5, subpart G, and to provide the agreed upon utilities and other services. The PHA must take into account complaints and any other information coming to its attention in scheduling inspections.
(c)
Units with health and safety hazards.
If the PHA notifies the Owner that the unit(s) under Contract are not being maintained in compliance with the standards under 24 CFR part 5, subpart G, and the Owner fails to take corrective action (including corrective action with respect to the Family where the condition of the unit is the fault of the Family) within the time prescribed in the notice, the PHA may exercise any of its rights or remedies under the Contract, including abatement of housing assistance payments (even if the Family continues in occupancy) or termination of the Contract on the affected unit(s) and assistance to the Family in accordance with § 882.514(e).
(d)
PHA management.
Where the PHA is managing units on which it is also administering the Housing Assistance Payments Contract pursuant to a management contract approved by HUD in accordance with § 882.412, HUD will make reviews of project operations, including inspections, in addition to required PHA reviews. These HUD reviews will be sufficient to assure that the Owner and the PHA are in full compliance with the terms and conditions of the Contract and the ACC. Should HUD determine that there are deficiencies, it may exercise any rights or remedies specified for the PHA under the Contract or reserved for HUD in the ACC, require termination of the management contract, or take other appropriate action.
(e)
Periodic reviews.
Periodic PHA audits must be conducted as required by HUD, in accordance with 2 CFR part 200, subpart F.
[47 FR 34383, Aug. 9, 1982, as amended at 53 FR 8065, Mar. 11, 1988; 80 FR 75941, Dec. 7, 2015; 88 FR 30499, May 11, 2023]
§ 882.517
HUD review of contract compliance.
HUD will review program operations at such intervals as it deems necessary to ensure that the Owner and the PHA are in full compliance with the terms and conditions of the Contract and the ACC. Equal Opportunity review may be
conducted with the scheduled HUD review or at any time deemed appropriate by HUD.

(a)
Requirement to deny admission
—(1)
Prohibiting admission of drug criminals.
(i) The PHA must prohibit admission to the program of an applicant for three years from the date of termination of tenancy if any household member's federally assisted housing tenancy has been terminated for drug-related criminal activity. However, the PHA may admit the household if the PHA determines:
(A) The household member who engaged in drug-related criminal activity and whose tenancy was terminated has successfully completed an approved supervised drug rehabilitation program, or
(B) The circumstances leading to the termination of tenancy no longer exist (for example, the criminal household member has died or is imprisoned).
(ii) The PHA must establish standards that permanently prohibit admission to the program if any household member has ever been convicted of drug-related criminal activity for manufacture or production of methamphetamine on the premises of federally assisted housing.
(iii) The PHA must establish standards that prohibit admission of a household to the program if the PHA determines that any household member is currently engaging in illegal use of a drug or that it has reasonable cause to believe that a household member's pattern of illegal use of a drug, as defined in § 5.100 of this title, may threaten the health, safety, or right to peaceful enjoyment of the premises by other residents.
(2)
Prohibiting admission of sex offenders.
The PHA must establish standards that prohibit admission to the program if any member of the household is subject to a lifetime registration requirement under a State sex offender registration program. In this screening of applicants, the PHA must perform criminal history background checks necessary to determine whether any household member is subject to a lifetime sex offender registration requirement in the State where the housing is located and in other States where household members are known to have resided.
(b)
Authority to deny admission
—(1)
Prohibiting admission of other criminals.
The PHA may prohibit admission of a household to the program under standards established by the PHA if the PHA determines that any household member is currently engaged in or has engaged in during a reasonable time before the admission decision:
(i) Drug-related criminal activity;
(ii) Violent criminal activity;
(iii) Other criminal activity which may threaten the health, safety, or right to peaceful enjoyment of the premises by other residents;
(iv) Other criminal activity which may threaten the health or safety of the owner or any employee, contractor, subcontractor or agent of the owner who is involved in the owner's housing operations.
(2)
Reasonable time.
The PHA may establish a period before the admission decision during which an applicant must not have engaged in the activities specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section “reasonable time”.
(3)
Sufficient evidence.
If the PHA has denied admission to an applicant because a member of the household engaged in criminal activity in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the PHA may reconsider the applicant if the PHA has sufficient evidence that the members of the household are not currently engaged in, and have not engaged in criminal activity during a reasonable period, as determined by the PHA, before the admission decision.
(i) The PHA would have “
sufficient evidence
” if the household member submitted a certification that she or he is not currently engaged in and has not engaged in such criminal activity during the specified period and provided supporting information from such sources as a probation officer, a landlord, neighbors, social service agency workers and criminal records, which the PHA verified.
(ii) For purposes of this section, a household member is “currently engaged in” criminal activity if the person has engaged in the behavior recently enough to justify a reasonable belief that the behavior is current.
(4)
Prohibiting admission of alcohol abusers.
The PHA must establish standards that prohibit admission to the program if the PHA determines that it has reasonable cause to believe that a household member's abuse or pattern of abuse of alcohol may threaten the health, safety, or right to peaceful enjoyment of the premises by other residents.
(c)
Terminating assistance
—(1)
Terminating assistance for drug criminals.
(i) The PHA may terminate assistance for drug-related criminal activity engaged in on or near the premises by any tenant, household member, or guest, and any such activity engaged in on the premises by any other person under the tenant's control.

(ii) The PHA may terminate assistance for a family if the PHA determines that a member of the household is:
(A) Fleeing to avoid prosecution, or custody or confinement after conviction, for a crime, or attempt to commit a crime, that is a felony under the laws of the place from which the individual flees, or that, in the case of the State of New Jersey, is a high misdemeanor; or
(B) Violating a condition of probation or parole imposed under Federal or State law.
(3)
Evidence of criminal activity.
(i) The PHA may terminate assistance for criminal activity in accordance with this section if the PHA determines, based on a preponderance of the evidence, that a covered person has engaged in the criminal activity, regardless of whether the covered person has been arrested or convicted for such activity.
(ii) See part 5, subpart J, of this title for provisions concerning access to criminal records.
(4)
Terminating assistance for alcohol abusers.
The PHA must establish standards that allow termination of assistance for a family if the PHA determines that a household member's abuse or pattern of abuse of alcohol threatens the health, safety, or right to peaceful enjoyment of the premises by other residents.

(c) Covered housing providers must develop and implement an emergency transfer plan that meets the requirements in 24 CFR 5.2005(e), and when a safe unit is not immediately available for a victim of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking who qualifies for an emergency transfer, covered housing providers must, at a minimum:
(1) Review the covered housing provider's existing inventory of units and determine when the next vacant unit may be available; and
(2) Provide a listing of nearby HUD subsidized rental properties, with or without preference for persons of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking, and contact information for the local HUD field office.
(d) Each year, the covered housing provider must submit to HUD data on all emergency transfers requested under 24 CFR 5.2005(e), pertaining to victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking, including data on the outcomes of such requests.
(e) For agreements covering nine or more assisted units, the following requirements for labor standards apply:
(1) Not less than the wages prevailing in the locality, as determined by the Secretary of Labor under the Davis-Bacon Act (40 U.S.C. 276a through 276a-5), must be paid to all laborers and mechanics employed in the development of the project, other than volunteers under the conditions set out in 24 CFR part 70;
(2) The employment of laborers and mechanics is subject to the provisions of the Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act (40 U.S.C. 327-333); and

§ 882.805
HA application process, ACC execution, and pre-rehabilitation activities.
(a)
Review.
When funds are made available for assistance, HUD will publish a notice of funding availability (NOFA) in the
Federal Register
in accordance with the requirements of 24 CFR part 4. HUD will review and screen applications in accordance with the guidelines, rating criteria, and procedures published in the NOFA.
(b)
ACC Execution.
(1) Before execution of the annual contributions contract (ACC), the HA must submit to the appropriate HUD field office the following:
(i) Estimates of Required Annual Contributions, Forms HUD-52672 and HUD-52673;
(ii) Administrative Plan, which should include:
(A) Procedures for tenant outreach;
(B) A policy governing temporary relocation; and
(C) A mechanism to monitor the provision of supportive services.
(iii) Proposed Schedule of Allowances for Tenant-Furnished Utilities and Other Services, Form HUD-52667, with a justification of the amounts proposed;
(iv) If applicable, proposed variations to the acceptability criteria of the Housing Quality Standards (see § 882.803(b)); and
(v) The fire and building code applicable to each structure.
(2) After HUD has approved the HA's application, the review and comment requirements of 24 CFR part 791 have been complied with, and the HA has submitted (and HUD has approved) the items required by paragraph (b)(1) of this section, HUD and the HA must execute the ACC in the form prescribed by HUD. The initial term of the ACC must be 11 years. This term allows one year to rehabilitate the units and place them under a 10-year HAP contract. The ACC must give HUD the option to renew the ACC for an additional 10 years.
(3) Section 882.403(a) (Maximum Total ACC Commitments) applies to this program.
(4) Section 882.403(b) (Project account) applies to this program.
(c)(1) If an owner is proposing to accomplish at least $3000 per unit of rehabilitation by including work to make the unit(s) accessible to a person with disabilities occupying the unit(s) or expected to occupy the unit(s), the PHA may approve such units not to exceed 5 percent of the units under its Program, provided that accessible units are necessary to meet the requirements of 24 CFR part 8, which implements section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. The rehabilitation must make the unit(s), and access and egress to the unit(s), barrier-free with respect to the disability of the individual in residence or expected to be in residence.
(2) The PHA must take the applications and determine the eligibility of all tenants residing in the approved units who wish to apply for the Program. After eligibility of all the tenants has been determined, the Owner must be informed of any adjustment in the number of units to be assisted. In order to make the most efficient use of housing assistance funds, an Agreement may not be entered into covering any unit occupied by a family which is not eligible to receive housing assistance payments. Therefore, the number of units approved by the PHA for a particular proposal must be adjusted to exclude any unit(s) determined by the
PHA to be occupied by a family not eligible to receive housing assistance payments. Eligible Families must also be briefed at this stage as to their rights and responsibilities under the Program.
(3) Should the Owner agree with the assessment of the PHA as to the work that must be accomplished, the preliminary feasibility of the proposal, and the number of units to be assisted, the Owner, with the assistance of the PHA where necessary, must prepare detailed work write-ups including specifications and plans (where necessary) so that a cost estimate may be prepared. The work write-up will describe how the deficiencies eligible for amortization through the Contract Rents are to be corrected including minimum acceptable levels of workmanship and materials. From this work write-up, the Owner, with the assistance of the PHA, must prepare a cost estimate for the accomplishment of all specified items.
(4) The owner is responsible for selecting a competent contractor to undertake the rehabilitation. The PHA must propose opportunities for minority contractors to participate in the program.
(5) The PHA must discuss with the Owner the various financing options available. The terms of the financing must be approved by the PHA in accordance with standards prescribed by HUD.
(6) Before execution of the Agreement, the HA must:
(i)(A) Inspect the structure to determine the specific work items that need to be accomplished to bring the units to be assisted up to the Housing Quality Standards (see § 882.803(b)) or other standards approved by HUD;
(B) Conduct a feasibility analysis, and determine whether cost-effective energy conserving improvements can be added;
(C) Ensure that the owner prepares the work write-ups and cost estimates required by paragraph (c)(3) of this section;
(D) Determine initial base rents and contract rents;
(ii) Assure that the owner has selected a contractor in accordance with paragraph (c)(4) of this section;
(iii) After the financing and a contractor are obtained, determine whether the costs can be covered by initial contract rents, computed in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section; and, if a structure contains more than 50 units to be assisted, submit the base rent and contract rent calculations to the appropriate HUD field office for review and approval in sufficient time for execution of the Agreement in a timely manner;
(iv) Obtain firm commitments to provide necessary supportive services;
(v) Obtain firm commitments for other resources to be provided;
(vi) Determine that the $3,000 minimum amount of work requirement and other requirements in paragraph (c)(1) of this section are met;
(vii) Determine eligibility of current tenants, and select the units to be assisted, in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this section;
(viii) Comply with the financing requirements in paragraph (c)(5) of this section;
(ix) Assure compliance with all other applicable requirements of this subpart; and
(x) If the HA determines that any structure proposed in its application is infeasible, or the HA proposes to select a different structure for any other reason, the HA must submit information for the proposed alternative structure to HUD for review and approval. HUD will rate the proposed structure in accordance with procedures in the applicable notice of funding availability. The HA may not proceed with processing for the proposed structure or execute an Agreement until HUD notifies the HA that HUD has approved the proposed alternative structure and that all requirements have been met.
(d)
Initial contract rents.
Section 882.408 (Initial contract rents), including the establishment of fair market rents for SRO units at 75 percent of the O-bedroom Moderate Rehabilitation Fair Market Rent, applies to this program, except as follows:
(1)(i) In determining the monthly cost of a rehabilitation loan, in accordance with § 882.408(c)(2), a loan term of a least 10 years (instead of 15 years) may be used. The exception in § 882.408(c)(2)(iii) for using the actual
loan term if the total amount of the rehabilitation is less than $15,000 continues to apply. In addition, the cost of the rehabilitation that may be included for the purpose of calculating the amount of the initial contract rent for any unit must not exceed the lower of:
(A) The projected cost of rehabilitation; or
(B) The per unit cost limitation that is established by
Federal Register
notice, plus the cost of the fire and safety improvements required by 24 CFR 982.605(b)(4). HUD may, however, increase the limitation in paragraph (d)(1)(i)(B) of this section by an amount HUD determines is reasonable and necessary to accommodate special local conditions, including high construction costs or stringent fire or building codes. HUD will publish future cost limitation changes in the
Federal Register
in the Notice of Funding Availability issued each year.
(ii) If the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) believes that high construction costs warrant an increase in the per unit cost limitation in paragraph (d)(1)(i)(B) of this section, the HA must demonstrate to HUD's satisfaction that a higher average per unit amount is necessary to conduct this program, and that every appropriate step has been taken to contain the amount of the rehabilitation within the published per unit cost limitation established at that time, plus the cost of the required fire and safety improvements. These higher amounts will be determined as follows:
(A) HUD may approve a higher per unit amount up to, but not to exceed, an amount computed by multiplying the HUD-approved High Cost Percentage for Base Cities (used for computing FHA high cost area adjustments) for the area, by the current published cost limitation plus the cost of the required fire and safety improvements.
(B) HUD may, on a structure-by-structure basis, increase the level approved in paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section to up to an amount computed by multiplying 2.4 by the current published cost limitation plus the cost of the required fire and safety improvements.
(2) In approving changes to initial contract rents during rehabilitation in accordance with § 882.408(d), the revised initial contract rents may not reflect an average per unit rehabilitation cost that exceeds the limitation specified in paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
(3) If the structure contains four or fewer SRO units, the Fair Market Rent for that size structure (the Fair Market Rent for a 1-, 2-, 3-, or 4-bedroom unit, as applicable) must be used to determine the Fair Market Rent limitation instead of using the separate Fair Market Rent for each SRO unit. To determine the Fair Market Rent limitation for each SRO unit, the Fair Market Rent for the structure must be apportioned equally to each SRO unit.
(4) Contract rents must not include the costs of providing supportive services, transportation, furniture, or other nonhousing costs, as determined by HUD. SRO program assistance may be used for efficiency units selected for rehabilitation under this program, but the gross rent (contract rent plus any Utility Allowance) for these units will be no higher than for SRO units (i.e., 75 percent of the 0-bedroom Moderate Rehabilitation Fair Market Rent).

§ 882.808
Management.
(a)
Outreach to homeless individuals and appropriate organizations.
(1) The HA or the owner must undertake outreach efforts to homeless individuals so that they may be brought into the program. The outreach effort should include notification to emergency shelter providers and other organizations that could provide referrals of homeless individuals. If the owner conducts the outreach effort, the owner must notify the HA so that it may provide referrals of homeless individuals.
(2)
Additional outreach concerns.
If the procedures that the HA or owner intends to use to publicize the availability of this program are unlikely to reach persons of any particular race,
color, religion, sex, age, national origin, or mental or physical disability who may qualify for admission to the program, the HA or owner must establish additional procedures that will ensure that such persons are made aware of the availability of the program. The HA or owner must also adopt and implement procedures to ensure that interested persons can obtain information concerning the existence and location of services and facilities that are accessible to persons with disabilities.
(3)
First priority for homeless individuals.
Homeless individuals must have the first priority for occupancy of housing rehabilitated under this program.
(b)
Individual participation
—(1)
Initial determination of individual eligibility.
Section 882.514(a) applies to this program.
(2)
Owner selection of individuals.
The owner must rent all vacant units under contract to homeless individuals located through HA or owner outreach efforts and determined by the HA to be eligible. The owner is responsible for tenant selection and may refuse any individual, provided the owner does not unlawfully discriminate. If the owner rejects an individual, and the individual believes that the owner's rejection was the result of unlawful discrimination, the individual may request the assistance of the HA in resolving the issue and may also file a complaint with HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity in accordance with 24 CFR 103.25. If the individual requests the assistance of the HA, and if the HA cannot resolve the complaint promptly, the HA should advise the individual that he or she may file a complaint with HUD, and provide the individual with the address of the nearest HUD Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity.
(3)
Briefing of individuals.
Section 882.514(d) applies to this program, except that § 882.514(d)(1)(vi) does not apply.
(4)
Continued participation of individual when contract is terminated.
Section 882.514(e) applies to this program.
(5)
Individuals determined by the HA to be ineligible.
Section 882.514(f) applies to this program. In addition, individuals are not precluded from exercising other rights if they believe they have been discriminated against on the basis of age.
(c)
Lease.
Sections 882.403(d) and 882.511(a) apply to this program. In addition, the lease must limit occupancy to one eligible individual.

Responsibility of the individual.
Section 882.413 applies to this program.
(i)
Reexamination of individual income
—(1)
Regular reexaminations.
The HA must reexamine the income of all individuals at least once every 12 months. After consultation with the individual and upon verification of the information, the HA must make appropriate adjustments in the Total Tenant Payment in accordance with 24 CFR part 5, subpart F, and verify that only one individual is occupying the unit. The HA must adjust Tenant Rent and the Housing Assistance Payment to reflect any change in Total Tenant Payment. At each regular reexamination, the HA must follow the requirements of 24 CFR part 5, subpart E concerning verification of immigration status of any new family member. For an individual with net family assets (as the term is defined in § 5.603 of this title) equal to or less than $50,000, which amount will be adjusted annually by HUD in accordance with the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers, a PHA may accept, for purposes of recertification of income, an individual's declaration under § 5.618(b) of this title, except that the PHA must obtain third-party verification of all family assets every 3 years.
(2)
Interim reexaminations.
The individual shall supply such certification, release, information, or documentation as the PHA or HUD determines to be necessary, including submissions required for interim reexaminations of individual income and determinations as to whether only one individual is occupying the unit. In addition § 882.515(b) shall apply.
(3)
Continuation of Housing Assistance Payments.
Section 882.515(d) applies to this program.
(4)
Individual reporting of change.
The PHA must adopt policies consistent with this section prescribing when and under what conditions the individual must report a change in family income or composition.
(5)
Accuracy of family income data.
The PHA must establish procedures that are appropriate and necessary to assure that income data provided by applicant or participant individuals is complete and accurate. The PHA will not be considered out of compliance with the requirements in this section solely due to de minimis errors in calculating family income but is still obligated to correct errors once the PHA becomes aware of the errors. A de minimis error is an error where the PHA determination of family income deviates from the correct income determination by no more than $30 per month in monthly adjusted income ($360 in annual adjusted income).
(A) The PHA must take any corrective action necessary to credit or repay an individual if the individual has been overcharged for their Tenant Rent or Total Tenant Payment as a result of an error (including a de minimis error) in the income determination. Individuals will not be required to repay the PHA in instances where the PHA has miscalculated income resulting in an individual being undercharged for Tenant Rent or Total Tenant Payment.
(B) HUD may revise the amount of de minimis error in this paragraph (i)(5) through a rulemaking published in the
Federal Register
for public comment.
(j)
Overcrowded units.
If the HA determines that anyone other than, or in addition to, the eligible individual is occupying an SRO unit assisted under this program, the HA must take all necessary action, as soon as reasonably feasible, to ensure that the unit is occupied by only one eligible individual.
(k)
Adjustment of utility allowance.
Section 882.510 applies to this program.
(l)
Termination of tenancy.
Section 882.511 applies to this program. For provisions requiring termination of assistance when the HA determines that a family member is not a U.S. citizen or does not have eligible immigration status, see 24 CFR part 5, subpart E for provisions concerning certain assistance for mixed families (families whose members include those with eligible immigration status, and those without eligible immigration status) in lieu of termination of assistance, or for provisions concerning deferral of termination of assistance.
(m)
Reduction of number of units covered by contract.
Section 882.512 applies to this program.
(n)
Maintenance, operation, and inspections.
Section 882.516 applies to this program.
(o)

Section 882.517 applies to this program.
(p)
Records and reports.
Each recipient of assistance under this subpart must keep any records and make any reports that HUD may require within the timeframe required.
(q)
Participation of homeless individuals.
(1) Each approved applicant receiving assistance under this program, except HAs, must provide for the participation of not less than one homeless individual or formerly homeless individual on the board of directors or other equivalent policymaking entity of such applicant, to the extent that the entity considers and makes policies and decisions regarding the rehabilitation of any housing with assistance under this subpart. This requirement is waived if the applicant is unable to meet this requirement and presents a plan that HUD approves to consult with homeless or formerly homeless individuals in considering and making such policies and decisions.
(2) To the maximum extent practicable, each approved applicant must involve homeless individuals and families, through employment, volunteer services, or otherwise, in rehabilitating and operating facilities assisted under this subpart, and in providing services for occupants of such facilities.

§ 882.809
Waivers.
Section 5.405(b) of this title does not apply to this program.
§ 882.810
Displacement, relocation, and acquisition.
(a)
Minimizing displacement.
(1) Consistent with the other goals and objectives of this part, owners must assure that they have taken all reasonable steps to minimize the displacement of persons (households, businesses, nonprofit organizations, and farms) as a result of a project assisted under this part. To the extent feasible, residential tenants must be provided a reasonable opportunity to lease and occupy a suitable, decent, safe, sanitary, and affordable dwelling unit in the project upon its completion.
(2) Whenever a building/complex is rehabilitated, and some but not all of the rehabilitated units will be assisted upon completion of the rehabilitation, the relocation requirements described in this section apply to the occupants of each rehabilitated unit, whether or not Section 8 assistance will be provided for the unit.
(b)
Temporary relocation.
The following policies cover residential tenants who will not be required to move permanently but who must relocate temporarily for the project. Such tenants must be provided:
(1) Reimbursement for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the temporary relocation;
(2) Appropriate advisory services, including reasonable advance written notice of:
(i) The date and approximate duration of the temporary relocation;
(ii) The location of the suitable, decent, safe, and sanitary dwelling to be made available for the temporary period;
(iii) The terms and conditions under which the tenant may lease and occupy a suitable, decent, safe, and sanitary dwelling in the project upon completion; and
(iv) The assistance required under paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
(c)
Relocation assistance for displaced persons.
A “displaced person” (defined in paragraph (g) of this section) must be provided relocation assistance at the levels described in, and in accordance with the requirements of, the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970, as amended (URA) (42 U.S.C. 4601-4655) and implementing regulations in 49 CFR part 24. A displaced person must be advised of his or her rights under the Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 3601-19) and, if the comparable replacement dwelling used to establish the amount of the replacement housing payment to be provided to a minority is located in an area of minority concentration, such person also must be given, if possible, referrals to comparable and suitable, decent, safe, and sanitary replacement dwellings not located in such areas.
(d)
Real property acquisition requirements.
The acquisition of real property for a project is subject to the URA and the requirements described in 49 CFR part 24, subpart B.
(e)
Appeals.
A person who disagrees with the HA's determination concerning whether the person qualifies as a displaced person, or the amount of relocation assistance for which the person is eligible, may file a written appeal of that determination with the HA. A person who is dissatisfied with the HA's determination on his or her appeal may submit a written request for review of that determination to the HUD field office.
(f)
Responsibility of HA.
(1) The HA must certify (i.e., provide assurance of compliance as required by 49 CFR part 24) that it will comply with the URA, the regulations in 49 CFR part 24, and the requirements of this section, and must ensure such compliance notwithstanding any third party's contractual obligation to the HA to comply with these provisions.
(2) The cost of required relocation assistance is an eligible project cost in the same manner and to the same extent as other project costs. Such costs may be paid for with local public funds or funds available from other sources. The cost of HA advisory services for temporary relocation of tenants to be assisted under the program also may be paid from preliminary administrative funds.
(3) The HA must maintain records in sufficient detail to demonstrate compliance with the provisions of this section. The HA must maintain data on the racial, ethnic, gender, and disability status of displaced persons.
(g)
Definition of displaced person.
(1) For purposes of this section, the term
displaced person
means a person (household, business, nonprofit organization, or farm) that moves from real property, or moves personal property from real property, permanently, as a direct result of acquisition, rehabilitation, or demolition for a project assisted under this part. The term
displaced person
includes, but may not be limited to:
(i) A person who moves permanently from the real property after receiving notice requiring such move, if the move occurs on or after the date the owner submits to the HA the owner proposal that is later approved;
(ii) A person, including a person who moves from the property before the date the owner submits the proposal to the HA, if the HA or HUD determines that the displacement resulted directly from acquisition, rehabilitation, or demolition for the assisted project; or
(iii) A tenant-occupant of a dwelling unit who moves from the building/complex permanently after the execution of the Agreement between the owner and the HA (or, for projects assisted under subpart H of this part, after the “initiation of negotiations” (see paragraph (h) of this section)), if the move occurs before the tenant is provided a written notice offering him or her the opportunity to lease and occupy a suitable, decent, safe, and sanitary dwelling in the same building/complex, under reasonable terms and conditions, upon its completion. Such reasonable terms and conditions must include a monthly rent and estimated average monthly utility costs that do not exceed the greater of:
(A) The tenant's monthly rent before the execution of the agreement and estimated average monthly utility costs; or
(B) Thirty percent of gross household income.
(C) For projects assisted under subpart H of this part, the amount cannot exceed the greater of the tenant's monthly rent before the “initiation of negotiations” and estimated average monthly utility costs; or (if the tenant is low-income) the total tenant payment, as determined under 24 CFR 5.613, or (if the tenant is not low-income) 30 percent of gross household income; or
(iv) A tenant-occupant of a dwelling, who is required to relocate temporarily, but does not return to the building/complex, if either:
(A) The tenant is not offered payment for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the temporary relocation; or
(B) Other conditions of the temporary relocation are not reasonable; or
(v) A tenant-occupant of a dwelling who moves from the building/complex permanently after he or she has been required to move to another dwelling unit in the building/complex, if either:
(A) The tenant is not offered reimbursement for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the move; or
(B) Other conditions of the move are not reasonable.
(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (g)(1) of this section, a person does not qualify as a displaced person (and is not eligible for relocation assistance under the URA or this section), if:
(i) The person has been evicted for serious or repeated violation of the terms and conditions of the lease or occupancy agreement, violation of applicable Federal, State, or local law, or other good cause, and the HA determines that the eviction was not undertaken for the purpose of evading the obligation to provide relocation assistance;
(ii) The person moved into the property after the submission of the preliminary proposal (or application, if there is no preliminary proposal), and before signing a lease and commencing occupancy, received written notice of the project and its possible impact on the person (e.g., the person may be displaced, temporarily relocated, or suffer a rent increase) and the fact that the person would not qualify as a displaced person (or for any assistance provided under this section) as a result of the project;
(iii) The person is ineligible under 49 CFR 24.2(g)(2); or
(iv) HUD determines that the person was not displaced as a direct result of
acquisition, rehabilitation, or demolition for the project.
(3) The HA may request, at any time, HUD's determination of whether a displacement is or would be covered by this section.

§ 883.101
General.
(a) The purpose of the Section 8 program is to provide decent, safe and sanitary housing for low-income families through the use of a system of housing assistance payments. These needs may be met by statewide or special purpose housing agencies established by the various States.
(b) The regulations in this part 883 contain the policies and procedures applicable to the Section 8 program for these State agencies.
[61 FR 13592, Mar. 27, 1996]
§ 883.105
Applicability of part 883 in effect as of February 29, 1980.
(a) Part 883, in effect as of February 29, 1980, applies to projects for which the initial application was submitted on or after the February 29, 1980, effective date. (See 24 CFR part 883, revised as of April 1, 1980.) Projects for which applications or proposals were submitted before the February 29, 1980, effective date of part 883 have been processed under the part 883 regulations and procedures in effect at the date of submission. If, however, the agency notified HUD within 60 calendar days of the February 29, 1980, effective date of the part 883 regulations that they chose to have the provisions of part 883, in effect as of February 29, 1980, apply to a specific case, it must have promptly modified the application(s) and proposal(s) to comply.
(b) Subpart F of this part, dealing with the HAP contract and subpart G of this part, dealing with management, apply to all projects for which an Agreement was not executed before the February 29, 1980, effective date of part 883. In cases where an Agreement has been executed:
(1) The Agency, owner and HUD may agree to make the revised subpart F of this part applicable and execute appropriate amendments to the Agreement or Contract;
(2) The Agency, Owner and HUD may agree to make the revised subpart G of this part applicable (with or without the limitation on distributions) and execute appropriate amendments to the Agreement or Contract.
(c) Section 883.708, Termination of Tenancy and Modifications of Leases, applies to new families who begin occupancy or execute a lease on or after 30 days following the February 29, 1980, effective date of part 883. This section also applies to families not covered by the preceding sentence, including families currently under lease, who have a lease in which a renewal becomes effective on or after the 60th day following the February 29, 1980 effective date of part 883. A lease is considered renewed when both the landlord and the family fail to terminate a tenancy under a lease permitting either to terminate.
(d) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section, the provisions of 24 CFR part 5 (concerning preferences for selection of applicants) apply to all projects, regardless of when am Agreement was executed.
[61 FR 13592, Mar. 27, 1996]
§ 883.106
Applicability and relationships between HUD and State agencies.
(a)
Applicability.
This subpart A applies to contract authority set aside for a State Agency.
(b)
General responsibilities and relationships.
Subject to audit and review by HUD to assure compliance with Federal requirements and objectives, Housing Finance Agencies (HFAs) shall assume responsibility for project development and for supervision of the development, management and maintenance functions of owners.
(c)
Certifications and HUD monitoring.
(1) Generally, when reviewing any of the certifications of an HFA required by this part, HUD shall accept the certification as correct. If HUD has substantial reason to question the correctness of any element in a certification, HUD shall promptly bring the matter to the attention of the HFA and ask it to provide documentation supporting the certifications. When the HFA provides such evidence, HUD will act in accordance with the HFA's judgment or evaluation unless HUD determines that the certification is clearly not supported by the documentation.
(2) HUD will periodically monitor the activities of HFA's participating under this part only with respect to Section 8 or other HUD programs. This monitoring is intended primarily to ensure that certifications submitted and projects operated under this part reflect appropriate compliance with Federal law and requirements.
[61 FR 13592, Mar. 27, 1996]
Subpart B [Reserved]

# Subpart C—Definitions and Other Requirements
§ 883.301
Applicability.
The provisions of this subpart are applicable to newly constructed and substantially rehabilitated housing allocated contract authority under subpart B of this part and processed and constructed under the Fast Tract Procedures of subpart D. The definitions contained in § 883.302 and the provisions of § 883.307(b) regarding review and approval of financing documents, however, apply to all of this part.
§ 883.302
Definitions.
The terms
Fair Market Rent (FMR), HUD,
and
Public Housing Agency (PHA)
are defined in 24 CFR part 5.
ACC (Annual Contributions Contract).
The contract between the State Agency and HUD under which HUD commits to provide the Agency with the funds needed to make housing assistance payments to the Owner and to pay the Agency for administrative fees in cases where it is eligible for them.
Agency.
See State Agency.
Agreement—(Agreement to enter into Housing Assistance Payments Contract).
The agreement between the owner and the State Agency on new construction and substantial rehabilitation projects which provides that, upon satisfactory completion of the project in accordance with the HUD-approved proposal or final proposal, the Agency will enter
into a Housing Assistance Payments Contract with the owner.
Annual Income.
As defined in part 5 of this title.
Assisted unit.
A dwelling unit eligible for assistance under a Contract.
Application.
A request, submitted by a State Agency, to assign a portion of its set-aside to a specific jurisdiction or project.
Contract—(Housing Assistance Payments Contract).
The Contract entered into by the owner and the State Agency upon satisfactory completion of a new construction or substantial rehabilitation project which sets forth the rights and duties of the parties with respect to the project and the payments under the Contract.
Contract Rent.
The total amount of rent specified in the Contract as payable by the Agency and the tenant to the owner for an assisted unit. In the case of the rental of only a manufactured home space, “contract rent” is the total rent specified in the Contract as payable by the Agency and the tenant to the owner for rental of the space, including fees or charges for management and maintenance services with respect to the space, but excluding utility charges for the manufactured home.
Covered housing provider.
For the Section 8 Housing Assistance Payments Programs—State Housing Agencies, “covered housing provider,” as such term is used in HUD's regulations in 24 CFR part 5, subpart L (Protection for Victims of Domestic Violence, Dating Violence, Sexual Assault, or Stalking), refers to the HFA or owner, as applicable given the responsibilities of the covered housing provider as set forth in 24 CFR part 5, subpart L. For example, the PHA is the covered housing provider responsible for providing the notice of occupancy rights under VAWA and certification form described at 24 CFR 5.2005(a), though the PHA may provide this notice and form to owners, and charge owners with distributing the notice and form to tenants. In addition, the owner is the covered housing provider that may choose to bifurcate a lease as described at 24 CFR 5.2009(a), while both the PHA and owner are both responsible for ensuring that an emergency transfer plan is in place in accordance with 24 CFR 5.2005(e), and the owner is responsible for implementing the emergency transfer plan when an emergency occurs.
Decent, safe, and sanitary.
Housing is decent, safe, and sanitary if it meets the physical condition requirements in 24 CFR part 5, subpart G.
Existing Housing.
Housing assisted under a contract entered into pursuant to 24 CFR part 882. (See subpart E of this part.)
Fast Track procedures.

Gross Rent.
As defined in part 813 of this chapter.
HFA (Housing Finance Agency).
While the Annual Contributions Contract between the State Agency and HUD is in effect, “Housing Finance Agency” and “HFA” means a State Agency that provided permanent financing for newly constructed or substantially rehabilitated housing processed under this part and financed without Federal mortgage insurance or a Federal guarantee except coinsurance under section 244 of the National Housing Act.

unit by the State Agency as provided in the Contract. Where the unit is leased to an eligible Family, the payment is the difference between the Contract Rent and the Tenant Rent. An additional payment is made to the Family when the Utility Allowance is greater than Total Tenant Payment. In the case of a Family renting only a manufactured home space as provided in § 883.303(i), the Housing Assistance Payment is the difference between Gross Rent and the Total Tenant Payment, but such payment may not exceed the Contract Rent for the space, and no additional payment is made to the Family. A Housing Assistance Payment, known as a “vacancy payment”, may be made to the Owner when an assisted unit is vacant, as provided in § 883.712.
Housing Assistance Plan (HAP).
A housing plan submitted by a unit of general local or State government and approved by HUD as being acceptable under the standards of 24 CFR part 570.
Housing type.
The three housing types are new construction, substantial rehabilitation, and existing housing/moderate rehabilitation.

If not certified, the Independent Public Accountant must have been licensed or registered by a regulatory authority of a State or other political subdivision of the United States on or before December 31, 1970. In States that do not regulate the use of the title “public accountant,” only Certified Public Accountants may be used.
Moderate rehabilitation.
The improvement of dwelling units in accordance with HUD requirements, under 24 CFR part 882.
New construction.
Housing for which construction starts after execution of an Agreement, or housing which is already under construction when the Agreement is executed provided that:

[45 FR 6889, Jan. 30, 1980, as amended at 45 FR 56326, Aug. 22, 1980; 48 FR 12708, Mar. 28, 1983; 49 FR 17449, Apr. 24, 1984; 49 FR 19946, May 10, 1984; 61 FR 5213, Feb. 9, 1996; 61 FR 13592, Mar. 27, 1996; 63 FR 46579, Sept. 1, 1998; 70 FR 77744, Dec. 30, 2005; 81 FR 80813, Nov. 16, 2016; 89 FR 96098, Dec. 4, 2024]
§ 883.306
Limitation on distributions.
(a) Non-profit owners are not entitled to distributions of project funds.
(b) For the life of the Contract, project funds may only be distributed to profit-motivated owners at the end of each fiscal year of project operation following the effective date of the Contract and after all project expenses have been paid, or funds have been set aside for payment, and all reserve requirements have been met. The first year's distribution may not be made until the HFA certification of project costs, (See § 883.411), where applicable, has been submitted to HUD. The HFA must certify that distributions will not exceed the following maximum returns:
(1) For projects for elderly families, the first year's distribution will be limited to 6 percent on equity. The Assistant Secretary may provide for increases in subsequent years' distributions on an annual or other basis so that the permitted return reflects a 6 percent return on the value, in subsequent years, as determined in accordance with HUD guidelines, of the approved initial equity. Any such adjustments will be made in accordance with a Notice in the
Federal Register.
The HFA may approve a lesser increase or no increase in subsequent years' distributions.
(2) For projects for non-elderly families the first year's distribution will be limited to 10 percent on equity. The Assistant Secretary may provide for increases in subsequent years' distributions on an annual or other basis so that the permitted return reflects a 10 percent return on the value, in subsequent years, as determined in accordance with HUD guidelines, of the approved initial equity. Any such adjustments will be made in accordance with a Notice in the
Federal Register.
The HFA may approve a lesser increase or no increase in subsequent years' distributions.
(c) For the purpose of determining the allowable distribution, an owner's equity investment in a project is deemed to be 10 percent of the replacement cost of the part of the project attributable to dwelling use accepted by the HFA at cost certification (See § 883.411), or as specified in the Proposal where cost certification is not required, unless the owner justifies a higher equity contribution through cost certification documentation accepted by the HFA.
(d) Any short-fall in return may be made up from surplus project funds in future years.
(e) If the HFA determines at any time that surplus project funds are more than the amount needed for project operations, reserve requirements and permitted distributions, the HFA may require the excess to be placed in a separate account to be used to reduce housing assistance payments or for other project purposes. Upon termination of the Contract, any excess project funds must be remitted to HUD. Upon termination of the Annual Contributions Contract between HUD and the HFA, the Owner must request withdrawal of any funds that were placed in such an account at the direction of the HFA and immediately deposit such funds into an interest-bearing residual receipts account that complies with the requirements of 24 CFR 880.601(e)(2)(i).
(f) Owners of small projects or partially assisted projects are exempt from the limitation on distributions contained in paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section.
(g) HUD may permit increased distributions of surplus, in excess of the amounts otherwise permitted, to profit-motivated owners who participate in a HUD-approved initiative or program to preserve below-market housing stock. The increased distributions will be limited to a maximum amount based on market rents and calculated according to HUD instructions. Funds that the owner is authorized to retain under section 236(g)(2) of the National Housing Act are not considered distributions to the owner.
(h) Any State or local law or regulation that restricts distributions to an amount lower than permitted by this section or permitted by the Commissioner under this paragraph (h) is preempted as provided by section 524(f) of the Multifamily Assisted Housing Reform and Affordability Act of 1997.
[45 FR 6889, Jan. 30, 1980, as amended at 65 FR 61075, Oct. 13, 2000; 65 FR 68891, Nov. 15, 2000; 89 FR 96098, Dec. 4, 2024]
§ 883.307
Financing.
(a)
Types of financing.
A State Agency that used the Fast Track Procedures formerly in this part must provide permanent financing for any new construction or substantial rehabilitation project without Federal mortgage insurance, except coinsurance under section 244 under the National Housing Act (12 U.S.C. 1701 et seq). Obligations issued by the HFA for this purpose may be taxable under section 802 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 (42 U.S.C. 1440) or tax-exempt under section 103 of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 103), 24 CFR part 811 or other Federal Law.
(b)
HUD approval.
(1) A State Agency, prior to receiving HUD approval of its first New Construction or Substantial Rehabilitation Proposal using contract authority under this part, must submit copies of the documents relating to the method of financing Section 8 projects to HUD for review. These documents shall include bond resolutions or indentures, loan agreements, regulatory agreements, notes, mortgages or deeds of trust and other related documents, if any, but does not need to include the “official statement” or copies of the prospectus for individual bond issues. HUD review will be limited to making certain that the documents are not inconsistent with or in violation of these regulations and the administrative procedures used to implement them. After review, HUD must notify the Agency that the documents are acceptable or, if unacceptable, will request clarification or changes. This review and approval will meet the requirements of 24 CFR 811.107(a).
(2) When an Agency which has received HUD approval of its financing documents proposes substantive changes in them which affect the Section 8 program, the revised documents must be submitted for review. HUD review will be limited to the areas indicated in paragraph (b)(1) of this section and must be carried out promptly. HUD will notify the Agency that the revised documents are acceptable, or, if unacceptable, will request clarification or changes.
(3) The review and approval of financing documents required under 24 CFR part 811 will constitute HUD approval under this section.
(4) The Agency must retain in its files, and make available for HUD inspection, the documentation relating to its financing of Section 8 projects, including any relating to the certifications of compliance with applicable Department of Treasury or HUD regulations (24 CFR part 811) regarding tax-exempt financing.
(c)
Pledge of Contracts.
The HFA or owner may pledge, or offer as security for any loan or obligation, an Agreement, Contract, or ACC entered into pursuant this part provided that such security is in connection with a project constructed pursuant to this part. Any pledge of the Agreement, Contract, or ACC, or payments thereunder will be limited to the amounts payable under the Contract or ACC in accordance with its terms. If the pledge or other document provides that all payments will be paid directly to the HFA, other mortgagee or the trustee for bondholders, the HFA, other mortgagee or trustee may make all payments or deposits required under the mortgage or trust indenture and remit any excess to the owner.
(d)
Foreclosure and other transfers.
In the event of assignment, sale, or other disposition of the project or the contracts agreed to by the HFA and approved by HUD (which approval shall not be unreasonably delayed or withheld), foreclosure, or assignment of the mortgage or deed in lieu of foreclosure,
(1) The Agreement, the Contract and the ACC will continue in effect, and
(2) Housing assistance payments will continue in accordance with the terms of the Contract, unless approval to amend or terminate the Agreement, the Contract or the ACC has been obtained from the Assistant Secretary.
(e) In the case of a newly constructed or substantially rehabilitated manufactured home park, the principal amount of any mortgage attributable to the rental spaces in the park may not exceed an amount per space determined in accordance with § 207.33(b) of this title.
[45 FR 6889, Jan. 30, 1980, as amended at 45 FR 56327, Aug. 22, 1980; 48 FR 12709, Mar. 28, 1983; 49 FR 17449, Apr. 24, 1984; 61 FR 13592, Mar. 27, 1996]
§ 883.308
Adjustments to reflect changes in terms of financing.
(a)
Certifications of projected financing terms.
When an HFA, under this part, provides permanent financing for a project through the issuance of obligations and these are not sold until after the contract rents for a project have been set, the HFA must submit, with the Proposal, a certification of:
(1) Its projected rate of borrowing (net interest cost), based on a reasonable evaluation of market conditions, on obligations issued to provide interim and permanent financing for the project,
(2) The projected cost of borrowing to the owner on interim financing for the project,
(3) The projected loan amount for the project,
(4) The projected cost of borrowing and the term of the permanent financing to be provided to the owner for the project,
(5) The projected annual debt service for the permanent financing on which the Contract Rents are based, and
(6) The override, if any.
(b)
Revised certifications.
If, at any time prior to the execution of the Agreement, the terms and conditions of financing change, other than the HFA's projected cost of borrowing, the HFA must submit revised certifications based upon the new terms.
(c)
Certifications of actual financing terms.
After a project has been permanently financed, the HFA must submit a certification which specifies the actual financing terms. The items that must be included in this certification include:
(1) The HFA's actual cost of borrowing (net interest cost) on obligations from which funds were used to permanently finance the project,
(2) The override, if any, added to the actual cost of borrowing on obligations in setting the rate of lending to the owner,
(3) The annual debt service to the owner for the permanent financing on which contract rents are based; and,
(4) The actual loan amount and the term on which the annual debt service is based.
(d)
Reduction of Contract Rents.
If the actual debt service to the owner under the permanent financing is lower than the anticipated debt service on which the Contract Rents were based, the initial Contract Rents, or the Contract Rents currently in effect, must be reduced commensurately, and the amount of the savings credited to the project account.
(e)
Increase of Contract Rents.
This paragraph (e) applies only if the HFA is using its set-aside for the project and it is processed under subpart D. If the actual debt service to the owner under the permanent financing is higher than the anticipated debt service on which the Contract Rents are based, the initial Contract Rents or the Contract Rents currently in effect may, if sufficient contract and budget authority is available, be increased commensurately based on the certification submitted under paragraph (c) of this section. The amount of this increase may not exceed the amount of the Financing Cost Contingency (FCC) authorized but not reserved for the project at the time the proposal is approved. The adjustment must not exceed the amount necessary to reflect an increase in debt service (based on the difference between the projected and actual terms of the permanent financing) resulting from an increase over the projected interest rate of not more than:
(1) One and one-half percent if the projected override was three-fourths of one percent or less, or
(2) One percent if such projected override was more than three-fourths of one percent but not more than one percent, or
(3) One-half of one percent if such projected override was more than one percent.
(f)
Recoupment of savings in financing costs.
In the event that interim financing is continued after the first year of the term of the Contract and the debt service of the interim financing for any period of three months after such first year is less than the anticipated debt service under the permanent financing on which the Contract Rents were based, an appropriate amount reflecting the savings in financing cost will be credited by HUD to the Project Account and withheld from housing assistance payments payable to the owner. If during the course of the same year there is any period of three months in which the debt service is greater than the anticipated debt service under the projected permanent financing, an adjustment will be made so that only the net amount of savings in debt service for the year is credited by HUD to the Project Account and withheld from housing assistance payments to the owner. No increased payments will be made to the owner on account of any net excess for the year of actual interim debt service over the anticipated debt service under the permanent financing. Nothing in this paragraph will be construed as requiring a permanent reduction in the Contract Rents or precluding adjustments of Contract Rents in accordance with paragraphs (d) or (e) of this section.
(g)
Compliance with other regulations.
The HFA must also submit a certification specifying:
(1) That the terms of financing, the amount of the obligations issued with respect to the project and the use of the funds will be in compliance with any regulation governing the issuance of the obligations, e.g., Department of the Treasury regulations regarding arbitrage or HUD regulations regarding Tax Exemption of Obligations of Public Housing Agencies (24 CFR part 811), and
(2) That the override, if any, on the permanent financing for the project will not be greater than the projected override nor greater than the override allowed for the borrowing as a whole under applicable regulations, e.g., the Department of Treasury regulations regarding arbitrage. The certifications required under 24 CFR 811.107(a)(2) will be sufficient to meet the certification requirements of this paragraph (g).

Vacancies during rent-up.
If a Contract Unit is not leased as of the effective date of the Contract, the Owner shall be entitled to housing assistance payments in the amount of 80 percent of the Contract Rent for the unit for a vacancy period not exceeding 60 days from the effective date of the Contract, in accordance with the procedure set forth in § 884.213(b):
Provided,
That the Owner: (1) Commenced marketing and otherwise complied with § 884.211(e), (2) has taken and continues to take all feasible actions to fill the vacancy, including, but not limited to, contacting applicants on his waiting list, if any, requesting the PHA and other appropriate sources to refer eligible applicants, and advertising the availability of the unit, and (3) has not rejected any eligible applicant, except for good cause acceptable to HUD or the PHA, as the case may be.
(c)
Vacancies after rent-up.
(1) If an Eligible Family vacates its unit (other than as a result of action by the Owner which is in violation of the Lease or the Contract or any applicable law), the Owner shall receive housing assistance payments in the amount of 80 percent of the Contract Rent for a vacancy period not exceeding 60 days; provided, however, That if the Owner collects any of the Family's share of the rent for this period in an amount which, when added to the 80 percent payments, results in more than the Contract Rent, such excess shall be payable to HUD or as HUD may direct. (See also § 884.115). The Owner shall not be entitled to any payment under this paragraph (c)(1) unless he: (i) Immediately upon learning of the vacancy, has notified HUD or the PHA, as the case may be, of the vacancy or prospective vacancy and the reasons for the vacancy, and (ii) has taken and continues to take the actions specified in paragraphs (b) (2) and (3) of this section.
(2) If the Owner evicts an Eligible Family, he shall not be entitled to any payment under paragraph (c)(1) of this section unless the request for such payment is supported by a certification that: (i) He gave such Family a written notice of the proposed eviction, stating
the grounds and advising the Family that it had 10 days within which to present its objections to the Owner in writing or in person and (ii) the proposed eviction was not in violation of the Lease or the Contract or any applicable law.
(d)
Debt-service vacancy payments.
(1) If a unit continues to be vacant after the 60-day period specified in paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, the owner may submit a claim to receive additional housing assistance payments on a semiannual basis with respect to the vacant unit in an amount equal to the principal and interest payments required to amortize the portion of the debt attributable to that unit for the period of the vacancy, whether the vacancy commenced during rent-up or after rent-up.
(2) Additional payments under this paragraph (d) for any unit shall not be for more than 12 months for any vacancy period, and shall be made only if:
(i) The unit was in decent, safe and sanitary condition during the vacancy period for which payments are claimed.
(ii) The Owner has taken and is continuing to take the actions specified in paragraphs (b) (1), (2) and (3) or paragraphs (c)(1) (i) and (ii) and (c)(2) of this section, as appropriate.
(iii) The owner has demonstrated, in connection with the semiannual claim on a form and in accordance wih the standards prescribed by HUD with respect to the period of the vacancy, that the project is not providing the owner with revenues at least equal to the project costs incurred by the owner and that the amount of the payments requested is not in excess of the amount needed to make up the deficiency.
(iv) The owner has submitted to HUD or the PHA, as appropriate, in connection with the semiannual claim, a statement with relevant supporting evidence that there is a reasonable prospect that the project can achieve financial soundness within a reasonable time. The statement shall indicate the causes of the deficiency; the corrective steps that have been and will be taken; and the time by which it is expected that the project revenues will at least equal project costs without the additional payments provided under this paragraph.
(3) HUD or the PHA, as appropriate, may deny any claim for additional payments or suspend or terminate payments if it determines that, based on the owner's statement and other evidence, there is not a reasonable prospect that the project can achieve financial soundness within a reasonable time.
(e)
Prohibition of double compensation for vacancies.
The Owner shall not be entitled to housing assistance payments with respect to vacant units under this section to the extent he is entitled to payments from other sources (for example, payments for losses of rental income incurred for holding units vacant for relocatees pursuant to Title I of the HCD Act or payments under § 884.115).

Term of housing assistance payments contract.
(a) Except in the case of a Contract described in paragraph (b) of this section, the Contract shall be for an initial term of 20 years:
Provided,
That at the end of such Contract term and at the request of RHCDS, HUD may, subject to the availability of contract and budget authority, authorize the execution of a new Contract providing for a total Contract term of an additional 20 years.
(b) In the case of a Contract under which housing assistance payments are made with respect to a project owned by a State or local agency, the total Contract term may be equal to the term of such financing but may not exceed 40 years for any dwelling unit.
(c) If the project is completed in stages, the dates for the initial and the renewal terms shall be separately related to the units in each stage:
Provided, however,
That the total Contract term for the units in all the stages, beginning with the effective date of the Contract with respect to the first
stage, may not exceed the overall maximum term allowable for any one unit, plus two years.

§ 884.108a
Notice upon contract expiration.
(a) The Contract will provide that the owner will notify each assisted family, at least 90 days before the end of the Contract term, of any increase in the amount the family will be required to pay as rent which may occur as a result of its expiration. If the Contract is to be renewed but with a reduction in the number of units covered by it, this notice shall be given to each family who will no longer be assisted under the Contract.
(b) The notice provided for in paragraph (a) of this section shall be accomplished by: (1) Sending a letter by first class mail, properly stamped and addressed, to the family at its address at the project, with a proper return address, and (2) serving a copy of the notice on any adult person answering the door at the leased dwelling unit, or if no adult responds, by placing the notice under or through the door, if possible, or else by affixing the notice to the door. Service shall not be considered to be effective until both required notices have been accomplished. The date on which the notice shall be considered to be received by the family shall be the date on which the owner mails the first class letter provided for in this paragraph, or the date on which the notice provided for in this paragraph is properly given, whichever is later.
(c) The notice shall advise each affected family that, after the expiration date of the Contract, the family will be required to bear the entire cost of the rent and that the owner will be free (to the extent the project is not otherwise regulated by HUD) to alter the rent without HUD approval, but subject to any applicable requirements or restrictions under the lease or under State or local law. The notice shall also state: (1) The actual (if known) or the estimated rent which will be charged following the expiration of the Contract; (2) the difference between the rent and the Total Tenant Payment toward rent under the Contract; and (3) the date the Contract will expire.
(d) The owner shall give HUD a certification that families have been notified in accordance with this section with an example of the text of the notice attached.
(e) This section applies to all Contracts entered into pursuant to an Agreement executed on or after October 1, 1981, or entered into pursuant to an Agreement executed before October 1, 1981, but renewed or amended on or after October 1, 1984.
[49 FR 31284, Aug. 6, 1984]
§ 884.109
Rent adjustments.
(a)
Funding of adjustments.
Housing assistance payments will be made in increased amounts commensurate with Contract Rent adjustments under this paragraph, up to the maximum amount authorized under the Contract. (See §§ 884.104 and 884.105).
(b)
Automatic annual adjustments.
(1) Automatic Annual Adjustment Factors will be determined by HUD at least annually; interim revisions may be made as market conditions warrant. Such Factors and the basis for their determination will be published in the
Federal Register.
These published Factors will be reduced appropriately by HUD where utilities are paid directly by Families.
(2) On each anniversary date of the Contract, the Contract Rents shall be adjusted by applying the applicable Automatic Annual Adjustment Factor most recently published by HUD. Contract Rents may be adjusted upward or downward, as may be appropriate; however, in no case shall the adjusted rents be less than the Contract Rents on the effective date of the Contract.
(c)
Special additional adjustments.
Special additional adjustments shall be granted, when approved by HUD, to reflect increases in the actual and necessary expenses of owning and maintaining the Contract Units which have resulted from substantial general increases in real property taxes, utility
rates, or similar costs (i.e., assessments, and utilities not covered by regulated rates), but only if and to the extent that the Owner clearly demonstrates that such general increases have caused increases in the Owner's operating costs which are not adequately compensated for by automatic annual adjustments. The Owner shall submit to HUD financial statements which clearly support the increase.
(d)
Overall limitation.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this part, adjustments as provided in this section shall not result in material differences between the rents charged for assisted and comparable unassisted units, as determined by HUD:
Provided, however,
That this limitation shall not be construed to prohibit differences in rents between assisted and comparable unassisted units to the extent that such differences may have existed with respect to the initial Contract Rents.
§ 884.110
Types of housing and property standards.
(a) Newly constructed single-family houses and multifamily structures may be utilized in this program. Congregate housing may be developed for elderly, disabled, or handicapped Families and individuals. Except in the case of housing predominantly for the elderly, high-rise elevator projects for Families with children may not be utilized unless HUD determines there is no practical alternative.
(b) Participation in this program requires compliance with:
(1) [Reserved]
(2) In the case of congregate housing, the appropriate HUD guidelines and standards;
(3) HUD requirements pursuant to section 209 of the HCD Act for projects for the elderly, disabled, or handicapped;
(4) HUD requirements pertaining to noise abatement and control; and
(5) Applicable State and local laws, codes, ordinances, and regulations.
(c) Housing assisted under this part shall be modest in design. Amenities in projects assisted under this part (except partially assisted projects) will be limited to those amenities, as determined by HUD, which are generally provided in unassisted, decent, safe and sanitary housing for low-income families, in the market area. The use of more durable, high-quality materials to control or reduce maintenance, repair and replacement costs will not be considered an excess amenity.
(d)
Smoke detectors
—(1)
Performance requirement.
After October 30, 1992, each dwelling unit must include at least one battery-operated or hard-wired smoke detector, in proper working condition, on each level of the unit. If the unit is occupied by hearing-impaired persons, smoke detectors must have an alarm system, designed for hearing-impaired persons, in each bedroom occupied by a hearing-impaired person.
(2)
Acceptability criteria.
The smoke detector must be located, to the extent practicable, in a hallway adjacent to a bedroom, unless the unit is occupied by a hearing-impaired person, in which case each bedroom occupied by a hearing-impaired person must have an alarm system connected to the smoke detector installed in the hallway.

Financing.
(a)
Types.
Eligible projects under this program shall be financed under Section 515, Title V of the Housing Act of 1949.
(b)
Use of contract as security for financing.
(1) An Owner may pledge, or offer as security for any loan or obligation, an Agreement or Contract entered into pursuant to this part:
Provided, however,
That such security is in connection with a project constructed pursuant to this part, and the terms of the financing or any refinancing have been approved by HUD. It is the Owner's responsibility to request such approval in sufficient time before he needs the financing to permit review of the method and terms of the financing and the instrument of pledge, offer or other assignment that HUD is requested to approve.
(2) Any pledge of the Agreement, Contract, or ACC, or payments thereunder, shall be limited to the amounts payable under the Contract or ACC in accordance with its terms.
(3) In the event of foreclosure and in the event of assignment or sale agreed
to by HUD, housing assistance payments shall continue in accordance with the Terms of the Contract.
§ 884.115
Security and utility deposits.
(a) An Owner may require Families to pay a security deposit in an amount equal to one month's Gross Family Contribution. If a Family vacates its unit, the Owner, subject to State and local laws, may utilize the deposit as reimbursement for any unpaid rent or other amount owed under the Lease. If the Family has provided a security deposit, and it is insufficient for such reimbursement, the Owner may claim reimbursement from HUD or the PHA, as appropriate, not to exceed an amount equal to the remainder of one month's Contract Rent. Any reimbursement under this section shall be applied first toward any unpaid rent. If a Family vacates the unit owing no rent or other amount under the Lease or if such amount is less than the amount of the security deposit, the Owner shall refund the full amount or the unused balance, as the case may be, to the Family.
(b) In those jurisdictions where interest is payable by the Owner on security deposits, the refunded amount shall include the amount of interest payable. All security deposit funds shall be deposited by the Owner in a segregated bank account, and the balance of this account, at all times, shall be equal to the total amount collected from tenants then in occupancy, plus any accrued interest. The Owner shall comply with all State and local laws regarding interest payments on security deposits.
(c) Families shall be expected to obtain the funds to pay security and utility deposits, if required, from their own resources and/or other private or public sources.
§ 884.116
Establishment of income limit schedules; 30 percent occupancy by very-low income families.
(a) HUD will establish schedules of Income limits for determining whether families qualify as Low-Income Families and Very Low-Income Families.
(b) In the leasing of units, the Owner shall comply with HUD requirements concerning the permissible income levels of families, as prescribed in part 5 of this title.

(2) Performance of all ordinary and extraordinary maintenance;
(3) Performance of all management functions, including the taking of applications; determining eligibility of applicants in accordance with part 5 of this title; selection of families, including verification of income, provision of Federal selection preferences in accordance with 24 CFR part 5, obtaining and verifying Social Security Numbers submitted by applicants (as provided by 24 CFR part 5), obtaining signed consent forms from applicants for the obtaining of wage and claim information from State Wage Information Collection Agencies (as provided in 24 CFR part 5), and other pertinent requirements; and determination of the amount of tenant rent in accordance with HUD established schedules and criteria;
(4) Collection of Tenant Rents;
(5) Termination of tenancies, including evictions;
(6) Preparation and furnishing of information required under the Contract;
(7) Reexamination of family income and composition; redetermination, as appropriate, of the amount of Tenant Rent and the amount of housing assistance payment in accordance with part 5 of this title; obtaining and verifying Social Security Numbers submitted by participants, as provided by 24 CFR part 5; and obtaining signed consent forms from participants for the obtaining of wage and claim information from State Wage Information Collection Agencies, as provided by 24 CFR part 5;
(8) Redetermination of amount of Tenant Rent and amount of housing assistance payment in accordance with part 5 of this title as a result of an adjustment by the PHA or HUD, as appropriate, of any applicable Utility Allowance; and
(9) Compliance with equal opportunity requirements issued by RHCDS and HUD with respect to project operation.
(b) Subject to HUD approval, any Owner may contract with any private or public entity to perform for a fee the services required by paragraph (a) of this section:
Provided,
That such contract shall not relieve the Owner of his responsibilities or obligations. However, no entity which is responsible for administration of the Contract (for example, a PHA in the case of a Private-Owner/PHA Project) may contract to perform management and maintenance of the project:
Provided, however,
That this prohibition shall not preclude management by the PHA in the event it takes possession as the result of foreclosure or assignment in lieu of foreclosure. (See, however, § 884.123(b), which permits conversion of a Private-Owner/PHA Project to a Private-Owner Project.)

(2) The ACC shall contain a provision to the effect that if the PHA fails to comply with any of its obligations (including specifically failure to enforce its rights under the Contract, in the event of any default by the Owner, to achieve compliance to the satisfaction of HUD or to terminate the Contract in whole or in part, as directed by HUD),
HUD may, after notice to the PHA giving it a reasonable opportunity to take corrective action, determine that there is a substantial default and require the PHA to assign to HUD all of the PHA's rights and interests under the Contract. In such case, HUD will continue to pay annual contributions in accordance with the terms of the ACC and the Contract.
(3) The Contract shall contain a provision to the effect (i) that if the PHA determines that the Owner is in default under the Contract, the PHA shall notify the Owner, with a copy to HUD and RHCDS, of the actions required to be taken to cure the default and of the remedies to be applied by the PHA including abatement of housing assistance payments and recovery of overpayments, where appropriate; and (ii) that if he fails to cure the default, the PHA has the right to terminate the Contract or to take other corrective action, in its discretion or as directed by HUD.

(d)
Acceptance where defects or deficiencies reported.
If the only defects or deficiencies are punchlist items or incomplete items awaiting seasonal opportunity, the project may be accepted and the Contract executed. If the Owner fails to complete the items within a reasonable time to the satisfaction of HUD (and the PHA, if applicable), HUD may, after consultation with FmHA, upon 30 days notice to the Owner (and the PHA, if applicable), terminate the Contract and/or exercise its other rights thereunder or, if the Contract is with a PHA, cancel its approval of the Contract and require its termination and/or exercise its other rights under the Contract and the ACC.
(e)

Upon acceptance of the project by HUD pursuant to § 884.212, the Contract shall be executed first by the Owner and then by HUD, or, in the case of a Private-Owner/PHA Project, executed by the Owner and the PHA and then approved by HUD.
(b)
Unleased units.
At the time of execution of the Contract, HUD (or the PHA, as appropriate) shall examine the lists of dwelling units leased and not leased, referred to in § 884.211(e) and shall determine whether or not the Owner has met his obligations under that section with respect to any unleased units. HUD (or the PHA, as appropriate) shall state in writing its determination with respect to the unleased units and for which of those units it will make housing assistance payments. The Owner shall indicate in writing his concurrence with this determination or his disagreement, reserving his rights to claim housing assistance payments for the unleased units pursuant to the Contract, without prejudice by reason of his signing the Contract. Copies of all documents referred to this paragraph shall be furnished to HUD in the case of a Private-Owner/PHA Project.
§ 884.214
Marketing.
(a)
Compliance with equal opportunity requirements.
Marketing of units and selection of Families by the Owner shall be in accordance with the Owner's FmHA-approved Affirmative Fair Housing Marketing Plan, if required, and with all regulations relating to fair housing advertising including use of
the equal opportunity logotype statement and slogan in all advertising. Projects shall be managed and operated without regard to race, color, creed, religion, sex, or national origin.
(b)
Eligibility, selection and admission of families.
(1) The owner is responsible for determination of eligibility of applicants in accordance with the procedure of 24 CFR part part 5, selection of families from among those determined to be eligible (including provision of Federal selection preferences in accordance with 24 CFR part 5), and computation of the amount of housing assistance payments on behalf of each selected family, in accordance with schedules and criteria established by HUD.
(2) For every family that applies for admission, the owner and the applicant will complete and sign the form of application prescribed by HUD. However, if there are no vacant units and the owner's waiting list is such that there would be an unreasonable length of time before the applicant could be admitted, the owner may advise the applicant that the owner is not accepting applications for that reason.
The owner must retain copies of all completed applications together with any related correspondence for three years. For each family selected for admission, the owner must submit one copy of the completed and signed application to the HUD field office (in the case of private-owner/PHA projects, the owner simultaneously must send a copy of the form to the PHA). Housing assistance payments will not be made on behalf of an admitted family unit after this copy has been received by the HUD field office (or, in the case of private-owner/PHA projects, until the copy has been received by the PHA with a certification by the owner that the owner has sent a copy to HUD).
(3) If the Owner determines that the applicant is eligible on the basis of Income and family composition and is otherwise acceptable but the Owner does not have a suitable unit to offer, the Owner shall place such Family on his waiting list and so advise the Family.
(4) If the Owner determines that the applicant is eligible on the basis of Income and family composition and is otherwise acceptable and if the Owner has a suitable unit, the Owner and the Family shall enter into a Lease. Such Lease shall be on the form of Lease included in the Owner's approved Final Proposal and shall otherwise be in conformity with the provisions of this part.
(5) Records on applicant families and approved Families shall be maintained by the Owner so as to provide HUD with racial, ethnic and gender data and shall be retained by the Owner for three years.
(6) In the case of a PHA-Owner project, (i) if the PHA places a Family on its waiting list, it shall notify the Family of the approximate date of availability of a suitable unit insofar as such date can be reasonably determined, and (ii) if the PHA determines that an applicant is ineligible on the basis of income or family composition, or that the PHA is not selecting the applicant for other reasons, the PHA shall promptly send the applicant a letter notifying him of the determination and the reasons and that the applicant has the right within a reasonable time (specified in the letter) to request an informal hearing. If, after conducting such an informal hearing, the PHA determines that the applicant shall not be admitted, the PHA shall so notify the applicant in writing and such notice shall inform the applicant that he has the right to request a review by HUD of the PHA's determination. The procedures of this subparagraph do not preclude the applicant from exercising his other rights if he believes he is being discriminated against on the basis of race, color, creed, religion, sex, or national origin. The PHA shall retain for three years a copy of the application, the letter, the applicant's response if any, the record of any informal hearing, and a statement of final disposition.
(7) See 24 CFR part 5 for the informal review provisions for the denial of a Federal selection preference.
(8) For the informal hearing provisions related to denial of assistance based upon failure to establish citizenship or eligible immigration status, see part 5 of this title for provisions concerning certain assistance for mixed
families (families whose members include those with eligible immigration status, and those without eligible immigration status) in lieu of denial of assistance.

§ 884.216
Termination of tenancy.
(a) The owner is responsible for termination of tenancies, including evictions. However, conditions for payment of housing assistance payments for any resulting vacancies must be as set forth in § 884.106(c)(1). Failure of the family to sign and submit consent forms for the obtaining of wage and claim information from State Wage Information Collection Agencies, as provided by 24 CFR part 5, shall be grounds for termination of tenancy. For provisions requiring termination of assistance for failure to establish citizenship or eligible immigration status, including the applicable informal requirements, see 24 CFR part 5 and also for provisions concerning assistance for mixed families (families whose members include those with eligible immigration status, and those without eligible immigration status) in lieu of termination of assistance, and for provisions concerning deferral of termination of assistance.
(b) Termination of tenancy for criminal activity by a covered person is subject to 24 CFR 5.858 and 5.859, and termination of tenancy for alcohol abuse by a covered person is subject to 24 CFR 5.860.
(c) In actions or potential actions to terminate tenancy, the owner shall follow 24 CFR part 5, subpart L (Protection for Victims of Domestic Violence, Dating Violence, Sexual Assault, or Stalking).
(d) In the case of failure to pay rent, the owner must provide the tenant with a termination notice at least 30 days before a formal judicial eviction is filed. All termination notices in cases of failure to pay rent must include the following:
(1) Instructions on how the tenant can cure the nonpayment of rent, including an itemized amount separated by month of alleged rent owed by the tenant, any other arrearages allowed by HUD and included in the lease separated by month, and the date by which the tenant must pay the amount of rent owed before an eviction for nonpayment of rent can be filed;

§ 884.217
Maintenance, operation, and inspections.
(a)
Maintenance and operation.
The Owner shall maintain and operate the project consistent with 24 CFR part 5, subpart G, and shall provide all the services, maintenance, and utilities which the Owner agrees to provide under the Contract, subject to abatement of housing assistance payments or other applicable remedies if the Owner fails to meet these obligations.
(b)
Inspection prior to occupancy.
Prior to occupancy of any unit by a Family, the Owner and the Family shall inspect the unit. On forms prescribed by HUD, the Owner and Family shall certify, that they have inspected the unit and the owner shall certify that the unit is compliant with 24 CFR part 5, subpart G, and the criteria provided in the prescribed forms. Copies of these reports
shall be kept on file by the Owner for at least 3 years, and may be required to be electronically submitted to HUD.
(c)
Periodic inspections.
HUD (or the PHA, as appropriate) will inspect or cause to be inspected the contract units and related facilities in accordance with the physical inspection requirements in 24 CFR part 5, subpart G, and at such other times (including prior to initial occupancy and renting of any unit) as HUD (or the PHA) may determine to be necessary to assure that the Owner is meeting the obligation to maintain the units in accordance with 24 CFR part 5, subpart G, and to provide the agreed upon utilities and other services.
(d)
Units with health and safety hazards.
If HUD (or the PHA, as appropriate) notifies the Owner that the Owner has failed to maintain a unit that in accordance with 24 CFR part 5, subpart G, and the Owner fails to take corrective action within the time prescribed by notice, HUD (or the PHA) may exercise any of its rights or remedies under the Contract, including abatement of housing assistance payments, even if the Family continues to occupy the unit. If, however, the Family wishes to be rehoused in another unit with Section 8 assistance and HUD (or the PHA) does not have other Section 8 funds for such purposes, HUD (or the PHA) may use the abated housing assistance payments for the purpose of rehousing the Family in another unit. Where this is done, the Owner shall be notified that the Owner will be entitled to resumption of housing assistance payments for the vacated unit if:
(1) The unit is restored to in accordance with 24 CFR part 5, subpart G;
(2) The Family is willing to and does move back to the restored dwelling unit; and
(3) A deduction is made for the expenses incurred by the Family for both moves.
[88 FR 30499, May 11, 2023]
§ 884.218
Reexamination of family income and composition.
(a)
Regular reexaminations.
The owner must reexamine the income and composition of all families at least once each year. Upon verification of the information, the owner must make appropriate adjustments in the Total Tenant Payment in accordance with part 5 of this title and determine whether the family's unit size is still appropriate. The owner must adjust Tenant Rent and the Housing Assistance Payment to reflect any change in Total Tenant Payment and carry out any unit transfer required by HUD. At the time of the annual reexamination of family income and composition, the owner must require the family to disclose and verify Social Security Numbers, as provided by 24 CFR part 5. For requirements regarding the signing and submitting of consent forms by families for the obtaining of wage and claim information from State Wage Information Collection Agencies, see 24 CFR part 5. At the first regular reexamination after June 19, 1995, the owner shall follow the requirements of 24 CFR part 5 concerning obtaining and processing evidence of citizenship or eligible immigration status of all family members. Thereafter, at each regular reexamination, the owner shall follow the requirements of 24 CFR part 5 concerning verification of the immigration status of any new family member.
(b)
Interim reexaminations.
The family must comply with provisions of its lease regarding interim reporting of changes in income. If the owner receives information concerning a change in the family's income or other circumstances between regularly scheduled reexaminations, the owner must consult with the family and make any adjustments determined to be appropriate. Any change in the family's income or other circumstances that results in an adjustment in the Total Tenant Payment, Tenant Rent and Housing Assistance Payment must be verified. See 24 CFR 750.10(d)(2)(i) for the requirements for the disclosure and verification of Social Security Numbers at interim reexaminations involving new family members. For requirements regarding the signing and submitting of consent forms by families for the obtaining of wage and claim information from State Wage Information Collection Agencies, see 24 CFR part 5. At any interim reexamination after June 19, 1995 when there is a new family member, the owner shall follow
the requirements of 24 CFR part 5 concerning obtaining and processing evidence of citizenship or eligible immigration status of the new family member.
(c)
Continuation of housing assistance payments.
A family's eligibility for Housing Assistance Payments continues until the Total Tenant Payment equals the Contract Rent plus any utility allowance, or until the family loses eligibility for continued occupancy under Farmer's Home Administration regulations. However, eligibility also may be terminated in accordance with HUD requirements, for such reasons as failure to submit requested verification information, including failure to meet the disclosure and verification requirements for Social Security Numbers, as provided by 24 CFR part 5, or failure to sign and submit consent forms for the obtaining of wage and claim information from State Wage Information Collection Agencies, as provided by 24 CFR part 5. For provisions requiring termination of assistance for failure to establish citizenship or eligible immigration status, see 24 CFR part 5 and also for provisions concerning certain assistance for mixed families (families whose members include those with eligible immigration status, and those without eligible immigration status) in lieu of termination ofassistance, and for provisions concerning deferral of termination of assistance.
(d)
Streamlined income determination.
An owner may elect to follow the provisions of 24 CFR 5.657(d).
[56 FR 7541, Feb. 22, 1991, as amended at 60 FR 14845, Mar. 20, 1995; 61 FR 13594, Mar. 27, 1996; 65 FR 16723, Mar. 29, 2000; 81 FR 12371, Mar. 8, 2016]
§ 884.219
Overcrowded and underoccupied units.
If HUD or the PHA, as the case may be, determines that a Contract unit assisted under this part is not Decent, Safe, and Sanitary by reason of increase in Family size, or that a Contract unit is larger than appropriate for the size of the Family in occupancy, housing assistance payments with respect to such unit will not be abated, unless the Owner fails to offer the Family a suitable unit as soon as one becomes vacant and ready for occupancy. In the case of an overcrowded unit, if the Owner does not have any suitable units or if no vacancy of a suitable unit occurs within a reasonable time, HUD (or the PHA) will assist the Family in finding a suitable dwelling unit and require the Family to move to such a unit as soon as possible. The Owner may receive housing assistance payments for the vacated unit if he complies with the requirements of § 884.106(c)(1).
§ 884.220
Adjustment of utility allowances.
In connection with annual and special adjustments of contract rents, the owner must submit an analysis of the project's Utility Allowances. Such data as changes in utility rates and other facts affecting utility consumption should be provided as part of this analysis to permit appropriate adjustments in the Utility Allowances. In addition, when approval of a utility rate change would result in a cumulative increase of 10 percent or more in the most recently approved Utility Allowances, the project owner must advise the Secretary and request approval of new Utility Allowances. Whenever a Utility Allowance for a unit is adjusted, the owner will promptly notify affected families and make a corresponding adjustment of the tenant rent and the amount of the housing assistance payment for the unit.
(Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 2502-0161)
[50 FR 39098, Sept. 27, 1985]
§ 884.221
Continued family participation.
A Family must continue to occupy its approved unit to remain eligible for participation in the Housing Assistance Payments Program except that if the Family (a) wishes to vacate its unit at the end of the Lease term (or prior thereto but in accordance with the provisions of the Lease), or (b) is required to move for reasons other than violation of the Lease on the part of the Family, and if the Family wishes to receive the benefit of housing assistance payments in another approvable unit, the Family should give reasonable notice of the circumstances to HUD or to the PHA, as appropriate, so that HUD
or the PHA may have the opportunity to consider the Family's request.
§ 884.222
Inapplicability of low-rent public housing model lease and grievance procedures.
Model lease and grievance procedures established by HUD for PHA-owned low-rent public housing are applicable only to PHA-Owner Projects under the Section 8 Housing Assistance Payments Program.
§ 884.223
Leasing to eligible families.
(a)
Availability of units for occupancy by Eligible Families.
During the term of the Contract, an owner shall make available for occupancy by eligible families the total number of units for which assistance is committed under the Contract. For purposes of this section, making units available for occupancy by eligible families means that the owner: (1) Is conducting marketing in accordance with § 884.214; (2) has leased or is making good faith efforts to lease the units to eligible and otherwise acceptable families, including taking all feasible actions to fill vacancies by renting to such families; and (3) has not rejected any such applicant family except for reasons acceptable to HUD (or the PHA in accordance with HUD guidelines and at the direction of HUD, as appropriate). If the owner is temporarily unable to lease all units for which assistance is committed under the Contract to eligible families, one or more units may be leased to ineligible families with the prior approval of HUD (or the PHA in accordance with HUD guidelines and at the direction of HUD, as appropriate). Failure on the part of the owner to comply with these requirements is a violation of the Contract and grounds for all available legal remedies, including specific performance of the Contract, suspension or debarment from HUD programs, and reduction of the number of units under the Contract as set forth in paragraph (b) of this section.
(b)
Reduction of number of units covered by Contract.
HUD (or the PHA at the direction of HUD, as appropriate), after consultation with the Farmers Home Administration, may reduce the number of units covered by the Contract to the number of units available for occupancy by eligible families if:
(1) The owner fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section; or
(2) Notwithstanding any prior approval by HUD (or the PHA at the direction of HUD, as appropriate) to lease such units to ineligible families, HUD (or the PHA at the direction of HUD, as appropriate) determines that the inability to lease units to eligible families is not a temporary problem.
(c)
Restoration.
HUD will agree to an amendment of the ACC or the Contract, as appropriate, to provide for subsequent restoration of any reduction made pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section if:
(1) HUD determines that the restoration is justified by demand;
(2) The owner otherwise has a record of compliance with his or her obligations under the Contract; and
(3) Contract and budget authority are available.
(d)
Applicability.
In accordance with section 555 of the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act of 1990, paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section apply to all contracts. An owner who had leased an assisted unit to an ineligible family consistent with the regulations in effect at the time will continue to lease the unit to that family. However, the owner must make the unit available for occupancy by an eligible family when the ineligible family vacates the unit.
(e)
Termination of assistance for failure to establish citizenship or eligible immigration status.
If an owner subject to paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section is required to terminate housing assistance payments for the family in accordance with 24 CFR part 5 because the owner determines that the entire family does not have U.S. citizenship or eligible immigration status, the owner may allow continued occupancy of the unit by the family without Section 8 assistance following the termination of assistance, or if the family constitutes a mixed family, as defined in 24 CFR part 5, the owner shall comply with the provisions of 24 CFR part 5 concerning assistance to mixed families, and deferral of termination of assistance.
(f) The regulations in 24 CFR part 5, subpart L (Protection for Victims of Domestic Violence, Dating Violence, Sexual Assault, or Stalking) apply to this section.

§ 884.223a
Preference for occupancy by elderly families.
(a)
Election of preference for occupancy by elderly families
—(1)
Election by owners of eligible projects.
(i) An owner of a project assisted under this part (including a partially assisted project) that was originally designed primarily for occupancy by elderly families (an “eligible project”) may, at any time, elect to give preference to elderly families in selecting tenants for assisted, vacant units in the project, subject to the requirements of this section.
(ii) For purposes of this section, a project eligible for the preference provided by this section, and for which the owner makes an election to give preference in occupancy to elderly families is referred to as an “elderly project.” “Elderly families” refers to families whose heads of household, their spouses or sole members are 62 years or older.
(iii) An owner who elects to provide a preference to elderly families in accordance with this section is required to notify families on the waiting list who are not elderly that the election has been made and how the election may affect them if:
(A) The percentage of disabled families currently residing in the project who are neither elderly nor near-elderly (hereafter, collectively referred to as “non-elderly disabled families”) is equal to or exceeds the minimum required percentage of units established for the elderly project in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section, and therefore non-elderly families on the waiting list (including non-elderly disabled families) may be passed over for covered section 8 units; or
(B) The project, after making the calculation set forth in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, will have no units set aside for non-elderly disabled families.
(iv) An owner who elects to give a preference for elderly families in accordance with this section shall not remove an applicant from the project's waiting list solely on the basis of having made the election.
(2)
HUD approval of election not required.
(i) An owner is not required to solicit or obtain the approval of HUD before exercising the election of preference for occupancy provided in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. The owner, however, if challenged on the issue of eligibility of the project for the election provided in paragraph (a)(1) of this section must be able to support the project's eligibility through the production of all relevant documentation in the possession of the owner that pertains to the original design of the project.
(ii) The Department reserves the right at any time to review and make determinations regarding the accuracy of the identification of the project as an elderly project. The Department can make such determinations as a result of ongoing monitoring activities, or the conduct of complaint investigations under the Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 3601 through 3619), or compliance reviews and complaint investigations under section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794) and other applicable statutes.
(b)
Determining projects eligible for preference for occupancy by elderly families
—(1)
Evidence supporting project eligibility.
Evidence that a project assisted under this part (or portion of a project) was originally designed primarily for occupancy by elderly families, and is therefore eligible for the election of occupancy preference provided by this section, shall consist of at least one item from the sources (“primary” sources) listed in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, or at least two items from the sources (“secondary” sources) listed in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section:
(i)
Primary sources.
Identification of the project (or portion of a project) as serving elderly (seniors) families in at least one primary source such as: the application in response to the notice of funding availability; the terms of the
notice of funding availability under which the application was solicited; the regulatory agreement; the loan commitment; the bid invitation; the owner's management plan, or any underwriting or financial document collected at or before loan closing;
or
(ii)
Secondary sources.
Two or more sources of evidence such as: lease records from the earliest two years of occupancy for which records are available showing that occupancy has been restricted primarily to households where the head, spouse or sole member is 62 years of age or older; evidence that services for elderly persons have been provided, such as services funded by the Older Americans Act, transportation to senior citizen centers, or programs coordinated with the Area Agency on Aging; project unit mix with more than fifty percent of efficiency and one-bedroom units [a secondary source particularly relevant to distinguishing elderly projects under the previous section 3(b) definition (in which disabled families were included in the definition of “elderly families”) from non-elderly projects and which in combination with other factors (such as the number of accessible units) may be useful in distinguishing projects for seniors from those serving the broader definition of “elderly families” which includes disabled families]; or any other relevant type of historical data, unless clearly contradicted by other comparable evidence.
(2)
Sources in conflict.
If a primary source establishes a design contrary to that established by the primary source upon which the owner would base support that the project is an eligible project (as defined in this section), the owner cannot make the election of preferences for elderly families as provided by this section based upon primary sources alone. In any case where primary sources do not provide
clear evidence
of original design of the project for occupancy primarily by elderly families, including those cases where sources documents conflict, secondary sources may be used to establish the use for which the project was originally designed.
(c)
Reservation of units in elderly projects for non-elderly disabled families.
The owner of an elderly project is required to reserve, at a minimum, the number of units specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section for occupancy by non-elderly disabled families.
(1)
Minimum number of units to be reserved for non-elderly disabled families.
The number of units in an elderly project required to be reserved for occupancy by non-elderly disabled families, shall be, at a minimum, the lesser of:
(i) The number of units equivalent to the higher of—
(A) The percentage of units assisted under this part in the elderly project that were occupied by non-elderly disabled families on October 28, 1992; and
(B) The percentage of units assisted under this part in the elderly project that were occupied by non-elderly disabled families upon January 1, 1992;
or
(ii) 10 percent of the number of units assisted under this part in the eligible project.
(2)
Option to reserve greater number of units for non-elderly disabled families.
The owner, at the owner's option, and at any time, may reserve a greater number of units for non-elderly disabled families than that provided for in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. The option to provide a greater number of units to non-elderly disabled families will not obligate the owner to always provide that greater number to non-elderly disabled families. The number of units required to be provided to non-elderly disabled families at any time in an elderly project is that number determined under paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
(d)
Secondary preferences.
An owner of an elderly project also may elect to establish secondary preferences in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph (d) of this section.
(1)
Preference for near-elderly disabled families in units reserved for elderly families.
If the owner of an elderly project determines, in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section, that there are an insufficient number of elderly families who have applied for occupancy to fill all the vacant units in the elderly project reserved for elderly families (that is, all units except those reserved for the non-elderly disabled families as provided in paragraph (c) of this section), the owner may give preference
for occupancy of such units to disabled families who are near-elderly families.
(2)
Preference for near-elderly disabled families in units reserved for non-elderly disabled families.
If the owner of an elderly project determines, in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section, that there are an insufficient number of non-elderly disabled families to fill all the vacant units in the elderly project reserved for non-elderly disabled families as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, the owner may give preference for occupancy of these units to disabled families who are near-elderly families.
(e)
Availability of units to families without regard to preference.
An owner shall make vacant units in an elderly project generally available to otherwise eligible families who apply for housing, without regard to the preferences and reservation of units provided in this section if either:
(1) The owner has adopted the secondary preferences and there are an insufficient number of families for whom elderly preference, reserve preference, and secondary preference has been given, to fill all the vacant units; or
(2) The owner has
not
adopted the secondary preferences and there are an insufficient number of families for whom elderly preference, and reserve preference has been given to fill all the vacant units.
(f)
Determination of insufficient number of applicants qualifying for preference.
To make a determination that there are an insufficient number of applicants who qualify for the preferences, including secondary preferences, provided by this section, the owner must:
(1) Conduct marketing in accordance with § 884.214(a) to attract applicants qualifying for the preferences and reservation of units set forth in this section; and
(2) Make a good faith effort to lease to applicants who qualify for the preferences provided in this section, including taking all feasible actions to fill vacancies by renting to such families.
(g)
Prohibition of evictions.
An owner may not evict a tenant without good cause, or require that a tenant vacate a unit, in whole or in part because of any reservation or preference provided in this section, or because of any action taken by the Secretary pursuant to subtitle D (sections 651 through 661) of title VI of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 (42 U.S.C. 13611 through 13620).

§ 884.224
Management and occupancy reviews.
(a) The contract administrator will conduct management and occupancy reviews to determine whether the owner is in compliance with the Contract. Such reviews will be conducted in accordance with a schedule set out by the Secretary and published in the
Federal Register
,
following notice and the opportunity to comment. Where a change in ownership or management occurs, a management and occupancy review must be conducted within six months.
(b) HUD or the Contract Administrator may inspect project operations and units at any time.
(c) Equal Opportunity reviews may be conducted by HUD at any time.

(b) In order to facilitate emergency transfers for victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking, covered housing providers have discretion to adopt new, and modify any existing, admission preferences or transfer waitlist priorities.
(c) In addition to following requirements in 24 CFR 5.2005(e), when a safe unit is not immediately available for a victim of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking who qualifies for an emergency transfer, covered housing providers must:
(1) Review the covered housing provider's existing inventory of units and
determine when the next vacant unit may be available; and
(2) Provide a listing of nearby HUD subsidized rental properties, with or without preference for persons of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking, and contact information for the local HUD field office.
(d) Each year, covered housing providers must submit to HUD data on all emergency transfers requested under 24 CFR 5.2005(e), including data on the outcomes of such requests.

§ 886.101
Applicability.
(a) The policies and procedures of this subpart apply to Housing Assistance Payments under Section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 on behalf of Eligible Families in Eligible Projects (see definitions in § 886.102).
(b) The primary goal of the Section 8 Loan Management Set-Aside Program is to reduce claims on the Department's insurance fund by aiding those FHA-insured or Secretary-Held projects with immediately or potentially serious financial difficulties. A first priority should be given to projects with presently serious financial problems, which are likely to result in a claim on the insurance fund in the near future. To the extent resources remain available, assistance also may be provided to projects with potentially serious financial problems which, on the basis of financial and/or management analysis, appear to have a high probability of producing a claim on the insurance fund within approximately the next five years.

§ 886.106
Notices.
(a) Within 10 days of receipt of each completed application by the HUD field office, the field office shall send to the chief executive officer of the unit of general local government in which the proposed assistance is to be provided, a notification in a form prescribed by
HUD for purposes of compliance with Section 213 of the HCD Act.
(b) If an application is approved, HUD shall send to the Owner a notice of application approval. If an application can be approved only on certain conditions, HUD shall notify the Owner of the conditions and specify a time limit by which those conditions must be met. If an application is disapproved, HUD shall so notify the Owner by letter indicating the reasons for disapproval.
[42 FR 5603, Jan. 28, 1977, as amended at 53 FR 3368, Feb. 5, 1988]
§ 886.107
Approval of applications.
HUD shall approve applications, after considering all pertinent information including comments (if any) received during the comment period from the unit of general local government, based on the following criteria:
(a) The Owner's Affirmative Fair Housing Marketing Plan is approvable.
(b) The HUD-approved unit rents are approvable within the Fair Market Rent limitations contained in § 886.110.
(c) The residential units meet the housing quality standards set forth in § 886.113, except for such variations as HUD may approve. Local climatic or geological conditions or local codes are examples which may justify such variations.
(d) A significant number of residents, or potential residents, in the case of projects having a vacancy rate over 10 percent, are eligible for and in need of Section 8 assistance.
(e) The infusion of Section 8 assistance into the subject project should not affect other HUD-related multifamily housing within the same neighborhood in a substantially adverse manner. Examples of such adverse effects are (1) substantial move-outs from nearby HUD-related projects precipitated by much lower rents in the subject project, or (2) substantial diversion of prospective applicants from such projects to the subject project.
(f) A first priority is given to HUD-Insured or Secretary-Held projects with presently serious financial problems, which are likely to result in a claim on the insurance fund in the near future. To the extent resources remain available, assistance also may be provided to projects with potentially serious financial problems which, on the basis of financial and/or management analysis, appear to have a high probability of producing a claim on the insurance funds within approximately the next five years.
(g) The infusion of Section 8 assistance into the subject project solves an identifiable problem, e.g., high vacancies and/or turnover, and provides a reasonable assurance of long-term project viability. A determination of long-term viability shall be based upon the following considerations:
(1) The project is not subject to any serious problems that are non-economic in nature. Examples of such problems are poor location, structural deficiencies or disinterested ownership.
(2) The Owner is in substantial compliance with the Regulatory Agreement. Owners are not diverting project funds for personal use. No dividends are being paid during any period of financial difficulty.
(3) The management agent is in substantial compliance with the management agreement. The current management agreement has been approved by HUD. Financial records are adequately kept. Occupancy requirements are being met. Marketing and maintenance programs are being carried out in an adequate manner, based upon available financial resources.
(4) The project's problems are primarily the result of factors beyond the control of the present ownership and management.
(5) The major problems are traceable to an inadequate cash flow.
(6) The infusion of Section 8 assistance will solve the cash flow problem by:
(i) Making it possible to grant needed rent increases;
(ii) Reducing turnover, vacancies and collection losses.
(7) The Owner's plan for remedying any deferred maintenance, financial problems, or other problems is realistic and achievable. There is positive evidence that the Owner will carry out the plan. Examples of such evidence are the Owner's past performance in correcting problems and, in the case of
profit-motivated Owners, any cash contributions made to correct project problems.
(h) Any plan submitted pursuant to § 886.105(d) is found by HUD to be adequate.
§ 886.108
Maximum annual contract commitment.
(a)
Number of units assisted.
Based on analysis of housing assistance needs of families residing or expected to reside in the project, HUD shall determine the number of units to be assisted up to 100 percent of the units in the project. All units currently assisted under section 23 or section 8 shall be converted and included under the Contract pursuant to this subpart, unless the parties to the Lease or Contract object to such conversion. Units assisted under section 101 of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1965 or under section 236(f)(2) of the National Housing Act shall not be included under the Contract pursuant to this subpart unless the Owner proposes and HUD approves such conversion.
(b)
Maximum annual Contract commitment.
The maximum annual housing assistance payments that may be committed under the Contract shall be that amount which, when paid annually over the term of the Contract, is determined by HUD to be sufficient to provide for all housing assistance payments and fees under the Contract.
(c)
Project Account.
In order to assure that housing assistance payments will be increased on a timely basis to cover increases in Contract Rents or decreases in Family Incomes:
(1) A Project Account shall be established and maintained, in an amount as determined by the Secretary consistent with his responsibilities under section 8(c)(6) of the Act, out of amounts by which the maximum annual Contract commitment per year exceeds amounts paid under the Contract for any year. This account shall be established and maintained by HUD for each project as a specifically identified and segregated account, and payment shall be made therefrom only for the purposes of (i) housing assistance payments, and (ii) other costs specifically authorized or approved by the Secretary.
(2) Whenever a HUD-approved estimate of required housing assistance payments for a fiscal year exceeds the maximum annual Contract commitment, and would cause the amount in the Project Account to be less than an amount equal to 40 percent of such maximum annual Contract commitment, HUD shall, within a reasonable period of time, take such additional steps authorized by Section 8(c)(6) of the Act as may be necessary to carry out this assurance, including (as provided in that section of the Act) “the allocation of a portion of new authorizations for the purpose of amending housing assistance contracts.”
§ 886.109
Housing assistance payments to owners.
(a)
General.
Housing Assistance Payments shall be paid to Owners for units under lease by eligible families, in accordance with the Contract and as provided in this section. These Housing Assistance Payments will cover the difference between the Contract Rent and the Tenant Rent. Where applicable, the Utility Reimbursement will be paid to the Family as an additional Housing Assistance Payment. The Contract will provide that the Owner will make this payment on behalf of HUD. Funds will be paid to the Owner in trust solely for the purpose of making this additional payment. If the Family and the utility company consent, the Owner may pay the Utility Reimbursement jointly to the Family and the utility company or directly to the utility company.
(b) No Section 8 assistance may be provided for any unit occupied by an Owner; cooperatives are considered rental housing.
(c) If an Eligible Family vacates its unit (other than as a result of action by the Owner which is in violation of the Lease or the Contract or any applicable law), the Owner shall receive housing assistance payments in the amount of 80 percent of the Contract Rent for a vacancy period not exceeding 60 days:
Provided, however,
That if the Owner collects any of the Family's share of the rent for this period, or applies security deposits for unpaid rent, in amounts which when added to the 80 percent payments, results in more than the Contract Rent, such excess shall be
payable to HUD or as HUD may direct. (See also § 886.116.) The Owner shall not be entitled to any payment under this paragraph unless he:
(1) Immediately upon learning of the vacancy, has notified HUD of the vacancy or prospective vacancy and the reasons for the vacancy, and
(2) Has taken and continues to take all feasible actions to fill the vacancy including, but not limited to, contacting applicants on his waiting list (if any), and advising them of the availability of the unit, and
(3) Has not rejected any eligible applicant except for good cause.
[42 FR 5603, Jan. 28, 1977, as amended at 49 FR 19948, May 10, 1984]
§ 886.110
Contract rents.
(a) The sum of the Contract Rents plus an Allowance for Utilities and Other Services shall not exceed the published Section 8 Fair Market Rents for Existing Housing, except that they may be exceeded by:
(1) Up to 10 percent if the Field Office Director determines that special circumstances warrant such higher rents, or
(2) By up to 20 percent where the Regional Administrator determines that special circumstances warrant such higher rents, and in either case, such higher rents meet the test of reasonableness in paragraph (c) of this section.
(b) In the case of any project completed not more than six years prior to the application for assistance under that part, or in the case of units converted to Section 8 which were previously assisted under Section 101 of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1965 or Section 236(f)(2) of the National Housing Act, contract rents plus any allowance for utilities and other services may be as high as 75 percent of the published Section 8 Fair Market Rents for New Construction, which limitation may be increased: (1) By up to 10 percent if the Field Office Director determines that special circumstances warrant such higher rents, or (2) by up to 20 percent where the Regional Administrator determines that special circumstances warrant such higher rents, and in either case, such higher rents meet the test of reasonableness contained in paragraph (c) of this section. The project shall be converted using the current HUD approved rent level established pursuant to 24 CFR 207.19(e)(2)(i).
(c) In any case, HUD shall determine and so certify that the Contract Rents for the project do not exceed rents which are reasonable for the location, quality, amenities, facilities, and management and maintenance services in relation to the rents paid for comparable units in the private unassisted market, nor shall the Contract Rents exceed the rents charged by the Owner to unassisted Families for comparable units. HUD shall maintain for three years all certifications and relevant documentation under this paragraph (c).
[42 FR 5603, Jan. 28, 1977, as amended at 48 FR 36103, Aug. 9, 1983; 48 FR 56949, Dec. 27, 1983]
§ 886.111
Term of contract.
A Contract may be for an initial term of not more than 5 years, renewable for successive 5 year terms by agreement between HUD and the Owner:
Provided,
That the total Contract term, including renewals, shall not exceed 15 years.
§ 886.111a
Notice upon contract expiration.
(a) The Contract will provide that the owner will notify each assisted family, at least 90 days before the end of the Contract term, of any increase in the amount the family will be required to pay as rent which may occur as a result of its expiration. If the Contract is to be renewed but with a reduction in the number of units covered by it, this notice shall be given to each family who will not longer be assisted under the Contract.
(b) The notice provided for in paragraph (a) of this section shall be accomplished by: (1) Sending a letter by first class mail, properly stamped and addressed, to the family at its address at the project, with a proper return address, and (2) serving a copy of the notice on any adult person answering the door at the leased dwelling unit, or if no adult responds, by placing the notice under or through the door, if possible, or else by affixing the notice to
the door. Service shall not be considered to be effective until both required notices have been accomplished. The date on which the notice shall be considered to be received by the family shall be the date on which the owner mails the first class letter provided for in this paragraph, or the date on which the notice provided for in this paragraph is properly given, whichever is later.
(c) The notice shall advise each affected family that, after the expiration date of the Contract, the family will be required to bear the entire cost of the rent and that the owner will be free (to the extent the project is not otherwise regulated by HUD) to alter the rent without HUD approval, but subject to any applicable requirements or restrictions under the lease or under State or local law. The notice shall also state: (1) The actual (if known) or the estimated rent which will be charged following the expiration of the Contract; (2) the difference between the rent and the Total Tenant Payment toward rent under the Contract; and (3) the date the Contract will expire.
(d) The owner shall give HUD a certification that families have been notified in accordance with this section with an example of the text of the notice attached.
(e) This section applies to all Contracts executed, renewed or amended on or after October 1, 1984.
[49 FR 31285, Aug. 6, 1984]
§ 886.112
Rent adjustments.
This section applies to adjustments of the dollar amount stated in the Contract as the Maximum Unit Rent. It does not apply to adjustments in rents payable to Owners as required by HUD in connection with its mortgage insurance and/or lending functions.
(a)
Funding of adjustments.
Housing Assistance Payments will be made in increased amounts commensurate with Contract Rent adjustments up to the maximum annual amount of housing assistance payments specified in the Contract pursuant to § 886.108(b).
(b)
Annual adjustments.
The contract rents may be adjusted annually, or more frequently, at HUD's option, either (1) on the basis of a written request for a rent increase submitted by the owner and properly supported by substantiating evidence, or (2) by applying, on each anniversary date of the contract, the applicable Automatic Annual Adjustment Factor most recently published by HUD in the
Federal Register
in accordance with 24 CFR part 888, subpart B. Published Automatic Annual Adjustment Factors will be reduced appropriately by HUD where utilities are paid directly by Families. If HUD requires that the owner submit a written request, HUD, within a reasonable time, shall approve a rental schedule that is necessary to compensate for any increase in taxes (other than income taxes) and operating and maintenance costs over which owners have no effective control, or shall deny the increase stating the reasons therefor. Increases in taxes and maintenance and operating costs shall be measured against levels of such expenses in comparable assisted and unassisted housing in the area to ensure that adjustments in the Contract Rents shall not result in material differences between the rents charged for assisted and comparable unassisted units. Contract Rents may be adjusted upward or downward as may be appropriate; however, in no case shall the adjusted rents be less than the contract rents on the effective date of the contract.
(c)
Special additional adjustments.
Special additional adjustments shall be granted, when approved by HUD, to reflect increases in the actual and necessary expenses of owning and maintaining the Contract units which have resulted from substantial general increases in real property taxes, utility rates or similar costs (i.e., assessment, and utilities not covered by regulated rates), but only if and to the extent that the Owner clearly demonstrates that such general increases have caused increases in the Owner's operating costs which are not adequately compensated for by automatic annual adjustments. The Owner shall submit to HUD financial statements which clearly support the increase.
(d)
Overall limitation.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of the subpart, adjustments as provided in this section shall not result in material differences between the rents charged
for assisted and comparable unassisted units, as determined by HUD.
(e)
Incorporation of rent adjustments.
Any adjustment in Maximum Unit Rents shall be incorporated into the Contract by a dated addendum to the Contract establishing the effective date of the adjustment.
[42 FR 5603, Jan. 28, 1977, as amended at 45 FR 59149, Sept. 8, 1980; 47 FR 24700, June 8, 1982]
§ 886.113
Physical condition standard; physical inspection requirements.
(a)
General.
Housing used in this program must be maintained and inspected in accordance with the requirements in 24 CFR part 5, subpart G.
(b)-(m) [Reserved]
(n)
Congregate housing.
In addition to the foregoing standards, the following standards apply to congregate housing:
(1) The unit shall contain a refrigerator of appropriate size.
(2) The central dining facility (and kitchen facility, if any) shall contain suitable space and equipment to store, prepare and serve food in a sanitary manner, and there shall be adequate facilities and services for the sanitary disposal of food wastes and refuse, including facilities for temporary storage where necessary (e.g., garbage cans).

§ 886.114
Equal opportunity requirements.
Participation in the program authorized in this subpart requires compliance with (a) Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, Executive Orders 11063 and 11246, and section 3 of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968; and (b) all rules, regulations, and requirements issued pursuant thereto.
§ 886.115
[Reserved]
§ 886.116
Security and utility deposits.
(a) An Owner may require Families to pay a security deposit in an amount up to, but not more than, one month's Gross Family Contribution. If a Family vacates its unit, the Owner, subject to State and local laws, may utilize the deposit as reimbursement for any unpaid rent or other amount owed under the Lease. If the Family has provided a security deposit and it is insufficient for such reimbursement, the Owner may claim reimbursement from HUD, not to exceed an amount equal to the remainder of one month's Contract Rent. Any reimbursement under this section shall be applied first toward any unpaid rent. If a Family vacates the unit owing no rent or other amount under the Lease or if such amount is less than the amount of the security deposit, the Owner shall refund the full amount or the unused balance, as the case may be, to the Family.
(b) In those jurisdictions where interest is payable by the Owner on security deposits, the refunded amount shall include the amount of interest payable. All security deposit funds shall be deposited by the Owner in a segregated bank account, and the balance of this account, at all times, shall be equal to the total amount collected from tenants then in occupancy, plus any accrued interest. The Owner shall comply with all State and local laws regarding interest payments on security deposits.
(c) Families shall be expected to obtain the funds to pay security and utility deposits, if required, from their own resources and/or other private or public sources.

Maintenance and operation.
The Owner shall maintain and operate the project so as to provide housing that is compliant with 24 CFR part 5, subpart G, and the Owner shall provide all the services, maintenance, and utilities which the Owner agrees to provide under the Contract, subject to abatement of housing assistance payments or other applicable remedies if the Owner fails to meet these obligations.
(b)
Inspection prior to occupancy.
Prior to occupancy of any unit by a Family, the Owner and the Family shall inspect the unit. On forms prescribed by HUD, the Owner and Family shall certify that they have inspected the unit, and the owner shall certify that the unit is compliant with 24 CFR part 5, subpart G, and with the criteria provided in the prescribed forms. Copies of these reports shall be kept on file by the Owner for at least three years.
(c)
Periodic inspections.

§ 886.124
Reexamination of family income and composition.
(a)
Regular reexaminations.
The owner must reexamine the income and composition of all families at least once each year. Upon verification of the information, the owner must make appropriate adjustments in the Total Tenant Payment in accordance with part 5 of this title and determine whether the family's unit size is still appropriate. The owner must adjust Tenant Rent and the Housing Assistance Payment to reflect any change in Total Tenant Payment and carry out any unit transfer required by HUD. At the time of the annual reexamination of family income and composition, the owner must require the family to disclose and verify Social Security Numbers. For requirements regarding the signing and submitting of consent forms by families for the obtaining of wage and claim information from State Wage Information Collection Agencies, see part 5, subpart B, of this title. At the first regular reexamination after June 19, 1995, the owner shall follow the requirements of part 5, subpart E, of this title concerning obtaining and processing evidence of citizenship or eligible immigration status of all family members. Thereafter, at each regular reexamination, the owner shall follow the requirements of part 5, subpart E, of this title concerning verification of the immigration status of any new family member.
(b)
Interim reexaminations.
The family must comply with provisions in its lease regarding interim reporting of
changes in income. If the owner receives information concerning a change in the family's income or other circumstances between regularly scheduled reexaminations, the owner must consult with the family and make any adjustments determined to be appropriate. Any change in the family's income or other circumstances that results in an adjustment in the Total Tenant Payment, Tenant Rent and Housing Assistance Payment must be verified. See part 5, subpart B, of this title for the requirements for the disclosure and verification of Social Security Numbers at interim reexaminations involving new family members. For requirements regarding the signing and submitting of consent forms by families for the obtaining of wage and claim information from State Wage Information Collection Agencies, see part 5, subpart B, of this title. At any interim reexamination after June 19, 1995, when there is a new family member, the owner shall follow the requirements of part 5, subpart E, of this title concerning obtaining and processing evidence of citizenship or eligible immigration status of the new family member.
(c)
Continuation of housing assistance payments.
A family's eligibility for housing assistance payments will continue until the Total Tenant Payment equals the Gross Rent. The termination of eligibility will not affect the family's other rights under its lease, nor will such termination preclude the resumption of payments as a result of later changes in income, rents, or other relevant circumstances during the term of the Contract. However, eligibility also may be terminated in accordance with program requirements, for such reasons as failure to submit requested verification information, including failure to meet the disclosure and verification requirements for Social Security Numbers, as provided by part 5, subpart B, of this title, or failure to sign and submit consent forms for the obtaining of wage and claim information from State Wage Information Collection Agencies, as provided by part 5, subpart B, of this title. For provisions requiring termination of assistance for failure to establish citizenship or eligible immigration status, see part 5, subpart E, of this title for provisions concerning certain assistance for mixed families (families whose members include those with eligible immigration status, and those without eligible immigration status) in lieu of termination of assistance, and for provisions concerning deferral of termination of assistance.

§ 886.125
Overcrowded and underoccupied units.
If HUD determines that a contract unit assisted under this part is not Decent, Safe, and Sanitary by reason of increase in Family size or that a Contract unit is larger than appropriate for the size of the Family in occupancy, housing assistance payments with respect to such unit will not be abated, unless the Owner fails to offer the Family a suitable unit as soon as one becomes vacant and ready for occupancy. The Owner may receive housing assistance payments for the vacated unit if he complies with the requirements of § 886.109.
§ 886.126
Adjustment of utility allowances.
When the owner requests HUD approval of adjustment in Contract Rents under § 886.112, an analysis of the project's Utility Allowances must be included. Such data as changes in utility rates and other facts affecting utility consumption should be provided as part of this analysis to permit appropriate adjustments in the Utility Allowances. In addition, when approval of a utility rate change would result in a cumulative increase of 10 percent or more in the most recently approved Utility Allowances, the owner must advise the Secretary and request approval of new Utility Allowances.

Termination of tenancy.
Part 247 of this title (24 CFR part 247) applies to the termination of tenancy and eviction of a family assisted under this subpart. For cases involving termination of tenancy because of a failure to establish citizenship or eligible immigration status, the procedures of 24 CFR parts 247 and 5 shall apply.

§ 886.129
Leasing to eligible families.
(a)
Availability of units for occupancy by Eligible Families.
During the term of the Contract, an owner shall make available for occupancy by eligible families the total number of units for
which assistance is committed under the Contract. For purposes of this section, making units available for occupancy by eligible families means that the owner: (1) Is conducting marketing in accordance with § 886.121; (2) has leased or is making good faith efforts to lease the units to eligible and otherwise acceptable families, including taking all feasible actions to fill vacancies by renting to such families; and (3) has not rejected any such applicant family except for reasons acceptable to HUD. If the owner is temporarily unable to lease all units for which assistance is committed under the Contract to eligible families, one or more units may be leased to ineligible families with the prior approval of HUD. Failure on the part of the owner to comply with these requirements is a violation of the Contract and grounds for all available legal remedies, including specific performance of the Contract, suspension or debarment from HUD programs, and reduction of the number of units under the Contract as set forth in paragraph (b) of this section.
(b)
Reduction of number of units covered by Contract.
HUD may reduce the number of units covered by the Contract to the number of units available for occupancy by eligible families if:
(1) The owner fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section; or
(2) Notwithstanding any prior approval by HUD to lease such units to ineligible families, HUD determines that the inability to lease units to eligible families is not a temporary problem.
(c)
Restoration.
HUD will agree to an amendment of the Contract to provide for subsequent restoration of any reduction made pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section if:
(1) HUD determines that the restoration is justified by demand;
(2) The owner otherwise has a record of compliance with his or her obligations under the Contract; and
(3) Contract and budget authority are available.
(d)
Applicability.
Paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section apply to Contracts executed on or after October 3, 1984.
(e)
Termination of assistance for failure to establish citizenship or eligible immigration status.
If an owner subject to paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section is required to terminate housing assistance payments for the family in accordance with part 5, subpart E, of this title because the owner determines that the entire family does not have U.S. citizenship or eligible immigration status, the owner may allow continued occupancy of the unit by the family without Section 8 assistance following the termination of assistance, or if the family constitutes a mixed family, as defined in part 5, subpart E, of this title, the owner shall comply with the provisions of part 5, subpart E, of this title concerning assistance to mixed families, and deferral of termination of assistance.

The following policies cover residential tenants who will not be required to move permanently but who must relocate temporarily for the project. Such tenants must be provided;
(1) Reimbursement for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the temporary relocation, including the cost of moving to and from the temporary housing and any increase in monthly rent/utility costs; and
(2) Appropriate advisory services, including reasonable advance written notice of:
(i) The date and approximate duration of the temporary relocation;
(ii) The location of the suitable, decent, safe, and sanitary dwelling to be made available for the temporary period;

A “displaced person” shall be advised of his or her rights under the Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 3601-19), and, if the representative comparable replacement dwelling used to establish the amount of the replacement housing payment to be provided to a minority person is located in an area of minority concentration, such person also shall be given, if possible, referrals to comparable and suitable, decent, safe, and sanitary replacement dwellings not located in such areas.
(d)
Real property acquisition requirements.
The acquisition of real property for a project is subject to the URA and the requirements described in 49 CFR part 24, subpart B.
(e)
Appeals.
A person who disagrees with the Owner's determination concerning whether the person qualifies as a “displaced person,” or the amount of relocation assistance for which the person is found to be eligible, may file a written appeal of that determination with the owner. A low-income person who is dissatisfied with the owner's determination on such appeal may submit a written request for review of that determination to the HUD Field Office.
(f)
Responsibility of owner.
(1) The owner shall certify (i.e., provide assurance of compliance, as required by 49 CFR part 24) that he or she will comply with the URA, the regulations at 49 CFR part 24, and the requirements of this section. The owner is responsible for such compliance notwithstanding and third party's contractual obligation to the owner to comply with these provisions.
(2) The cost of providing required relocation assistance is an eligible project cost to the same extent and in the same manner as other project costs. Such costs also may be paid for with funds available from other sources.
(3) The owner shall maintain records in sufficient detail to demonstrate compliance with the provisions of this section. The owner shall maintain data on the race, ethnic, gender, and handicap status of displaced persons.
(g)
Definition of displaced person.
(1) for purposes of this section, the term
displaced person
means a person (family, individual, business, nonprofit organization, or farm) that moves from real property, or moves personal property from real property, permanently, as a direct result of acquisition, rehabilitation, or demolition for a project assisted under this part. This includes any permanent, involuntary move for an assisted project, including any permanent move from the real property that is made:
(i) After notice by the owner to move permanently from the property, if the move occurs on or after the date of the submission of the application to HUD;
(ii) Before submission of the application to HUD, if HUD determines that the displacement resulted directly from acquisition, rehabilitation, or demolition for the assisted project; or
(iii) By a tenant-occupant of a dwelling unit, if any one of the following three situations occurs;
(A) The tenant moves after execution of the Housing Assistance Payments Contract, and the move occurs before the tenant is provided written notice offering him or her the opportunity to lease and occupy a suitable, decent, safe, and sanitary dwelling in the same building/complex, under reasonable terms and conditions, upon completion of the project. Such reasonable terms and conditions include a monthly rent and estimated average monthly utility costs that do not exceed the greater of:
(
1
) The tenant's monthly rent before execution of the Housing Assistance Payments Contract and estimated average monthly utility costs; or
(
2
) The total tenant payment, as determined under part 5 of this title, if the tenant is low-income, or 30 percent of gross household income, if the tenant is not low-income;
(B) The tenant is required to relocate temporarily, does not return to the building/complex, and either:
(
1
) The tenant is not offered payment for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the temporary relocation, or
(
2
) Other conditions of the temporary relocation are not reasonable; or
(C) The tenant is required to move to another dwelling unit in the same building/complex but is not offered reimbursement for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the move, or other conditions of the move are not reasonable.
(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (g)(1) of this section, a person does not qualify as a “displaced person” (and is not eligible for relocation assistance under the URA or this section), if:
(i) The person has been evicted for serious or repeated violation of the terms and conditions of the lease or occupancy agreement, violation of applicable Federal, State or local law, or other good cause, and HUD determines that the eviction was not undertaken for the purpose of evading the obligation to provide relocation assistance;
(ii) The person moved into the property after the submission of the application and, before signing a lease and commencing occupancy, received written notice of the project, its possible impact on the person (e.g., the person may be displaced, temporarily relocated, or suffer a rent increase) and the fact that he or she would not qualify as a “displaced person” (or for assistance under this section) as a result of the project;
(iii) The person is ineligible under 49 CFR 24.2(g)(2); or
(iv) HUD determines that the person was not displaced as a direct result of acquisition, rehabilitation, or demolition for the project.
(3) The owner may ask HUD, at any time, to determine whether a displacement is or would be covered by this section.
(h)
Definition of initiation of negotiations.
For purposes of determining the formula for computing the replacement housing assistance to be provided to a residential tenant displaced as a direct result of private-owner rehabilitation, demolition or acquisition of the real property, the term “initiation of negotiations” means the owner's execution of the Housing Assistance Payments Contract.

Emergency transfers for victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking.
(a) Covered housing providers must develop and implement an emergency transfer plan that meets the requirements in 24 CFR 5.2005(e).

Selection of projects.
HUD shall select projects for sale with assistance under this subpart on the basis of the final disposition programs developed and approved in accordance with part 290 and the requirements of this subpart.

In these projects, Section 8 payments may be made only for project units which are determined to be decent, safe and sanitary.
(c)
High-rise elevator projects.

§ 886.308
Maximum total annual contract commitment.
(a)
Number of units assisted.
Based on the final disposition program developed in accordance with 24 CFR part 290, HUD shall determine the number of units to be assisted up to 100 percent of the units in the project.
(b)
Maximum assistance.
The maximum total annual housing assistance payments that may be committed under the contract shall be the total of the gross rents for all the contract units in the project.
(c)
Changes in contract amounts.
In order to assure that housing assistance payments will be increased on a timely basis to cover increases in contract rents, changes in family composition, or decreases in family incomes:
(1) A project account shall be established and maintained, in an amount as determined by HUD consistent with section 8(c)(6) of the Act, out of amounts by which the maximum annual contract commitment per year exceeds amounts paid under the contract for any fiscal year. This account shall be established and maintained by HUD as a specifically identified and segregated account, and payment shall be
made therefrom only for the purposes of:
(i) Housing assistance payments, and
(ii) Other costs specifically authorized or approved by HUD.
(2) Whenever a HUD-approved estimate of required housing assistance payments for a fiscal year exceeds the maximum annual contract commitment, causing the amount in the project account to be less than an amount equal to 40 percent of the maximum annual contract commitment, HUD, within a reasonable period of time, shall take such additional steps authorized by Section 8(c)(6) of the Act as may be necessary to carry out this assurance, including (as provided in that section of the Act) “the reservation of annual contributions authority for the purpose of amending housing assistance contracts or the allocation of a portion of new authorizations for the purpose of amending housing assistance contracts.”
§ 886.309
Housing assistance payment to owners.
(a)
General.
Housing Assistance Payments shall be paid to Owners for units under lease by eligible Families, in accordance with the Contract and as provided in this section. These Housing Assistance Payments will cover the difference between the Contract Rent and the Tenant Rent. Where applicable, the Utility Reimbursement will be paid to the Family as an additional Housing Assistance Payment. The Contract will provide that the Owner will make this payment on behalf of HUD. Funds will be paid to the Owner in trust solely for the purpose of making this additional payment. If the Family and the utility company consent, the Owner may pay the Utility Reimbursement jointly to the Family and the utility company or directly to the utility company.
(b)
No assistance for owners.
No Section 8 assistance may be provided for any unit occupied by an owner. However, cooperatives are considered rental housing rather than owner-occupied housing under this subpart.
(c)
Payments for vacancies from execution of contract to initial occupancy.
If a Contract unit which is decent, safe and sanitary and has been accepted by HUD as available as of the effective date of the Contract is not leased within 15 days of the effective date of the Contract, the Owner will be entitled to housing assistance payments in the amount of 80 percent of the Contract Rent for the unit for a vacancy period not exceeding 60 days from the effective date of the Contract provided that the Owner (1) has submitted a list of units leased as of the effective date and a list of the units not so leased; (2) 60 days prior to the completion of the rehabilitation or the date the agreement was executed, whichever is later, had notified the PHA of any units which the owner anticipated would be vacant on the anticipated effective date of the contract; (3) has taken and continues to take all feasible actions to fill the vacancy including, but not limited to: contracting applicants on the Owner's waiting list, if any, requesting the PHA and other appropriate sources to refer eligible applicants, and advertising the availability of the units in a manner specifically designed to reach low-income families; and (4) has not rejected any eligible applicant except for good cause acceptable to HUD.
(d)
Payments for vacancies after initial occupancy.
If an eligible family vacates its unit (other than as a result of action by the Owner which is in violation of the Lease or the Contract or any applicable law), the owner may receive housing assistance payments for so much of the month in which the Family vacates the unit as the unit remains vacant. Should the unit remain vacant, the Owner may receive from HUD a housing assistance payment in the amount of 80 percent of Contract Rent for a vacancy period not exceeding an additional month. However, if the owner collects any of the family's share of the rent for this period, the payment must be reduced to an amount which, when added to the family's payments, does not exceed 80 percent of the Contract Rent. Any such excess shall be reimbursed by the Owner to HUD or as HUD may direct. (See also § 886.315.) The owner shall not be entitled to any payment under this paragraph unless he or she: (1) Immediately upon learning of the vacancy, has notified HUD of the vacancy or prospective vacancy and the reasons for the vacancy, and (2) has made and
continues to make a good faith effort to fill the vacancy, including but not limited to, contacting applicants on the waiting list, if any, requesting the PHA and other appropriate sources to refer eligible applicants, and advertising the availability of the unit, and (3) has not rejected any eligible applicant, except for good cause acceptable to HUD.
(e)
Payments for units where family is evicted.
If the owner evicts a family, the owner shall not be entitled to any payments pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section unless the request for such payment is supported by a certification that the provisions of § 886.328 and part 247 of this title have been followed.
(f)
Prohibition for double compensation for vacancies.
The owner shall not be entitled to housing assistance payments with respect to vacant units under this section to the extent he or she is entitled to payments from other sources (for example, payments for losses of rental income incurred for holding units vacant for relocatees pursuant to Title I of the HCD Act or payments under § 886.315).
(g)
Debt service payments.
(1) If a contract unit continues to be vacant after the 60-day period specified in paragraph (c) or (d) of this section, the Owner may submit a claim and receive additional housing assistance payments on a semiannual basis with respect to such a vacant unit in an amount equal to the principal and interest payments required to amortize the portion of the debt attributable to that unit for the period of the vacancy, whether such vacancy commenced during rent-up or after rent-up.
(2) Additional payments under this paragraph (g) for any unit shall not be for more than 12 months for any vacancy period, and shall be made only if:
(i) The unit is not in a project insured under the National Housing Act except pursuant to section 244 of that Act.
(ii) The unit was in decent, safe, and sanitary condition during the vacancy period for which payments are claimed.
(iii) The owner has taken and is continuing to take the actions specified in paragraphs (c)(1), (2) and (3) or paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section, as appropriate.
(iv) The Owner has demonstrated in connection with the semiannual claim on a form and in accordance with the standards prescribed by HUD with respect to the period of the vacancy, that the project is not providing the Owner with revenues at least equal to the project costs incurred by the Owner, and that the amount of the payments requested is not in excess of that portion of the deficiency which is attributable to the vacant units for the period of the vacancies.
(v) The Owner has submitted, in connection with the semiannual claim, a statement with relevant supporting evidence that there is a reasonable prospect that the project can achieve financial soundness within a reasonable time. The statement shall indicate the causes of the deficiency; the corrective steps that have been and will be taken; and the time by which it is expected that the project revenues will at least equal project costs without the additional payments provided under this paragraph.
(3) HUD may deny any claim for additional payments or suspend or terminate payments if it determines that based on the Owner's statement and other evidence, there is not a reasonable prospect that the project can achieve financial soundness within a reasonable time.

§ 886.310
Initial contract rents.
HUD will establish contract rents at levels that, together with other resources available to the purchasers, provide sufficient amounts for the necessary costs of rehabilitating and operating the multifamily housing project and do not exceed 120 percent of the most recently published Section 8 Fair Market Rents for Existing Housing (24 CFR part 888, subpart A).
[60 FR 11859, Mar. 2, 1995]
§ 886.311
Term of contract.
The contract term for any unit shall not exceed 15 years, except that the
term may be less than 15 years as provided under either paragraph (a) or (b) of this section.
(a) The contract term may be less than 15 years if HUD finds that, based on the rental charges and financing for the multifamily housing project to which the contract relates, the financial viability of the project can be maintained under a contract having a term less than 15 years. Where a contract of less than 15 years is provided under this paragraph, the amount of rent payable by tenants of the project for units assisted under such a contract shall not exceed the amount payable for rent under section 3(a) of the United States Housing Act of 1937 for a period of at least 15 years.
(b) The contract term may be less than 15 years if the assistance is provided under a contract authorized under section 6 of the HUD Demonstration Act of 1993, and pursuant to a disposition plan under this part for a project that is determined by the HUD to be otherwise in compliance with this part.
[60 FR 11859, Mar. 2, 1995]
§ 886.311a
Notice upon contract expiration.
(a) The Contract will provide that the owner will notify each assisted family, at least 90 days before the end of the Contract term, of any increase in the amount the family will be required to pay as rent which may occur as a result of its expiration. If the Contract is to be renewed but with a reduction in the number of units covered by it, this notice shall be given to each family who will no longer be assisted under the Contract.
(b) The notice provided for in paragraph (a) of this section shall be accomplished by: (1) Sending a letter by first class mail, properly stamped and addressed, to the family at its address at the project, with a proper return address, and (2) serving a copy of the notice on any adult person answering the door at the leased dwelling unit, or if no adult responds, by placing the notice under or through the door, if possible, or else by affixing the notice to the door. Service shall not be considered to be effective until both required notices have been accomplished. The date on which the notice shall be considered to be received by the family shall be the date on which the owner mails the first class letter provided for in this paragraph, or the date on which the notice provided for in this paragraph is properly given, whichever is later.
(c) The notice shall advise each affected family that, after the expiration date of the Contract, the family will be required to bear the entire cost of the rent and that the owner will be free (to the extent the project is not otherwise regulated by HUD) to alter the rent without HUD approval, but subject to any applicable requirements or restrictions under the lease or under State or local law. The notice shall also state:
(1) The actual (if known) or the estimated rent which will be charged following the expiration of the Contract;
(2) The difference between the rent and the Total Tenant Payment toward rent under the Contract; and
(3) The date the Contract will expire.
(d) The owner shall give HUD a certification that families have been notified in accordance with this section with an example of the text of the notice attached.
(e) This section shall apply to (1) Contracts involving Substantial Rehabilitation entered into pursuant to Agreements executed on or after October 1, 1981, or Contracts involving Substantial Rehabilitation entered into pursuant to Agreements executed before October 1, 1981, but renewed or amended on or after October 1, 1984 and (2) all other Contracts executed, renewed or amended on or after October 1, 1984.

§ 886.312
Rent adjustments.
(a)
Limits.
Housing assistance payments will be made in amounts commensurate with contract rent adjustments under this paragraph, up to the maximum amount authorized under the contract. (See § 886.308.)
(b)
Annual adjustments.
The contract rents may be adjusted annually, at HUD's option, either (1) on the basis of a written request for a rent increase submitted by the owner and properly supported by substantiating evidence, or (2) by applying, on each anniversary
date of the contract, the applicable automatic annual adjustment factor most recently published by HUD in the
Federal Register.
If HUD requires that the owner submit a written request, HUD within a reasonable time shall approve a rental schedule that is necessary to compensate for any increase occurring since the last approved rental schedule in taxes (other than income taxes) and operating and maintenance costs over which owners have no effective control, or shall deny the increase stating the reasons therefor. Increases in taxes and maintenance and operating costs shall be measured against levels of such expenses in comparable assisted and unassisted housing in the area to ensure that adjustments in the contract rents shall not result in material differences between the rents charged for assisted and comparable unassisted units. Contract rents may be adjusted upward or downward as may be appropriate; however, in no case shall the adjusted rents be less than the contract rents on the effective date of the contract, provided there was no fraud or mistake adverse to the Department's interest in determining the initial contract rent.
(c)
Special adjustments.
Special adjustments in the contract rents shall be requested in writing by the owner and may be authorized by HUD to the extent HUD determines such adjustments are necessary to reflect increases in the actual and necessary expenses of owning and maintaining the contract units which have resulted from substantial general increases in real property taxes, utility rates or similar costs (i.e., assessments and utilities not covered be regulated rates) which are not adequately compensated for by the adjustment authorized by paragraph (b) of this section.
(d)
Comparability between assisted and unassisted units.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this subpart, adjustments as provided in this section shall not result in material differences between the rents charged for assisted and comparable unassisted units, as determined by HUD:
Provided, however,
That this limitation shall not be construed to prohibit differences in rents between assisted and comparable unassisted units to the extent that such differences may have existed with respect to the initial contract rents assuming no fraud or mistake adverse to the Department's interest.
(e)
Addendums to contract and leases.
Any adjustment in contract rents shall be incorporated into the contract and leases by dated addendums to the contract and leases establishing the effective date of the adjustment.
§ 886.313
Other Federal requirements.

§ 886.314
Financial default.
In the event of a financial default under the project mortgage, HUD shall have the right to make subsequent housing assistance payments to the mortgagee until such time as the default is cured, or until some other time agreeable to the mortgagee and approved by HUD.
§ 886.315
Security and utility deposits.
(a)
Amount of deposits.
If at the time of the initial execution of the Lease the Owner wishes to collect a security deposit, the maximum amount shall be the greater of one month's Gross Family Contribution or $50. However, this amount shall not exceed the maximum amount allowable under State or local law. For units leased in place, security deposits collected prior to the execution of a Contract which are in excess of this maximum amount do not have to be refunded until the Family is expected to pay security deposits and utility deposits from its resources and/or other public or private sources.
(b)
When a Family vacates.
If a Family vacates the unit, the Owner, subject to State and local law, may use the security deposit as reimbursement for any unpaid Family Contribution or other amount which the Family owes under the Lease. If a Family vacates the unit owing no rent or other amount under the Lease consistent with State or local law or if such amount is less than the amount of the security deposit, the Owner shall refund the full amount or the unused balance to the Family.
(c)
Interest payable on deposits.
In those jurisdictions where interest is payable by the Owner on security deposits, the refunded amount shall include the amount of interest payable. The Owner shall comply with all State and local laws regarding interest payments on security deposits.
(d)
Insufficient deposits.
If the security deposit is insufficient to reimburse the Owner for the unpaid Family Contribution or other amounts which the Family owes under the Lease, or if the Owner did not collect a security deposit, the Owner may claim reimbursement from HUD for an amount not to exceed the lesser of: (1) The amount owed the Owner, (2) two months' Contract Rent, minus, in either case, the greater of the security deposit actually collected or the amount of security deposit the owner could have collected under the program (pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section). Any reimbursement under this section must be applied first toward any unpaid Family Contribution due under the Lease and then to any other amounts owed. No reimbursement shall be claimed for unpaid rent for the period after the family vacates.

When contract termination is under consideration by HUD, HUD shall give eligible families an opportunity to submit written and other comments. Where the project is sold under the arrangement that involves a regulatory agreement between HUD and the owner, a default under the regulatory agreement shall be treated as default under the contract.
§ 886.321
Marketing.
(a)
Marketing in accordance with HUD-Approved Plan.
Marketing of units and selection of families by the owner shall be in accordance with the owner's HUD-approved Affirmative Fair Housing Marketing Plan, HUD-approved tenant selection factors and with all regulations relating to fair housing advertising including use of the equal opportunity logotype, statement, and slogan in all advertising. Projects shall be
managed and operated without regard to race, color, creed, religion, sex, or national origin.
(b)(1) HUD will determine the eligibility of assistance of families in occupancy before sales closing. After the sale, the owner shall be responsible for taking applications, selecting families, and all related determinations, in accordance with part 5 of this title. (See especially, 24 CFR part 5, subpart F).
(2) For every family that applies for admission, the owner and the applicant must complete and sign the form of application prescribed by HUD. When the owner decides no longer to accept applications, the owner must publish a notice to that effect in a publication likely to be read by potential applicants. The notice must state the reasons for the owner's refusal to accept additional applications. When the owner agrees to accept applications again, a notice to this effect must also be published. The owner must retain copies of all completed applications together with any related correspondence for three years. For each family selected for admission, the owner must submit one copy of the completed and signed application to HUD. Housing assistance payments will not be made on behalf of an admitted family until after this copy has been received by HUD.
(3) If the owner determines that the applicant is eligible on the basis of income and family composition and is otherwise acceptable but the owner does not have a suitable unit to offer, the owner shall place such family on the waiting list and so advise the family indicating approximately when a unit may be available.
(4) If the owner determines that the applicant is eligible on the basis of income and family composition and is otherwise acceptable in accordance with the HUD approved tenant selection factors and if the owner has a suitable unit, the owner and the family shall enter into a lease. The lease shall be on a form approved by HUD and shall otherwise be in conformity with the provisions of this subpart.
(5) Records on applicant families and approved families shall be maintained by the owner so as to provide HUD with racial, ethnic, and gender data and shall be retained by the owner for 3 years.
(6) If the owner determines that an applicant is not eligible, or, if eligible, not selected, the owner must notify the applicant in writing of the determination, the reasons upon which the determination is made, and inform the applicant that the applicant has the right within a reasonable time (specified in the letter) to request an informal hearing if the applicant believes that the owner's determination is based on erroneous information. The procedures of this paragraph (b)(6) do not preclude an applicant from exercising his or her other rights if the applicant believes that he or she is being discriminated against on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, or handicap. The owner must retain for three years a copy of the application, the letter, the applicant's response, if any, the record of any informal hearing, and a statement of final disposition. The informal review provisions for the denial of a tenant selection preference under § 886.337 are contained in paragraph (k) of that section.
(7) For the informal hearing provisions related to denial of assistance based upon failure to establish citizenship or eligible immigration status, see part 5 of this title for provisions concerning certain assistance for mixed families (families whose members include those with eligible immigration status, and those without eligible immigration status) in lieu of denial of assistance.
(c)
Initial occupancy.
(1) Where rehabilitation is involved, sixty days prior to the completion of the rehabilitation, or when the rehabilitation is begun, whichever is later, the Owner shall determine whether the tenant population of the project generally reflects the racial/ethnic makeup of the housing market area. Based on this determination, the Owner shall then conduct appropriate marketing activities in accordance with a HUD-approved Affirmative Fair Housing Marketing Plan. Such activities may include special outreach to those groups identified as not ordinarily expected to apply for these units without special outreach; notification to PHA's in the housing market area of
any anticipated vacancies; and formulation of waiting lists based on the Owner's HUD-approved tenant selection factors.
(2) Where a PHA is notified, the PHA shall notify an appropriate size family (families) on its waiting list of the availability of the unit and refer the family (families) to the owner. (Since the Owner is responsible for tenant selection, the owner is not required to lease to a PHA selected family, but the owner must comply with § 886.321(b)(6).)

§ 886.323
Maintenance, operation, and inspections.
(a)
Maintain housing free of health and safety hazards.
The Owner shall maintain and operate the project so as to be compliant with 24 CFR part 5, subpart G, and the Owner shall provide all the services, maintenance, and utilities which the Owner agrees to provide under the contract and the lease. Failure to do so shall be considered a material default under the contract and Regulatory Agreement, if any.
(b)
HUD inspection.
Prior to execution of the contract, HUD shall inspect (or cause to be inspected) each proposed contract unit and related facilities to ensure that they comply with the requirements at 24 CFR part 5, subpart G.
(c)
Owner and family inspection.
Prior to occupancy of any vacant unit by a Family, the Owner and the Family shall inspect the unit. The Owner shall certify that they have inspected the unit, and the owner shall certify that the unit is compliant with 24 CFR part 5, subpart G. Copies of these reports shall be kept on file by the owner for at least 3 years.
(d)
Periodic inspections.
HUD will inspect the project (or cause it to be inspected) in accordance with the requirements in 24 CFR part 5, subpart G, and at such other times as HUD may determine to be necessary to assure that the owner is meeting the Owner's obligation to maintain the units and the related facilities in accordance with 24 CFR part 5, subpart G, and to provide the agreed-upon utilities and other services.
(e)
Failure to maintain housing.
If HUD notifies the Owner that he/she has failed to maintain a unit that is compliant with 24 CFR part 5, subpart G, and the Owner fails to take corrective action within the time prescribed in the notice, HUD may exercise any of its rights or remedies under the Contract, or Regulatory Agreement, if any, including abatement of housing assistance payments (even if the Family continues to occupy the unit) and rescission of the sale. If the Family wishes to be rehoused in another unit, HUD shall provide assistance in finding such a unit for the Family.
[88 FR 30500, May 11, 2023]
§ 886.324
Reexamination of family income and composition.
(a)
Regular reexaminations.
The owner must reexamine the income and composition of all families at least once each year. Upon verification of the information, the owner must make appropriate adjustments in the Total Tenant Payment in accordance with part 5 of this title and determine whether the family's unit size is still appropriate. The owner must adjust Tenant Rent and the Housing Assistance Payment to reflect any change in Total Tenant Payment and carry out any unit transfer required by HUD. At the time of the annual reexamination of family income and composition, the owner must require the family to disclose and verify Social Security Numbers, as provided by part 5, subpart B, of this title. For requirements regarding the signing and submitting of consent forms by families for the obtaining of wage and claim information from State Wage Information Collection Agencies, see part 5, subpart B, of this title. At the first regular reexamination after June 19, 1995, the owner shall follow the requirements of part 5 of this title concerning obtaining and processing evidence of citizenship or eligible immigration status of all family members. Thereafter, at each regular reexamination, the owner shall follow the requirements of part 5 of this title
concerning verification of the immigration status of any new family member.
(b)
Interim reexaminations.
The family must comply with provisions in its lease regarding interim reporting of changes in income. If the owner receives information concerning a change in the family's income or other circumstances between regularly scheduled reexaminations, the owner must consult with the family and make any adjustments determined to be appropriate. Any change in the family's income or other circumstances that results in an adjustment in the Total Tenant Payment, Tenant Rent and Housing Assistance Payment must be verified. See part 5, subpart B, of this title for the requirements for the disclosure and verification of Social Security Numbers at interim reexaminations involving new family members. For requirements regarding the signing and submitting of consent forms by families for the obtaining of wage and claim information from State Wage Information Collection Agencies, see part 5, subpart B, of this title. At any interim reexamination after June 19, 1995 when there is a new family member, the owner shall follow the requirements of part 5 of this title concerning obtaining and processing evidence of citizenship or eligible immigration status of the new family member.
(c)
Continuation of housing assistance payments.
A family's eligibility for Housing Assistance Payments will continue until the Total Tenant Payment equals the Contact Rent plus any applicable Utility Allowance. The termination of eligibility at such point will not affect the family's other rights under its lease, nor will such termination preclude the resumption of payments as a result of later changes in income, rents, or other relevant circumstances during the term of the contract. However, eligibility also may be terminated in accordance with HUD requirements, for such reasons as failure to submit requested verification information, including failure to meet the disclosure and verification requirements for Social Security Numbers, as provided by part 5, subpart B, of this title, or failure to sign and submit consent forms for the obtaining of wage and claim information from State Wage Information Collection Agencies, as provided by part 5, subpart B, of this title. For provisions requiring termination of assistance for failure to establish citizenship or eligible immigration status, see part 5, subpart E, of this title for provisions concerning certain assistance for mixed families (families whose members include those with eligible immigration status, and those without eligible immigration status) in lieu of termination of assistance, and for provisions concerning deferral of termination of assistance.
(d)
Streamlined income determination.
An owner may elect to follow the provisions of 24 CFR 5.657(d).

§ 886.325
Overcrowded and underoccupied units.
(a)
Change in family composition, family's notification.
The family shall notify the owner of a change in family composition and shall transfer to an appropriate size dwelling unit, based on family composition, upon appropriate notice by the owner of HUD that such a dwelling unit is available. Such a family shall have priority over a family on the owner's waiting list seeking the same size unit.
(b)
Change in family composition, owner's responsibilities.
Upon receipt by the owner of a notification by the family of a change in the family size, the owner agrees to offer the family a suitable unit as soon as one becomes vacant and ready for occupancy. If the owner does not have any suitable units or if no vacancy of a suitable unit occurs within a reasonable time, HUD may assist the family in finding a suitable dwelling unit and require the family to move to such unit as soon as possible.
(c)
HUD actions if appropriate size unit is not made available.
If the owner fails to offer the family a unit appropriate for the size of the family when such unit becomes vacant and ready for occupancy, HUD may abate housing assistance payments to the owner for the unit occupied by the family and assist
the family in finding a suitable dwelling unit elsewhere.
[46 FR 19467, Mar. 31, 1981]
§ 886.326
Adjustment of utility allowances.
When the owner requests HUD approval of an adjustment in Contract Rents under § 886.312, an analysis of the project's Utility Allowances must be included. Such data as changes in utility rates and other facts affecting utility consumption should be provided as part of this analysis to permit appropriate adjustments in the Utility Allowances. In addition, when approval of a utility rate change would result in a cumulative increase of 10 percent or more in the most recently approved Utility Allowances, the owner must advise the Secretary and request approval of new Utility Allowances.

§ 886.327
Lease requirements.
(a)
Term of lease.
(1) The term of a lease, including a new lease or a lease amendment, executed by the owner and the family must be for at least one year, or the remaining term of the contract if the remaining term of the contract is less than one year.
(2) During the first year of the lease term, the owner may not terminate the tenancy for “other good cause” under 24 CFR 247.3(a)(3), unless the termination is based on family malfeasance or nonfeasance. For example, during the first year of the lease term, the owner may not terminate the tenancy for “other good cause” based on the failure of the family to accept the offer of a new lease.
(3) The lease may contain a provision permitting the family to terminate on 30 days advance written notice to the owner. In this case of a lease term for more than one year, the lease must contain this provision.
(b)
Required and prohibited provisions.
The lease between the owner and the family must comply with HUD regulations and requirements, and must be in the form required by HUD. The lease may not contain any of the following types of prohibited provisions:
(1)
Admission of guilt.
Agreement by the family (i) to be sued, and (ii) to admit guilt, or (iii) to a judgment in favor of the owner, in a court proceeding against the family in connection with the lease.
(2)
Treatment of family property.
Agreement by the family that the owner may take or hold family property, or may sell family property, without notice to the family and a court decision on the rights of the parties.
(3)
Excusing owner from responsibility.
Agreement by the family not to hold the owner or the owner's agents responsible for any action or failure to act, whether intentional or negligent.
(4)
Waiver of notice.
Agreement by the family that the owner does not need to give notice of a court proceeding against the family in connection with the lease, or does not need to give any notice required by HUD.
(5)
Waiver of court proceeding for eviction.
Agreement by the family that the owner may evict the family (i) without instituting a civil court proceeding in which the family has the opportunity to present a defense, or (ii) before a decision by the court on the rights of the parties.
(6)
Waiver of jury trial.
Agreement by the family to waive any right to a trial by jury.
(7)
Waiver of appeal.
Agreement by the family to waive the right to appeal, or to otherwise challenge in court, a court decision in connection with the lease.
(8)
Family chargeable with legal costs regardless of outcome.
Agreement by the family to pay lawyer's fees or other legal costs of the owner, even if the family wins in a court proceeding by the owner against the family. (However, the family may have to pay these fees and costs if the family loses.)
(c)
Notification for nonpayment of rent.
The lease must contain a provision or addendum that tenants will receive notification at least 30 days before a formal judicial eviction is filed.

§ 886.328
Termination of tenancy.
Part 247 of this title (24 CFR part 247) applies to the termination of tenancy and eviction of a family assisted under this subpart. For cases involving termination of tenancy because of a failure to establish citizenship or eligible immigration status, the procedures of 24 CFR part 247 and 24 CFR part 5 shall apply. The provisions of 24 CFR part 5, subpart L (Protection for Victims of Domestic Violence, Dating Violence, Sexual Assault, or Stalking) apply to this section. The provisions of 24 CFR part 5, subpart E, concerning certain assistance for mixed families (families whose members include those with eligible immigration status, and those without eligible immigration status) in lieu of termination of assistance, and concerning deferral of termination of assistance, also shall apply.
[81 FR 80814, Nov. 16, 2016]
§ 886.329
Leasing to eligible families.
(a)
Availability of units for occupancy by Eligible Families.
During the term of the Contract, an owner shall make available for occupancy by eligible families the total number of units for which assistance is committed under the Contract. For purposes of this section, making units available for occupancy by eligible families means that the owner: (1) Is conducting marketing in accordance with § 886.321; (2) has leased or is making good faith efforts to lease the units to eligible and otherwise acceptable families, including taking all feasible actions to fill vacancies by renting to such families; and (3) has not rejected any such applicant family except for reasons acceptable to HUD. If the owner is temporarily unable to lease all units for which assistance is committed under the Contract to eligible families, one or more units may be leased to ineligible families with the prior approval of HUD. Failure on the part of the owner to comply with these requirements is a violation of the Contract and grounds for all available legal remedies, including specific performance of the Contract, suspension or debarment from HUD programs, and reduction of the number of units under the Contract as set forth in paragraph (b) of this section.
(b)
Reduction of number of units covered by Contract.
HUD may reduce the number of units covered by the Contract to the number of units available for occupancy by eligible families if:
(1) The owner fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section; or
(2) Notwithstanding any prior approval by HUD to lease such units to ineligible families, HUD determines that the inability to lease units to eligible families is not a temporary problem.
(c)
Restoration.
HUD will agree to an amendment of the Contract to provide for subsequent restoration of any reduction made pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section if:
(1) HUD determines that the restoration is justified by demand;
(2) The owner otherwise has a record of compliance with his or her obligations under the Contract; and
(3) Contract and budget authority are available.
(d)
Applicability.
In accordance with section 555 of the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act of 1990, paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section apply to all contracts involving substantial rehabilitation. These paragraphs apply to all other Contracts executed on or after October, 3, 1984. An owner who had leased an assisted unit to an ineligible family consistent with the regulations in effect at the time will continue to lease the unit to that family. However, the Borrower must make the unit available for occupancy by an eligible family when the ineligible family vacates the unit.
(e)
Termination of assistance for failure to establish citizenship or eligible immigration status.
If an owner who is subject to paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section is required to terminate housing assistance payments for the family in accordance with part 5, subpart E, of this title because the owner determines that the entire family does not have U.S. citizenship or eligible immigration status, the owner may allow continued occupancy of the unit by the family without Section 8 assistance following the termination of assistance, or if the family constitutes a mixed family, as defined in part 5, subpart E, of this title, the owner shall
comply with the provisions of part 5, subpart E, of this title concerning assistance to mixed families, and deferral of termination of assistance.
(f) The regulations of 24 CFR part 5, subpart L (Protection for Victims of Domestic Violence, Dating Violence, Sexual Assault, or Stalking) apply to this section.

§ 886.329a
Preferences for occupancy by elderly families.
(a)
Election of preference for occupancy by elderly families
—(1)
Election by owners of eligible projects.
(i) An owner of a project involving substantial rehabilitation and assisted under this part (including a partially assisted project) that was originally designed primarily for occupancy by elderly families (an “eligible project”) may, at any time, elect to give preference to elderly families in selecting tenants for assisted, vacant units in the project, subject to the requirements of this section.
(ii) For purposes of this section, a project eligible for the preference provided by this section, and for which the owner makes an election to give preference in occupancy to elderly families is referred to as an “elderly project.” “Elderly families” refers to families whose heads of household, their spouses or sole members are 62 years or older.
(iii) An owner who elects to provide a preference to elderly families in accordance with this section is required to notify families on the waiting list who are not elderly that the election has been made and how the election may affect them if:
(A) The percentage of disabled families currently residing in the project who are neither elderly nor near-elderly (hereafter, collectively referred to as “non-elderly disabled families”) is equal to or exceeds the minimum required percentage of units established for the elderly project in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section, and therefore non-elderly families on the waiting list (including non-elderly disabled families) may be passed over for covered section 8 units; or
(B) The project, after making the calculation set forth in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, will have no units set aside for non-elderly disabled families.
(iv) An owner who elects to give a preference for elderly families in accordance with this section shall not remove an applicant from the project's waiting list solely on the basis of having made the election.
(2)
HUD approval of election not required.
(i) An owner is not required to solicit or obtain the approval of HUD before exercising the election of preference for occupancy provided in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. The owner, however, if challenged on the issue of eligibility of the project for the election provided in paragraph (a)(1) of this section must be able to support the project's eligibility through the production of all relevant documentation in the possession of the owner that pertains to the original design of the project.
(ii) The Department reserves the right at any time to review and make determinations regarding the accuracy of the identification of the project as an elderly project. The Department can make such determinations as a result of ongoing monitoring activities, or the conduct of complaint investigations under the Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 3601 through 3619), or compliance reviews and complaint investigations under section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794) and other applicable statutes.
(b)
Determining projects eligible for preference for occupancy by elderly families
—(1)
Evidence supporting project eligibility.
Evidence that a project assisted under this part (or portion of a project) was originally designed primarily for occupancy by elderly families, and is therefore eligible for the election of occupancy preference provided by this section, shall consist of at least one item from the sources (“primary” sources) listed in paragraph (b)(1)(i), or at least two items from the sources (“secondary” sources) listed in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section:
(i)
Primary sources.
Identification of the project (or portion of a project) as serving elderly (seniors) families in at
least one primary source such as: the application in response to the notice of funding availability; the terms of the notice of funding availability under which the application was solicited; the regulatory agreement; the loan commitment; the bid invitation; the owner's management plan, or any underwriting or financial document collected at or before loan closing;
or
(ii)
Secondary sources.
Two or more sources of evidence such as: lease records from the earliest two years of occupancy for which records are available showing that occupancy has been restricted primarily to households where the head, spouse or sole member is 62 years of age or older; evidence that services for elderly persons have been provided, such as services funded by the Older Americans Act, transportation to senior citizen centers, or programs coordinated with the Area Agency on Aging; project unit mix with more than fifty percent of efficiency and one-bedroom units [a secondary source particularly relevant to distinguishing elderly projects under the previous section 3(b) definition (in which disabled families were included in the definition of “elderly families”) from non-elderly projects and which in combination with other factors (such as the number of accessible units) may be useful in distinguishing projects for seniors from those serving the broader definition of “elderly families” which includes disabled families]; or any other relevant type of historical data, unless clearly contradicted by other comparable evidence.
(2)
Sources in conflict.
If a primary source establishes a design contrary to that established by the primary source upon which the owner would base support that the project is an eligible project (as defined in this section), the owner cannot make the election of preferences for elderly families as provided by this section based upon primary sources alone. In any case where primary sources do not provide
clear evidence
of original design of the project for occupancy primarily by elderly families, including those cases where primary sources conflict, secondary sources may be used to establish the use for which the project was originally designed.
(c)
Reservation of units in elderly projects for non-elderly disabled families.
The owner of an elderly project is required to reserve, at a minimum, the number of units specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section for occupancy by non-elderly disabled families.
(1)
Minimum number of units to be reserved for non-elderly disabled families.
The number of units in an elderly project required to be reserved for occupancy by non-elderly disabled families, shall be, at a minimum, the lesser of:
(i) The number of units equivalent to the higher of—
(A) The percentage of units assisted under this part in the elderly project that were occupied by non-elderly disabled families on October 28, 1992; and
(B) The percentage of units assisted under this part in the elderly project that were occupied by non-elderly disabled families upon January 1, 1992;
or
(ii) 10 percent of the number of units assisted under this part in the eligible project.
(2)
Option to reserve greater number of units for non-elderly disabled families.
The owner, at the owner's option, and at any time, may reserve a greater number of units for non-elderly disabled families than that provided for in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. The option to provide a greater number of units to non-elderly disabled families will not obligate the owner to always provide that greater number to non-elderly disabled families. The number of units required to be provided to non-elderly disabled families at any time in an elderly project is that number determined under paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
(d)
Secondary preferences.
An owner of an elderly project also may elect to establish secondary preferences in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph (d) of this section.
(1)
Preference for near-elderly disabled families in units reserved for elderly families.
If the owner of an elderly project determines, in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section, that there are an insufficient number of elderly families who have applied for occupancy to fill all the vacant units in the elderly project reserved for elderly families (that is, all units except those reserved
for the non-elderly disabled families as provided in paragraph (c) of this section), the owner may give preference for occupancy of such units to disabled families who are near-elderly families.
(2)
Preference for near-elderly disabled families in units reserved for non-elderly disabled families.
If the owner of an elderly project determines, in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section, that there are an insufficient number of non-elderly disabled families to fill all the vacant units in the elderly project reserved for non-elderly disabled families as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, the owner may give preference for occupancy of these units to disabled families who are near-elderly families.
(e)
Availability of units to families without regard to preference.
An owner shall make vacant units in an elderly project generally available to otherwise eligible families who apply for housing, without regard to the preferences and reservation of units provided in this section if either:
(1) The owner has adopted the secondary preferences and there are an insufficient number of families for whom elderly preference, reserve preference, and secondary preference has been given, to fill all the vacant units; or
(2) The owner has
not
adopted the secondary preferences and there are an insufficient number of families for whom elderly preference, and reserve preference has been given to fill all the vacant units.
(f)
Determination of insufficient number of applicants qualifying for preference.
To make a determination that there are an insufficient number of applicants who qualify for the preferences, including secondary preferences, provided by this section, the owner must:
(1) Conduct marketing in accordance with § 886.321(a) to attract applicants qualifying for the preferences and reservation of units set forth in this section; and
(2) Make a good faith effort to lease to applicants who qualify for the preferences provided in this section, including taking all feasible actions to fill vacancies by renting to such families.
(g)
Prohibition of evictions.
An owner may not evict a tenant without good cause, or require that a tenant vacate a unit, in whole or in part because of any reservation or preference provided in this section, or because of any action taken by the Secretary pursuant to subtitle D (sections 651 through 661) of title VI of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 (42 U.S.C. 13611 through 13620).

§ 886.330
Work write-ups and cost estimates.
(a)
HUD preparation of work write-ups.
If needed, a work write-up, including plans and specifications, will be made by HUD specifying necessary rehabilitation.
(b)
HUD specifies deficiencies and corrective action.
The work write-up will specify deficiencies noted by HUD and describe the manner in which the deficiencies are to be corrected, including minimum acceptable levels of workmanship and materials.
(c)
HUD preparation of cost estimates.
HUD shall perform or cause to be performed a cost estimate to complete rehabilitation. The cost of any necessary relocation, as determined by HUD as being necessary to expedite the rehabilitation and the estimated cost to the owner of maintaining project rents at the Section 8 level, as required by HUD prior to execution of the Contract, plus other costs allowable by HUD will be included in the cost estimate. The work write-up and cost estimate shall become part of the disposition package and will be used in determining the sales price of the project.

Agreement to enter into housing assistance payments contract.
(a)
Execution of agreement.
At the sales closing and prior to the Owner's commencement of any rehabilitation under this subpart, HUD will enter into an Agreement with the Owner which contains the following:
(1) A statement that the Owner agrees to rehabilitate the project unit(s) to make the unit(s) decent, safe, and sanitary in accordance with the work write-up, cost estimates, and this subpart.

(3) The Contract Rent which will be paid to the Owner once rehabilitation is completed, the Contract is executed, and the unit(s) is/are occupied by an eligible family.
(4) A date for final inspection of the unit(s) by HUD and the owner shall be specified. This date shall be as soon as possible after the deadline date specified pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
(5) The term of the contract.
(b)

§ 886.332
Rehabilitation period.
(a)
Immediate start of rehabilitation after sales closing.
After the execution of the Agreement and the sales closing, the owner shall immediately proceed with the rehabilitation work as provided in the Agreement. In the event the work is not immediately commenced, diligently continued, and/or completed by the deadline date stated on the Agreement, HUD will have the right, upon written notification to the owner, to rescind the Agreement and the sale, or take other appropriate action.
(b)
Extensions.
Although extensions of time may be granted by HUD upon a written request from the owner stating the grounds for the extension, no increases in Contract Rents shall be granted for delays.
(c)
Changes.
(1) The Owner must submit to HUD for approval any changes from the work specified in the Agreement which would materially reduce or alter the Owner's obligations or the quality or amenities of the project. HUD may condition its approval of such changes on a reduction of the Contract Rents. If changes are made without prior HUD approval, HUD will have the right to take action consistent with the purpose of this subpart, including action intended to preclude the owner from benefiting from a change in the work specified without HUD approval. HUD action shall include but is not limited to reducing the Contract Rents, requiring the owner to remedy the deficiency, or rescission of the Contract of Sale with reimbursement to the owner for the HUD determined reasonable cost of work items completed by the Owner and acceptable to HUD.
(2) Contract Rents for project units being rehabilitated shall not be increased except in accordance with this subpart. Should an increase in Contract Rents be necessitated by changes in local codes or ordinances or other unanticipated changes in work items which could not have been anticipated by HUD, an increase will only be approved if HUD approval is obtained prior to incorporation of any changes in the project.

(g)
Acceptance where defects or deficiencies reported.
If the projects unit(s) are not acceptable under paragraph (f) of this section, the following shall apply:

§ 886.334
Execution of housing assistance payments contract.
(a)
Time of execution.
Upon acceptance of the unit(s) by HUD pursuant to § 886.333(f), the contract will be executed first by the Owner and then by HUD. The effective date must be no earlier than the HUD inspection which provides the basis for unconditional acceptance.
(b)
Changes in initial contract rents during rehabilitation.
(1) The Contract Rents established pursuant to § 886.310 and 24 CFR part 290 will be the Contract Rents on the effective date of the Contract except under the following circumstances:
(i) When, during rehabilitation, work items are discovered which could not reasonably have been anticipated by HUD or are necessitated by an unforeseen change in local codes or ordinances; were not listed in the work write-up prepared by HUD but are deemed by HUD, in writing, to be necessary work; and will require additional expenditures which would make the rehabilitations infeasible at the Contract Rents established in the Agreement. Under these circumstances, HUD will:
(A) Approve a change order to the rehabilitation contract, or amend the work write-up if there is no rehabilitation contract, specifying the additional work to be accomplished and the additional cost for this work,
(B) Recompute the Contract Rents, within the limits specified in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, based upon the revised cost estimate, and
(C) Prepare and execute an amendment to the Agreement stating the additional work required and the revised Contract Rents.
(ii) When the actual cost of the rehabilitation performed is less than that estimated in the calculation of Contract Rents for the Agreement.
(iii) When, due to unforeseen factors, the actual certified relocation payments made by the Owner to temporarily relocated Families varies from the cost estimated by HUD.
(2) Should changes occur as specified in paragraph (b)(1) (ii) or (iii) (either an increase or decrease), HUD may recalculate the Contract Rents and amend the Contract or Agreement, as appropriate, to reflect the revised rents. The rents shall not be recalculated based on increased costs to maintain rents at the Section 8 level during the rehabilitation period.
(3) HUD must review and approve the Owner's certification that the rehabilitation costs and relocation costs are the actual costs incurred.
(4) In establishing the revised Contract Rents, HUD must determine that the resulting Contract Rents plus an applicable Utility Allowances do not exceed the Fair Market Rent or the exception rent provided in § 886.310 in effect at the time of execution of the Agreement.
(c)
Unleased unit(s).
At the time the contract is executed, HUD will provide a list of dwelling unit(s) leased as of the effective date of the Contract and a list of the unit(s) not so leased, if any, and shall determine whether or not the owner has met the obligations with respect to any unleased unit(s) and for which of those unit(s) vacancy payments will be made by HUD. The owner must indicate in writing either concurrence with this determination or disagreement reserving all rights to claim vacancy payments for the unleased unit(s) pursuant to the contract, without prejudice by reason of the owner's signing the contract.

(b)
Temporary relocation.
The following policies cover residential tenants who will not be required to move permanently but who must relocate temporarily for the project. Such tenants must be provided:
(1) Reimbursement for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the temporary relocation, including the cost of moving to and from the temporary housing and any increase in monthly rent/utility costs; and
(2) Appropriate advisory services, including reasonable advance written notice of:
(i) The date and approximate duration of the temporary relocation;
(ii) The location of the suitable, decent, safe, and sanitary dwelling to be made available for the temporary period;

A “displaced person” (defined in paragraph (g) of this section) must be provided relocation assistance at the levels described in, and in accordance with the requirements of, the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970 (URA) (42 U.S.C. 4601-4655) and implementing regulations at 49 CFR part 24. A “displaced person” shall be advised of his or her rights under the Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 3601-19), and, if the representative comparable replacement dwelling used to establish the amount of the replacement housing payment to be provided to a minority person is located in an area of minority concentration, such person also shall be given, if possible, referrals to comparable and suitable, decent, safe, and sanitary replacement dwellings not located in such areas.
(d)
Real property acquisition requirements.
The acquisition of real property for a project is subject to the URA and the requirements described in 49 CFR part 24, subpart B.
(e)
Appeals.
A person who disagrees with the owner's determination concerning whether the person qualifies as a “displaced person,” or the amount of relocation assistance for which the person is found to be eligible, may file a written appeal of that determination with the owner. A low-income person who is dissatisfied with the owner's determination on such appeal may submit a written request for review of that determination to the HUD Field Office.
(f)
Responsibility of owner.
(1) The owner shall certify (i.e., provide assurance of compliance, as required by 49 CFR part 24) that he or she will comply with the URA, the regulations at 49 CFR part 24, and the requirements of this section. The owner is responsible for such compliance notwithstanding
any third party's contractual obligation to the owner to comply with these provisions.
(2) The cost of providing required relocation assistance is an eligible project cost to the same extent and in the same manner as other project costs. Such costs may also be paid for with funds available from other sources.
(3) The owner shall maintain records in sufficient detail to demonstrate compliance with the provisions of this section. The owner shall maintain data on the race, ethnic, gender, and handicap status of displaced persons.
(g)
Definition of displaced person.

displaced person
means a person (family, individual, business, nonprofit organization, or farm) that moves from real property, or moves personal property from real property, permanently, as a direct result of acquisition, rehabilitation, or demolition for a project assisted under this part. This includes any permanent, involuntary move for an assisted project, including any permanent move from the real property that is made:
(i) After notice by the owner to move permanently from the property, if the move occurs on or after the date of the submission of the application to HUD;
(ii) Before submission of the application to HUD, if HUD determines that the displacement resulted directly from acquisition, rehabilitation, or demolition for the assisted project; or
(iii) By a tenant-occupant of a dwelling unit, if any one of the following three situations occurs:
(A) The tenant moves after the execution of the contract to provide Housing Assistance Payments, and the move occurs before the tenant is provided written notice offering him or her the opportunity to lease and occupy a suitable, decent, safe, and sanitary dwelling in the same building/complex, under reasonable terms and conditions, upon completion of the project. Such reasonable terms and conditions include a monthly rent and estimated average monthly utility costs that do not exceed the greater of:
(
1
) The tenant's monthly rent before execution of the Housing Assistance Payments Contract and estimated average monthly utility costs; or
(
2
) The total tenant payment, as determined under part 5 of this title, if the tenant is low-income, or 30 percent of gross household income, if the tenant is not low-income; or
(B) The tenant is required to relocate temporarily, does not return to the building/complex, and either:
(
1
) The tenant is not offered payment for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the temporary relocation, or
(
2
) Other conditions of the temporary relocation are not reasonable; or
(C) The tenant is required to move to another dwelling unit in the same building/complex but is not offered reimbursement for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the move, or other conditions of the move are not reasonable.
(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (g)(1) of this section, a person does not qualify as a “displaced person” (and is not eligible for relocation assistance under the URA or this section), if:
(i) The person has been evicted for serious or repeated violation of the terms and conditions of the lease or occupancy agreement, violation of applicable Federal, State or local law, or other good cause, and HUD determines that the eviction was not undertaken for the purpose of evading the obligation to provide relocation assistance;
(ii) The person moved into the property after the submission of the application and, before signing a lease and commencing occupancy, received written notice of the project, its possible impact on the person (e.g., the person may be displaced, temporarily relocated, or suffer a rent increase) and the fact that he or she would not qualify as a “displaced person” (or for assistance under this section) as a result of the project;
(iii) The person is ineligible under 49 CFR 24.2(g)(2); or
(iv) HUD determines that the person was not displaced as a direct result of acquisition, rehabilitation, or demolition for the project.
(3) The owner may ask HUD, at any time, to determine whether a displacement is or would be covered by this section.
(h)
Definition of initiation of negotiations.
For purposes of determining the formula for computing the replacement housing assistance to be provided to a residential tenant displaced as a direct result of privately undertaken rehabilitation, demolition, or acquisition of the real property, the term “initiation of negotiations” means the owner's execution of the Housing Assistance Payments Contract.

(c) In addition to following requirements in 24 CFR 5.2005(e), when a safe unit is not immediately available for a victim of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking who qualifies for an emergency transfer, covered housing providers must:
(1) Review the covered housing provider's existing inventory of units and determine when the next vacant unit may be available; and
(2) Provide a listing of nearby HUD subsidized rental properties, with or without preference for persons of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking, and contact information for the local HUD field office.
(d) Each year, covered housing providers must submit to HUD data on all emergency transfers requested under 24 CFR 5.2005(e), including data on the outcomes of such requests.

# Subpart A—Fair Market Rents
§ 888.111
Fair market rents for existing housing: Applicability.
(a) The fair market rents (FMRs) for existing housing are determined by HUD and are used in the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program (HCV program) (part 982 of this title), Section 8 project-based assistance programs and other programs requiring their use. In the HCV program, the FMRs are used to determine payment standard schedules. In the Section 8 project-based assistance programs, the FMRs are used to determine the maximum initial rent (at the beginning of the term of a housing assistance payments contract).
(b) Fair market rent means the rent, including the cost of utilities (except telephone), as established by HUD, pursuant to this subpart, for units of varying sizes (by number of bedrooms), that must be paid in the market area to rent privately owned, existing, decent, safe and sanitary rental housing of modest (non-luxury) nature with suitable amenities.
[64 FR 56911, Oct. 21, 1999, as amended at 81 FR 80580, Nov. 16, 2017]
§ 888.113
Fair market rents for existing housing: Methodology.
(a)
Basis for setting fair market rents.
Fair Market Rents (FMRs) are estimates of rent plus the cost of utilities, except telephone. FMRs are housing market-wide estimates of rents that provide opportunities to rent standard quality housing throughout the geographic area in which rental housing units are in competition. The level at which FMRs are set is expressed as a percentile point within the rent distribution of standard quality rental housing units in the FMR area. FMRs are set at the 40th percentile rent, the dollar amount below which the rent for 40 percent of standard quality rental housing units fall within the FMR area. The 40th percentile rent is drawn from the distribution of rents of all units within the FMR area that are occupied by recent movers. Adjustments are made to exclude public housing units and substandard units.
(b)
Setting FMRs at the 40th percentile rent.
Generally, HUD will set the FMRs at the 40th percentile rent, but no lower than 90 percent of the previous year's FMR for the FMR area.
(c)
Setting Small Area FMRs.
(1) HUD will set Small Area FMRs for certain metropolitan FMR areas for use in the administration of tenant-based assistance under the HCV program. HUD will establish the selection values used to determine those metropolitan areas through a
Federal Register
notice on November 16, 2016 and may update the selection values through a
Federal Register
notice, subject to public comment. The selection criteria used to determine those metropolitan areas are:
(i) The number of vouchers under lease in the metropolitan FMR area;
(ii) The percentage of the standard quality rental stock, within the metropolitan FMR area is in small areas (ZIP codes) where the Small Area FMR is more than 110 percent of the metropolitan FMR area;
(iii) The percentage of voucher families living in concentrated low income areas;
(iv) The percentage of voucher families living in concentrated low income areas relative to the percentage of all renters within these areas over the entire metropolitan area; and
(v) The vacancy rate for the metropolitan area.
(2) For purposes of determining applicability of Small Area FMRs to a metropolitan area, the term “concentrated low-income areas” means:
(i) Those census tracts in the metropolitan FMR area with a poverty rate of 25 percent or more; or
(ii) Any tract in the metropolitan FMR area where at least 50 percent of the households earn less than 60 percent of the area median income and are designated by HUD as Qualified Census Tracts in accordance with section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 42).
(3) If a metropolitan area meets the criteria of paragraph (c)(1) of this section, Small Area FMRs will apply to the metropolitan area and all PHAs administering HCV programs in that area
will be required to use Small Area FMRs. A PHA administering an HCV program in either a metropolitan area not subject to the application of Small Area FMRs or in a non-metropolitan area for which HUD publishes Small Area FMRs may choose to use Small Area FMRs after notification to HUD. A PHA that exercises this option in one metropolitan area or non-metropolitan county is not required to exercise this option in other metropolitan areas or non-metropolitan counties.
(4) HUD will designate Small Area FMR areas at the beginning of a Federal fiscal year, such designations will be permanent, and will make new area designations every 5 years thereafter as new data becomes available. HUD may suspend a Small Area FMR designation from a metropolitan area, or may temporarily exempt a PHA in a Small Area FMR metropolitan area from use of the Small Area FMRs, when HUD by notice makes a documented determination that such action is warranted. Actions that may serve as the basis of a suspension of Small Area FMRs are:
(i) A Presidentially declared disaster area that results in the loss of a substantial number of housing units;
(ii) A sudden influx of displaced households needing permanent housing; or
(iii) Other events as determined by the Secretary.
(5) Small Area FMRs only apply to tenant-based assistance under the HCV program. However, a PHA may elect to apply Small Area FMRs to project-based voucher (PBV) units at 24 CFR part 983 as provided in paragraph (h) of this section.
(d)
FMR areas.
FMR areas comprise metropolitan areas and nonmetropolitan counties and Small Area FMR areas as follows:
(1) Generally, FMR areas are metropolitan areas and nonmetropolitan counties. With several exceptions, the most current Office of Management and Budget (OMB) metropolitan area definitions of Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) are used because of their generally close correspondence with housing market area definitions. HUD may make exceptions to OMB definitions if the MSAs encompass areas that are larger than housing market areas. The counties deleted from the HUD-defined FMR areas in those cases are established as separate metropolitan county FMR areas. FMRs are established for all areas in the United States, the District of Columbia, and the Insular Areas of the United States.
(2) Small Area FMR areas are the U.S. Postal Service ZIP code areas within a designated metropolitan area.
(e)
Data sources.
(1) HUD uses the most accurate and current data available to develop the FMR estimates and may add other data sources as they are discovered and determined to be statistically valid. The following sources of survey data are used to develop the base-year FMR estimates:
(i) The most recent American Community Survey conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau, which provides statistically reliable rent data.
(ii) Locally collected survey data acquired through Address-Based Mail surveys or Random Digit Dialing (RDD) telephone survey data, based on a sampling procedure that uses computers to select statistically random samples of rental housing.
(iii) Statistically valid information, as determined by HUD, presented to HUD during the public comment and review period.
(2) Base-year recent mover adjusted FMRs are updated and trended to the midpoint of the program year they are to be effective using Consumer Price Index (CPI) data for rents and for utilities.
(f)
Unit size adjustments.
(1) For most areas the ratios developed incorporating the most recent American Community Survey data are applied to the two-bedroom FMR estimates to derive FMRs for other bedroom sizes. Exceptions to this procedure may be made for areas with local bedroom intervals below an acceptable range. To help the largest most difficult-to-house families find units, higher ratios than the actual market ratios may be used for three-bedroom and larger-size units.
(2) The FMR for single room occupancy housing is 75 percent of the FMR for a zero bedroom unit.
(g)
Manufactured home space rental.
The FMR for a manufactured home
space rental (for the HCV program under 24 CFR part 982) is 40 percent of the FMR for a two-bedroom unit for the metropolitan area or non-metropolitan county, as applicable. Small Area FMRs under paragraph (c) of this section do not apply to manufactured home space rentals.
(h)
Small Area FMRs and project-based vouchers.
Unless one of the following exceptions apply, Small Area FMRs do not apply to project-based vouchers regardless of whether HUD designates the metropolitan area or the PHA notifies HUD and implements the Small Area FMRs under paragraph (c)(3) of this section. (See 24 CFR 983.301(f)(3) for separate requirements regarding the applicability of exception payment standards based on Small Area FMRs to PBV projects.)
(1) Where the proposal or project selection date under 24 CFR 983.51(g) was on or before the effective dates of either or both the Small Area FMR designation/implementation and the PHA administrative policy, the PHA and owner may mutually agree to apply the Small Area FMR. The application of the Small Area FMRs must be prospective and consistent with the PHA Administrative Plan. The owner and PHA may not subsequently choose to revert back to the use of the metropolitan-wide or county-wide FMRs for the PBV project. If the rent to owner will increase as a result of the mutual agreement to apply the Small Area FMRs to the PBV project, the rent increase shall not be effective until the next annual anniversary of the HAP contract in accordance with 24 CFR 983.302(b).
(2) Where the proposal or project selection date under 24 CFR 983.51(g) was after the effective dates of both the Small Area FMR designation/implementation and the PHA administrative policy, the Small Area FMRs shall apply to the PBV project if the PHA Administrative Plan provides that Small Area FMRs are used for all future PBV projects. If the PHA chooses to implement this administrative policy, the Small Area FMRs must apply to all future PBV projects located within the same metropolitan area or non-metropolitan county where the Small Area FMRs are in effect for the PHA's HCV program. An owner and the PHA may not subsequently choose to apply the metropolitan area or county FMR to the project, regardless of whether the PHA subsequently changes its Administrative Plan to revert to the use of metropolitan-wide or county-wide FMR for future PBV projects.
(3) For purposes of this section, the term “effective date of the Small Area FMR designation” means:
(i) The date that HUD designated a metropolitan area as a Small Area FMR area; or
(ii) The date that HUD approved a PHA request to voluntarily opt to use Small Area FMRs for its HCV program, as applicable.
(4) For purposes of this section, the term “effective date of the PHA administrative policy” means the date the administrative policy was formally adopted as part of the PHA administrative plan by the PHA Board of Commissioners or other authorized PHA officials in accordance with § 982.54(a).
(i)
Transition of metropolitan areas previously subject to 50th percentile FMRs.
(1) A metropolitan area designated as 50th percentile FMR areas for which the 3-year period has not expired prior to January 17, 2017 shall transition out of 50th percentile FMRs as follows:
(i) A 50th percentile FMR area that is designated for Small Area FMRs in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section will transition to the Small Area FMRs upon the effective date of the Small Area FMR designation;
(ii) A 50th percentile metropolitan FMR area not designated as a Small Area FMRs in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section, will remain a 50th percentile FMR until the expiration of the three-year period, at which time the metropolitan area will revert to the standard FMR based on the 40th percentile rent for the metropolitan area.
(2) A PHA with jurisdiction in a 50th percentile FMR area that reverts to the standard 40th percentile FMR may request HUD approval of payment standard amounts based on the 50th percentile rent in accordance with 24 CFR 982.503(g).
(3) HUD will calculate the 50th percentile rents for certain metropolitan areas for this purpose. As is the case for determining 40th percentile rent,
the 50th percentile rent is drawn from the distribution of rents of all units that are occupied by recent movers and adjustments are made to exclude public housing units, newly built units and substandard units.

§ 888.115
Fair market rents for existing housing: Manner of publication.
(a)
Publication of FMRs.
FMRs will be published at least annually by HUD on the World Wide Web, or in any other manner specified by the Secretary. HUD will publish a notice announcing the publication of the FMRs in the
Federal Register,
to be effective October 1 of each year, and provide for a minimum of 30 days of public comments and requested for reevaluation of the FMRs in a jurisdiction. The FMRs will become effective no earlier than 30 days after the date the notice publishes in the
Federal Register
(
e.g.
, if HUD fails to publish FMRs 30 days before October 1, the effective date will be 30 days after publication), except for areas where HUD receives comments during the minimum 30-day comment period requesting reevaluation of the FMRs in a jurisdiction. After HUD reviews a request for reevaluation, HUD will post on the World Wide Web the final FMRs for the areas that have been reevaluated and publish a notice in the
Federal Register
announcing the publication and the effective date.
(b)
Changes in methodology.
HUD will publish for comment in the
Federal Register
a document proposing material changes in the method for estimating FMRs and shall respond to public comment on the proposed material changes in the subsequent
Federal Register
document announcing the availability of new FMRs based on the revised method for estimating FMRs.
[81 FR 80581, Nov. 16, 2016]

# Subpart B—Contract Rent Annual Adjustment Factors
§ 888.201
Purpose.
Automatic Annual Adjustment Factors are used to adjust rents under the Section 8 Housing Assistance Payments Program.
[44 FR 75383, Dec. 20, 1979]
§ 888.202
Manner of publication.
Adjustment Factors will be published in the
Federal Register
at least annually by Notice. Interim revisions may be published as market conditions indicate. In the case of revised factors applicable only to specific areas, the HUD Field Office will publish a notice appropriate to the limited scope of the revised factors (see § 888.204).
[42 FR 60508, Nov. 25, 1977, as amended at 44 FR 75383, Dec. 20, 1979; 47 FR 4252, Jan. 29, 1982]
§ 888.203
Use of contract rent automatic annual adjustment factors.
(a) To compute an adjustment to a Contract Rent, find the schedule of Automatic Annual Adjustment Factors for the appropriate Census Region or Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area—
(1) If the Contract Rent includes all utilities, use the factor shown on the basic schedule for the rent bracket within which the particular Contract Rent falls and for the applicable size of unit (by number of bedrooms).
(2) If the Contract Rent does not include all utilities but does include the highest cost utility, use the appropriate factor shown on the basic schedule.
(3) If the Contract Rent does not include any utilities or includes some utilities but not the highest cost utility, use the Annual Adjustment Factor for Contract Rent (Excluding Utilities).
(b) The adjusted monthly amount of the Contract Rent of a dwelling unit shall be determined by multiplying the Contract Rent in effect on the anniversary date of the contract by the applicable Automatic Annual Adjustment Factor (see paragraph (a) of this section) and rounding the result as follows:
(1) If the result contains a fractional dollar amount ranging from $0.01 to $0.49, round to the next lower whole dollar amount;
(2) If the result contains a fractional dollar amount ranging from $0.50 to
$0.99, round to the next higher whole dollar amount.
[42 FR 60508, Nov. 25, 1977, as amended at 44 FR 21769, Apr. 12, 1979; 47 FR 4252, Jan. 29, 1982; 59 FR 38564, July 29, 1994]
§ 888.204
Revision to the automatic annual adjustment factors.
If the application of the Annual Adjustment Factors results in rents that are substantially lower than rents charged for comparable units not receiving assistance under the U.S. Housing Act of 1937, in the area for which the factor was published or a portion thereof, and it is shown to HUD that the costs of operating comparable rental housing have increased at a substantially greater rate than the Adjustment Factors, the HUD Field Office will consider establishing separate or revised Automatic Annual Adjustment Factors for that particular area. Any request for revision of the factors must be accompanied by an identification of the area, its boundaries and evidence that the area constitutes the largest contiguous area in which substantially the same rent levels prevail. The HUD Field Office will publish appropriate notice of the establishment of any such revised Automatic Annual Adjustment Factors. These factors will remain in effect until superseded by the subsequent publication of Automatic Annual Adjustment Factors pursuant to § 888.202.
[44 FR 21769, Apr. 12, 1979]

# Subpart C—Retroactive Housing Assistance Payments for New Construction, Substantial Rehabilitation, State Finance Agencies, Section 515 Farmers Home Administration, Section 202 Elderly or Handicapped, and Special Allocations Projects

# Source:
56 FR 20084, May 1, 1991, unless otherwise noted.
§ 888.301
Purpose and scope.
(a)
Purpose.
This subpart describes the basic policies and procedures for the retroactive payment of Housing Assistance Payments to eligible project owners for the period from October 1, 1979 to May 31, 1991 and for one-time Contract Rent determinations for such eligible project owners.
(b)
Applicability.
This subpart applies to all project-based Section 8 Housing Assistance Payments Contracts under New Construction (Part 880); Substantial Rehabilitation (Part 881); State Finance Agencies (Part 883); and Section 515 Farmers Home Administration (Part 884). It also applies to those projects under Section 202 Elderly or Handicapped (Part 885) and Special Allocations (Part 886, Subparts A and C) whose Contract Rents are adjusted by use of the Annual Adjustment Factors (AAFs), as described in subpart B of this part.
(c)
Eligible project owners.
Project owners may be eligible for retroactive payments if, during the period from October 1, 1979 to May 31, 1991:
(1) The use of a comparability study by HUD (or the Contract Administrator), which was conducted as an independent limitation on the amount of rent adjustment that would have resulted from use of the applicable AAF, resulted in the reduction of the maximum monthly Contract Rents for units covered by a Housing Assistance Payments (HAP) contract or resulted in less than the maximum increase for those units than would otherwise be permitted by the AAF; or
(2) The HAP contract required a project owner to request annual rent adjustments, and the project owner certifies that a request was not made because of an anticipated reduction of the maximum monthly Contract Rents resulting from a comparability study.
§ 888.305
Amount of the retroactive Housing Assistance Payments.
(a)
Recalculating the total rent adjustment.
To establish the amount of the retroactive HAP payment for which a project owner meeting the criteria in § 888.301(c) is eligible, the total rent adjustment will be recalculated for the period from October 1, 1979 to May 31, 1991. For purposes of establishing the amount of the retroactive payment only, the total rent adjustment will be an amount equal to the Contract Rent, minus the amount of the Contract
Rent attributable to debt service, multiplied by the applicable AAF, for each year.
(b)
Calculating the retroactive payment.
HUD (or the Contract Administrator) will pay, as a retroactive Housing Assistance Payment, the amount, if any, by which the total rent adjustment, calculated under paragraph (a) of this section, exceeds the rent adjustments actually approved for the same time period, except that in no event will any payment be an amount less than 30 percent of the aggregate of the full Contract Rent multiplied by the applicable AAF, minus the sum of the rent adjustments actually approved for the same time period, adjusted by the average occupancy rate.
(c)
Occupancy rates.
(1) Retroactive payments will be made only for units that were occupied, based on average occupancy rate, including units qualifying for vacancy payments under 24 CFR 880.611, 881.611, 883.712, 884.106, 885.985, 886.109, or 886.309, during the time period from October 1, 1979 to May 31, 1991.
(2) When requesting retroactive payment, a project owner must, if the information is available, submit documentation of occupancy rates, on either an annual or monthly basis, for the same time period. The average occupancy rate will be based on these records. If records are unavailable for the full time period, HUD (or the Contract Administrator) will establish an average occupancy rate, to be used for the entire period, from the occupancy rate for the three years immediately preceding May 31, 1991.
(d)
Revised AAFs.
For any year during the period from October 1, 1979 to May 31, 1991, where a HUD field office published a revised Annual Adjustment Factor that replaced the applicable AAF for a specific locality under 24 CFR 888.204, the revised Annual Adjustment Factor, which applied to all projects in that area, will be used to recalculate the total rent adjustment under paragraph (a) of this section, and to establish the amount of the retroactive payments.
(e)
Special adjustments.
When calculating the total rent adjustments and establishing the amount of the retroactive payments under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, any special adjustments granted under 24 CFR 880.609(b), 881,609(b), 883.710(b), 884.109(c), 886.112(c), or 886.312(c) during the time period from October 1, 1979 to May 31, 1991, to reflect substantial general increases in real property taxes, assessments, utility rates, utilities not covered by regulated rates, or for special adjustments for any other purpose authorized by a waiver of the regulations, will be deducted from the Contract Rent before applying the AAF.
(f)
AAFs less than 1.0.
For any area where an AAF of less than 1.0 was published, a factor of 1.0 will be used to recalculate the total rent adjustments and to establish the amount of the retroactive payments under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.
(g)
Debt service.
(1) For purposes of this section, debt service includes principal, interest, and the mortgage insurance premium, if any.
(2) The monthly debt service set forth in the original mortgage documents for a project will be used to compute the debt service portion of the contract rent. The debt service will be compared to the spread of unit sizes included in the original HAP contract, and the amount used in the calculation will be based on the percentage of total rent potential of the various unit types.
(3) If, in some cases, HUD or the Contract Administrator cannot determine the debt service for a project, the project owner will be asked to provide documentation of the debt service. The project owner will be notified by the HUD Field Office or the Contract Administrator of the need for documentation of the debt service, and allowed 30 days to respond, or for such longer period as approved by HUD or the Contract Administrator on a case-by-case basis. Where the debt service is not available to HUD or the Contract Administrator and the owner is unable to provide the necessary information, retroactive payments cannot be made.
(h)
Applicable AAF.
The applicable AAF is the factor in effect on the anniversary date of the contract and appropriate for the area, for the size of the unit, and for the treatment of utilities; except where, for any year when AAFs were published after November 8 and
made retroactive to November 8, a project owner was given the option to choose the factor in effect on the anniversary date or the retroactive factor, the applicable AAF is the factor chosen by the project owner in that year.
(Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 2502-0042)
§ 888.310
Notice of eligibility requirements for retroactive payments.
(a)
Notice of eligibility requirements.
HUD (or the Contract Administrator) will give written notice to all current owners of projects of the eligibility requirements for retroactive payments. Eligible project owners must make a request for payment and a request for a one-time contract determination within 60 days from the date of the notice.
(b)
Request for payment.
(1) Owners eligible for retroactive payments under § 888.301(c) must submit a request for a calculation of the total rent adjustments and the establishment of the amount of the retroactive payment, as described in § 888.301 (a) and (b), and documentation of the occupancy rate for the period from October 1, 1979, to May 31, 1991, if available.
(2) Owners whose HAP contract requires a request to be made for annual rent adjustments must certify that a request was not made because of an anticipated reduction in the Contract Rents as a result of a comparability study. The certification must contain the year or years upon which the request for payment is based and a statement of the basis for the belief that rents would have been reduced.
(3) Retroactive payments will be made to owners over a three-year period as funds are appropriated for that purpose. When funds are available for payment, HUD will publish a
Federal Register
notice containing procedures for claiming payments.
(c)
Request for one-time contract rent determination.
When making a request for payment, eligible owners may also request a one-time contract rent determination, as described in § 888.320. Eligible owners may request a one-time contract rent determination even if they choose not to request retroactive payments, provided they are eligible for retroactive payments.
(d)
Transfer of ownership since October 1, 1979.
Eligible owners who request retroactive payments must certify that they are entitled to the entire amount of the payment. Any owner who is unable to certify must present documentation of an agreement between the current and former owners of the proportionate share of the payment for which each is eligible.
(Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 2502-0042)
§ 888.315
Restrictions on retroactive payments.
(a)
Restrictions on distribution of surplus cash.
Retroactive payments for HUD-insured projects and other projects subject to limitations on the distribution of surplus cash will be deposited, in the manner of Housing Assistance Payments, into the appropriate project account. The payments will be subject to HUD rules and procedures (or rules and procedures of other agencies, as appropriate), described in the applicable regulations and the HAP contracts, for distribution of surplus cash to project owners.
(b)
Replacement reserve.
Projects required by HUD regulations to maintain a reserve for replacement account and to adjust the annual payment to the account each year by the amount of the annual rent adjustment must deposit into the account the proportionate share of any retroactive payment received, in accordance with HUD regulations and the HAP contract.
(c)
Physical condition of HUD-insured or State-financed projects.
If the most recent physical inspection report of a HUD-insured project, completed by the mortgagee, or by HUD or the Contract Administrator if a mortgagee inspection is not present, shows significant deficiencies that have not been addressed to the satisfaction of HUD by the date the retroactive payment is deposited into the project account, the payment will not be made available for surplus cash distribution until the deficiencies are resolved or a plan for their resolution has been approved by HUD.
§ 888.320
One-time Contract Rent determination.
(a)
Determining the amount of the new Contract Rent.
Project owners eligible
for retroactive payments, as described in § 888.301(c), may request a one-time Contract Rent determination, to be effective as described in paragraph (c) of this section. The request for a one-time rent determination must be made when submitting a request for retroactive payments, as described in § 888.315. If no claim for retroactive payments is made, an owner may submit only the request for a one-time rent determination, provided the owner is eligible for retroactive payments. The new Contract Rent under this provision will be the greater of:
(1) The Contract Rent currently approved by HUD (or the Contract Administrator); or
(2) An amount equal to the applicable AAF multipled by the Contract Rent minus debt service, calculated for each year from October 1, 1979, to May 31, 1991.
(b)
Currently approved rent.
The Contract Rent currently approved by HUD (or the Contract Administrator) is the Contract Rent stated in the most recent amendment to the HAP Contract signed by both HUD (or the Contract Administrator) and the owner, or as shown on HUD Form 92458 (Rental Schedule) if the most recent amendment to the HAP Contract cannot be located.
(c)
Effective date of new Contract Rent.
The new Contract Rent, determined under paragraph (a) of this section, will be effective on May 31, 1991.

# Subpart D—Retroactive Housing Assistance Payments for Moderate Rehabilitation Projects

# Source:
56 FR 20085, May 1, 1991, unless otherwise noted.
§ 888.401
Purpose and scope.
(a)
Purpose.
This subpart describes the basic policies and procedures for the retroactive payment of Housing Assistance Payments to eligible project owners for the period from October 1, 1979 to May 31, 1991 and a one-time Contract Rent determination for such eligible project owners.
(b)
Applicability.
This subpart applies to all Moderate Rehabilitation projects under 24 CFR part 882, subparts D, E, and H.
(c)
Eligible project owners.
Project owners may be eligible for retroactive payments if, during the period from October 1, 1979 to May 31, 1991:
(1) The use of a comparability study by the Public Housing Agency (PHA) as contract administrator, which was conducted as an independent limitation on the amount of rent adjustment that would have resulted from use of the applicable AAF, resulted in the reduction of the maximum monthly Contract Rents for units covered by a Housing Assistance Payments (HAP) contract or resulted in less than the maximum increase for those units than would otherwise be permitted by the AAF; or
(2) The project owner certifies that a request for an annual rent adjustment was not made because of an anticipated reduction of the maximum monthly Contract Rents resulting from a comparability study.
§ 888.405
Amount of the retroactive Housing Assistance Payments.
(a)
Recalculating the total rent adjustment.
To establish the amount of the retroactive HAP payment for which a project owner meeting the criteria in § 888.401(c) is eligible, the total rent adjustment will be recalculated for the period from October 1, 1979 to May 31, 1991. Rents for that period will be recalculated, under the procedures set out in 24 CFR 882.410(a)(1), by applying the AAF for any affected year, and recalculating the rents for the remainder of the period as necessary. For each year thereafter, all rent adjustments made at the request of the owner at the time will be recalculated, under the procedures in 24 CFR 882.410(a)(1), to account for the new adjustments.
(b)
Calculating the retroactive payment.
HUD will pay, through the PHA, as a retroactive Housing Assistance Payment the amount, if any, by which the total rent adjustment, calculated under paragraph (a) of this section exceeds the rent adjustments actually approved for the same time period.
(c)
Occupancy rate.
(1) Retroactive payments will be made only for units that were occupied, based on average
occupancy rate, including units qualifying for vacancy payments under 24 CFR 882.411, during the time period from October 1, 1979 to May 31, 1991.
(2) When requesting a retroactive payment, a project owner must, if the information is available, submit documentation of occupancy rates, on either an annual or monthly basis, for the same time period. The average occupancy rate will be based on these records. If records are unavailable for the full time period, the PHA will establish an average occupancy rate, to be used for the entire period, from the occupancy rate for the three years immediately preceding May 31, 1991.
(d)
Revised AAFs.
For any year during the period from October 1, 1979 to May 31, 1991, where a HUD field office published a revised Annual Adjustment Factor that replaced the applicable AAF for a specific locality under 24 CFR 888.204, the revised Annual Adjustment Factor, which applied to all projects in that area, will be used to recalculate the total rent adjustment under paragraph (a) of this section, and to establish the amount of the retroactive payments.
(e)
Special adjustments.
When calculating the total rent adjustments and establishing the amount of the retroactive payments under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, any special adjustments granted under 24 CFR 882.410(a)(2) during the period from October 1, 1979 to May 31, 1991, to reflect substantial general increases in real property taxes, assessments, utility rates, utilities not covered by regulated rates, or for special adjustments for any other purpose authorized by a waiver of the regulations, will be deducted from the base rent before applying the AAF.
(f)
AAFs less than 1.0.
For any area where an AAF of less than 1.0 was published, a factor of 1.0 will be used to recalculate the total rent adjustments and to establish the amount of the retroactive payments under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.
(Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 2502-0042)
§ 888.410
Notice of eligibility requirements for retroactive payments.
(a)
Notice of eligibility requirements.
PHAs will give written notice to all current owners of projects, for which they are the Contract Administrators, of the eligibility requirements for retroactive payments. Eligible project owners must make a request for payment or a request for a one-time contract determination within 60 days from the date of the notice.
(b)
Request for payment.
(1) Owners eligible for retroactive payments under § 888.401(c) must submit a request for a calculation of the total rent adjustments and the establishment of the amount of the retroactive payment, as described in § 888.401 (a) and (b), and documentation of the occupancy rate for the period from October 1, 1979 to May 31, 1991, if available.
(2) Owners claiming eligibility under § 888.401(c)(2) must certify that a request was not made because of an anticipated reduction in the Contract Rents as a result of a comparability study. The certification must contain the year or years upon which the request for payment is based and a statement of the basis for the belief that rents would have been reduced.
(3) Retroactive payments will be made to owners over a three-year period as funds are appropriated for that purpose. When funds are available for payment, HUD will publish a
Federal Register
Notice containing procedures for claiming payments.
(c)
Request for one-time contract rent determination.
When making a request for payment, eligible owners may also request a one-time contract rent determination, as described in § 888.420. Eligible owners may request a one-time contract rent determination even if they choose to forgo receiving retroactive payments, provided they are eligible for retroactive payments.
(d)
Transfer of ownership since October 1, 1979.
Eligible owners requesting retroactive payments must certify that they are entitled to the entire amount of the payment. Any owner who is unable to certify must present documentation of an agreement between the current and former owners of the
proportionate share of the payment for which each is eligible.
(Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 2502-0042)
§ 888.415
Restrictions on retroactive payments.
(a)
Restrictions.
Retroactive payments are subject to all regulations, procedures, or restrictions that apply to Housing Assistance Payments.
(b)
Review of initial rents.
Before calculating the amount of any retroactive payment, the PHA, if directed by HUD, will review whether rents were excessive when initially set.
(c)
Physical condition of projects.
If the most recent physical inspection report by the PHA shows significant deficiencies that have not been addressed to the satisfaction of the PHA by the date the retroactive payment is deposited into the project account, the payment will not be made available until the deficiencies are resolved or a plan for their resolution has been approved by the PHA.
§ 888.420
One-time Contract Rent determination.
(a)
Determining the amount of the new Contract Rent.
Project owners eligible for retroactive payments, as described in § 888.401(c), may request a one-time Contract Rent determination, to be effective as described in paragraph (c) of this section. The request for a one-time rent determination must be made when submitting a request for retroactive payments, as described in § 888.415. If no claim for retroactive payments is made, an owner may submit only the request for a one-time rent determination, provided the owner is eligible for retroactive payments. The new Contract Rent under this provision will be the greater of:
(1) The Contract Rent currently approved by the PHA; or
(2) An amount equal to the Contract Rent as adjusted to May 31, 1991 under § 888.405(a).
(b)
Currently approved rent.
The Contract Rent currently approved by the PHA is the Contract Rent stated in the most recent amendment to the HAP Contract signed by both the PHA and the owner.
(c)
Effective date of new Contract Rent.
The new Contract Rent, determined under paragraph (a) of this section, will be effective on May 31, 1991.

# Subpart A—General Program Requirements
§ 891.100
Purpose and policy.
(a)
Purpose.
The Section 202 Program of Supportive Housing for the Elderly and the Section 811 Program of Supportive Housing for Persons with Disabilities provide Federal capital advances and project rental assistance under section 202 of the Housing Act of 1959 (12 U.S.C. 1701q) (section 202) and section 811 of the National Affordable Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 8013) (section 811), respectively, for housing projects serving elderly households and persons with disabilities. Section 202 projects shall provide a range of services that are tailored to the needs of the residents. Owners of Section 811 projects shall ensure that the residents are provided with any necessary supportive services that address their individual needs.
(b)
General policy
—(1)
Supportive Housing for the Elderly.
A capital advance and contract for project rental assistance provided under this program shall be used for the purposes described in Section 202 (12 U.S.C. 1701q(b)).
(2)
Supportive Housing for Persons with Disabilities.
A capital advance and contract for project rental assistance provided under this program shall be used for the purposes described in Section 811 (42 U.S.C. 8013(b)).
(c)
Use of capital advance funds.
No part of the funds reserved may be transferred by the Sponsor, except to the Owner caused to be formed by the Sponsor. This action must be accomplished prior to issuance of a commitment for capital advance funding.
(d)
Amendments.
Subject to the availability of funds, HUD may amend the amount of an approved capital advance only after initial closing has occurred.
§ 891.105
Definitions.
The following definitions apply, as appropriate, throughout this part. Other terms with definitions unique to the particular program are defined in §§ 891.205, 891.305, 891.505, and 891.805, as applicable.
Acquisition with or without repair
means the purchase of existing housing and related facilities.
Adjusted income
as defined in part 5, subpart F of subtitle A of this title.
Affiliated entities
means entities that the field office determines to be related to each other in such a manner that it is appropriate to treat them as a single entity. Such relationship shall include any identity of interest among such entities or their principals and the use by any otherwise unaffiliated entities of a single Sponsor or of Sponsors (or of a single Borrower or of Borrowers, as applicable) that have any identity of interest themselves or their principals.
Annual income
as defined in part 5, subpart F of subtitle A of this title. In the case of an individual residing in an intermediate care facility for the developmentally disabled that is assisted under title XIX of the Social Security Act and this part, the annual income of the individual shall exclude protected personal income as provided under that Act. For purposes of determining the total tenant payment, the income of such individuals shall be imputed to be the amount that the household would receive if assisted under title XVI of the Social Security Act.
Covered housing provider.
For the Supportive Housing for the Elderly and Persons with Disabilities Program, “covered housing provider,” as such term is used in HUD's regulations at 24 CFR part 5, subpart L (Protection for Victims of Domestic Violence, Dating Violence, Sexual Assault, or Stalking), refers to the owner (as defined in §§ 891.205 and 891.305).
Family
is defined in 24 CFR 5.403.
Gross rent
means contract rent plus any utility allowance.
Household (eligible household)
means an elderly or disabled household (as defined in §§ 891.205 or 891.305, respectively), as applicable, that meets the project occupancy requirements approved by HUD and, if the household occupies an assisted unit, meets the very low-income requirements described in § 813.102 of this chapter, as modified by the definition of annual income in this section.
Housing and related facilities
means rental housing structures constructed, rehabilitated, or acquired as permanent residences for use by elderly or disabled households, as applicable. The term includes necessary community space. Except for intermediate care facilities for individuals with developmental disabilities, this term does not include nursing homes, hospitals, intermediate care facilities, or transitional care facilities. For the Loans for the Elderly and Persons with Disabilities Program, see § 891.505.
Low-income families
shall have the same meaning provided in section 3(b)(2) of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437a).
National Sponsor
means a Sponsor that has one or more Section 202 or one or more Section 811 project(s) under reservation, construction, or management in two or more different HUD geographical regions.
Net family assets
is defined in § 5.603 of this title.
Operating costs
means HUD-approved expenses related to the provision of housing and includes:
(1) Administrative expenses, including salary and management expenses related to the provision of shelter and, in the case of the Section 202 Program, the coordination of services;
(2) Maintenance expenses, including routine and minor repairs and groundskeeping;
(3) Security expenses;
(4) Utilities expenses, including gas, oil, electricity, water, sewer, trash removal, and extermination services. The term “
operating costs
” excludes telephone services for households;
(5) Taxes and insurance;
(6) Allowances for reserves; and
(7) Allowances for services (in the Section 202 Program only).
Project rental assistance contract (PRAC)
means the contract entered into by the Owner and HUD setting forth the rights and duties of the parties with respect to the project and the payments under the PRAC.
Project rental assistance payment
means the payment made by HUD to the Owner for assisted units as provided in the PRAC. The payment is the difference between the total tenant payment and the HUD-approved per unit operating expenses except for expenses related to items not eligible under design and cost provisions. An additional payment is made to a household occupying an assisted unit when the utility allowance is greater than the total tenant payment. A project rental assistance payment, known as a “vacancy payment,” may be made to the Owner when an assisted unit is vacant, in accordance with the terms of the PRAC.
Rehabilitation
means the improvement of the condition of a property from deteriorated or substandard to good condition. Rehabilitation may vary in degree from the gutting and extensive reconstruction to the cure of substantial accumulation of deferred maintenance. Cosmetic improvements alone do not qualify as rehabilitation under this definition. Rehabilitation may also include renovation, alteration, or remodeling for the conversion or adaptation of structurally sound property to the design and condition required for use under this part, or the repair or replacement of major building systems or components in danger of failure. Improvement of an existing structure requires 15 percent or more of the estimated development cost to rehabilitate the project for a useful life of 40 years. The useful life period commences upon execution of a capital advance agreement.
Replacement reserve account
means a project account into which funds are deposited, which may be used only with the approval of the Secretary for repairs, replacement, capital improvements to the section 202 or section 811 units, and retrofitting to reduce the number of units as provided by 24 CFR 891.405(d).
Section 202
means section 202 of the Housing Act of 1959 (12 U.S.C. 1701q), as amended, or the Supportive Housing for the Elderly Program authorized by that section.
Section 811
means section 811 of the National Affordable Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 8013), as amended, or the Supportive Housing for Persons with Disabilities Program authorized by that section.
Single-asset entity,
for the purpose of this subpart, means an entity in which the mortgaged property is the only
asset of the owner, and the entity is the only owner of the property.
Start-up expenses
mean necessary costs (to plan a Section 202 or Section 811 project, as applicable) incurred by the Sponsor or Owner prior to initial closing.
Tenant rent
equals total tenant payment less utility allowance, if any.
Total tenant payment
means the monthly amount defined in, and determined in accordance with part 5, subpart F of subtitle A of this title.
Utility allowance
is defined in part 5, subpart F of this subtitle A of this title and is determined or approved by HUD.
Very low-income families
shall have the same meaning provided in section 3(b)(2) of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437a).
[61 FR 11956, Mar. 22, 1996, as amended at 66 FR 6225, Jan. 19, 2001; 66 FR 8175, Jan. 30, 2001; 68 FR 67320, Dec. 1, 2003; 70 FR 54209, Sept. 13, 2005; 77 FR 5675, Feb. 3, 2012; 78 FR 37112, June 20, 2013; 81 FR 80814, Nov. 16, 2016; 88 FR 9668, Feb. 14, 2023]
§ 891.110
Allocation of authority.
In accordance with 24 CFR part 791, the Assistant Secretary will separately allocate the amounts available for capital advances for the development of housing for elderly households and for disabled households, less amounts set aside by Congress for specific types of projects, and for amendments of fund reservations made in prior years, for technical assistance, and for other contracted services.
§ 891.115
Notice of funding availability.
Following an allocation of authority under § 891.110, HUD shall publish a separate Notice of Funding Availability (NOFA) for the Section 202 Program of Supportive Housing for the Elderly and for the Section 811 Program of Supportive Housing for Persons with Disabilities in the
Federal Register.
The NOFAs will contain specific information on how and when to apply for the available capital advance authority, the contents of the application, and the selection process.
§ 891.120
Project design and cost standards.
In addition to the special project standards described in §§ 891.210 and 891.310, as applicable, the following standards apply:
(a)
Property standards.
Projects under this part must comply with HUD Minimum Property Standards as set forth in 24 CFR part 200, subpart S.
(b)
Accessibility requirements.
Projects under this part must comply with the Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards (See 24 CFR 40.7 for availability), section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and HUD's implementing regulations (24 CFR part 8), and for new construction multifamily housing projects, the design and construction requirements of the Fair Housing Act and HUD's implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 100. For the Section 811 Program of Supportive Housing for Persons with Disabilities, see additional accessibility requirements in § 891.310(b).
(c)
Restrictions on amenities.
Projects must be modest in design. Amenities not eligible for HUD funding include atriums, bowling alleys, swimming pools, saunas, and jacuzzis. Sponsors may include certain excess amenities, but they must pay for them from sources other than the Section 202 or 811 capital advance. They must also pay for the continuing operating costs associated with any excess amenities from sources other than the Section 202 or 811 project rental assistance contract.
(d)
Smoke detectors.
Smoke detectors and alarm devices must be installed in accordance with standards and criteria acceptable to HUD for the protection of occupants in any dwelling or facility bedroom or other primary sleeping area.
(e) Projects under this part may have on their sites commercial facilities for the benefit of residents of the project and of the community in which the project is located, so long as the commercial facilities are not subsidized with funding under the supportive housing programs for the elderly or persons with disabilities. Such commercial facilities are considered public accommodations under Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act and
must be accessible under the requirements of that Act.
(f)
Broadband infrastructure.
Any new construction or substantial rehabilitation, as substantial rehabilitation is defined by 24 CFR 5.100, of a building with more than 4 rental units and funded by a grant awarded after January 19, 2017 must include installation of broadband infrastructure, as this term is also defined in 24 CFR 5.100, except where the owner determines and documents the determination that:
(1) The location of the new construction or substantial rehabilitation makes installation of broadband infrastructure infeasible;
(2) The cost of installing broadband infrastructure would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of its program or activity or in an undue financial burden; or
(3) The structure of the housing to be substantially rehabilitated makes installation of broadband infrastructure infeasible.
[61 FR 11956, Mar. 22, 1996, as amended at 68 FR 67320, Dec. 1, 2003; 73 FR 29985, May 23, 2008; 78 FR 37112, June 20, 2013; 81 FR 92638, Dec. 20, 2016; 82 FR 3623, Jan. 12, 2017]
§ 891.125
Site and neighborhood standards.
All sites must meet the following site and neighborhood requirements:
(a) The site must be adequate in size, exposure, and contour to accommodate the number and type of units proposed, and adequate utilities (water, sewer, gas, and electricity) and streets must be available to service the site.
(b) The site and neighborhood must be suitable from the standpoint of facilitating and furthering full compliance with the applicable provisions of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Fair Housing Act, Executive Order 11063 (27 FR 11527, 3 CFR, 1958-1963 Comp., p. 652); as amended by Executive Order 12259, (46 FR 1253, 3 CFR, 1980 Comp., p. 307)); section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and implementing HUD regulations.
(c) New construction sites must meet the following site and neighborhood requirements:
(1) The site must not be located in an area of minority concentration (or minority elderly concentration under the Section 202 Program) except as permitted under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, and must not be located in a racially mixed area if the project will cause a significant increase in the proportion of minority to nonminority residents (or minority elderly to nonminority elderly residents, under the Section 202 Program) in the area.
(2) A project may be located in an area of minority concentration (or minority elderly concentration, under the Section 202 Program) only if:
(i) Sufficient, comparable opportunities exist for housing for minority elderly households or minority disabled households, as applicable (or minority families, for projects funded under §§ 891.655 through 891.790), in the income range to be served by the proposed project, outside areas of minority concentration (see paragraph (c)(3) of this section for further guidance on this criterion); or
(ii) The project is necessary to meet overriding housing needs that cannot be met in that housing market area (see paragraph (c)(4) of this section for further guidance on this criterion).
(3)(i)
Sufficient
does not require that in every locality there be an equal number of assisted units within and outside of areas of minority concentration. Rather, application of this standard should produce a reasonable distribution of assisted units each year which over a period of several years will approach an appropriate balance of housing opportunities within and outside areas of minority concentration. An appropriate balance in any jurisdiction must be determined in light of local conditions affecting the range of housing choices available for very low-income minority elderly or disabled households, as applicable (or low-income minority families, for projects funded under §§ 891.655 through 891.790), and in relation to the racial mix of the locality's population.
(ii) Units may be considered to be
comparable opportunities
if they have the same household type (elderly or disabled, as applicable) and tenure type (owner/renter); require approximately the same total tenant payment; serve the same income group; are located in the same housing market; and are in standard condition.
(iii) Application of this sufficient, comparable opportunities standard involves assessing the overall impact of HUD-assisted housing on the availability of housing choices for very low-income minority elderly or disabled households, as applicable (or low-income minority families, for projects funded under §§ 891.655 through 891.790), in and outside areas of minority concentration, and must take into account the extent to which the following factors are present, along with any other factor relevant to housing choice:
(A) A significant number of assisted housing units are available outside areas of minority concentration.
(B) There is significant integration of assisted housing projects constructed or rehabilitated in the past ten years, relative to the racial mix of the eligible population.
(C) There are racially integrated neighborhoods in the locality.
(D) Programs are operated by the locality to assist minority elderly or disabled households, as applicable (or minority families, for projects funded under §§ 891.655 through 891.790), that wish to find housing outside areas of minority concentration.
(E) Minority elderly or disabled households, as applicable (or minority families, for projects funded under §§ 891.655 through 891.790), have benefitted from local activities (e.g., acquisition and write-down of sites, tax relief programs for homeowners, acquisitions of units for use as assisted housing units) undertaken to expand choice for minority households (or families) outside of areas of minority concentration.
(F) A significant proportion of minority elderly or disabled households, as applicable (or minority households, for projects funded under §§ 891.655 through 891.790), have been successful in finding units in nonminority areas under the Section 8 Housing Voucher programs.
(G) Comparable housing opportunities have been made available outside areas of minority concentration through other programs.
(4) Application of the
overriding housing needs
criterion, for example, permits approval of sites that are an integral part of an overall local strategy for the preservation or restoration of the immediate neighborhood and of sites in a neighborhood experiencing significant private investment that is demonstrably changing the economic character of the area (a “revitalizing area”). An
overriding housing need,
however, may not serve as the basis for determining that a site is acceptable if the only reason the need cannot otherwise be feasibly met is that discrimination on the basis of race, color, creed, sex, or national origin renders sites outside areas of minority concentration unavailable, or if the use of this standard in recent years has had the effect of circumventing the obligation to provide housing choice.
(d) The neighborhood must not be one that is seriously detrimental to family life or in which substandard dwellings or other undesirable conditions predominate, unless there is actively in progress a concerted program to remedy the undesirable conditions.

§ 891.140
Development cost limits.
(a) HUD shall use the development cost limits, established by Notice in the
Federal Register
and adjusted by locality, to calculate the fund reservation amount of the capital advance to be made available to individual Owners. Owners that incur actual development costs that are less than the amount of the initial fund reservation shall be entitled to retain 50 percent of the savings in a Replacement Reserve Account. Such percentage shall be increased to 75 percent for Owners that add energy efficiency features.

However, under the Section 811 Program and for projects funded under §§ 891.655 through 891.790, the operating cost standard for group homes shall be based on the number of residents. HUD may adjust the operating cost standard applicable to an approved project to reflect such factors as differences in costs based on location within the field office jurisdiction. The operating cost standard will be used to determine the amount of the project assistance initially reserved for a project.

(3) At the time of PRAC execution, the Owner must submit to HUD a list of leased and unleased assisted units (or in the case of a group home, leased and unleased residential spaces) with a justification for the unleased units or residential spaces, in order to qualify for vacancy payments for the unleased units or residential spaces.
(b)
Management and maintenance.
The Owner is responsible for all management functions. These functions include selection and admission of tenants, required reexaminations of incomes for households occupying assisted units or residential spaces, collection of tenant payments, termination of tenancy and eviction, and all repair and maintenance functions (including ordinary and extraordinary maintenance and replacement of capital items). All functions must be performed in compliance with equal opportunity requirements.
(c)
Contracting for services.
(1) With HUD approval, the Owner may contract with a private or public entity for performance of the services or duties required in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section. However, such an arrangement does not relieve the Owner of responsibility for these services and duties. All such contracts are subject to the restrictions governing prohibited contractual relationships described in § 891.130. (These prohibitions do not extend to management contracts entered into by the Owner with the Sponsor or its nonprofit affiliate.)
(2) Consistent with the objectives of Executive Order No. 11625 (36 FR 19967, 3 CFR, 1971-1975 Comp., p. 616; as amended by Executive Order No. 12007 (42 FR 42839, 3 CFR, 1977 Comp., p. 139)); Executive Order No. 12432 (48 FR 32551, 3 CFR, 1983 Comp., p. 198); and Executive Order No. 12138 (44 FR 29637, 3 CFR, 1979 Comp., p. 393; as amended by Executive Order No. 12608 (52 FR 34617, 3 CFR, 1987 Comp., p. 245)), the Owner will promote awareness and participation of minority and women's business enterprises in contracting and procurement activities.
(d)
Submission of financial and operating statements.
The Owner must submit to HUD:
(1) Within 60 days after the end of each fiscal year of project operations, financial statements for the project audited by an independent public accountant and in the form required by HUD; and
(2) Other statements regarding project operation, financial conditions and occupancy as HUD may require to administer the PRAC and to monitor project operations.
(e)
Use of project funds.
The Owner shall maintain a separate interest bearing project fund account in a depository or depositories which are members of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund and shall deposit all tenant payments, charges, income and revenues arising from project operation or ownership to this account. All project funds are to be deposited in Federally insured accounts. All balances shall be fully insured at all times, to the maximum extent possible. Project funds must be used for the operation of the project (including required insurance coverage), and to make required deposits to the replacement reserve under § 891.405, in accordance with HUD-approved budget. Any remaining project funds in the project funds account (including earned interest) following the expiration of the fiscal year shall be deposited in a Federally-insured residual receipts account within 60 days following the end of the fiscal year. Withdrawals from this account may be made only for project purposes and with the approval of HUD. If there are funds remaining in the residual receipts account when the mortgage is satisfied, such funds shall be returned to HUD.
(f)
Reports.
The Owner shall submit such reports as HUD may prescribe to demonstrate compliance with applicable civil rights and equal opportunity requirements. See § 891.410(a).
(Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 2502-0470)
§ 891.405

Establishment of reserve.
The Owner shall establish and maintain a replacement reserve to aid in funding extraordinary maintenance and repair and replacement of capital items.
(b)
Deposits to reserve.
The Owner shall make monthly deposits to the replacement reserve in an amount determined by HUD.

Level of reserve.
The reserve must be built up to and maintained at a level determined by HUD to be sufficient to meet projected requirements. Should the reserve reach that level, the amount of the deposit to the reserve may be reduced with the approval of HUD.
(d)
Administration of reserve.
Replacement reserve funds must be deposited with HUD or in a Federally-insured depository in an interest-bearing account(s) whose balances(s) are fully insured at all times. All earnings including interest on the reserve must be added to the reserve. Funds may be drawn from the reserve and used only in accordance with HUD guidelines and with the approval of, or as directed by, HUD. With HUD approval, reserves may be used to reduce the number of dwelling units, provided that the purpose for the reduction is the retrofitting of obsolete or unmarketable units.

§ 891.410
Selection and admission of tenants.
(a)
Written procedures.
The Owner shall adopt written tenant selection procedures that ensure nondiscrimination in the selection of tenants and that are consistent with the purpose of improving housing opportunities for very low-income elderly persons and persons with disabilities (as applicable); and reasonably related to program eligibility and an applicant's ability to perform the obligations of the lease. Owners shall promptly inform in writing any rejected applicant of the grounds for any rejection. Additionally, Owners shall maintain a written, chronological waiting list showing the name, race, gender, ethnicity, and date of each person applying for the program.
(b)
Application for admission.
The Owner must accept applications for admission to the project in the form prescribed by HUD, and (under the Section 202 Program only) is obligated to confirm all information provided by applicant families on the application. Applicant households applying for assisted units (or residential spaces in a group home) must complete a certification of eligibility as part of the application for admission. Applicant households must meet the disclosure and verification requirements for Social Security Numbers, as provided by 24 CFR part 5, subpart B. Applicant families must sign and submit consent forms for the obtaining of wage and claim information from State Wage Information Collection Agencies, as provided by 24 CFR part 5, subpart B. Both the Owner and the applicant household must complete and sign the application for admission. On request, the Owner must furnish copies of all applications for admission to HUD.
(c)
Determination of eligibility and selection of tenants.
(1) The Owner is responsible for determining whether applicants are eligible for admission and for the selection of households. To be eligible for admission, an applicant must be an elderly person or a person with disabilities, as applicable (as defined in §§ 891.205 and 891.305, respectively); must meet the disclosure and verification requirements for Social Security Numbers, as provided by 24 CFR part 5, subpart B; must sign and submit consent forms for the obtaining of wage and claim information from State Wage Information Collection Agencies, as provided by 24 CFR part 5, subpart B; and must be a very low-income family, as defined in § 891.105.
(2) Under the Section 811 Program:
(i) In order to be eligible for admission, the applicant must also meet any project occupancy requirements approved by HUD.
(ii) Owners shall make selections in a nondiscriminatory manner without regard to considerations such as race, religion, color, sex, national origin, familial status, or disability. An Owner may, with the approval of the Secretary, limit occupancy within housing developed under this part 891 to persons with disabilities who have similar disabilities and require a similar set of supportive services in a supportive housing environment. However, the Owner must permit occupancy by any qualified person with a disability who could benefit from the housing and/or services provided regardless of the person's disability.
(d)
Unit assignment.
If the Owner determines that the household is eligible and is otherwise acceptable and units (or residential spaces in a group home) are available, the Owner will assign the household a unit or residential space in a group home. If the household will occupy an assisted unit, the Owner will assign the household a unit of the appropriate size in accordance with
HUD's general occupancy guidelines. If no suitable unit (or residential space in a group home) is available, the Owner will place the household on a waiting list for the project and notify the household when a suitable unit or residential space may become available. If the waiting list is so long that the applicant would not be likely to be admitted for the next 12 months, the Owner may advise the applicant that no additional applications for admission are being considered for that reason.
(e)
Ineligibility determination.
If the Owner determines that an applicant is ineligible for admission or the Owner is not selecting the applicant for other reasons, the Owner will promptly notify the applicant in writing of the determination, the reasons for the determination, and the applicant's right to request a meeting to review the rejection, in accordance with HUD requirements. The review, if requested, may not be conducted by a member of the Owner's staff who made the initial decision to reject the applicant. The applicant may also exercise other rights (e.g., rights granted under Federal, State or local civil rights laws) if the applicant believes he or she is being discriminated against on a prohibited basis.
(f)
Records.
Records on applicants and approved eligible households, which provide racial, ethnic, gender and place of previous residency data required by HUD, must be retained for three years. See § 891.410(a).
(g)
Reexamination of household family income and composition
—(1)
Regular reexaminations.
The Owner must reexamine the income and composition of the household at least every 12 months. Upon verification of the information, the Owner must make appropriate adjustments in the total tenant payment in accordance with § 5.657 of this title and must adjust the tenant rent. The Owner must also request an appropriate adjustment to the project rental assistance payment. Further, the Owner must determine whether the household's unit size is still appropriate and must carry out any unit transfer in accordance with HUD standards. At the time of reexamination, the Owner must require the household to meet the disclosure and verification requirements for Social Security Numbers, as provided by 24 CFR part 5, subpart B. For requirements regarding the signing and submitting of consent forms by families for obtaining wage and claim information from State Wage Information Collection Agencies, see 24 CFR part 5, subpart B.
(2)
Interim reexaminations.
The household must comply with the provisions in § 5.657 of this title regarding interim reporting of changes in income. If the Owner receives information concerning a change in the household's income or other circumstances between regularly scheduled reexaminations, the Owner must consult with the household and make any adjustments determined to be appropriate. See 24 CFR part 5, subpart B, for the requirements for the disclosure and verification of Social Security Number at interim reexaminations involving new household members. For requirements regarding the signing and submitting of consent forms by families for obtaining wage and claim information from State Wage Information Collection Agencies, see 24 CFR part 5, subpart B. Any change in the household's income or other circumstances that result in an adjustment in the total tenant payment, tenant rent, or project rental assistance payment must be verified.
(3)
Continuation of project rental assistance payment.
(i) A household shall remain eligible for subsidy until the total tenant payment equals or exceeds the gross rent (or a pro rata share of the gross rent in a group home). The termination of subsidy eligibility will not affect the household's other rights under its lease, nor will the unit or residential space be removed from the PRAC. Project rental assistance payments may be resumed if, as a result of changes in income, rent, or other relevant circumstances during the term of the PRAC, the household meets the income eligibility requirements of § 5.657 of this title (as modified in § 891.105) and project rental assistance is available for the unit or residential space under the terms of the PRAC. The household will not be required to establish its eligibility for admission to the
project under the remaining requirements of paragraph (c) of this section.
(ii) A household's eligibility for project rental assistance payment may be terminated in accordance with HUD requirements for such reasons as failure to submit requested verification information, including information related to disclosure and verification of Social Security Numbers, as provided by 24 CFR part 5, subpart B or failure to sign and submit consent forms for the obtaining of wage and claim information from State Wage Information Collection Agencies (as provided by 24 CFR part 5, subpart B).
(4)
Streamlined income determination.
An owner may elect to follow the provisions of 24 CFR 5.657(d).

§ 891.420
Overcrowded and underoccupied units.
If the Owner determines that because of change in household size, an assisted unit is smaller than appropriate for the eligible household to which it is leased, or that the assisted unit is larger than appropriate, project rental assistance payment with respect to the unit will not be reduced or terminated until the eligible household has been relocated to an appropriate alternate unit. If possible, the Owner will, as promptly as possible, offer the household an appropriate alternate unit. The Owner may receive vacancy payments for the vacated unit if the Owner complies with the requirements of § 891.445.
§ 891.425

§ 891.435
Security deposits.
This section shall apply to capital advances under the Section 202 Program and the Section 811 Program, as well as loans financed under subpart E of this part. For loans financed under subpart E of this part, the requirements in § 891.635 also apply.

Collection of security deposits.
At the time of the initial execution of the lease, the Owner (or Borrower, as applicable) will require each household (or family, as applicable) occupying an assisted unit or residential space in a group home to pay a security deposit in an amount equal to one month's tenant rent or $50, whichever is greater. The household (or family) is expected to pay the security deposit from its own resources or other available public or private resources. The Owner (or Borrower) may collect the security deposit on an installment basis.
(b)
Security deposit provisions applicable to units
—(1)
Administration of security deposit.
The Owner (or Borrower, as applicable) must place the security deposits in a segregated interest-bearing account. The amount of the segregated, interest-bearing account maintained by the Owner (or Borrower) must at all times equal the total amount collected from the households (or families, as applicable) then in occupancy plus any accrued interest and less allowable administrative cost adjustments. The Owner (or Borrower) must comply with any applicable State and local laws concerning interest payments on security deposits.
(2)
Household (or family, as applicable) notification requirement.
In order to be considered for the refund of the security deposit, a household (or family) must provide the Owner (or Borrower, as applicable) with a forwarding address or arrange to pick up the refund.
(3)
Use of security deposit.
The Owner (or Borrower, as applicable), subject to State and local law and the requirements of paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(3) of this section, may use the household's (or family's, as applicable) security deposit balance as reimbursement for any unpaid amounts that the household (or family) owes under the lease. Within 30 days (or shorter time if required by State or local law) after receiving notification under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the Owner (or Borrower) must:
(i) Refund to a household (or family) that does not owe any amount under the lease the full amount of the household's (or family's) security deposit balance;
(ii) Provide to a household (or family) owing amounts under the lease a list itemizing each amount, along with a statement of the household's (or family's) rights under State and local law. If the amount that the Owner (or Borrower) claims is owed by the household (or family) is less than the amount of the household's (or family's) security deposit balance, the Owner (or Borrower) must refund the excess balance to the household (or family). If the
Owner (or Borrower) fails to provide the list, the household (or family) will be entitled to the refund of the full amount of the household's (or family's) security deposit balance.
(4)
Disagreements.
If a disagreement arises concerning reimbursement of the security deposit, the household (or family, if applicable) will have the right to present objections to the Owner (or Borrower, if applicable) in an informal meeting. The Owner (or Borrower) must keep a record of any disagreements and meetings in a tenant file for inspection by HUD. The procedures of this paragraph do not preclude the household (or family) from exercising its rights under State or local law.
(5)
Decedent's interest in security deposit.
Upon the death of a member of a household (or family, as applicable), the decedent's interest, if any, in the security deposit will be governed by State or local law.
(c)
Reimbursement by HUD for assisted units.
If the household's (or family's, if applicable) security deposit balance is insufficient to reimburse the Owner (or Borrower, if applicable) for any amount that the household (or family) owes under the lease for an assisted unit or residential space, and the Owner (or Borrower) has provided the household (or family) with the list required by paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section, the Owner (or Borrower) may claim reimbursement from HUD for an amount not to exceed the lesser of:
(1) The amount owed the Owner (or Borrower); or
(2) One month's per unit operating cost (or contract rent, if applicable), minus the amount of the household's (or family's) security deposit balance. Any reimbursement under this section will be applied first toward any unpaid tenant rent due under the lease. No reimbursement may be claimed for any unpaid tenant rent for the period after termination of the tenancy. The Owner (or Borrower) may be eligible for vacancy payments following a vacancy in accordance with the requirements of § 891.445 (or §§ 891.650 or 891.790, as applicable).

§ 891.440
Adjustment of utility allowances.
This section shall apply to projects funded under the Section 202 Program, to independent living complexes funded under Section 811 Program, and to projects financed with loans under subpart E of this part. The Owner (or Borrower, as applicable) must submit an analysis of any utility allowances applicable. Such data as changes in utility rates and other facts affecting utility consumption must be provided as part of this analysis to permit appropriate adjustments in the utility allowances for assisted units. In addition, when utility rate changes would result in a cumulative increase of 10 percent or more in the most recently approved utility allowances, the Owner (or Borrower) must advise HUD and request approval of new utility allowances. Whenever a utility allowance for an assisted unit is adjusted, the Owner (or Borrower) will promptly notify affected households (or families, as applicable) and make a corresponding adjustment of the tenant rent and the amount of the project rental assistance payment (or housing or project assistance payment, as applicable).

In the case of acquisition with or without moderate rehabilitation, at least three years must have elapsed from the later of the date of completion of the project or the beginning of occupancy to the date of the application for a Section 202 fund reservation. Except for intermediate care facilities for the mentally retarded and individuals with related conditions, this term does not include nursing homes, hospitals, intermediate care facilities, or transitional care facilities.
Nonelderly handicapped family
means a handicapped family in which the head of the family (and spouse, if any) is less than 62 years of age at the time of the family's initial occupancy of a project.
Section 8 Program

§ 891.510
Displacement, relocation, and real property acquisition.
(a)
Minimizing displacement.
Consistent with the other goals and objectives of subpart E of this part, Sponsors and Borrowers shall assure that they have taken all reasonable steps to minimize the displacement of persons (families, individuals, businesses, nonprofit organizations, and farms) as a result of a project assisted under subpart E of this part.
(b)
Relocation assistance for displaced persons.
A displaced person (defined in paragraph (f) of this section) must be provided relocation assistance at the levels described in, and in accordance with the requirements of the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970, as amended (URA) (42 U.S.C. 4201-4655), as implemented by 49 CFR part 24. A displaced person shall be advised of his or her rights under the Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 3601-3619). If the comparable replacement dwellings are located in areas of minority concentration, minority persons also must be given, if possible, referrals to suitable, decent, safe, and sanitary replacement dwellings not located in such areas.
(c)
Real property acquisition requirements.
The acquisition of real property for a project is subject to the URA and the requirements described in 49 CFR part 24, subpart B.
(d)
Appeals.
A person who disagrees with the Sponsor's/Borrower's determination concerning whether the person qualifies as a
“displaced person,”
or with the amount of relocation assistance for which the person is eligible, may file a written appeal of that determination with the Sponsor/Borrower. A low-income person who is dissatisfied with the Sponsor's/Borrower's determination on his or her appeal may submit a written request for review of that determination to the HUD field office.
(e)
Responsibility of Sponsor/Borrower.
The Sponsor/Borrower shall certify that it will comply (i.e., provide assurance of compliance, as required by 49 CFR part 24) with the URA, the regulations at 49 CFR part 24, and the requirements of this section, and shall ensure such compliance notwithstanding any third party's contractual obligation to comply with these provisions. The Sponsor/Borrower shall maintain records in sufficient detail to demonstrate compliance with the provisions of this section. The Sponsor/Borrower shall maintain data on the race, ethnic, gender, and handicap status of displaced persons.
(f)
Definition of a displaced person.
(1) For purposes of this section, the term
displaced person
means a person (family, individual, business, nonprofit organization, or farm) that moves from real property, or moves personal property from real property, permanently, as a direct result of acquisition, rehabilitation, or demolition for a project assisted under this part. This includes any permanent, involuntary move for
an assisted project including any permanent move from the real property that is made:
(i) After notice by the Sponsor/Borrower to move permanently from the property if the move occurs on or after:
(A) The date of the submission of an application to HUD that is later approved, if the Sponsor has control of an appropriate site; or
(B) The date that the Sponsor obtains control of an approvable site, if such control is obtained after the submission of an application to HUD:
(ii) Before the date described in paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section, if the Sponsor, Borrower or HUD determines that the displacement resulted directly from acquisition, rehabilitation, or demolition for the project;
(iii) By a tenant-occupant of a dwelling unit, if any one of the following three situations occurs;
(A) The tenant moves after execution of the Agreement between the Sponsor/Borrower and HUD, and the move occurs before the tenant is provided written notice offering him or her the opportunity to lease and occupy a suitable, decent, safe, and sanitary dwelling in the same building/complex upon completion of the project under reasonable terms and conditions. Such reasonable terms and conditions include a monthly rent and estimated average monthly utility costs that do not exceed the greater of:
(
1
) The tenant's monthly rent and estimated average monthly utility costs before the Agreement; or
(
2
) The total tenant payment, as determined under 24 CFR 5.628, if the tenant is low-income, or 30 percent of gross household income, if the tenant is not low-income; or
(B) The tenant is required to relocate temporarily, does not return to the building/complex, and either:
(
1
) The tenant is not offered payment for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the temporary relocation; or
(
2
) Other conditions of the temporary relocation are not reasonable; or
(C) The tenant is required to move to another dwelling in the same building/complex but is not offered reimbursement for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the move, or other conditions of the move are not reasonable.
(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (f)(1) of this section, however, a person does not qualify as a “displaced person” (and is not eligible for relocation assistance at URA levels), if:
(i) The person has been evicted for cause based upon a serious or repeated violation of the terms and conditions of the lease or occupancy agreement, violation of applicable Federal, State, or local law, or other good cause, and HUD determines that the eviction was not undertaken for the purpose of evading the obligation to provide relocation assistance.
(ii) The person moved into the property after the submission of the application and, before signing a lease and commencing occupancy, was provided written notice of the project, its possible impact on the person (e.g., displacement, temporary relocation or a rent increase) and the fact that he or she will not qualify as a displaced person as a result of the project;
(iii) The person is ineligible under 49 CFR 24.2(g)(2); or
(iv) HUD determines that the person was not displaced as a direct result of acquisition, rehabilitation, or demolition for the project;
(3) The Sponsor/Borrower may request, at any time, a HUD determination of whether a displacement is or would be covered by this section.

# Section 202 Projects for the Elderly or Handicapped—Section 8 Assistance
§ 891.520
Definitions applicable to 202/8 projects.
The following definitions apply to projects for eligible families receiving assistance under section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 in
addition to reservations under section 202 of the Housing Act of 1959 (202/8 projects):
Adjusted income
as defined in part 5, subpart F of subtitle A of this title.
Assisted unit
means a dwelling unit eligible for assistance under a HAP contract.
Contract rent
means the total amount of rent specified in the HAP contract as payable by HUD and the tenant to the Borrower for an assisted unit.
Family (eligible family)
means an elderly or handicapped family that meets the project occupancy requirements approved by HUD and, if the family occupies an assisted unit, meets the requirements described in 24 CFR 5.403.
HAP contract (housing assistance payments contract)
means the contract entered into by the Borrower and HUD setting forth the rights and duties of the parties with respect to the project and the payments under the HAP contract.
Housing assistance payment
means the payment made by HUD to the Borrower for assisted units as provided in the HAP contract. The payment is the difference between the contract rent and the tenant rent. An additional payment is made to a family occupying an assisted unit when the utility allowance is greater than the total tenant payment. A housing assistance payment, known as a “vacancy payment,” may be made to the Borrower when an assisted unit is vacant, in accordance with the terms of the HAP contract.
Project account
means a specifically identified and segregated account for each project that is established in accordance with § 891.570(b) out of the amounts by which the maximum annual commitment exceeds the amount actually paid out under the HAP contract each year.
Project occupancy requirements
means that eligible populations to be served under the Section 202 program are qualified individuals or families whose head of household or spouse is elderly, physically handicapped, developmentally disabled, or chronically mentally ill. Projects are designed to meet the special needs of the particular tenant population that the Borrower was selected to serve. Individuals from one eligible group may not be accepted for occupancy in a project designed for a different tenant group. However, a Sponsor can propose to house eligible tenant groups other than the one it was selected to serve, but must apply to the HUD field office for permission to do so, based on a plan that demonstrates that it can adequately serve the proposed tenant group. Upon review and recommendation by the field office, HUD Headquarters will approve or disapprove the request.
Rent,
in the case of a unit in a cooperative project, means the carrying charges payable to the cooperative with respect to occupancy of the unit.
Tenant rent
means the monthly amount defined in, and determined in accordance with part 5, subpart F of subtitle A of this title.
Total tenant payment
means the monthly amount defined in, and determined in accordance with part 5, subpart F of subtitle A of this title.
Utility allowance
is defined in part 5, subpart F of subtitle A of this title and is determined or approved by HUD.
Utility reimbursement
is defined in part 5, subpart F of subtitle A of this title.
Vacancy payment
means the housing assistance payment made to the Borrower by HUD for a vacant assisted unit if certain conditions are fulfilled, as provided in the HAP contract. The amount of the vacancy payment varies with the length of the vacancy period and is less after the first 60 days of any vacancy.
[61 FR 11956, Mar. 22, 1996, as amended at 66 FR 6225, Jan. 19, 2001; 66 FR 8174, Jan. 30, 2001; 88 FR 9669, Feb. 14, 2023; 88 FR 75233, Nov. 2, 2023]
§ 891.525
Amount and terms of financing.
(a) The amount of financing approved shall be the amount stated in the Notice of Section 202 Fund Reservation, including any increase approved by the field office prior to the final closing of a loan; provided, however, that the amount of financing provided shall not exceed the lesser of:
(1) The dollar amounts stated in paragraphs (b) through (f) of this section; or
(2) The total development cost of the project as determined by the field office.
(b) For such part of the property or project attributable to dwelling use (excluding exterior land improvements, as defined by the Assistant Secretary) the maximum loan amount, depending on the number of bedrooms, may not exceed:
(1) $28,032 per family unit without a bedroom.
(2) $32,321 per family unit with one bedroom.
(3) $38,979 per family unit with two bedrooms.
(c) In order to compensate for the higher costs incident to construction of elevator type structures of sound standards of construction and design, the field office may increase the dollar limitations per family unit, as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, to not to exceed:
(1) $29,500 per family unit without a bedroom.
(2) $33,816 per family unit with one bedroom.
(3) $41,120 per family unit with two bedrooms.
(d)
Reduced loan amount—leaseholds.
In the event the loan is secured by a leasehold estate rather than a fee simple estate, the allowable cost of the property upon which the loan amount is based shall be reduced by the value of the leased fee.
(e)
Adjusted loan amount—rehabilitation projects.
A loan amount that involves a project to be rehabilitated shall be subject to the following additional limitations:
(1)
Property held in fee.
If the Borrower is the fee simple owner of the project not encumbered by a mortgage, the maximum loan amount shall not exceed 100 percent of the cost of the proposed rehabilitation.
(2)
Property subject to existing mortgage.
If the Borrower owns the project subject to an outstanding indebtedness, which is to be refinanced with part of the Section 202 loan, the maximum loan amount shall not exceed the cost of rehabilitation plus such portion of the outstanding indebtedness as does not exceed the fair market value of such land and improvements prior to the rehabilitation, as determined by the field office.
(3)
Property to be acquired.
If the project is to be acquired by the Borrower and the purchase price is to be financed with a part of the Section 202 loan, the maximum loan amount shall not exceed the cost of the rehabilitation plus such portion of the purchase price as does not exceed the fair market value of such land and improvements prior to the rehabilitation, as determined by the field office.
(f)
Increased Mortgage Limits—High Cost Areas.
(1)(i) The Assistant Secretary may increase the dollar amount limitations in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section:
(A) By not to exceed 110 percent in any geographical area in which the Assistant Secretary finds that cost levels so require; and
(B) By not to exceed 140 percent where the Assistant Secretary determines it necessary on a project-by-project basis.
(ii) In no case, however, may any such increase exceed 90 percent, where the Assistant Secretary determines that there is involved a mortgage purchased or to be purchased by the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) in implementing its Special Assistance Functions under section 305 of the National Housing Act (as section 305 existed immediately before its repeal on November 30, 1983).
(2) If the Assistant Secretary finds that because of high costs in Alaska, Guam, or Hawaii it is not feasible to construct dwellings without the sacrifice of sound standards of construction, design, and livability within the limitations of maximum loan amounts provided in this section, the principal amount of mortgages may be increased by such amounts as may be necessary to compensate for such costs, but not to exceed in any event the maximum, including high cost area increases, if any, otherwise applicable by more than one-half thereof.
(g)
Loan interest rate.
Loans shall bear interest at a rate determined by HUD in accordance with this section.
(1)
Annual interest rate.
Except as provided under paragraph (g)(2), loans shall bear interest at the rate in effect
at the time the loan is made. The loan interest rate shall not exceed:
(i) The average yield on the most recently issued 30-year marketable obligations of the United States during the 3-month period immediately preceding the fiscal year in which the loan is made (adjusted to the nearest one-eighth of one percent), plus an allowance to cover administrative costs and probable losses under the program; and
(ii) Any applicable statutory ceiling on the loan interest rate including the allowance to cover administrative costs and probable losses.
(2)
Optional interest rate.
The Borrower may elect an optional loan interest rate. To elect the optional rate, the Borrower must request that HUD determine the loan interest rate at the time of the Borrower's request for conditional or firm commitment for direct loan financing.
(i) If the Borrower elects the optional loan interest rate, the loan interest rate shall not exceed:
(A) The average yield on the most recently issued 30-year marketable obligations of the United States during the 3-month period immediately preceding the fiscal year in which the request for commitment is submitted (adjusted to the nearest one-eighth of one percent), plus an allowance to cover administrative costs and probable losses under the program;
(B) The average yield on the most recently issued 30-year marketable obligations of the United States during the 1-month period immediately preceding the month in which the request for commitment is submitted (adjusted to the nearest one-eighth of one percent), plus an allowance to cover the administrative costs and probable losses under the program; and (C) Any applicable statutory ceiling on the loan interest rate including an allowance to cover administrative costs and probable losses under the program.
(ii) The date of submission of a request for conditional or firm commitment is the date that the Borrower submits the complete and acceptable request to HUD. The date of the submission of a request for commitment will not be affected by any subsequent resubmission of the request by the Borrower or by any reprocessing of the request by HUD.
(iii) The Borrower may withdraw its election of the optional interest rate at any time before initial loan closing. If the Borrower elected the optional interest rate with its request for conditional commitment and withdraws its election, the loan will bear interest at the rate determined under paragraph (g)(1) of this section, unless the Borrower elects an optional interest rate with its request for firm commitment. If the Borrower withdraws its election after the date of submission of its request for firm commitment, the loan will bear interest at the rate determined under paragraph (g)(1) of this section.
(iv) If initial loan closing has not occurred within 18 months after the Notice of Section 202 Fund Reservation is issued, the Borrower's election of the optional rate will be cancelled and the loan will bear interest at the rate determined under paragraph (g)(1) of this section.
(3)
Allowance for administrative costs and probable losses.
For the purpose of computing the loan interest rate under paragraphs (g) (1) and (2) of this section, the allowance to cover administrative costs and probable losses under the program is one-fourth of one percent (.25%) per annum for both the construction and permanent loan periods.
(h)
Announcement of interest rates.
(1) HUD will annually announce the loan interest rate determination under paragraph (g)(1) of this section by publishing notice of the rate in the
Federal Register.
The
Federal Register
notice will include a statement explaining the basis for the interest rate determination.
(2) Upon the Borrower's request, HUD will provide available current information concerning the determination of the interest rate under paragraph (g)(2) of this section.
(i) The loan shall be secured by a first mortgage on real estate in fee simple or long term leasehold. The mortgage shall be repayable during a term not to exceed 40 years and shall be subject to such terms and conditions as shall be determined by the Assistant Secretary.
(j) In order to assure HUD of the Borrower's continued commitment to the development, management, and operation of the project, a minimum capital investment is required of Section 202 Borrowers of one-half of one percent (0.5%) of the mortgage amount committed to be disbursed, not to exceed the amount of $10,000. Section 106(b) loans made pursuant to section 106 of the Housing Act of 1968 may not be utilized to meet the minimum capital investment requirement. Such minimum capital investment shall be placed in escrow at the initial closing of the Section 202 loan and shall be held by HUD or other escrow agent acceptable to the field office for not less than a 3-year period from the date of initial occupancy and may be used for operating expenses or deficits as may be directed by the field office. Any unexpended balance remaining in the minimum capital investment account at the end of the escrow period shall be returned to the Borrower.
§ 891.530
Prepayment privileges.
(a) The prepayment (whether in whole or in part) or the assignment or transfer of physical and financial assets of any Section 202 project is prohibited, unless the Secretary gives prior written approval.
(b) The Secretary may not grant approval unless he or she has determined that the prepayment or transfer of the loan is part of a transaction that will ensure the continued operation of the project, until the original maturity date of the loan, in a manner that will provide rental housing for the elderly and handicapped on terms at least as advantageous to existing and future tenants as the terms required by the original Section 202 loan agreement and any other loan agreements entered into under other provisions of law.
§ 891.535
Requirements for awarding construction contracts.
(a) Awards shall be made only to responsible contractors that possess the potential ability to perform successfully under the terms and conditions of a proposed construction contract. Consideration shall be given to such matters as contractor integrity, compliance with public policy, record of past performance, and financial and technical resources.
(b) Each Borrower is permitted to use either competitive bidding (formal advertising) in selecting a construction contractor or the negotiated noncompetitive method of contract award under paragraph (c) of this section. In competitive bidding, sealed bids are publicly solicited and a firm, fixed-price contract is awarded (in accordance with the requirements of this paragraph (b)) to the responsible bidder whose bid, conforming with all the material terms and conditions of the invitation for bids, is lowest in price. Regardless of which method a Borrower uses, there should be an opportunity for minority owned and women owned businesses to be awarded a contract.
(1) Bids shall be solicited from an adequate number of known contractors a reasonable time prior to the date set forth for opening of bids. In addition, the invitation shall be publicly advertised.
(2) The invitation for bids shall specify:
(i) The name of the Borrower;
(ii) A brief description of the proposed project and the proposed construction contract;
(iii) A preliminary estimate of cost;
(iv) That bids will be received at a specified place until a specified time at which time and place all bids will be publicly opened;
(v) The location where the proposed forms of contract and bid documents, including plans and specifications, are on file and may be obtained on payment of a specified returnable deposit;
(vi) That a certified check or bank draft or satisfactory bid bond in the amount of 5 percent of the bid shall be submitted with the bid;
(vii) That the successful bidder will be required to provide assurance of completion in the form of a performance and payment bond or cash escrow; and
(viii) That the Borrower reserves the right to reject any or all bids and to waive any informality.
(3) The bid form, which must be submitted by all bidders, must specify:
(i) The name of the project;
(ii) The name and address of the bidder;
(iii) That the bidder proposes to furnish all labor, materials, equipment and services required to construct and complete the project, as described in the invitation for bids (including the contents of all documents on file), for a specified lump-sum price;
(iv) That the security specified in paragraph (b)(2)(vi) of this section accompanies the bid;
(v) The period after the bid opening during which the bid shall not be withdrawn without the consent of the Borrower;
(vi) That the bidder will, if notified of acceptance of such bid within a specified period after the opening, execute and deliver a contract in the prescribed form and furnish the required bond within ten days thereafter;
(vii) That the bidder acknowledges any amendments to the invitation for bids; and
(viii) That the bidder certifies that the bid is in strict accordance with all terms of the invitation for bids (including the contents of all documents on file) and that the bid is signed by a person authorized to bind the bidder.
(4) Bidding shall be open to all general contractors who furnish the security guaranteeing their bid, as described in paragraph (b)(2)(vi) of this section.
(5) All bids shall be opened publicly at the time and place stated in the invitation for bids, in the presence of the HUD Regional Administrator or his designee.
(6) A firm, fixed-price contract award shall be made by written notice to the responsible bidder whose bid, conforming to the invitation for bids, is lowest. The contract may provide for an incentive payment to the contractor for an early completion.
(c) A Sponsor or Borrower may award a negotiated, noncompetitive construction contract.
§ 891.540
Loan disbursement procedures.
(a) Disbursements of loan proceeds shall be made directly by HUD to or for the account of the Borrower and may be made through an approved lender, mortgage servicer, title insurance company, or other agent satisfactory to the Borrower and HUD.
(b) All disbursements to the Borrower shall be made on a periodic basis in an amount not to exceed the HUD-approved cost of portions of construction or rehabilitation work completed and in place (except as modified in paragraph (d) of this section), minus the appropriate holdback, as determined by the field office.
(c) Requisitions for loan disbursements shall be submitted by the Borrower on forms to be prescribed by the Assistant Secretary and shall be accompanied by such additional information as the field office may require in order to approve loan disbursements under subpart E of this part, including but not limited to evidence of compliance with the Davis-Bacon Act, Department of Labor regulations, all applicable zoning, building, and other governmental requirements, and such evidence of continued priority of the mortgage of the Borrower as the Assistant Secretary may prescribe.
(d) In loan disbursements for building components stored off-site, the term
building component
shall mean any manufactured or preassembled part of a structure as defined by HUD and that the Assistant Secretary has designated for off-site storage because it is of such size or weight that storage of the components required for timely construction progress at the construction site is impractical, or weather damage or other adverse conditions prevailing at the construction site would make storage at the site impractical or unduly costly. Each building component must be specifically identified for incorporation into the property as provided under paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section.
(1)
Storage.
(i) A loan disbursement may be made for up to 90 percent of the invoice value (to exclude costs of transportation and storage) of the building components stored off-site if the components are stored at a location approved by HUD.
(ii) Each building component shall be adequately marked so as to be readily identifiable in the inventory of the off-site location. It shall be kept together with all other building components of the same manufacturer intended for use in the same project for which loan
disbursements have been made and separate and apart from similar units not for use in the project.
(iii) Storage costs, if any, shall be borne the general contractor.
(2)
Responsibility for transportation, storage and insurance of off-site building components.
The general contractor of the project shall have the responsibility for:
(i) Insuring the components in the name of the Borrower while in transit and storage; and
(ii) Delivering or contracting for the delivery of the components to the storage area and to the construction site, including payment of freight.
(3)
Loan disbursements.
(i) Before a loan disbursement for a building component stored off-site is made, the Borrower shall:
(A) Obtain a bill of sale for the component;
(B) Provide HUD with a security agreement pledged by a first lien on the building components with the exception of such other liens or encumbrances as may be approved by HUD; and
(C) File a financing statement in accordance with the Uniform Commercial Code.
(ii) Before each loan disbursement for building components stored off-site is made the manufacturer and the general contractor shall certify to HUD that the components, in their intended use, comply with HUD-approved contract plan and specifications.
(iii) Loan disbursements may be made only for components stored off-site in a quantity required to permit uninterrupted installation at the site.
(iv) At no time shall the invoice value of building components being stored off-site, for which advances have been insured, represent more than 25 percent of the total estimated construction costs for the insured mortgaged project as specified in the construction contract. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence and other regulatory requirements that set bonding requirements, the percentage of total estimated construction costs insured by advances under this section may exceed 25 percent but not 50 percent if the mortgagor furnishes assurance of completion in the form of a corporate surety bond for the payment and performance each in the amount of 100 percent of the amount of the construction contract. In no event will insurance of components stored off-site be made in the absence of a payment and performance bond.
(v) No single loan disbursement which is to be made shall be in an amount less than ten thousand ($10,000) dollars.
§ 891.545
Completion of project, cost certification, and HUD approvals.
(a) The Borrower must satisfy the requirements for completion of construction and substantial rehabilitation and approvals by HUD before submission of a final requisition for disbursement of loan proceeds.
(b) The Borrower shall submit to the field office all documentation required for final disbursement of the loan, including:
(1) A Borrower's/Mortgagor's Certificate of Actual Cost, showing the actual cost to the mortgagor of the construction contract, architectural, legal, organizational, offsite costs, and all other items of eligible expense. The certificate shall not include as actual cost any kickbacks, rebates, trade discounts, or other similar payments to the mortgagor or to any of its officers, directors, or members.
(2) A verification of the Certificate of Actual Cost by an independent Certified Public Accountant or independent public accountant acceptable to the field office.
(3) In the case of projects not subject to competitive bidding, a certification of the general contractor (and of such subcontractors, material suppliers, and equipment lessors as the Assistant Secretary or field office may require), on a form prescribed by the Assistant Secretary, as to all actual costs paid for labor, materials, and subcontract work under the general contract exclusive of the builder's fee and kickbacks, rebates, trade discounts, or other similar payments to the general contractor, the mortgagor, or any of its officers, directors, stockholders, partners, or members.
(c) In lieu of the requirements set forth in paragraphs (c)(1) and (3) of this
section, a simplified form of cost certification prescribed by the Secretary may be completed and submitted by the Borrower for projects with mortgages of $500,000 or less. The simplified cost certification shall be verified by an independent Certified Public Accountant or an independent public accountant in a manner acceptable to the Secretary.
(d) If the Borrower's certified costs provided in accordance with paragraph (c) or (d) of this section and as approved by HUD are less than the loan amount, the contract rents will be reduced accordingly.
(e) If the contract rents are reduced pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section, the maximum annual HAP Contract commitment will be reduced. If contract rents are reduced based on cost certification after HAP Contract execution, any overpayment after the effective date of the Contract will be recovered from the Borrower by HUD.

§ 891.550
Broadband infrastructure.
Any new construction or substantial rehabilitation, as substantial rehabilitation is defined by 24 CFR 5.100, of a building with more than 4 rental units and funded by a grant awarded after January 19, 2017 must include installation of broadband infrastructure, as this term is also defined in 24 CFR 5.100, except where the owner determines and documents the determination that:
(a) The location of the new construction or substantial rehabilitation makes installation of broadband infrastructure infeasible;
(b) The cost of installing broadband infrastructure would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of its program or activity or in an undue financial burden; or
(c) The structure of the housing to be substantially rehabilitated makes installation of broadband infrastructure infeasible.
[81 FR 92638, Dec. 20, 2016]
§ 891.560
HAP contract.
(a)
HAP contract.
The housing assistance payments contract sets forth rights and duties of the Borrower and HUD with respect to the project and the housing assistance payments.
(b)
HAP contract execution.
(1) Upon satisfactory completion of the project, the Borrower and HUD shall execute the HAP contract on the form prescribed by HUD.
(2) The effective date of the HAP contract may be earlier than the date of execution, but no earlier than the date of HUD's issuance of the permission to occupy.
(3) If the project is completed in stages, the procedures of paragraph (b) of this section shall apply to each stage.
(c)
Housing assistance payments to owners under the HAP contract.
The housing assistance payments made under the HAP contract are:
(1)
Payments to the Borrower to assist eligible families leasing assisted units.
The amount of the housing assistance payment made to the Borrower for an assisted unit leased to an eligible family is equal to the difference between the contract rent for the unit and the tenant rent payable by the family.
(2)
Payments to the Borrower for vacant assisted units (vacancy payments).
The amount of and conditions for vacancy payments are described in § 891.650. The housing assistance payments are made monthly by HUD upon proper requisition by the Borrower, except payments for vacancies of more than 60 days, which are made semiannually by HUD upon requisition by the Borrower.
(d)
Payment of utility reimbursement.
As applicable, a utility reimbursement will be paid to a family occupying an assisted unit as an additional housing assistance payment. The HAP contract will provide that the Borrower will make this payment on behalf of HUD. Funds will be paid to the Borrower in trust solely for the purpose of making the additional payment. The Borrower may pay the utility reimbursement jointly to the family and the utility company, or, if the family and utility company consent, directly to the utility company.
§ 891.565
Term of HAP contract.
The term of the HAP contract for assisted units shall be 20 years. If the project is completed in stages, the
term of the HAP contract for assisted units in each stage shall be 20 years. The term of the HAP contract for all assisted units in all stages of a project shall not exceed 22 years.
§ 891.570
Maximum annual commitment and project account.
(a)
Maximum annual commitment.
The maximum annual amount that may be committed under the HAP contract is the total of the contract rents and utility allowances for all assisted units in the project.
(b)
Project account.
(1) HUD will establish and maintain a specifically identified and segregated project account for each project. The project account will be established out of the amounts by which the maximum annual commitment exceeds the amount actually paid out under the HAP contract each year. HUD will make payments from this account for housing assistance payments as needed to cover increases in contract rents or decreases in tenant income and other payments for costs specifically approved by the Secretary.
(2) If the HUD-approved estimate of required annual payments under the HAP contract for a fiscal year exceeds the maximum annual commitment for that fiscal year plus the current balance in the project account, HUD will, within a reasonable time, take such steps authorized by section 8(c)(6) of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437f note), as may be necessary, to assure that payments under the HAP contract will be adequate to cover increases in contract rents and decreases in tenant income.
§ 891.575
Leasing to eligible families.
(a)
Availability of assisted units for occupancy by eligible families.
(1) During the term of the HAP contract, a Borrower shall make available for occupancy by eligible families the total number of units for which assistance is committed under the HAP contract. For purposes of this section, making units available for occupancy by eligible families means that the Borrower:
(i) Is conducting marketing in accordance with § 891.600(a);
(ii) Has leased or is making good faith efforts to lease the units to eligible and otherwise acceptable families, including taking all feasible actions to fill vacancies by renting to such families;
(iii) Has not rejected any such applicant family except for reasons acceptable to HUD.
(2) If the Borrower is temporarily unable to lease all units for which assistance is committed under the HAP contract to eligible families, one or more units may, with the prior approval of HUD, be leased to otherwise eligible families that do not meet the income eligibility requirements of 24 CFR 5.653. Failure on the part of the Borrower to comply with these requirements is a violation of the HAP contract and grounds for all available legal remedies, including an action for specific performance of the HAP contract, suspension or debarment from HUD programs, and reduction of the number of units under the HAP contract as set forth in paragraph (b) of this section.
(b)
Reduction of number of units covered by the HAP contract.
HUD may reduce the number of units covered by the HAP contract to the number of units available for occupancy by eligible families if:
(1) The Borrower fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section; or
(2) Notwithstanding any prior approval by HUD, HUD determines that the inability to lease units to eligible families is not a temporary problem.
(c)
Restoration.
HUD will agree to an amendment of the HAP contract to provide for subsequent restoration of any reduction made under paragraph (b) of this section if:
(1) HUD determines that the restoration is justified by demand;
(2) The Borrower otherwise has a record of compliance with the Borrower's obligations under the HAP contract; and
(3) Contract and budget authority is available.
(d)
Applicability.
In accordance with section 555 of the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act of 1990, paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section apply to all contracts. An owner who had leased an assisted unit to an ineligible family consistent with the
regulations in effect at the time will continue to lease the unit to that family. However, the owner must make the unit available for occupancy by an eligible family when the ineligible family vacates the unit.
(e)
Occupancy by families that are not elderly or handicapped.
HUD may permit units in the project to be leased to other than elderly or handicapped families if:
(1) The Borrower has made reasonable efforts to lease assisted and unassisted units to eligible families;
(2) The Borrower has been granted HUD approval under paragraph (a) of this section; and
(3) The Borrower is temporarily unable to achieve or maintain a level of occupancy sufficient to prevent financial default and foreclosure under the Section 202 loan documents. HUD approval under paragraph (e)(3) of this section will be of limited duration. HUD may impose terms and conditions to this approval that are consistent with program objectives and necessary to protect its interest in the Section 202 loan.
(f) The regulations of 24 CFR part 5, subpart L (Protection for Victims of Domestic Violence, Dating Violence, Sexual Assault, or Stalking) apply to this section.
[61 FR 11956, Mar. 22, 1996, as amended at 73 FR 72343, Nov. 28, 2008; 75 FR 66262, Oct. 27, 2010; 81 FR 80815, Nov. 16, 2016; 88 FR 75233, Nov. 2, 2023]
§ 891.580
HAP contract administration.
HUD is responsible for the administration of the HAP contract.
§ 891.582
Management and occupancy reviews.
(a) The contract administrator will conduct management and occupancy reviews to determine whether the owner is in compliance with the HAP Contract. Such reviews will be conducted in accordance with a schedule set out by the Secretary and published in the
Federal Register,
following notice and the opportunity to comment. Where a change in ownership or management occurs, a management and occupancy review must be conducted within six months.
(b) HUD or the Contract Administrator may inspect project operations and units at any time.
(c) Equal Opportunity reviews may be conducted by HUD at any time.
[87 FR 37997, June 27, 2022]
§ 891.585
Default by Borrower.
(a)
HAP contract provisions.
The HAP contract will provide:
(1) That if HUD determines that the Borrower is in default under the HAP contract, HUD will notify the Borrower of the actions required to be taken to cure the default and of the remedies to be applied by HUD including an action for specific performance under the HAP contract, reduction or suspension of housing assistance payments and recovery of overpayments, where appropriate; and
(2) That if the Borrower fails to cure the default, HUD has the right to terminate the HAP contract or to take other corrective action.
(b)
Loan provisions.
Additional provisions governing default under the section 202 loan are included in the regulatory agreement and other loan documents.
§ 891.590
Notice upon HAP contract expiration.
(a)
Notice required.
The HAP contract will provide that the Borrower will, at least one year before the end of the HAP contract term, notify each family leasing an assisted unit of any increase in the amount the family will be required to pay as rent as a result of the expiration.
(b)
Service requirements.
The notice under paragraph (a) of this section shall be accomplished by sending a letter by first class mail, properly stamped and addressed, to the family at its address at the project, with a proper return address; and serving a copy of the notice on any adult person answering the door at the leased dwelling unit, or if no adult responds, by placing the notice under or through the door, if possible, or else by affixing the notice to the door. Service shall not be considered to be effective until both required notices have been accomplished. The date on which the notice shall be considered to be received by the family
shall be the date on which the Borrower mails the first class letter provided for in paragraph (b) of this section, or the date on which the notice provided for in paragraph (b) of this section is properly given, whichever is later.
(c)
Contents of notice.
The notice shall advise each affected family that, after the expiration date of the HAP contract, the family will be required to bear the entire cost of the rent and that the Borrower may, subject to requirements and restrictions contained in the regulatory agreement, the lease, and State or local law, change the rent. The notice also shall state:
(1) The actual (if known) or the estimated rent that will be charged following the expiration of the HAP contract;
(2) The difference between the new rent and the total tenant payment toward rent under the HAP contract; and
(3) The date the HAP contract will expire.
(d)
Certification to HUD.
The Borrower shall give HUD a certification that families have been notified in accordance with this section and shall attach to the certification an example of the text of the notice.
(e)
Applicability.
This section applies to all HAP contracts entered into under an agreement to enter into a housing assistance payments contract executed on or after October 1, 1981, or entered into under such an agreement executed before October 1, 1981 but renewed or amended after February 9, 1995.
(Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 2502-0371)
§ 891.595
HAP contract extension or renewal.
Upon expiration of the term of the HAP contract, HUD and the Borrower may agree (subject to available funds) to extend the term of the HAP contract or to renew the HAP contract. The number of assisted units under the extended or renewed HAP contract shall equal the number of assisted units under the original HAP contract, except that:
(a) HUD and the Borrower may agree to reduce the number of assisted units by the number of assisted units that are not occupied by eligible families at the time of the extension or renewal; and
(b) HUD and the Borrower may agree to permit reductions in the number of assisted units during the term of the extended or renewed HAP contract as assisted units are vacated by eligible families. Nothing in this section shall prohibit HUD from reducing the number of units covered under the extended or renewed HAP contract in accordance with § 891.575(b).
§ 891.600
Responsibilities of Borrower.
(a)
Marketing.
(1) The Borrower must commence and continue diligent marketing activities not later than 90 days before the anticipated date of availability for occupancy of the first unit of the project. Market activities shall include the provision of notices of availability of housing under the program to operators of temporary housing for the homeless in the same housing market.
(2) Marketing must be done in accordance with the HUD-approved affirmative fair housing marketing plan and all Federal, State, or local fair housing and equal opportunity requirements. The purpose of the plan and requirements is to achieve a condition in which eligible families of similar income levels in the same housing market have a like range of housing choices available to them regardless of discriminatory considerations, such as their race, color, creed, religion, familial status, disability, sex or national origin. Marketing must also be done in accordance with the communication and notice requirements of Section 504 at 24 CFR 8.6 and 24 CFR 8.54.
(3) At the time of HAP contract execution, the Borrower must submit to HUD a list of leased and unleased assisted units, with a justification for the unleased units, in order to qualify for vacancy payments for the unleased units.
(b)
Management and maintenance.
The Borrower is responsible for all management functions. These functions include selection and admission of tenants, required reexaminations of incomes for families occupying assisted units (or residential spaces, as applicable), collection of rents, termination of
tenancy and eviction, and all repair and maintenance functions (including ordinary and extraordinary maintenance and replacement of capital items). All functions must be performed in compliance with equal opportunity requirements.
(c)
Contracting for services.
(1) With HUD approval, the Borrower may contract with a private or public entity for performance of the services or duties required in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section. However, such an arrangement does not relieve the Borrower of responsibility for these services and duties. All such contracts are subject to the restrictions governing prohibited contractual relationships described in §§ 891.130 and 891.505, if applicable. (These prohibitions do not extend to management contracts entered into by the Borrower with the Sponsor or its nonprofit affiliate).
(2) Consistent with the objectives of Executive Order No. 11625 (36 FR 19967, 3 CFR, 1971-1975 Comp., p. 616; as amended by Executive Order No. 12007 (42 FR 42839, 3 CFR, 1977 Comp., p. 139; unless otherwise noted); Executive Order No. 12432 (48 FR 32551, 3 CFR, 1983 Comp., p. 198; unless otherwise noted); and Executive Order No. 12138 (44 FR 29637, 3 CFR, 1979 Comp., p. 393; unless otherwise noted), the Borrower will promote awareness and participation of minority and women's business enterprises in contracting and procurement activities.
(d)
Submission of financial and operating statements.
The Borrower must submit to HUD:
(1) Within 60 days after the end of each fiscal year of project operations, financial statements for the project audited by an independent public accountant and in the form required by HUD; and
(2) Other statements regarding project operation, financial conditions and occupancy as HUD may require to administer the housing assistance payments contract (HAP contract) or the project assistance contract (PAC), as applicable, and to monitor project operations.
(e)
Use of project funds.
The Borrower shall maintain a separate project fund account in a depository or depositories that are members of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund and shall deposit all rents, charges, income and revenues arising from project operation or ownership to this account. All project funds are to be deposited in Federally-insured accounts. All balances shall be fully insured at all times, to the maximum extent possible. Project funds must be used for the operation of the project (including required insurance coverage), to make required principal and interest payments on the Section 202 loan, and to make required deposits to the replacement reserve under §§ 891.605 and 891.745 (as applicable), in accordance with a HUD-approved budget. Any project funds in the project funds account (including earned interest) following the expiration of the fiscal year shall be deposited in a Federally-insured residual receipts account within 60 days following the end of the fiscal year. Withdrawals from this account may be made only for project purposes and with the approval of HUD. If there are funds remaining in the residual receipts account when the mortgage is satisfied, such funds shall be returned to HUD.
(f)
Reports.
The Borrower shall submit such reports as HUD may prescribe to demonstrate compliance with applicable civil rights and equal opportunity requirements.
(Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 2502-0371)
§ 891.605
Replacement reserve.
(a)
Establishment of reserve.
The Borrower shall establish and maintain a replacement reserve to aid in funding extraordinary maintenance, and repair and replacement of capital items.
(b)
Deposits to reserve.
The Borrower shall make monthly deposits to the replacement reserve in an amount determined by HUD. Further requirements regarding the amount of the deposits for projects funded under §§ 891.655 through 891.790 are provided in § 891.745.
(c)
Level of reserve.
The reserve must be built up to and maintained at a level determined by HUD to be sufficient to meet projected requirements. Should the reserve reach that level, the amount of the deposit to the reserve
may be reduced with the approval of HUD.
(d)
Administration of reserve.
Replacement reserve funds must be deposited with HUD or in a Federally-insured depository in an interest-bearing account(s) whose balances are fully insured at all times. All earnings including interest on the reserve must be added to the reserve. Funds may be drawn from the reserve and used only in accordance with HUD guidelines and with the approval of, or as directed by, HUD.
§ 891.610
Selection and admission of tenants.
(a)
Written procedures.
The Owner shall adopt written tenant selection procedures that ensure nondiscrimination in the selection of tenants and that are consistent with the purpose of improving housing opportunities for very low-income elderly or handicapped persons; and reasonably related to program eligibility and an applicant's ability to perform the obligations of the lease. Owners shall promptly notify in writing any rejected applicant of the grounds for any rejection. Additionally, owners shall maintain a written, chronological waiting list showing the name, race, gender, ethnicity and date of each person applying for the program.
(b)
Application for admission.
The Borrower must accept applications for admission to the project in the form prescribed by HUD and is obligated to confirm all information provided by the applicant families on the application. Applicant families must be requested to complete a release of information consent for verification of information. Applicants applying for assisted units must complete a certification of eligibility as part of the application for admission. Applicant families must meet the disclosure and verification requirements for Social Security Numbers, and sign and submit consent forms for the obtaining of wage and claim information from State Wage Information Collection Agencies, as provided by 24 CFR part 5, subpart B. Both the Borrower and the applicant must complete and sign the application for admission. On request, the Borrower must furnish copies of all applications for admission to HUD.
(c)
Determination of eligibility and selection of tenants.
The borrower is responsible for determining whether applicants are eligible for admission and for selection of families. To be eligible for admission, an applicant must be an elderly or handicapped family as defined in § 891.505; meet any project occupancy requirements approved by HUD; meet the disclosure and verification requirement for Social Security numbers and sign and submit consent forms for obtaining wage and claim information from State Wage Information Collection Agencies, as provided by 24 CFR part 5, subpart B; and, if applying for an assisted unit, be eligible for admission under subpart F of 24 CFR part 5, which governs selection of tenants and occupancy requirements. The provisions of 24 CFR part 5, subpart L (Protection for Victims of Domestic Violence, Dating Violence, Sexual Assault, or Stalking) apply to this section.
(d)
Unit assignment.
If the Borrower determines that the family is eligible and is otherwise acceptable and units are available, the Borrower will assign the family a unit. The Borrower will assign the family a unit of the appropriate size in accordance with HUD's general occupancy guidelines. If no suitable unit is available, the Borrower will place the family on a waiting list for the project and notify the family of when a suitable unit may become available. If the waiting list is so long that the applicant would not be likely to be admitted within the next 12 months, the Borrower may advise the applicant that no additional applications for admission are being considered for that reason, except that the Borrower may not refuse to place an applicant on the waiting list if the applicant is otherwise eligible for assistance and claims that he or she qualifies for a Federal preference as provided in 24 CFR part 5, subpart D.
(e)
Ineligibility determination.
If the Borrower determines that an applicant is ineligible for admission or the Borrower is not selecting the applicant for other reasons, the Borrower will promptly notify the applicant in writing of the determination, the reasons
for the determination, and that the applicant has a right to request a meeting with the Borrower or managing agent to review the rejection, in accordance with HUD requirements. The review, if requested, may not be conducted by a member of the Borrower's staff who made the initial decision to reject the applicant. The applicant may also exercise other rights (
e.g.,
rights granted under Federal, State, or local civil rights laws) if the applicant believes he or she is being discriminated against on a prohibited basis.
(f)
Records.
Records on applicants and approved eligible families, which provide racial, ethnic, gender, handicap status, and place of previous residency data required by HUD, must be retained for three years.
(g)
Reexamination of family income and composition
—(1)
Regular reexaminations.
The Borrower must reexamine the income and composition of the family at least every 12 months. Upon verification of the information, the Borrower shall make appropriate adjustments in the total tenant payment in accordance with § 5.657 of this title and determine whether the family's unit size is still appropriate. The Borrower must adjust tenant rent and the housing assistance payment and must carry out any unit transfer in accordance with the administrative instructions issued by HUD. At the time of reexamination, the Borrower must require the family to meet the disclosure and verification requirements for Social Security Numbers, as provided by 24 CFR part 5, subpart B.
(2)
Interim reexaminations.
The family must comply with the provisions in § 5.657 of this title regarding interim reporting of changes in income. If the Borrower receives information concerning a change in the family's income or other circumstances between regularly scheduled reexaminations, the Borrower must consult with the family and make any adjustments determined to be appropriate. Any change in the family's income or other circumstances that results in an adjustment in the total tenant payment, tenant rent, or housing assistance payment must be verified.
(3)
Continuation of housing assistance payments.
(i) A family shall remain eligible for housing assistance payments until the total tenant payment equals or exceeds the gross rent. The termination of subsidy eligibility will not affect the family's other rights under its lease. Housing assistance payments may be resumed if, as a result of changes in income, rent, or other relevant circumstances during the term of the HAP contract, the family meets the income eligibility requirements of § 5.657 of this title and housing assistance is available for the unit under the terms of the HAP contract. The family will not be required to establish its eligibility for admission to the project under the remaining requirements of paragraph (c) of this section.
(ii) A family's eligibility for housing assistance payments may be terminated in accordance with HUD requirements for such reasons as failure to submit requested verification information, including information related to disclosure and verification of Social Security Numbers, or failure to sign and submit consent forms for the obtaining of wage and claim information from State wage information collection agencies, as provided by 24 CFR part 5, subpart B.
(4)
Streamlined income determination.
An owner may elect to follow the provisions of 24 CFR 5.657(d).

§ 891.615
Obligations of the family.
The obligations of the family are provided in § 891.415.
§ 891.620
Overcrowded and underoccupied units.
If the Borrower determines that because of change in family size, an assisted unit is smaller than appropriate for the eligible family to which it is leased, or that the assisted unit is larger than appropriate, housing assistance payments or project assistance payments (as applicable) with respect to the unit will not be reduced or terminated until the eligible family has been relocated to an appropriate alternate
unit. If possible, the Borrower will, as promptly as possible, offer the family an appropriate alternate unit. The Borrower may receive vacancy payments for the vacated unit if the Borrower complies with the requirements of § 891.650.
§ 891.625
Lease requirements.
The lease requirements are provided in § 891.425.

§ 891.635
Security deposits.
The general requirements for security deposits on assisted units are provided in § 891.435. For purposes of subpart E of this part, the additional requirements apply:
(a) The Borrower may require each family occupying an unassisted unit (or residential space in a group home) to pay a security deposit equal to one month's rent payable by the family.
(b) The Borrower shall maintain a record of the amount in the segregated interest-bearing account that is attributable to each family in residence in the project. Annually for all families, and when computing the amount available for disbursement under § 891.435(b)(3), the Borrower shall allocate to the family's balance the interest accrued on the balance during the year. Unless prohibited by State or local law, the Borrower may deduct for the family, from the accrued interest for the year, the administrative cost of computing the allocation to the family's balance. The amount of the administrative cost adjustment shall not exceed the accrued interest allocated to the family's balance for the year.
§ 891.640
Adjustment of rents.
(a)
Contract rents
—(1)
Adjustment based on approved budget.
If the HAP contract provides, or has been amended to provide, that contract rents will be adjusted based upon a HUD-approved budget, HUD will calculate contract rent adjustments based on the sum of the project's operating costs and debt service (as calculated by HUD), with adjustments for vacancies, the project's nonrental income, and other factors that HUD deems appropriate. The calculation will be made on the basis of information provided by the Borrower on a form acceptable to the Secretary. The automatic adjustment factor described in part 888 of this chapter is not used to adjust contract rents under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, except to the extent that the amount of the replacement reserve deposit is adjusted under § 880.602 of this chapter.
(2)
Annual and special adjustments.
If the HAP contract provides that contract rents will be adjusted based on the application of an automatic adjustment factor and by special additional adjustments:
(i) Consistent with the HAP contract, contract rents may be adjusted in accordance with part 888 of this chapter;
(ii) Special additional adjustments will be granted, to the extent determined necessary by HUD, to reflect increases in the actual and necessary expenses of owning and maintaining the assisted units that have resulted from substantial general increases in real property taxes, assessments, utility rates or similar costs (i.e., assessments and utilities not covered by regulated rates), and that are not adequately compensated for by an annual adjustment. The Borrower must submit to HUD required supporting data, financial statements, and certifications for the special additional adjustment.
(b)
Rent for unassisted units.
The rent payable by families occupying units that are not assisted under the HAP contract shall be equal to the contract
rent computed under paragraph (a) of this section.
(Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 2502-0371)
§ 891.645
Adjustment of utility allowances.
In connection with adjustments of contract rents as provided in § 891.640(a), the requirements for the adjustment of utility allowances provided in § 891.440 apply.
§ 891.650
Conditions for receipt of vacancy payments for assisted units.
(a)
General.
Vacancy payments under the HAP contract will not be made unless the conditions for receipt of these housing assistance payments set forth in this section are fulfilled.
(b)
Vacancies during rent-up.
For each unit that is not leased as of the effective date of the HAP contract, the Borrower is entitled to vacancy payments in the amount of 80 percent of the contract rent for the first 60 days of vacancy, if the Borrower:
(1) Complied with § 891.600;
(2) Has taken and continues to take all feasible actions to fill the vacancy; and
(3) Has not rejected any eligible applicant except for good cause acceptable to HUD.
(c)
Vacancies after rent-up.
If an eligible family vacates a unit, the Borrower is entitled to vacancy payments in the amount of 80 percent of the contract rent for the first 60 days of vacancy if the Borrower:
(1) Certifies that it did not cause the vacancy by violating the lease, the HAP contract, or any applicable law;
(2) Notified HUD of the vacancy or prospective vacancy and the reasons for the vacancy immediately upon learning of the vacancy or prospective vacancy;
(3) Has fulfilled and continues to fulfill the requirements specified in § 891.600(a)(2) and (3), and in paragraphs (b)(2) and (3) of this section; and
(4) For any vacancy resulting from the Borrower's eviction of an eligible family, certifies that it has complied with § 891.630.
(d)
Vacancies for longer than 60 days.
If a unit continues to be vacant after the 60-day period specified in paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, the Borrower may apply to receive additional vacancy payments in an amount equal to the principal and interest payments required to amortize that portion of the debt service attributable to the vacant unit for up to 12 additional months for the unit if:
(1) The unit was in decent, safe, and sanitary condition during the vacancy period for which payment is claimed;
(2) The Borrower has fulfilled and continues to fulfill the requirements specified in paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, as appropriate; and
(3) The Borrower has demonstrated to the satisfaction of HUD that:
(i) For the period of vacancy, the project is not providing the Borrower with revenues at least equal to project expenses (exclusive of depreciation) and the amount of payments requested is not more than the portion of the deficiency attributable to the vacant unit; and
(ii) The project can achieve financial soundness within a reasonable time.
(e)
Prohibition of double compensation for vacancies.
If the Borrower collects payments for vacancies from other sources (tenant rent, security deposits, payments under § 891.435(c), or governmental payments under other programs), the Borrower shall not be entitled to collect vacancy payments to the extent these collections from other sources plus the vacancy payment exceed contract rent.

Project assistance payment
means the payment made by HUD to the Borrower for assisted units as provided in the PAC. The payment is the difference between the contract rent and the tenant rent. An additional payment is made to a family occupying an assisted unit in an independent living complex when the utility allowance is greater than the total tenant payment. A project assistance payment, known as a “vacancy payment,” may be made to the Borrower when an assisted unit (or residential space in a group home) is vacant, in accordance with the terms of the PAC.
Tenant rent
equals total tenant payment less utility allowance, if any.
Total tenant payment
means the monthly amount defined in, and determined in accordance with part 5, subpart F of this title.
Utility allowance
is defined in part 5, subpart F of this title and is determined or approved by HUD.
Utility reimbursement
is defined in part 5, subpart F of this title.
Vacancy payment
means the project assistance payment made to the Borrower by HUD for a vacant assisted unit (or residential space in a group home) if certain conditions are fulfilled, as provided in the PAC. The amount of the vacancy payment varies with the length of the vacancy period and is less after the first 60 days of any vacancy.

except that unrelated handicapped individuals sharing a unit (other than a handicapped person living with another person who is essential to the handicapped person's well-being) are counted as separate households. For independent living complexes for handicapped families in the developmental disability or physically handicapped occupancy categories, units with three or more bedrooms may only be developed to serve handicapped families of one or two parents with children.
(b)
Additional limitations.
Based on the amount of loan authority appropriated for a fiscal year, HUD may have imposed additional limitations on the number of units or residents that may be proposed under an application for Section 202 loan fund reservation, as published in the annual notice of funding availability or the invitation for Section 202 fund reservation.
(c)
Exemptions.
On a case-by-case basis, HUD may approve independent living complexes that do not comply with the project size limitations prescribed in paragraphs (a)(2), (a)(3), or (b) of this section. HUD may approve such projects if the Sponsor demonstrates:

Prepayment of loans.
(a)
Prepayment prohibition.
The prepayment (whether in whole or in part) or the assignment or transfer of physical and financial assets of any Section 202 project is prohibited, unless the Assistant Secretary gives prior written approval.
(b)
HUD-approved prepayment.
Approval for prepayment or transfer will not be granted unless HUD determines that the prepayment or transfer of the loan is a part of a transaction that will ensure the continued operation of the project until the original maturity date of the loan in a manner that will provide rental housing for the handicapped families on terms at least as advantageous to existing and future tenants as the terms required by the original Section 202 loan agreement and any other loan agreements entered into under other provisions of law.
§ 891.705
Project assistance contract.
(a)
Project assistance contract (PAC).
The PAC sets forth rights and duties of the Borrower and HUD with respect to the project and the project assistance payments.
(b)
PAC execution.
(1) Upon satisfactory completion of the project, the Borrower and HUD shall execute the PAC on the form prescribed by HUD.
(2) The effective date of the PAC may be earlier than the date of execution, but no earlier than the date of HUD's issuance of the permission to occupy.
(3) If the project is completed in stages, the procedures of paragraph (b) of this section shall apply to each stage.
(c)
Project assistance payments to owners under the PAC.
The project assistance payments made under the PAC are:
(1) Payments to the Borrower to assist eligible families leasing assisted units. The amount of the project assistance payment made to the Borrower for an assisted unit (or residential space in a group home) that is leased to an eligible family is equal to the difference between the contract rent for the unit (or pro rata share of the contract rent in a group home) and the tenant rent payable by the family.
(2) Payments to the Borrower for vacant assisted units (“vacancy payments”). The amount of and conditions for vacancy payments are described in § 891.790. HUD makes the project assistance payments monthly upon proper requisition by the Borrower, except payments for vacancies of more than 60 days, which HUD makes semiannually upon requisition by the Borrower.
(d)
Payment of utility reimbursement.
If applicable, a utility reimbursement will be paid to a family occupying an assisted unit in an independent living complex as an additional project assistance payment. The PAC will provide that the Borrower will make this payment on behalf of HUD. Funds will be paid to the Borrower in trust solely for the purpose of making the additional payment. The Borrower may pay the utility reimbursement jointly to the family and the utility company, or, if the family and utility company consent, directly to the utility company.
§ 891.710
Term of PAC.
The term of the PAC shall be 20 years. If the project is completed in stages, the term of the PAC for each stage shall be 20 years. The term of the PAC for stages of a project shall not exceed 22 years.
§ 891.715
Maximum annual commitment and project account.
(a)
Maximum annual commitment.
The maximum annual amount that may be committed under the PAC is the total of the initial contract rents and utility allowances for all assisted units in the project.
(b)
Project account.
(1) HUD will establish and maintain a specifically identified and segregated project account for each project. The project account will be established out of the amounts by which the maximum annual commitment exceeds the amount actually paid out under the PAC each year. HUD will make payments from this account for project assistance payments as needed to cover increases in contract rents or decreases in tenant income and other payments for costs specifically approved by the Secretary.
(2) If the HUD-approved estimate of required annual payments under the PAC for a fiscal year exceeds the maximum annual commitment for that fiscal year plus the current balance in the project account, HUD will, within a reasonable time, take such steps authorized by section 202(h)(4)(A) of the Housing Act of 1959, as may be necessary, to assure that payments under the PAC will be adequate to cover increases in contract rents and decreases in tenant income.
§ 891.720
Leasing to eligible families.
(a)
Availability of assisted units for occupancy by eligible families.
During the term of the PAC, a Borrower shall make all units (or residential spaces in a group home) available for eligible families. For purposes of this section, making units or residential spaces available for occupancy by eligible families means that the Borrower:
(1) Is conducting marketing in accordance with § 891.740(a);
(2) Has leased or is making good faith efforts to lease the units or residential spaces to eligible and otherwise acceptable families, including taking all feasible actions to fill vacancies by renting to such families; and (3) Has not rejected any such applicant family except for reasons acceptable to HUD. If the Borrower is temporarily unable to lease all units or residential spaces to eligible families, one or more units or
residential spaces may, with the prior approval of HUD, be leased to otherwise eligible families that do not meet the income requirements of part 813 of this chapter, as modified by § 891.505. Failure on the part of the Borrower to comply with these requirements is a violation of the PAC and grounds for all available legal remedies, including an action for specific performance of the PAC, suspension or debarment from HUD programs, and reduction of the number of units (or in the case of group homes, reduction of the number of residential spaces) under the PAC as set forth in paragraph (b) of this section.
(3) Has not rejected any such applicant family except for reasons acceptable to HUD. If the Borrower is temporarily unable to lease all units or residential spaces to eligible families, one or more units or residential spaces may, with the prior approval of HUD, be leased to otherwise eligible families that do not meet the income requirements of part 5, subpart F of this title. Failure on the part of the Borrower to comply with these requirements is a violation of the PAC and grounds for all available legal remedies, including an action for specific performance of the PAC, suspension or debarment from HUD programs, and reduction of the number of units (or in the case of group homes, reduction of the number of residential spaces) under the PAC as set forth in paragraph (b) of this section.
(b)
Reduction of number of units covered by the PAC.
HUD may reduce the number of units (or in the case of group homes, the number of residential spaces) covered by the PAC to the number of units or residential spaces available for occupancy by eligible families if:
(1) The Borrower fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section; or
(2) Notwithstanding any prior approval by HUD, HUD determines that the inability to lease units or residential spaces to eligible families is not a temporary problem.
(c)
Restoration.
HUD will agree to an amendment of the PAC to provide for subsequent restoration of any reduction made under paragraph (b) of this section if:
(1) HUD determines that the restoration is justified by demand;
(2) The Borrower otherwise has a record of compliance with the Borrower's obligations under the PAC; and
(3) Contract and budget authority is available.
(d)
Occupancy by families that are not handicapped.
HUD may relieve the Borrower of the requirement that all units in the project (or residential spaces in a group home) must be leased to handicapped families if:
(1) The Borrower has made reasonable efforts to lease to eligible families;
(2) The Borrower has been granted HUD approval under paragraph (a) of this section; and
(3) The Borrower is temporarily unable to achieve or maintain a level of occupancy sufficient to prevent financial default and foreclosure under the Section 202 loan documents. HUD approval under this paragraph will be of limited duration. HUD may impose terms and conditions to this approval that are consistent with program objectives and necessary to protect its interest in the Section 202 loan.

§ 891.730
Default by Borrower.
(a)
PAC provisions.
The PAC will provide:
(1) That if HUD determines that the Borrower is in default under the PAC, HUD will notify the Borrower of the actions required to be taken to cure the default and of the remedies to be applied by HUD, including an action for specific performance under the PAC, reduction or suspension of project assistance payment and recovery of overpayments, as appropriate; and
(2) That if the Borrower fails to cure the default, HUD has the right to terminate the PAC or to take other corrective action.
(b)
Loan provisions.
Additional provisions governing default under the Section 202 loan are included in the regulatory agreement and other loan documents.
§ 891.735
Notice upon PAC expiration.
The PAC will provide that the Borrower will, at least 90 days before the end of the PAC contract term, notify each family occupying an assisted unit (or residential space in a group home) of any increase in the amount the family will be required to pay as rent as a result of the expiration. The notice of expiration will contain such information and will be served in such manner as HUD may prescribe.
§ 891.740
Responsibilities of Borrower.
(a)
Marketing.
(1) The Borrower must commence and continue diligent marketing activities not later than 90 days before the anticipated date of availability for occupancy of the group home or the anticipated date of availability of the first unit in an independent living complex. Market activities shall include the provision of notices of the availability of housing under the program to operators of temporary housing for the homeless in the same housing market.
(2) Marketing must be done in accordance with the HUD-approved affirmative fair housing marketing plan and all fair housing and equal opportunity requirements. The purpose of the plan and requirements is to achieve a condition in which eligible families of similar income levels in the same housing market have a like range of housing choices available to them regardless of their race, color, religion, sex (including actual or perceived sexual orientation and gender identity), disability, familial status, or national origin.
(3) At the time of PAC execution, the Borrower must submit to HUD a list of leased and unleased assisted units (or in the case of a group home, leased and unleased residential spaces) with a justification for the unleased units or residential spaces, in order to qualify for vacancy payments for the unleased units or residential spaces.
(b)

§ 891.745
Replacement reserve.
The general requirements for the replacement reserve are provided in § 891.605. For projects funded under §§ 891.655 through 891.790, the amount of the deposits for the initial year of operation shall be an amount equal to 0.6 percent of the cost of the total structures (for new construction projects), 0.4 percent of the cost of the initial mortgage amount (for all other projects), or such higher rate as required by HUD. For the purposes of this section, total structures include main buildings, accessory buildings, garages, and other buildings. The amount of the deposits will be adjusted each year by the amount of the annual adjustment factor as described in part 888 of this chapter.
§ 891.750
Selection and admission of tenants.
(a)
Application for admission.
The Borrower must accept applications for admission to the project in the form prescribed by HUD. Applicant families applying for assisted units (or residential spaces in a group home) must complete a certification of eligibility as part of the application for admission. Applicant families must meet the disclosure and verification requirements for Social Security Numbers, and sign and submit consent forms for the obtaining of wage and claim information from State Wage Information Collection Agencies, as provided by 24 CFR part 5,
subpart B. Both the Borrower and the applicant family must complete and sign the application for admission. On request, the Borrower must furnish copies of all applications for admission to HUD.
(b)
Determination of eligibility and selection of tenants.
The Borrower is responsible for determining whether applicants are eligible for admission and for the selection of families. To be eligible for admission, an applicant family must be a family that includes a person with a disability (that meets the definition of “handicapped family” in 24 CFR 891.505); meet any project occupancy requirements approved by HUD; meet the disclosure and verification requirements for Social Security Numbers, as provided by 24 CFR part 5, subpart B; and be a low-income family, as defined in part 5, subpart F of this title, as modified by 24 CFR 891.505. Under certain circumstances, HUD may permit the leasing of units (or residential space in a group home) to ineligible families under § 891.720.
(1)
Local residency requirements are prohibited.
Local residency preferences may be applied in selecting tenants only to the extent that they are not inconsistent with affirmative fair housing marketing objectives and the Borrower's HUD-approved affirmative fair housing marketing plan. Preferences may not be based on the length of time the applicant has resided in the jurisdiction. With respect to any residency preference, persons expected to reside in the community as a result of current or planned employment will be treated as residents.
(2) If the Borrower determines that the family is eligible and is otherwise acceptable and units (or residential spaces in a group home) are available, the Borrower will assign the family a unit or residential space in a group home. If the family will occupy an assisted unit the Borrower will assign the family a unit of the appropriate size in accordance with HUD standards. If no suitable unit (or residential space in a group home) is available, the Borrower will place the family on a waiting list for the project and notify the family when a suitable unit or residential space may become available. If the waiting list is so long that the applicant would not be likely to be admitted within the next 12 months, the Borrower may advise the applicant that no additional applications for admission are being considered for that reason.
(3) If the Borrower determines that an applicant is ineligible for admission or the Borrower is not selecting the applicant for other reasons, the Borrower will promptly notify the applicant in writing of the determination, the reasons for the determination, and that the applicant has a right to request a meeting to review the rejection, in accordance with HUD requirements. The review, if requested, may not be conducted by the member of the Borrower's staff who made the initial decision to reject the applicant. The applicant may also exercise other rights, including filing a complaint with HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity, if the applicant believes the applicant is being discriminated against on the basis of race, color, religion, sex (including actual or perceived sexual orientation and gender identity), disability, familial status, or national origin.
(4) Records on applicants and approved eligible families, which provide racial, ethnic, gender and place of previous residency data required by HUD, must be maintained and retained for three years.
(c)
Reexamination of family income and composition
—(1)
Regular reexaminations.
If the family occupies an assisted unit (or residential space in a group home), the Borrower must reexamine the income and composition of the family at least every 12 months. Upon verification of the information, the Borrower shall make appropriate adjustments in the total tenant payment in accordance with § 5.657 of this title and must adjust the rent. The Borrower must also request an appropriate adjustment to the project assistance payment. Further, the Borrower must determine whether the family's unit size is still appropriate and must carry out any unit transfer in accordance with HUD standards. At the time of reexamination, the Borrower must require the family to meet the disclosure and verification requirements for Social Security Numbers, as provided by
24 CFR part 5, subpart B. For requirements regarding the signing and submitting of consent forms by families for obtaining wage and claim information from State Wage Information Collection Agencies, see 24 CFR part 5, subpart B.
(2)
Interim reexamination.
If the family occupies an assisted unit (or residential space in a group home) the family must comply with the provisions in § 5.657 of this title regarding interim reporting of changes in income. If the Borrower receives information concerning a change in the family's income or other circumstances between regularly scheduled reexaminations, the Borrower must consult with the family and make any adjustments determined to be appropriate. See 24 CFR part 5, subpart B, for the requirements for the disclosure and verification of Social Security Number at interim reexaminations involving new household members. For requirements regarding the signing and submitting of consent forms by families for obtaining wage and claim information from State Wage Information Collection agencies, see 24 CFR part 5, subpart B. Any change in the family's income or other circumstances that result in an adjustment in the total tenant payment, tenant rent, or project assistance payment must be verified.
(3)
Continuation of project assistance payment.
(i) A family occupying an assisted unit (or residential space in a group home) shall remain eligible for project assistance payments until the total tenant payment equals or exceeds the gross rent (or a pro rata share of the gross rent in a group home). The termination of subsidy eligibility will not affect the family's other rights under its lease. Project assistance payments may be resumed if, as a result of changes in income, rent, or other relevant circumstances during the term of the PAC, the family meets the income eligibility requirements of § 5.657 of this title (as modified in § 891.105) and project assistance is available for the unit or residential space under the terms of the PAC. The family will not be required to establish its eligibility for admission to the project under the remaining requirements of paragraph (b) of this section.
(ii) A family's eligibility for project assistance payment may also be terminated in accordance with HUD requirements for such reasons as failure to submit requested verification information, including failure to meet the disclosure and verification requirements for Social Security Numbers, or failure to sign and submit consent forms for the obtaining of wage and claim information from State Wage Information Collection Agencies, as provided by 24 CFR part 5, subpart B.
(4)
Streamlined income determination.
An owner may elect to follow the provisions of 24 CFR 5.657(d).

Conditions for receipt of vacancy payments for assisted units.
(a)
General.
Vacancy payments under the PAC will not be made unless the conditions for receipt of these project assistance payments set forth in this section are fulfilled.
(b)
Vacancies during rent-up.
For each unit (or residential space in a group home) that is not leased as of the effective date of the PAC, the Borrower is entitled to vacancy payments in the amount of 80 percent of the contract rent (or pro rata share of the contract rent for a group home) for the first 60 days of vacancy, if the Borrower:
(1) Complied with § 891.740;
(2) Has taken and continues to take all feasible actions to fill the vacancy; and
(3) Has not rejected any eligible applicant except for good cause acceptable to HUD.
(c)
Vacancies after rent-up.
If an eligible family vacates an assisted unit (or residential space in a group home) the Borrower is entitled to vacancy payments in the amount of 80 percent of the contract rent (or pro rata share of the contract rent in a group home) for the first 60 days of vacancy if the Borrower:
(1) Certifies that it did not cause the vacancy by violating the lease, the PAC, or any applicable law;
(2) Notified HUD of the vacancy or prospective vacancy and the reasons for the vacancy immediately upon learning of the vacancy or prospective vacancy;
(3) Has fulfilled and continues to fulfill the requirements specified in § 891.740(a)(2) and (3), and in paragraphs (b)(2) and (3) of this section; and
(4) For any vacancy resulting from the Borrower's eviction of an eligible family, certifies that it has complied with § 891.770.
(d)
Vacancies for longer than 60 days.
If an assisted unit (or residential space in a group home) continues to be vacant after the 60-day period specified in paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, HUD may approve additional vacancy payments for 60-day periods up to a total of 12 months in an amount equal to the principal and interest payments required to amortize that portion of the debt service attributable to the vacant unit (or, in the case of group homes, the residential space). Such payments may be approved if:
(1) The unit was in decent, safe, and sanitary condition during the vacancy period for which payment is claimed;
(2) The Borrower has fulfilled and continues to fulfill the requirements specified in paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, as appropriate; and
(3) The Borrower has demonstrated to the satisfaction of HUD that:
(i) For the period of vacancy, the project is not providing the Borrower with revenues at least equal to project expenses (exclusive of depreciation) and the amount of payments requested is not more than the portion of the deficiency attributable to the vacant unit (or residential space in a group home); and
(ii) The project can achieve financial soundness within a reasonable time.
(e)
Prohibition of double compensation for vacancies.
If the Borrower collects payments for vacancies from other sources (tenant rent, security deposits, payments under § 891.435(c), or governmental payments under other programs), the Borrower shall not be entitled to collect vacancy payments to the extent these collections from other
sources plus the vacancy payment exceed contract rent.

The purpose of this subpart is to establish rules allowing for, and regulating the participation of, for-profit limited partnerships, of which the sole general partner is a Nonprofit Organization meeting the requirements of 12 U.S.C. 1701q(k)(4) or 42 U.S.C. 8032(k)(6), in the development of housing for the elderly and persons with disabilities using mixed-finance development methods. These rules are intended to develop more supportive housing for the elderly and persons with disabilities by allowing the use of federal assistance, private capital and expertise, and low-income housing tax credits.
§ 891.802
Applicability of other provisions.
The provisions of 24 CFR part 891, subparts A through D, apply to this subpart F unless otherwise stated.
§ 891.805
Definitions.
In addition to the definitions at §§ 891.105, 891.205, and 891.305, the following definitions apply to this subpart:
Mixed-finance owner,
for the purpose of the mixed-finance development of housing under this part, means a single-asset, for-profit limited partnership of which a private nonprofit organization is the sole general partner. The purpose of the mixed-finance owner must include the promotion of the welfare of the elderly or persons with disabilities, as appropriate.
Private nonprofit organization,
for the purpose of this subpart, means:
(1) In the case of supportive housing for the elderly:
(i) An organization that meets the requirements of the definition of “private nonprofit organization” in § 891.205; and
(ii) A for-profit limited partnership, the sole general partner of which owns at least one-hundredth of one percent of the partnership assets, whereby the sole general partner is either: an organization meeting the requirements of § 891.205 or a for-profit corporation wholly owned and controlled by one or more organizations meeting the requirements of § 891.205 or a limited liability company wholly owned and controlled by one or more organizations meeting the requirements of § 891.205. If the project will include units financed with the use of federal Low-Income Housing Tax Credits and the organization is a limited partnership, the requirements of section 42 of the IRS code, including the requirements of section 42(h)(5), apply. The general partner may also be the sponsor, so long as it meets the requirements of this part for sponsors and general partners.
(2) In the case of supportive housing for persons with disabilities:
(i) An organization that meets the requirements of the definition of “private nonprofit organization” in § 891.305; and
(ii) A for-profit limited partnership, the sole general partner of which owns at least one-hundredth of one percent of the partnership assets, whereby the sole general partner is either: an organization meeting the requirements of § 891.305 or a corporation owned and controlled by an organization meeting the requirements of § 891.305. If the project will include units financed with the use of federal Low-Income Housing Tax Credits and the organization is a limited partnership, the requirements of section 42 of the IRS code, including the requirements of section 42(h)(5), apply. The general partner may also be the sponsor, so long as it meets the requirements of this part for sponsors and general partners.
[78 FR 37113, June 20, 2013]
§ 891.808
Capital advance funds.
(a) HUD is authorized to provide capital advance funds to expand the supply of supportive housing for the elderly and persons with disabilities in accordance with the rules and regulations of
the Section 202 and Section 811 supportive housing programs. For mixed-finance projects, HUD provides a capital advance funds reservation to the sponsor, which transfers the fund reservation to the mixed-finance owner meeting the requirements of this subpart. The sponsor may transfer the fund reservation directly to the owner or to the general partner of the owner, or the sponsor may be the general partner of the mixed-finance owner if the sponsor meets the applicable statutory and regulatory requirements.
(b) Developments built with mixed-finance funds may combine Section 202 or Section 811 units with other units, which may or may not benefit from federal assistance. The number of Section 202 or Section 811 supportive housing units must not be less than the number specified in the agreement letter for a capital advance. In the case of a Section 811 mixed-finance project, the additional units cannot cause the project to exceed the applicable Section 811 project size limit if they will also house persons with disabilities.
§ 891.809
Limitations on capital advance funds.
Capital advances are not available in connection with:
(a) Acquisition of facilities currently owned and operated by the sponsor as housing for the elderly, except with rehabilitation as defined in 24 CFR 891.105;
(b) The financing or refinancing of federally assisted or insured projects;
(c) Facilities currently owned and operated by the sponsor as housing for persons with disabilities, except with rehabilitation as defined in 24 CFR 891.105; or
(d) Units in Section 202 direct loan projects previously refinanced under the provisions of section 811 of the American Homeownership and Economic Opportunity Act of 2000, 12 U.S.C. 1701q note.
§ 891.810
Project rental assistance.
Project Rental Assistance is defined in § 891.105. Project Rental Assistance is provided for operating costs, not covered by tenant contributions, attributable to the number of units funded by capital advances under the Section 202 and Section 811 supportive housing programs, subject to the provisions of 24 CFR 891.445. The sponsor of a mixed-finance development must obtain the necessary funds from a source other than project rental assistance funds for operating costs related to non-202 or -811 units.
§ 891.813
Eligible uses for assistance provided under this subpart.
(a) Assistance under this subpart may be used to finance the construction, reconstruction, or rehabilitation of a structure or a portion of a structure; or the acquisition of a structure to be used as supportive housing for the elderly; or the acquisition of housing to be used as supportive housing for persons with disabilities. Such assistance may also cover the cost of real property acquisition, site improvement, conversion, demolition, relocation, and other expenses that the Secretary determines are necessary to expand the supply of supportive housing for the elderly and persons with disabilities.
(b) Assistance under this subpart may not be used for excess amenities, as stated in § 891.120(c), or for Section 202 “prohibited facilities,” as stated in § 891.220. Such amenities or Section 202 prohibited facilities may be included in a mixed-finance development only if:
(1) The amenities or prohibited facilities are not financed, maintained, or operated with funds provided under the Section 202 or Section 811 program;
(2) The amenities or prohibited facilities are designed with appropriate safeguards for the residents' health and safety; and
(3) The assisted residents are not required to use, participate in, or pay a fee for the use or maintenance of the amenities or prohibited facilities, although they are permitted to do so voluntarily. Any fee charged for the use, maintenance, or access to amenities or prohibited facilities by residents must be reasonable and affordable for all residents of the development.
(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, § 891.315 on “prohibited facilities” shall apply to mixed-
finance developments containing units assisted under Section 811.
[70 FR 54210, Sept. 13, 2005, as amended at 78 FR 37114, June 20, 2013]
§ 891.815
Mixed-finance developer's fee.
(a)
Mixed-finance developer's fee.
A mixed-finance developer may include, on an up-front or deferral basis, or a combination of both, a fee to cover reasonable profit and overhead costs.
(b)
Mixed-finance developer's fee cap.
No mixed-finance developer's fee may be a greater percentage of the total project replacement costs than the percentage allowed by the state housing finance agency or other tax credit allocating agency in the state in which the mixed-finance development is sited. In no event may the mixed-finance developer's fee exceed 15 percent of the total project replacement cost.
(c)
Sources of mixed-finance developer's fee.
The mixed-finance developer's fee may be paid from project income or project sources of funding other than Section 202 or 811 capital advances, project rental assistance, or tenant rents.
§ 891.818
Firm commitment application.
The sponsor will submit the firm commitment application including the mixed-finance proposal in a form described by HUD.
§ 891.820
Civil rights requirements.
The mixed-finance development must comply with the following: all fair housing and accessibility requirements, including the design and construction requirements of the Fair Housing Act; the requirements of section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973; accessibility requirements, project standards, and site and neighborhood standards under 24 CFR 891.120, 891.125, 891.210, 891.310, and 891.320, as applicable; and 24 CFR 8.4(b)(5), which prohibits the selection of a site or location which has the purpose or effect of excluding persons with disabilities from federally assisted programs or activities.
§ 891.823
HUD review and approval.
HUD will review and may approve or disapprove the firm commitment application and mixed finance proposal.
§ 891.825
Mixed-finance closing documents.
The mixed-finance owner must submit the mixed-finance closing documents in the form prescribed by HUD. The materials shall be submitted after the firm commitment has been issued and prior to capital advance closing.
§ 891.830
Drawdown.
(a) Upon its approval of the executed mixed-finance closing documents and other documents submitted and upon determining that such documents are satisfactory, and after the capital advance closing, HUD may approve the drawdown of capital advance funds in accordance with the HUD-approved drawdown schedule.
(b) Non-capital advance funds may be disbursed before capital advance proceeds or the capital advance funds may be drawn down in an approved ratio to other funds, in accordance with a drawdown schedule approved by HUD.
(c) Each drawdown of funds constitutes a certification by the mixed-finance owner that:
(1) All the representations and warranties submitted in accordance with this subpart continue to be valid, true, and in full force and effect;
(2) All parties are in compliance with their obligations pursuant to this subpart, which, by their terms, are applicable at the time of the drawdown of funds;
(3) All conditions precedent to the drawdown of the funds by the mixed-finance owner have been satisfied;
(4) The capital advance funds drawn down will be used only for eligible costs actually incurred in accordance with the provisions of this subpart and the approved mixed-finance project, which include costs stated in 12 U.S.C. 1701q(h) and 42 U.S.C. 8013(h). Capital advance funds may be used for paying off bridge or construction financing, or repaying or collateralizing bonds, but only for the portion of such financing or bonds that was used for capital advance units; and
(5) The amount of the drawdown is consistent with the ratio of 202 or 811 supportive housing units to other units.
[70 FR 54210, Sept. 13, 2005, as amended at 78 FR 37114, June 20, 2013]
§ 891.832
Prohibited relationships.
(a) Paragraph (a) of § 891.130, describing conflicts of interest, applies to mixed finance developments.

[78 FR 37114, June 20, 2013]
§ 891.833
Monitoring and review.
HUD shall monitor and review the development during the construction and operational phases in accordance with the requirements that HUD prescribes. In order for units assisted under the 202 and 811 programs to continue to receive project rental assistance, they must be operated in accordance with all contractual agreements among the parties and other HUD regulations and requirements. It is the responsibility of the mixed-finance owner and Nonprofit Organization to ensure compliance with the preceding sentence.
§ 891.835
Eligible uses of project rental assistance.
(a) Section 202 or 811 project rental assistance may be used to pay the necessary and reasonable operating costs, as defined in 24 CFR 891.105 and approved by HUD, not met from project income and attributed to Section 202 or 811 supportive housing units. Operating cost standards under 24 CFR 891.150 apply to developments under this part.
(b) Section 202 or 811 project rental assistance may not be used to pay for:
(1) Debt service on construction or permanent financing, or any refinancing thereof, for any units in the development, including the 202 or 811 supportive housing units;
(2) Cash flow distributions to owners; or
(3) Creation of reserves for non-202 or -811 units.
(c) HUD-approved operating costs attributable to common areas or to the development as a whole, such as groundskeeping costs and general administrative costs, may be paid from project rental assistance on a pro-rata basis according to the percentage of 202 or 811 supportive housing units as compared to the total number of units.
§ 891.840
Site and neighborhood standards.
For section 202 or 811 mixed-finance developments, the site and neighborhood standards described at § 891.125 and § 891.320 apply to the entire mixed-finance development.
§ 891.848
Project design and cost standards.
(a) The project design and cost standards at § 891.120 apply to mixed-finance developments under this subpart, with the exception of § 891.120(c), subject to the provisions of § 891.813(b).
(b) For Section 202 mixed-finance developments, the prohibited facilities requirements described at § 891.220 shall apply to only the capital advance-funded portion of the Section 202 mixed-finance developments under this subpart, subject to the provisions of § 891.813(b).
(c) For Section 811 mixed-finance developments, the prohibited facilities requirements described at § 891.315 shall apply to the entire mixed-finance development.
[78 FR 37114, June 20, 2013]
§ 891.853
Development cost limits.
The Development Cost Limits for development activities, as established at § 891.140, apply to Section 202 or 811 supportive housing units in mixed-finance developments under this subpart.
§ 891.855
Replacement reserves.
(a) The mixed-finance owner shall establish and maintain a replacement reserve account for Section 202 or 811 supportive housing units. This account must meet all the requirements of 24 CFR 891.405.
(b) The mixed-finance owner may obtain a disbursement from the reserve only if the funds will be used to pay for capital replacement costs for the Section 202 or 811 supportive housing units in the mixed-finance development and in accordance with the terms of the regulatory and operating agreement. In
the case of repairs to common elements, the Section 202/811 replacement reserve can be used on a pro rata basis based on the percentage of Section 202 or 811 units in the building whose common elements are being repaired. In the event of a disposition of the mixed-finance development, or the dissolution of the owner, any Section 202 or 811 funds remaining in the replacement reserve account must remain dedicated to the Section 202 or 811 supportive housing units to ensure their long-term viability, or as otherwise agreed by HUD.
(c) Subject to HUD's approval, reserves may be used to reduce the number of Section 202 or 811 dwelling units in the development for the purpose of retrofitting units that are obsolete or unmarketable.
§ 891.860
Operating reserves.
(a) The mixed-finance owner shall maintain an operating reserve account in an amount sufficient to cover the operating expenses of the development for at least a three-month period.
(b) Project income, project rental assistance, tenant rents, and tax credit equity may be used to fund the operating reserve account.
(c) Amounts derived from Section 202 or 811 (
e.g.
, project income, project rental assistance, and tenant rents) in operating reserve accounts may only be used for the operating expenses of the 202 or 811 units.
§ 891.863
Maintenance as supportive housing units for elderly persons and persons with disabilities.
(a) The mixed-finance owner must develop and continue to operate the same number of supportive housing units for elderly persons or persons with disabilities, as stated in the use agreement or other document establishing the number of assisted units, for a 40-year period.
(b) If a mixed-finance development proposal provides that the Section 202 or 811 supportive housing units will be floating units, the mixed-finance owner must operate the HUD-approved percentage of Section 202 or 811 supportive housing units, and maintain the percentage distribution of bedroom sizes of Section 202 or 811 supportive housing units for the entire term of the very low-income use restrictions on the development. Any foreclosure, sale, or other transfer of the development must be subject to a covenant running with the land requiring the continued adherence to the very low-income use restrictions for the Section 202 or 811 supportive housing units.
(c) The owner must ensure that Section 202 or 811 supportive housing units in the development are and continue to be comparable to unassisted units in terms of location, size, appearance, and amenities. If due to a change in the partnership structure it becomes necessary to establish a new owner partnership or to transfer the supportive housing project, the new or revised owner must be a single-purpose entity and the use restrictions must remain in effect as provided above.
§ 891.865
Sanctions.
In the event that Section 202 or 811 supportive housing units are not developed and operated in accordance with all applicable federal requirements, HUD may impose sanctions on the participating parties and seek legal or equitable relief in enforcing all requirements under Section 202, the Housing Act of 1959, or Section 811 of the National Affordable Housing Act, all implementing regulations and requirements and contractual obligations under the mixed-finance documents.

# Subpart A—General Provisions
§ 902.1
Purpose, scope, and general matters.
(a)
Purpose.
The purpose of the Public Housing Assessment System (PHAS) is to improve the delivery of services in public housing and enhance trust in the public housing system among public housing agencies (PHAs), public housing residents, and the general public, by providing a management tool for effectively and fairly measuring the performance of a PHA in essential housing operations of projects, on a program-wide basis and individual project basis, and providing rewards for high performers and remedial requirements for poor performers.
(b)
Scope.
PHAS is a strategic measure of the essential housing operations of projects and PHAs. PHAS does not evaluate the compliance of a project or PHA with every HUD-wide or program-specific requirement or objective. Although not specifically evaluated through PHAS, PHAs are responsible for complying with nondiscrimination and equal opportunity requirements, including but not limited to those specified in 24 CFR 5.105, for affirmatively furthering fair housing, requirements under section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794), and requirements of other federal programs under
which the PHA is receiving assistance. A PHA's adherence to these requirements will be monitored in accordance with the applicable program regulations and the PHA's Annual Contributions Contract (ACC).
(c)
PHAS indicators.
HUD will assess and score the performance of projects and PHAs based on the indicators, which are more fully addressed in § 902.9: Physical condition, financial condition, management operations, and the Capital Fund program.
(d)
Assessment tools.
HUD will make use of uniform and objective criteria for the physical inspection of projects and PHAs and the financial assessment of projects and PHAs, and will use data from appropriate agency data systems to assess management operations. For the Capital Fund program indicator, HUD will use information provided in the electronic Line of Credit Control System (eLOCCS), the Public Housing Information Center (PIC), or their successor systems. On the basis of this data, HUD will assess and score the results, advise PHAs of their scores, and identify low-scoring and poor-performing projects and PHAs so that these projects and PHAs will receive the appropriate attention and assistance.
(e)
Small PHAs.
A PHA with fewer than 250 units that does not convert to asset management will be considered as one project by HUD.
(f) HUD's s
coring procedures
will be published from time to time in the
Federal Register
for public comment.
§ 902.3
Definitions.
As used in this part:
Act
means the U.S. Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437
et seq.
)
Alternative management entity (AME)
is a receiver, private contractor, private manager, or any other entity that is under contract with a PHA, under a management agreement with a PHA, or that is otherwise duly appointed or contracted (for example, by court order or agency action), to manage all or part of a PHA's operations.
Assessed fiscal year
is the PHA fiscal year that has been/is being assessed under PHAS.
Assistant Secretary
means the Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing.
Capital Fund-troubled
refers to a PHA that does not meet the minimum passing score of 5 points or 50 percent under the Capital Fund indicator.
Corrective Action Plan
means a plan, as provided in § 902.73(a), that is developed by a PHA that specifies the actions to be taken, including timetables, that shall be required to correct deficiencies identified under any of the PHAS indicators and subindicators, and identified as a result of a PHAS assessment, when a memorandum of agreement (MOA) is not required.
Days
mean calendar days, unless otherwise specified.
Decent, safe, sanitary housing and in good repair (DSS/GR)
is HUD's standard for acceptable basic housing conditions and the level to which a PHA is required to maintain its public housing.
Deficiency
means any finding or determination that requires corrective action, or any score below 60 percent of the available points for the physical condition, financial condition, or management operations indicators, and any score below 50 percent for the Capital Fund indicator. In the context of physical condition and physical inspection in subpart B of this part, “deficiency” means a specific problem, as described in the Dictionary of Deficiency Definitions, such as a hole in a wall or a damaged refrigerator in the kitchen that can be recorded for inspectable items.
Dictionary of Deficiency Definitions
means the documents published in the
Federal Register
that contain the inspection standards and scoring values pursuant to 24 CFR part 5, subpart G.
Direct Funded RMC
(DF-RMC) means a Resident Management Corporation to which HUD directly provides operating and capital assistance under the provisions of 24 CFR 964.225(h).
Inspectable areas (
or
area)
mean any of the three major components of public housing that are inspected, which are: inside, outside, and unit.
Inspectable item
means the individual parts, such as walls, kitchens, bathrooms, and other things, to be inspected in an inspectable area.
Memorandum of Agreement (MOA)
is defined in § 902.75(b).
Resident Management Corporation
(RMC) is defined in 24 CFR 964.7.
Unit-weighted average
means the average of the PHA's individual indicator scores, weighted by the number of units in each project, divided by the total number of units in all of the projects of the PHA. In order to compute a unit-weighted average, an individual project score for a particular indicator is multiplied by the number of units in each project to determine a “weighted value.” For example, for a PHA with two projects, one with 200 units and a score of 90, and the other with 100 units and a score of 60, the unit-weighted average score for the indicator would be (200 × 90 + 100 × 60)/300 = 80.
[76 FR 10149, Feb. 23, 2011, as amended at 88 FR 30500, May 11, 2023]
§ 902.5
Applicability.
(a)
PHAs, RMCs, AMEs.
This part applies to PHAs, Resident Management Corporations (RMCs), and AMEs. This part is also applicable to RMCs that receive direct funding from HUD in accordance with section 20 of the 1937 Act (DF-RMCs).
(1)
Scoring of RMCs and AMEs.
(i) RMCs and DF-RMCs will be assessed and issued their own numeric scores under PHAS based on the public housing or portions of public housing that they manage and the responsibilities they assume that can be scored under PHAS. References in this part to PHAs include RMCs, unless stated otherwise. References in this part to RMCs include DF-RMCs, unless stated otherwise.
(ii) AMEs are not issued PHAS scores. The performance of the AME contributes to the PHAS score of the project(s)/PHA(s) for which they assumed management responsibilities.
(2)
ACC.
The ACC makes a PHA legally responsible for all public housing operations, except where DF-RMC assumes management operations.
(i) Because the PHA and not the RMC or AME is ultimately responsible to HUD under the ACC, the PHAS score of a PHA will be based on all of the projects covered by the ACC, including those with management operations assumed by an RMC or AME (including a court-ordered or administrative receivership agreement, if applicable).
(ii) A PHA's PHAS score will not be based on projects managed by a DF-RMC.
(3) This part does not apply to Moving-to-Work (MTW) agencies that are specifically exempted in their grant agreement.
(b)
Implementation of PHAS.
The regulations in this part are applicable to PHAs beginning with the first fiscal year end date after the effective date of this rule, and thereafter.
§ 902.9
PHAS scoring.
(a)
Indicators and subindicators.
Each PHA will receive an overall PHAS score, rounded to the nearest whole number, based on the four indicators: Physical condition, financial condition, management operations, and the Capital Fund program. Each of these indicators contains subindicators, and the scores for the subindicators are used to determine a single score for each of these PHAS indicators. Individual project scores are used to determine a single score for the physical condition, financial condition, and management operations indicators. The Capital Fund program indicator score is entity-wide.
(b)
Overall PHAS score and indicators.
The overall PHAS score is derived from a weighted average of score values for the four indicators, as follows:
(1) The physical condition indicator is weighted 40 percent (40 points) of the overall PHAS score. The score for this indicator is obtained as indicated in subpart B of this part.
(2) The financial condition indicator is weighted 25 percent (25 points) of the overall PHAS score. The score for this indicator is obtained as indicated in subpart C of this part.
(3) The management operations indicator is weighted 25 percent (25 points) of the overall PHAS score. The score for this indicator is obtained as indicated in subpart D of this part.
(4) The Capital Fund program indicator is weighted 10 percent (10 points) of the overall PHAS score for all Capital Fund program grants for which
fund balances remain during the assessed fiscal year. The score for this indicator is obtained as indicated in subpart E of this part.
§ 902.11
PHAS performance designation.
All PHAs that receive a PHAS assessment shall receive a performance designation. The performance designation is based on the overall PHAS score and the four indicator scores, as set forth below.
(a)
High performer.
(1) A PHA that achieves a score of at least 60 percent of the points available under the financial condition, physical condition, and management operations indicators and at least 50 percent of the points available under the Capital Fund indicator, and achieves an overall PHAS score of 90 percent or greater of the total available points under PHAS shall be designated a high performer. A PHA shall not be designated a high performer if it scores below the threshold established for any indicator.
(2) High performers will be afforded incentives that include relief from reporting and other requirements, as described in § 902.71.
(b)
Standard performer.
(1) A PHA that is not a high performer shall be designated a standard performer if the PHA achieves an overall PHAS score of at least 60 percent, and at least 60 percent of the available points for the physical condition, financial condition, and management operations indicators, and at least 50 percent of the available points for the Capital Fund indicator.
(2) At HUD's discretion, a standard performer may be required by the field office to submit and operate under a Corrective Action Plan.
(c)
Substandard performer.
A PHA shall be designated a substandard performer if the PHA achieves a total PHAS score of at least 60 percent and achieves a score of less than 60 percent under one or more of the physical condition, financial condition, or management operations indicators. The PHA shall be designated as substandard physical, substandard financial, or substandard management, respectively. The HUD office with jurisdiction over the PHA shall require a Corrective Action Plan if the deficiencies have not already been addressed in a current Corrective Action Plan.
(d)
Troubled performer.
(1) A PHA that achieves an overall PHAS score of less than 60 percent shall be designated as a troubled performer.
(2) In accordance with section 6(j)(2)(A)(i) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 1437d(j)(2)(A)(i)), a PHA that receives less than 50 percent under the Capital Fund program indicator under subpart E of this part will be designated as a troubled performer and subject to the sanctions provided in section 6(j)(4) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 1437(d)(j)(4)).
§ 902.13
Frequency of PHAS assessments.
The frequency of a PHA's PHAS assessments is determined by the size of the PHA's Low-Rent program and its PHAS designation. HUD may, due to unforeseen circumstances or other cause as determined by HUD, extend the time between assessments by direct notice to the PHA and relevant resident organization or resident management entity, and any other general notice that HUD deems appropriate.
(a)
Small PHAs.
HUD will assess and score the performance of a PHA with fewer than 250 public housing units, as follows:
(1) A small PHA that is a high performer may receive a PHAS assessment every 3 years;
(2) A small PHA that is a standard or substandard performer may receive a PHAS assessment every other year; and
(3) All other small PHAs may receive a PHAS assessment every year, including a PHA that is designated as troubled or Capital Fund-troubled in accordance with § 902.75.
(b)
Frequency of scoring for PHAs with 250 units or more.
(1) All PHAs, other than stated in paragraph (a) of this section, may be assessed on an annual basis.
(2) The physical condition score for each project will determine the frequency of inspections of each project in accordance with the inspection cycle laid out in 24 CFR 5.705(c). The PHAS physical condition indicator score for an assessment period shall be calculated by taking the unit-weighted average of the most recent physical
condition score for each project, except that, starting July 1, 2023, no new physical condition indicator will be issued for a PHA until every project under the PHA has been inspected on or after July 1, 2023.
(3) If a PHA is designated as a troubled performer, all projects will receive a physical condition inspection regardless of the individual project physical condition score.
(4) In the baseline year, every PHA will receive an overall PHAS score and in all four of the PHAS indicators: Physical condition; financial condition; management operations; and Capital Fund program. This will allow a baseline for the physical condition inspections and the 3-2-1 inspection schedule, as well as a baseline year for the small deregulated PHAs.
(c)
Financial submissions.
HUD shall not issue a PHAS score for the unaudited and audited financial information in the years that a PHA is not being assessed under PHAS. Although HUD shall not issue a PHAS score under such circumstances, a PHA shall comply with the requirements for submission of annual unaudited and audited financial statements in accordance with subpart C of this part and 24 CFR 5.801.
[76 FR 10149, Feb. 23, 2011, as amended at 88 FR 30500, May 11, 2023]

# Subpart B—Physical Condition Indicator
§ 902.20
[Reserved]
§ 902.21
Physical condition standards for public housing.
Public housing must be maintained in a manner that meets the physical condition standards set forth in 24 CFR part 5, subpart G.
[88 FR 30500, May 11, 2023]
§ 902.22
Inspection of PHA projects.
The PHA's score for the physical condition indicator is based on an independent inspection of a PHA's project(s) provided by HUD and using the requirements and timelines laid out in 24 CFR part 5, subpart G, to ensure projects meet acceptable basic housing conditions. Mixed-finance projects will be subject to the physical condition inspections.
[88 FR 30501, May 11, 2023]
§ 902.24
[Reserved]
§ 902.25
Physical condition scoring and thresholds.
(a)
Scoring.
Under the physical condition indicator, a score will be calculated for individual projects, as well as for the overall condition of a PHA's public housing portfolio.
(b)
Overall PHA physical condition indicator score.
The overall physical condition indicator score is a unit-weighted average of project scores. The sum of the unit-weighted values is divided by the total number of units in the PHA's portfolio to derive the overall physical condition indicator score.
(c)
Thresholds.
(1) The project or projects' 100-point physical condition score is converted to a 40-point basis for the overall physical condition indicator score. The project scores on the 100-point basis are multiplied by .40 in order to derive a 40-point equivalent score to compute the overall physical condition score and overall PHAS score.
(2) In order to receive a passing score under the physical condition indicator, the PHA must achieve a score of at least 24 points, or 60 percent.
(3) A PHA that receives fewer than 24 points will be categorized as a substandard physical condition agency.
§ 902.26
[Reserved]

# Subpart C—Financial Condition Indicator
§ 902.30
Financial condition assessment.
(a)
Objective.
The objective of the financial condition indicator is to measure the financial condition of each public housing project within a PHA's public housing portfolio for the purpose of evaluating whether there are sufficient financial resources to support the provision of housing that is DSS/GR. Individual project scores for financial condition, as well as overall financial condition scores, will be issued.
(b)
Financial reporting standards.
A PHA's financial condition will be assessed under this indicator by measuring the combined performance of all public housing projects in each of the subindicators listed in § 902.35, on the basis of the annual financial report provided in accordance with § 902.33.
(c)
Exclusions.
Mixed-finance projects are excluded from the financial condition indicator.
§ 902.33
Financial reporting requirements.
(a)
Annual financial report.
All PHAs must submit their unaudited and audited financial data to HUD on an annual basis. The financial information must be:
(1) Prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), as further defined by HUD in supplementary guidance; and
(2) Submitted electronically in the format prescribed by HUD using the Financial Data Schedule (FDS).
(b)
Annual unaudited financial information report filing dates.
The unaudited financial information to be submitted to HUD in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section must be submitted to HUD annually, no later than 2 months after the PHA's fiscal year end, with no penalty applying until the 16th day of the 3rd month after the PHA's fiscal year end, in accordance with § 902.62.
(c)
Annual audited financial information compliance dates.
Audited financial statements will be required no later than 9 months after the PHA's fiscal year end, in accordance with the Single Audit Act and 2 CFR part 200, subpart F.
(d)
Year-end audited financial information.
All PHAs that meet the federal assistance threshold stated in the Single Audit Act and 2 CFR part 200, subpart F, must also submit year-end audited financial information.
(e)
Submission of information.
In addition to the submission of information required by paragraph (a) of this section, a PHA shall provide one copy of the completed audit report package and the Management Letter issued by the Independent Auditor to the local HUD field office having jurisdiction over the PHA.
[76 FR 10149, Feb. 23, 2011, as amended at 80 FR 75941, Dec. 7, 2015]
§ 902.35
Financial condition scoring and thresholds.
(a)
Scoring.
(1) Under the financial condition indicator, a score will be calculated for each project based on the values of financial condition subindicators and an overall financial condition score, as well as audit and internal control flags. Each financial condition subindicator has several levels of performance, with different point values for each level.
(2) The financial condition score for projects will be based on the annual financial condition information submitted to HUD for each project under 24 CFR 990.280 and 990.285. The financial condition score for PHAs will be based on a unit-weighted average of project scores.
(b)
Subindicators of the financial condition indicator.
The subindicators of financial condition indicator are:
(1)
Quick Ratio (QR).
The QR compares quick assets to current liabilities. Quick assets are cash and assets that are easily convertible to cash and do not include inventory. Current liabilities are those liabilities that are due within the next 12 months. A QR of less than one indicates that the project's ability to make payments on a timely basis may be at risk.
(2)
Months Expendable Net Assets Ratio (MENAR).
The MENAR measures a project's ability to operate using its net available, unrestricted resources without relying on additional funding. This ratio compares the adjusted net available unrestricted resources to the average monthly operating expenses. The result of this calculation shows how many months of operating expenses can be covered with currently available, unrestricted resources.
(3)
Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR).
The DSCR is the ratio of net operating income available to make debt payments, to the amount of the debt payments. This subindicator is used if the PHA has taken on long-term obligations. A DSCR of less than one would indicate that the project would have difficulty generating sufficient cash
flow to cover both its expenses and its debt obligations.
(c)
Overall PHA financial condition indicator score.
The overall financial condition indicator score is a unit-weighted average of project scores. The sum of the weighted values is then divided by the total number of units in the PHA's portfolio to derive the overall financial condition indicator score.
(d)
Thresholds.
(1) The PHA's financial condition score is based on a maximum of 25 points.
(2) In order for a PHA to receive a passing score under the financial condition indicator, the PHA must achieve a score of at least 15 points, or 60 percent of the available points under this indicator.
(3) A PHA that receives fewer than 15 points available under this indicator will be categorized as a substandard financial condition agency.

# Subpart D—Management Operations Indicator
§ 902.40
Management operations assessment.
(a)
Objective.
The objective of the management operations indicator is to measure the PHA's performance of management operations through the management performance of each project.
(b)
Exclusions.
Mixed-finance projects are excluded from the management operations indicator.
§ 902.43
Management operations performance standards.
(a)
Management operations subindicators.
The following subindicators listed in this section will be used to assess the management operations of projects and PHAs, consistent with section 6(j)(1) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 1437d(j)(1)). Individual project scores for management operations, as well as overall PHA management operations scores, will be issued.
(1)
Occupancy.
This subindicator measures the occupancy for the project's fiscal year, adjusted for allowable vacancies.
(2)
Tenant accounts receivable.
This subindicator measures the tenant accounts receivable of a project against the tenant charges for the project's fiscal year.
(3)
Accounts payable.
This subindicator measures the money that a project owes to vendors at the end of the project's fiscal year for products and services purchased on credit against total operating expenses.
(b)
Assessment under the Management Operations Indicator.
Projects will be assessed under this indicator through information that is electronically submitted to HUD through the FDS.
§ 902.44
Adjustment for physical condition and neighborhood environment.
(a)
General.
In accordance with section 6(j)(1)(I)(2) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 1437d(j)(1)(I)(2)), the overall management operations score for a project will be adjusted upward to the extent that negative conditions are caused by situations outside the control of the project. These situations are related to the poor physical condition of the project or the overall depressed condition of the major census tract in which a project is located. The intent of this adjustment is to avoid penalizing such projects, through appropriate application of the adjustment.
(b)
Definitions.
Definitions and application of physical condition and neighborhood environment factors are:
(1) Physical condition adjustment applies to projects at least 28 years old, based on the unit-weighted average Date of Full Availability (DOFA) date.
(2) Neighborhood environment adjustment applies to projects located in census tracts where at least 40 percent of the families have an income below the poverty rate, as documented by the most recent census data. If a project is located in more than one census tract, the census data for the census tract where the majority of the project's units are located shall be used.
(c)
Adjustment for physical condition and neighborhood environment.
HUD will adjust the management operations score of a project, subject to one or both of the physical condition and neighborhood environment conditions. The adjustments will be made to the overall management operations score for each project so as to reflect the difficulty in managing the projects. In
each instance where the actual management operations score is rated below the maximum score of 25 points, one point each will be added for physical condition and neighborhood environment, but not to exceed the maximum number of 25 points available for the management operations indicator.
(d)
Application of adjustment.
The adjustment for physical condition and neighborhood environment will be calculated by HUD and applied to all eligible projects.
§ 902.45
Management operations scoring and thresholds.
(a)
Scoring.
Under the management operations indicator, HUD will calculate a score for each project, as well as for the overall management operations of a PHA, that reflects weights based on the relative importance of the individual management subindicators.
(b)
Overall PHA management operations indicator score.
The overall management operations indicator score is a unit-weighted average of project scores. The sum of the weighted values is divided by the total number of units in the PHA's portfolio to derive the overall management operations indicator score.
(c)
Thresholds.
(1) The PHA's management operations score is based on a maximum of 25 points.
(2) In order to receive a passing score under the management operations indicator, a PHA must achieve a score of at least 15 points or 60 percent.
(3) A PHA that receives fewer than 15 points will be categorized as a substandard management operations agency.

# Subpart E—Capital Fund Program Indicator
§ 902.50
Capital Fund program assessment.
(a)
Objective.
The Capital Fund program indicator examines the period of time taken by a PHA to obligate funds and occupy units in relation to statutory deadlines for obligation for all Capital Fund program grants for which fund balances remain during the assessed fiscal year. Funds from the Capital Fund program under section 9(d) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 1437g(d)) do not include HOPE VI program funds.
(b)
Applicability.
This indicator is applicable on a PHA-wide basis, and not to individual projects. This indicator is not applicable to PHAs that choose not to participate in the Capital Fund program under section 9(d) of the Act.
(c)
Capital Fund subindicators.
The subindicators pursuant to section 9(d) of the Act are:
(1) Timeliness of fund obligation. This subindicator examines the period of time it takes for a PHA to obligate funds from the Capital Fund program under section 9(j)(1) of the 1937 Act (42 U.S.C. 1437g(9)(j)).
(2) Occupancy rate. This subindicator measures the PHA's occupancy rate as of the end of the PHA's fiscal year.
(d)
Method of assessment.
The assessment required under the Capital Fund program indicator will be performed through analysis of obligated amounts in HUD's eLOCCS (or its successor) for all Capital Fund program grants that were open during the assessed fiscal year. This subindicator measures a statutory requirement for the Capital Fund program. Other aspects of the Capital Fund program will be monitored by HUD through other types of reviews, and in this indicator through considering occupancy rates.
(1) PHAs are responsible to ensure that their Capital Fund program information is submitted to eLOCCS by the submission due date.
(2) A PHA may not appeal its PHAS score, Capital Fund program score, or both, based on the fact that it did not submit its Capital Fund program information to eLOCCS and/or the PIC systems by the submission due date.
§ 902.53
Capital Fund program scoring and thresholds.
(a)
Scoring.
The Capital Fund program indicator score provides an assessment of a PHA's ability to obligate Capital Fund program grants in a timely manner on capital and modernization needs.
(b)
Thresholds.
(1) The PHA's Capital Fund program score is based on a maximum of 10 points.
(2) In order to receive a passing score under the Capital Fund program indicator, a PHA must achieve a score of at least 5 points, or 50 percent.

# Subpart F—PHAS Scoring
§ 902.60
Data collection.
(a)
Fiscal year reporting period—limitation on changes after PHAS effective date.
To allow for a period of consistent assessments to refine and make necessary adjustments to PHAS, a PHA is not permitted to change its fiscal year for the first 3 full fiscal years following the effective date of this regulation, unless such change is approved by HUD for good cause.
(b)
Request for extension of time to submit unaudited financial information.
In the event of extenuating circumstances, a PHA may request extensions of time to submit its unaudited financial information. To receive an extension, a PHA must ensure that HUD receives the extension request electronically 15 days before the submission due date. The PHA's electronic extension request must include an objectively verifiable justification as to why the PHA cannot submit the information by the submission due date. PHAs shall submit their requests for extensions of time for the submission of unaudited financial information through the FASS-PH Secure Systems Web site. HUD shall forward its determination electronically to the requesting PHA.
(c)
Request for waiver of due date for PHA submission of audited financial information.
(1) HUD, for good cause, may grant PHAs a waiver of the due date of the submission of audited financial information to HUD. HUD shall consider written requests from PHAs for a waiver of the report submission due date (established by the Single Audit Act and 2 CFR part 200, subpart F, as no later than 9 months after the end of the fiscal year). The PHA's written request for a waiver of the due date of the submission of audited financial information must include an objectively verifiable justification as to why the PHA cannot submit the information by the submission due date. A PHA shall submit its written request for such a waiver, 30 days prior to the submission due date, to its local field office. HUD shall forward its written determination of the waiver request to the PHA and, if appropriate, establish a new submission due date for the audited financial information.
(2) A waiver of the due date for the submission of audited financial information to HUD does not relieve a PHA of its responsibility to submit its audited information to OMB's Federal Audit Clearinghouse no later than 9 months after the end of its fiscal year.
(d)
Rejected unaudited financial submissions.
When HUD rejects a PHA's year-end unaudited financial information after the due date, a PHA shall have 15 days from the date of the rejection to resubmit the information without a penalty being applied, in accordance with § 902.62.
(e)
Late points and late presumptive failure.
Late points and late presumptive failure will only be applied to the financial condition indicator since the management operations information is derived from the financial condition submission.
(f)
Score change.
A management operations score can change as a result of the audited submission since the management operations information is derived from the financial condition submission.
[76 FR 10149, Feb. 23, 2011, as amended at 80 FR 75941, Dec. 7, 2015]
§ 902.62
Failure to submit data.
(a)
Failure to submit data by due date.
(1) If a PHA without a finding of good cause by HUD does not submit its year-end financial information, required by this part, or submits its unaudited year-end financial information more than 15 days past the due date, appropriate sanctions may be imposed, including a reduction of one point in the total PHAS score for each 15-day period past the due date.
(2) If the unaudited year-end financial information is not received within 3 months past the due date, or extended due date, the PHA will receive a presumptive rating of failure for its unaudited information and shall receive zero points for its unaudited financial information and the final financial condition indicator score. The
subsequent timely submission of audited information does not negate the score of zero received for the unaudited year-end financial information submission.
(3) The PHA's audited financial statement must be received no later than 9 months after the PHA's fiscal year-end, in accordance with the Single Audit Act and 2 CFR part 200, subpart F. If the audited financial statement is not received by that date, the PHA will receive a presumptive rating of failure for the financial condition indicator.
(b)
Verification of information submitted.
(1) A PHA's year-end financial information and any supporting documentation are subject to review by an independent auditor, as authorized by section 6(j)(6) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 1437(d)(j)(6)). Appropriate sanctions for intentional false certification will be imposed, including civil penalties, suspension or debarment of the signatories, the loss of high performer designation, a lower score under the financial condition indicator, and a lower overall PHAS score.
(2) A PHA that cannot provide justifying documentation to HUD for the assessment under any indicator(s) or subindicator(s) shall receive a score of zero for the relevant indicator(s) or subindicator(s) and its overall PHAS score shall be lowered accordingly.
(c)
Failure to submit.
If a PHA does not submit its unaudited or audited information, it will receive a zero for management operations.
[76 FR 10149, Feb. 23, 2011, as amended at 80 FR 75941, Dec. 7, 2015]
§ 902.64
PHAS scoring and audit reviews.
(a)
Adjustments to PHAS score.
(1) Adjustments to the score may be made after a PHA's audit report for the fiscal year being assessed is transmitted to HUD. If significant differences are noted between unaudited and audited results, a PHA's PHAS score will be adjusted in accordance with the audited results.
(2) A PHA's PHAS score under individual indicators or subindicators, or its overall PHAS score, may be changed by HUD in accordance with data included in the audit report or obtained through such sources as HUD project management and other reviews, investigations by HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity, investigations or audits by HUD's Office of Inspector General, or reinspection by HUD, as applicable.
(b)
Issuance of a score by HUD.
(1) An overall PHAS score will be issued for each PHA after the later of one month after the submission due date for financial data or one month after submission by the PHA of its financial data. The overall PHAS score becomes the PHA's final PHAS score after any adjustments requested by the PHA and determined necessary under the processes provided in §§ 902.25(d), 902.35(a), and 902.68; any adjustments resulting from the appeal process provided in § 902.69; and any adjustments determined necessary as a result of the independent public accountant (IPA) audit.
(2) Each PHA (or RMC) shall post a notice of its final PHAS score and designation in appropriate conspicuous and accessible locations in its offices within 2 weeks of receipt of its final PHAS score and designation. In addition, HUD will post every PHA's PHAS score and designation on HUD's Internet site.
(c)
Review of audit.
(1)
Quality control review.
HUD may undertake a quality control review of the audit work papers or as part of the Department's ongoing quality assurance process.
(2)
Determination of deficiency.
If HUD determines that the PHA's financial statements, electronic financial submission, or audit are deficient, it shall notify the PHA of such determination in writing. The PHA will have 30 days in which to respond to the notice of deficiency and to establish that the determination is erroneous. Following consideration of any PHA response, HUD will issue a final determination in writing to the PHA.
(i)
Deficient financial statements.
Deficient financial statements are statements that are not presented, in some material respect, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, as set forth by the Government Accounting Standards Board, or if applicable, the Financial Accounting Standards Board.
(ii)
Deficient electronic submission.
A deficient electronic financial submission is a filing that was not made, in some material respect, in accordance with HUD requirements or attested to in accordance with the Standards for Attestation Engagements issued by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants or Generally Accepted Government Auditing Standards.
(iii)
Deficient audit.
A deficient audit is one that was not performed, in some material respect, in compliance with Generally Accepted Government Auditing Standards; Generally Accepted Auditing Standards; the Single Audit Act and 2 CFR part 200, subpart F, when applicable; or HUD requirements.
(3)
HUD actions.
If HUD determines that the financial statements, electronic financial submission, or audit are deficient, HUD may adjust the financial indicator score to zero and/or reduce the overall PHAS score in accordance with the provisions of this section. Additionally, if HUD determines that the audit is deficient, HUD may, at its discretion, elect to serve as the audit committee for the PHA for the next fiscal year and select the audit firm that will perform the audit in question.
[76 FR 10149, Feb. 23, 2011, as amended at 80 FR 75942, Dec. 7, 2015]
§ 902.66
Withholding, denying, and rescinding designation.
(a)
Withholding designation.
In exceptional circumstances, even though a PHA has satisfied all of the PHAS indicators for high performer or standard performer designation, HUD may conduct any review as it may determine necessary, and may deny or rescind incentives or high performer designation or standard performer designation, in the case of a PHA that:
(1) Is operating under a special agreement with HUD (
e.g.,
a civil rights compliance agreement);
(2) Is involved in litigation that bears directly upon the physical, financial, or management performance of a PHA;
(3) Is operating under a court order;
(4) Demonstrates substantial evidence of fraud or misconduct, including evidence that the PHA's certifications, submitted in accordance with this part, are not supported by the facts, as evidenced by such sources as a HUD review, routine reports, an Office of Inspector General investigation/audit, an independent auditor's audit, or an investigation by any appropriate legal authority; or
(5) Demonstrates substantial noncompliance in one or more areas of a PHA's required compliance with applicable laws and regulations, including areas not assessed under PHAS. Areas of substantial noncompliance include, but are not limited to, noncompliance with civil rights, nondiscrimination and fair housing laws and regulations, or the ACC. Substantial noncompliance casts doubt on the capacity of a PHA to preserve and protect its public housing projects and operate them consistent with federal laws and regulations.
(b)
High performer and standard designations.
If a high performer designation is denied or rescinded, the PHA shall be designated either a standard performer, substandard performer, or troubled performer, depending on the nature and seriousness of the matter or matters constituting the basis for HUD's action. If a standard performer designation is denied or rescinded, the PHA shall be designated as a substandard performer or troubled performer.
(c)
Effect on score.
The denial or rescission of a designation of high performer or standard performer shall not affect the PHA's numerical PHAS score, except where the denial or rescission is under paragraph (a)(4) of this section.
§ 902.68
[Reserved]
§ 902.69
PHA right of petition and appeal.
(a)
Appeal of troubled performer designation and petition for removal of troubled performer designation.
A PHA may take any of the following actions:
(1) Appeal its troubled performer designation (including Capital Fund program troubled performer designation);
(2) Appeal its final overall PHAS score;
(3) Petition for removal of troubled performer designation;
(4) Appeal any refusal of a petition to remove troubled performer designation; and
(5) Appeal actions under § 902.66.
(b)
Appeal of PHAS score.
(1) If a PHA believes that an objectively verifiable and material error(s) exists in any of the scores for its PHAS indicators, which, if corrected, will result in a significant change in the PHA's PHAS score and its designation (i.e., as troubled performer, substandard performer, standard performer, or high performer), the PHA may appeal its PHAS score in accordance with the procedures of paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) of this section. A significant change in a PHAS score is a change that would cause the PHA's PHAS score to increase, resulting in a higher PHAS designation for the PHA (i.e., from troubled performer to substandard performer or standard performer, or from standard performer to high performer).
(2) A PHA may not appeal its PHAS score, physical condition score, or both, based on the subsequent correction of deficiencies identified as a result of a project's physical inspection or the denial of a technical review request.
(3) A PHA may not appeal its PHAS score, Capital Fund program score, or both, based on the fact that it did not submit its Capital Fund program information to eLOCCS by the submission due date.
(c)
Appeal and petition procedures.
(1) To appeal a troubled performer designation or a final overall PHAS score, a PHA must submit a request in writing to the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Real Estate Assessment Center, which must be received by HUD no later than 30 days following the issuance of the overall PHAS score to the PHA. To petition the removal of a troubled performer designation, a PHA must submit its request in writing to the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Real Estate Assessment Center.
(2) To appeal the denial of a petition to remove a troubled performer designation, a PHA must submit a written request to the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Real Estate Assessment Center, which must be received by HUD no later than 30 days after HUD's decision to refuse to remove the PHA's troubled performer designation.
(3) To appeal the petition for the removal of a troubled performer designation, or appeal the denial of a petition to remove a troubled performer designation, a PHA shall submit its request in writing to the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Real Estate Assessment Center.
(4) An appeal of a troubled performer designation, the petition for removal of a troubled performer designation, or the appeal of a refusal of a petition to remove a troubled performer designation must include the PHA's supporting documentation and reasons for the appeal or petition. An appeal of a PHAS score must be accompanied by the PHA's evidence that a material error occurred. An appeal or petition submitted to HUD without supporting documentation will not be considered and will be returned to the PHA.
(d)
Denial, withholding, or rescission.
A PHA that disagrees with the basis for denial, withholding, or rescission of its designation under § 902.66 may make a written request for reinstatement within 30 days of notification by HUD of the denial or rescission of the designation to the Assistant Secretary, and the request shall include reasons for the reinstatement.
(e)
Consideration of petitions and appeals.
(1) Consideration of a petition or the appeal of a final overall PHAS score, of a troubled performer designation, or of a petition to remove troubled performer designation. Upon receipt of such an appeal or a petition from a PHA, HUD will evaluate the appeal and its merits for purposes of determining whether a reassessment of the PHA is warranted. HUD will review the PHA's file and the evidence submitted by the PHA to determine whether an error occurred.
(2) Consideration of an appeal of refusal to remove a troubled performer designation. Upon receipt of an appeal of refusal to remove a troubled performer designation, HUD will evaluate the appeal and its merits for the purposes of determining whether a reassessment of the PHA is warranted. The HUD staff initially evaluating an appeal of refusal to remove a troubled performer designation will not be the
same HUD staff who evaluated the PHA's petition to remove the troubled performer designation. The Assistant Secretary will render the final determination of such an appeal.
(f)
Notice and finality of decisions.
(1) If HUD determines that one or more objectively verifiable and material error has occurred, HUD will undertake a new inspection of the project, arrange for audit services, adjust the PHA's score, or perform other reexamination of the financial, management, or Capital Fund program information, as appropriate in light of the nature of the error that occurred. A new score will be issued and an appropriate performance designation made by HUD. HUD's decision on appeal of a PHAS score, issuance of a troubled performer designation, or refusal to remove a troubled performer designation will be final agency action. No reconsideration will be given by HUD of such decisions.
(2) HUD will issue a written decision on all appeals and petitions made under this section.

# Subpart G—PHAS Incentives and Remedies
§ 902.71
Incentives for high performers.
(a)
Incentives for high performer PHAs.
A PHA that is designated a high performer will be eligible for the following incentives, and such other incentives that HUD may determine appropriate and permissible under program statutes or regulations.
(1)
Relief from specific HUD requirements.
A PHA that is designated a high performer will be relieved of specific HUD requirements (
e.g.,
will receive fewer reviews and less monitoring), effective upon notification of a high performer designation.
(2)
Public recognition.
High performer PHAs and RMCs that receive a score of at least 60 percent of the points available for the physical condition, financial condition, and management operations indicators, and at least 50 percent of the points available for the Capital Fund indicator, and achieve an overall PHAS score of 90 percent or greater of the total available points under PHAS shall be designated a high performer and will receive a Certificate of Commendation from HUD, as well as special public recognition, as provided by the field office.
(3)
Bonus points in funding competitions.
A high performer PHA may be eligible for bonus points in HUD's funding competitions, where such bonus points are not restricted by statute or regulation governing the funding program and are provided in the relevant notice of funding availability.
(b)
Compliance with applicable federal laws and regulations.
Relief from any standard procedural requirement that may be provided under this section does not mean that a PHA is relieved from compliance with the provisions of federal law and regulations or other handbook requirements. For example, although a high performer or standard performer may be relieved of requirements for prior HUD approval for certain types of contracts for services, the PHA must still comply with all other federal and state requirements that remain in effect, such as those for competitive bidding or competitive negotiation (see 2 CFR 200.319, as applicable).
(c)
Audits and reviews not relieved by designation.
A PHA designated as a high performer or standard performer remains subject to:
(1) Regular independent auditor audits;
(2) Office of Inspector General audits or investigations as circumstances may warrant; and
(3) Reviews identified by the regional or field office in its current Risk Assessment of PHAs and projects.
[76 FR 10149, Feb. 23, 2011, as amended at 80 FR 75942, Dec. 7, 2015]
§ 902.73
PHAs with deficiencies.
(a)
Oversight and action.
Standard and substandard performers will be referred to the field office for appropriate oversight and action.
(1) A standard performer that receives a total score of at least 60 percent shall be required to correct the deficiencies in performance within the time period for correction, as stated in § 902.73(c). If the PHA fails to correct the deficiencies, HUD may either require the PHA to enter into a Corrective Action Plan, or HUD may take other action, as appropriate.
(2) A substandard performer,
i.e.,
a PHA that achieves a PHAS score of at least 60 percent and achieves a score of less than 60 percent of the total points available under one or more of the physical condition, management operations, or financial condition PHAS indicators, shall be required to correct the deficiencies in performance within the time period for correction. If the PHA fails to correct the deficiencies, HUD may require the PHA to enter into a Corrective Action Plan, or take other action, as appropriate.
(3) A PHA with a project(s) that receives less than 60 percent of the points available for the physical condition, management operations, or financial condition PHAS indicators, or less than 50 percent of the points available for the capital fund indicator, shall be required to correct the deficiencies in performance within the time period for correction, as stated in § 902.73(b). If the PHA fails to correct the deficiencies within the time period allowed, HUD may either require the PHA to enter into a Corrective Action Plan, or take other action, as appropriate.
(b)
Correction of deficiencies.
(1)
Time period for correction.
After a PHA's (or DF-RMC's) receipt of its final overall PHAS score and designation as: A standard performer, within the range described in § 902.73(a)(1); or substandard performer, within the range described in § 902.73(a)(2), or, in the case of an RMC, after notification of its score from a PHA, a PHA or RMC shall correct any deficiency indicated in its assessment within 90 days, or within such period as provided in the HUD-executed Corrective Action Plan, if required.
(2)
Notification and report to regional or field office.
A PHA shall notify the regional or field office of its action to correct a deficiency. A PHA shall also forward to the regional or field office an RMC's report of its action to correct a deficiency. A DF-RMC shall forward directly to the regional or field office its report of its action to correct a deficiency.
(c)
Failure to correct deficiencies.
(1) If a PHA (or DF-RMC or RMC) fails to correct deficiencies within the time period noted in paragraph (b) of this section, or to correct deficiencies within the time specified in a Corrective Action Plan, or within such extensions as may be granted by HUD, the field office will notify the PHA of its noncompliance.
(2) The PHA (or DF-RMC or RMC) will provide the field office with its reasons for lack of progress in negotiating, executing, or carrying out the Corrective Action Plan, within 30 days of the PHA's receipt of the noncompliance notification. HUD will advise the PHA as to the acceptability of its reasons for lack of progress.
(3) If HUD finds the PHA's (or DF-RMC or RMC's) reasons for lack of progress unacceptable, HUD will notify the PHA (or DF-RMC or RMC) that it will take such actions as it may determine appropriate in accordance with the provisions of the 1937 Act and other statutes, the ACC, this part, and other HUD regulations, including, but not limited to, the remedies available for substantial default.
§ 902.75
Troubled performers.
(a)
General.
Upon a PHA's designation as a troubled performer, in accordance with the requirements of section 6(j)(2)(B) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 1437d(j)(2)(B)) and in accordance with this part, HUD must notify the PHA and shall refer each troubled performer PHA to the PHA's field office, or other designated office(s) at HUD, for remedial action, oversight, and monitoring. The actions to be taken by HUD and the PHA will include statutorily required actions, and such other actions as may be determined appropriate by HUD.
(b)
Memorandum of agreement (MOA).
Within 30 days of notification of a PHA's designation as a troubled performer, HUD will initiate activities to negotiate and develop an MOA. An MOA is required for a troubled performer. The final MOA is a binding contractual agreement between HUD and a PHA. The scope of the MOA may vary depending upon the extent of the problems present in the PHA. It shall include, but not be limited to:
(1) Baseline data, which should be data without adjustments or weighting but may be the PHA's score in each of
the PHAS indicators or subindicators identified as a deficiency;
(2) Performance targets for such periods specified by HUD (
e.g.,
annual, semiannual, quarterly, monthly), which may be the attainment of a higher score within an indicator or subindicator that is a problem, or the description of a goal to be achieved;
(3) Strategies to be used by the PHA in achieving the performance targets within the time period of the MOA, including the identification of the party responsible for the completion of each task and for reporting progress;
(4) Technical assistance to the PHA provided or facilitated by HUD; for example, the training of PHA employees in specific management areas or assistance in the resolution of outstanding HUD monitoring findings;
(5) The PHA's commitment to take all actions within its control to achieve the targets;
(6) Incentives for meeting such targets, such as the removal of a troubled performer designation or troubled with respect to the program for assistance from the Capital Fund program under section 9(d) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 1437g(d)) and HUD recognition for the most-improved PHAs;
(7) The consequences of failing to meet the targets, which include, but are not limited to, the interventions stated in 24 CFR part 907 and in section 6(j)(3) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 1437d(j)(3)); and
(8) A description of the involvement of local public and private entities, including PHA resident leaders, in carrying out the agreement and rectifying the PHA's problems. A PHA shall have primary responsibility for obtaining active local public and private entity participation, including the involvement of public housing resident leaders, in assisting PHA improvement efforts. Local public and private entity participation should be premised upon the participant's knowledge of the PHA, ability to contribute technical expertise with regard to the PHA's specific problem areas, and authority to make preliminary commitments of support, financial or otherwise.
(c)
PHA review of MOA.
The PHA will have 10 days to review the MOA. During this 10-day period, the PHA shall resolve any claimed discrepancies in the MOA with HUD, and discuss any recommended changes and target dates for improvement to be incorporated in the final MOA. Unless the time period is extended by HUD, the MOA is to be executed 15 days following issuance of the draft MOA.
(d)
Maximum recovery period.
(1)
Expiration of the first-year improvement period.
Upon the expiration of the one-year period that started on the date on which the PHA receives initial notice of a troubled performer designation, the PHA shall, by the next PHAS assessment that is at least 12 months after the initial notice of the troubled performer designation, improve its performance by at least 50 percent of the difference between the initial PHAS assessment score that led to the troubled performer status and the score necessary to remove the PHA's designation as a troubled performer.
(2)
Expiration of 2-year recovery period.
Upon the expiration of the 2-year period that started on the date on which the PHA received the initial notice of a troubled performer designation, the PHA shall, by the next PHAS assessment that is at least 24 months after the initial notice of the troubled performer designation, improve its performance and achieve an overall PHAS score of at least 60 percent of the total points available.
(e)
Parties to the MOA.
An MOA shall be executed by:
(1) The PHA Board Chairperson (supported by a Board resolution), or a receiver (pursuant to a court-ordered receivership agreement, if applicable) or other AME acting in lieu of the PHA Board;
(2) The PHA Executive Director, or a designated receiver (pursuant to a court-ordered receivership agreement, if applicable), or other AME-designated Chief Executive Officer; and
(3) The field office
(f)
Involvement of resident leadership in the MOA.
HUD encourages the inclusion of the resident leadership in the execution of the MOA.
(g)
Failure to execute MOA or make substantial improvement under MOA.
(1) If a troubled performer PHA fails or refuses to execute an MOA within the period provided in paragraph (c) of this
section, or a troubled performer PHA operating under an executed MOA does not show a substantial improvement, as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, toward a passing PHAS score following the issuance of the failing PHAS score by HUD, the field office shall refer the PHA to the Assistant Secretary to determine such remedial actions, consistent with the provisions of the ACC and other HUD regulations, including, but not limited to, remedies available for substantial default.
(2) For purposes of paragraph (g) of this section, substantial improvement is defined as the improvement required by paragraph (d) of this section. The maximum period of time for remaining in troubled performer status before being referred to the Assistant Secretary is 2 years after the initial notification of the troubled performer designation. Therefore, the PHA must make substantial improvement in each year of this 2-year period.
(3) The following example illustrates the provisions of paragraph (g)(1) of this section:

# Example:
A PHA receives a score of 50 points on the physical condition, management operations, or financial condition PHAS indicators; 60 points is a passing score. Upon the expiration of the one-year period that started on the date on which the PHA received the initial notification of the troubled performer designation, the PHA must achieve at least 55 points (50 percent of the 10 points necessary to achieve a passing score of 60 points) to continue recovery efforts. In the second year, the PHA must achieve a minimum score of 60 points (a passing score). If, in the first year that started on the date on which the PHA received the initial notification of the troubled designation, the PHA fails to achieve the 5-point increase, or if the PHA achieves the 5 point increase within the first year that started on the date on which the PHA received the initial notification of the troubled designation, but fails to achieve the minimum passing score of 60 points after the second year after the initial notification, HUD will notify the PHA that it will take such actions as it may determine appropriate in accordance with the provisions of the ACC and other HUD regulations, including, but not limited to, the remedies available for substantial default.
(h)
Audit review.
For a PHA designated as a troubled performer, HUD may perform an audit review and may, at its discretion, select the audit firm that will perform the audit of the PHA; and HUD may, at its discretion, serve as the audit committee for the audit in question.
(i)
Continuation of services to residents.
To the extent feasible, while a PHA is in a troubled performer status, all services to residents will continue uninterrupted.
§ 902.79
Verification and records.
All project and PHA certifications, year-end financial information, and supporting documentation are subject to HUD verification at any time, including review by an independent auditor. All PHAs must retain supporting documents for any certifications and for asset management reviews for at least 3 years. Failure to maintain and provide supporting documentation for a period of 3 years for any indicator(s), subindicator(s), or other methods used to assess performance shall result in a score of zero for the indicator(s) or subindicator(s), and a lower overall PHAS score for the applicable assessment period.
§ 902.81
Resident petitions for remedial action.
Residents of a PHA designated as troubled pursuant to section 6(j)(2)(A) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 1437d(j)(2)(A)) may petition HUD in writing to take one or more of the actions referred to in section 6(j)(3)(A) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 1437d(j)(3)(A)). HUD will consider any petition from a group of residents totaling at least 20 percent of the PHA's residents, or from an organization or organizations of residents whose membership equals at least 20 percent of the PHA's residents. HUD shall respond to such petitions in a timely manner with a written description of the actions, if any, HUD plans to take and, where applicable, the reasons why such actions differ from the course proposed by the residents. Nothing in this section shall limit HUD's discretion to determine whether a substantial default has occurred or to select the appropriate intervention upon such determination.
§ 902.83
Sanctions for troubled performer PHAs.
(a) If a troubled performer PHA fails to make substantial improvement, as set forth in § 902.75(d), HUD shall:
(1) In the case of a troubled performer PHA with 1,250 or more units, declare substantial default in accordance with § 907.3(b)(3) of this chapter and petition for the appointment of a receiver pursuant to section 6(j)(3)(A)(ii) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 1437d(j)(3)(A)(ii)); or
(2) In the case of a troubled performer PHA with fewer than 1,250 units, declare substantial default in accordance with § 907.3(b)(3) of this chapter and either petition for the appointment of a receiver pursuant to section 6(j)(3)(A)(ii) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 1437d(j)(3)(A)(ii)), or take possession of the PHA (including all or part of any project or program of the PHA) pursuant to section 6(j)(3)(A)(iv) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 1437d(j)(3)(A)(iv)), and appoint, on a competitive or noncompetitive basis, an individual or entity as an administrative receiver to assume the responsibilities of HUD for the administration of all or part of the PHA (including all or part of any project or program of the PHA).
(3) In the case of substantial default by a troubled performer PHA, nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the courses of action available to HUD under this part, 24 CFR part 907, or section 6(j)(3)(A) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 1437d(j)(3)(A)) for any other substantial default by a PHA.
(b) If a troubled performer PHA fails to execute or meet the requirements of an MOA in accordance with § 902.75, other than as specified in paragraph (a) of this section, the PHA may be deemed to be in substantial default by HUD and any remedy available therefore may be invoked in the discretion of HUD.

# Subpart H—Assessment of Small Rural Public Housing Agencies

# Source:
88 FR 30501, May 11, 2023, unless otherwise noted.
§ 902.101
Definition of small rural PHAs.
(a)
Definition.
A PHA is a small rural PHA if it administers 550 or fewer combined public housing units and vouchers under section 8(o), and either:
(1) Has a primary administrative building as determined with a physical address in a rural area as described in 12 CFR 1026.35(b)(2)(iv)(A); or
(2) More than 50 percent of its combined public housing units and voucher units under section 8(o) are in rural areas as described in 12 CFR 1026.35(b)(2)(iv)(A).
(b)
Determination.
(1) HUD will make the initial determination of PHAs that qualify as small rural as defined in this section no later than October 30, 2023.
(2) HUD will determine if a PHA qualifies as a small rural PHA under paragraph (a) of this section every 3 years.
(c)
Appeals.
A PHA may challenge HUD's determination concerning whether the PHA qualifies as small rural PHA by presenting an objectively verifiable material error which resulted in the incorrect determination, or by presenting information showing that the status of the PHA has changed to justify a redetermination.
§ 902.103
Public housing assessment of small rural PHAs.
(a)
Small rural public housing assessment.
The public housing program of small rural PHAs as defined in § 902.101 shall be assessed and scored based only on the physical condition of their public housing properties in accordance with 24 CFR part 5, subpart G, except that properties that meet the definition specified in § 902.44(b) of physical condition and neighborhood environment shall receive one additional point for physical condition and neighborhood environment. Such agencies shall not be subject to PHAS except as noted below.
(b)
Triennial assessment.
Public housing programs operated by small rural PHAs will be assessed no more than once every three years, except that a small rural PHA shall be subject to annual inspection if it is designated by the Secretary as troubled as defined in § 902.105.
(c)
Initial public housing assessment.
(1) For PHAs subject to small PHA deregulation, the first assessment and inspections will be determined based on the PHA's next scheduled PHAS assessment (e.g., a higher performing PHA would receive the first inspection 3 years after the most recent PHAS assessment).
(2) For PHAs not subject to small PHA deregulation, the first inspection is based on the PHA's overall weighted project physical condition indicator score (e.g., a PHA with a physical condition indicator score of 90 or greater would receive the first inspection three years after most recent PHAS assessment).
§ 902.105
Troubled small rural PHAs.
(a)
Definition of troubled small rural PHA.
A small rural PHA will be determined to be troubled under the public housing program if the weighted average score of all property inspections is below 70 percent of the total available points, or if a small rural PHA has a weighted average score of between 70 and 80 percent of the total available points and has at least one property that receives fewer than 70 percent of the total available points.
(b)
Referral to the local field office.
Upon a PHA's designation as a troubled performer HUD must notify the PHA and shall refer the troubled performer PHA to the PHA's field office, or other designated office(s) at HUD, for remedial action, oversight, and monitoring. The actions to be taken by HUD and the PHA will include statutorily required actions, and such other actions as may be determined appropriate by HUD.
(c)
Corrective Action Agreement (CAA).
Within 30 days of notification of a PHA's designation as a troubled performer, HUD will initiate activities to negotiate and develop a CAA. A CAA is required for a troubled performer. The final CAA is a binding contractual agreement between HUD and a PHA. The scope of the CAA may vary depending upon the extent of the problems present in the PHA. The term of the CAA will not exceed one year and is subject to renewal at the discretion of HUD if HUD determines that the circumstances requiring the CAA still exist at the expiration of the term of the CAA based on the annual assessment frequency as included in § 902.103. It shall include, but not be limited to:
(1) Baseline data, which should be data without adjustments or weighting but may be the PHA's score identified as a deficiency;
(2) Performance targets for such periods specified by HUD (e.g., annual, semiannual, quarterly, monthly), which may be the attainment of a higher score or the description of a goal to be achieved; however, safety, health, and environmental performance targets and deadlines otherwise specified by regulation, including the lead safety regulations at 24 CFR part 35, are not superseded by the CAA performance targets;
(3) Strategies to be used by the PHA in achieving the performance targets within the time period of the CAA, including the identification of the party responsible for the completion of each task and for reporting progress;
(4) Technical assistance to the PHA provided or facilitated by HUD;
(5) The PHA's commitment to take all actions within its control to achieve the targets;
(6) The consequences of failing to meet the targets; and
(7) A description of the involvement of local public and private entities, including PHA resident leaders, in carrying out the agreement and rectifying the PHA's problems. A PHA shall have primary responsibility for obtaining active local public and private entity participation, including the involvement of public housing resident leaders, in assisting PHA improvement efforts. Local public and private entity participation should be premised upon the participant's knowledge of the PHA, ability to contribute technical expertise with regard to the PHA's specific problem areas, and authority to make preliminary commitments of support, financial or otherwise.
(d)
PHA review of the CAA.
The PHA will have 10 days to review the CAA. During this 10-day period, the PHA shall resolve any claimed discrepancies in the CAA with HUD and discuss any recommended changes and target dates for improvement to be incorporated in the final CAA. Unless the time period
is extended by HUD, the CAA is to be executed 30 days following issuance of the draft CAA.
(e)
Maximum recovery period.
Upon the expiration of the one-year period that started on the date on which the PHA receives initial notice of a troubled performer designation, the PHA shall improve its performance in order to no longer be considered troubled under the assessment.
(f)
Parties to the CAA.
A CAA shall be executed by:
(1) The PHA Board Chairperson (supported by a Board resolution), or a receiver (pursuant to a court-ordered receivership agreement, if applicable) or other AME acting in lieu of the PHA Board;
(2) The PHA Executive Director, or a designated receiver (pursuant to a court-ordered receivership agreement, if applicable), or other AME-designated Chief Executive Officer; and
(3) The field office.
(g)
Involvement of resident leadership in the CAA.
HUD encourages the inclusion of the resident leadership in the execution of the CAA.
(h)
Failure to execute CAA or make substantial improvement under CAA.
If a troubled performer PHA fails or refuses to execute an CAA within the period provided in paragraph (d) of this section, or a troubled performer PHA operating under an executed CAA does not achieve a passing physical inspection score, as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, the field office shall refer the PHA to the Assistant Secretary to determine such remedial actions, consistent with the provisions of the ACC and other HUD regulations, including, but not limited to, remedies available for substantial default.
(i)
Continuation of services to residents.
To the extent feasible, while a PHA is in a troubled performer status, all services to residents will continue uninterrupted.
§ 902.107
Withholding, denying, and rescinding troubled designation.
(a)
Withholding designation.
In exceptional circumstances, even though a PHA has satisfied the requirements for high performer or non-troubled designations, HUD may conduct any review as it may determine necessary, and may deny or rescind incentives or high performer designation or non-troubled performer designation, in the case of a PHA that:
(1) Is operating under a special agreement with HUD (e.g., a civil rights Conciliation or Voluntary Compliance Agreement);
(2) Is involved in litigation that bears directly upon the physical performance of a PHA;
(3) Is operating under a court order;
(4) Demonstrates substantial evidence of fraud or misconduct, including evidence that the PHA's certifications, submitted in accordance with this part, are not supported by the facts, as evidenced by such sources as a HUD review, routine reports, an Office of Inspector General investigation/audit, an independent auditor's audit, or an investigation by any appropriate legal authority; or
(5) Demonstrates substantial noncompliance in one or more areas of a PHA's required compliance with applicable laws and regulations, including areas not assessed under the small rural assessment. Areas of substantial noncompliance include, but are not limited to, noncompliance with civil rights, nondiscrimination and fair housing laws and regulations, or the ACC. Substantial noncompliance casts doubt on the capacity of a PHA to preserve and protect its public housing projects and operate them consistent with Federal laws and regulations.
(b)
High performer and standard designations.
If a high performer designation is denied or rescinded, the PHA shall be designated either a non-troubled performer, or troubled performer, depending on the nature and seriousness of the matter or matters constituting the basis for HUD's action. If a non-troubled performer designation is denied or rescinded, the PHA shall be designated as a troubled performer.
(c)
Effect on score.
The denial or rescission of a designation of high performer or non-troubled performer shall not affect the PHA's numerical small rural assessment score, except where the denial or rescission is under paragraph (a)(4) of this section.
§ 902.109
Right to petition and appeal troubled designation.
(a)
Appeal of troubled performer designation and petition for removal of troubled performer designation.
A PHA may take any of the following actions:
(1) Appeal its troubled performer designation;
(2) Petition for removal of troubled performer designation; and
(3) Appeal any refusal of a petition to remove troubled performer designation.
(b)
Appeal of small rural Assessment score.
(1) If a PHA believes that an objectively verifiable and material error(s) exists in its small rural assessment score, which, if corrected, will result in a significant change in the PHA's score and its designation, the PHA may appeal its score in accordance with the procedures of paragraphs (c) through (e) of this section. A significant change in a score is a change that would cause the PHA's score to increase, resulting in a higher designation for the PHA (
i.e.,
from troubled performer to non-troubled performer, or from non-troubled to high performer).
(2) A PHA may not appeal its score or designation based on the subsequent correction of deficiencies identified as a result of a project's physical inspection.
(c)
Appeal and petition procedures.
(1) To appeal a troubled performer designation or petition for the removal of a troubled performer designation, a PHA must submit a request in writing to the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Real Estate Assessment Center, which must be received by HUD no later than 30 days following the issuance of the score to the PHA.
(2) To appeal the denial of a petition to remove a troubled performer designation, a PHA must submit a written request to the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Real Estate Assessment Center, which must be received by HUD no later than 30 days after HUD's decision to refuse to remove the PHA's troubled performer designation.
(3) An appeal of a troubled performer designation or an appeal of the denial of a petition for removal of a troubled performer designation must include the PHA's supporting documentation and reasons for the appeal or petition. An appeal of an assessment score must be accompanied by the PHA's evidence that a material error occurred. An appeal or petition submitted to HUD without supporting documentation will not be considered and will be returned to the PHA.
(d)
Denial, withholding, or rescission.
A PHA that disagrees with the basis for denial, withholding, or rescission of its designation under § 902.66 may make a written request for reinstatement within 30 days of notification by HUD of the denial or rescission of the designation to the Assistant Secretary, and the request shall include reasons for the reinstatement.
(e)
Consideration of petitions and appeals.
(1) Consideration of a petition or the appeal of a final overall assessment score, of a troubled performer designation, or of a petition to remove troubled performer designation. Upon receipt of such an appeal or a petition from a PHA, HUD will evaluate the appeal and its merits for purposes of determining whether a reassessment of the PHA is warranted. HUD will review the PHA's file and the evidence submitted by the PHA to determine whether an error occurred.
(2) Consideration of an appeal of refusal to remove a troubled performer designation. Upon receipt of an appeal of refusal to remove a troubled performer designation, HUD will evaluate the appeal and its merits for the purposes of determining whether a reassessment of the PHA is warranted. The HUD staff initially evaluating an appeal of refusal to remove a troubled performer designation will not be the same HUD staff who evaluated the PHA's petition to remove the troubled performer designation. The Assistant Secretary will render the final determination of such an appeal.
(f)
Notice and finality of decisions.
(1) If HUD determines that one or more objectively verifiable and material error has occurred, HUD will undertake a new inspection of the project, adjust the PHA's score, or perform another reexamination of information, as appropriate in light of the nature of the error that occurred. A new score will be issued and an appropriate performance designation made by HUD. HUD's
decision on appeal of an assessment score, issuance of a troubled performer designation, or refusal to remove a troubled performer designation will be final agency action. No reconsideration will be given by HUD of such decisions.
(2) HUD will issue a written decision on all appeals and petitions made under this section.
§ 902.111
Sanctions for troubled small rural PHAs.
The sanctions for small rural PHAs with troubled public housing programs that remain troubled as required by § 902.108 will be the same as those sanctions for PHAs assessed under PHAS as described in § 902.83.
§ 902.113
Incentives for small rural PHAs high-performers.
(a)
High performer.
PHAs with a weighted average score for all inspections of at least 90 percent of all available points will be considered high performers and will be eligible for benefits as described in § 902.113(b) and § 905.400(l) of this chapter.
(b)
Incentives.
High performer small rural PHAs under the public housing program will be eligible for the same incentives as high performer PHAs under PHAS as described in § 902.71.

# Subpart A—Deconcentration of Poverty
§ 903.1
What is the purpose of this subpart?
The purpose of this subpart is to specify the process which a Public Housing Agency, as part of its annual planning process and development of an admissions policy, must follow in order to develop and apply a policy that provides for deconcentration of poverty and income mixing in certain public housing developments.
[80 FR 42368, July 16, 2015]
§ 903.2
With respect to admissions, what must a PHA do to deconcentrate poverty in its developments?
(a)
General.
The PHA's admission policy includes the PHA's policy designed to promote deconcentration of poverty and income mixing in accordance with section 16(a)(3)(B) of the 1937 Act (42 U.S.C. 1437n), which is submitted to HUD as part of the PHA Annual Plan process. Deconcentration of poverty and income mixing is promoted by a policy that provides for bringing higher income tenants into lower income developments and lower income tenants into higher income developments.
(1) The provisions of this section apply to applicants to and residents seeking voluntary transfers within covered public housing developments (“covered developments” as specified in paragraph (b) of this section).
(2) The statutory requirement to design a policy to provide for deconcentration and income mixing is not to be construed to impose or require any specific income or racial quotas for any development or developments.
(b)
Applicability of deconcentration of poverty and income mixing requirements
—(1)
Developments subject to deconcentration of poverty and income mixing requirements.
The deconcentration requirements of this subpart apply to general occupancy, family public housing developments, excluding those developments listed in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. Developments to which this subpart is applicable are referred to as “covered developments”.
(2)
Developments not subject to deconcentration of poverty and income mixing requirements.
This subpart does not apply to the following public housing developments:
(i) Public housing developments operated by a PHA with fewer than 100 public housing units;
(ii) Public housing developments operated by a PHA which house only elderly persons or persons with disabilities, or both;
(iii) Public housing developments operated by a PHA which consist of only one general occupancy, family public housing development;
(iv) Public housing developments approved for demolition or for conversion to tenant-based assistance; and
(v) Public housing developments which include public housing units operated in accordance with a HUD-approved mixed-finance plan using HOPE VI or public housing funds awarded before the effective date of this rule, provided that the PHA certifies (and includes reasons for the certification) as part of its PHA Plan (which may be accomplished either in the annual Plan submission or as a significant amendment to its PHA Plan) that exemption from the regulation is necessary to honor an existing contractual agreement or be consistent with a mixed finance plan, including provisions regarding the incomes of public housing residents to be admitted to that development, which has been developed in consultation with residents with rights to live at the affected development and other interested persons.
(c)
Deconcentration of poverty and income mixing
—(1)
Steps for implementation.
To implement the statutory requirement to deconcentrate poverty and provide for income mixing in covered public housing developments, a PHA must comply with the following steps:
(i)
Step 1.
A PHA shall determine the average income of all families residing in all the PHA's covered developments. A PHA may use median income, instead of average income, provided that the PHA includes a written explanation in its PHA Annual Plan justifying use of median income in the PHA's Annual Plan.
(ii)
Step 2.
A PHA shall determine the average income of all families residing in each covered development. In determining average income for each development, a PHA has the option of adjusting its income analysis for unit size in accordance with procedures prescribed by HUD.
(iii)
Step 3.
A PHA shall determine whether each of its covered developments falls above, within or below the Established Income Range. The Established Income Range is from 85 to 115 percent (inclusive) of the average family income (the PHA-wide average income for covered developments as defined in Step 1), except that the upper limit shall never be less than the income at which a family would be defined as an extremely low income family under 24 CFR 5.603(b).
(iv)
Step 4.
A PHA with covered developments having average incomes outside the Established Income Range may explain or justify the income profile for these developments as being consistent with and furthering two sets of goals: the goals of deconcentration of poverty and income mixing as specified by the statute (bringing higher income tenants into lower income developments and vice versa); and the local goals and strategies contained in the
PHA Annual Plan. Elements of explanations or justifications that may satisfy these requirements may include, but shall not be limited to the following:
(A) The covered development or developments are subject to consent decrees or other resident selection and admission plans mandated by court action;
(B) The covered development or developments are part of PHA's programs, strategies or activities specifically authorized by statute, such as mixed-income or mixed-finance developments, homeownership programs, self-sufficiency strategies, or other strategies designed to deconcentrate poverty, promote income mixing in public housing, increase the incomes of public housing residents, or the income mix is otherwise subject to individual review and approval by HUD;
(C) The covered development's or developments' size, location, and/or configuration promote income deconcentration, such as scattered site or small developments;
(D) The income characteristics of the covered development or developments are sufficiently explained by other circumstances.
(v)
Step 5.
Where the income profile for a covered development is not explained or justified in the PHA Annual Plan submission, the PHA shall include in its admission policy its specific policy to provide for deconcentration of poverty and income mixing in applicable covered developments. Depending on local circumstances, a PHA's deconcentration policy (which may be undertaken in conjunction with other efforts such as efforts to increase self-sufficiency or current residents) may include but is not limited to providing for one or more of the following actions:
(A) Providing incentives designed to encourage families with incomes below the Established Income Range to accept units in developments with incomes above the Established Income Range, or vice versa, including rent incentives, affirmative marketing plans, or added amenities;
(B) Targeting investment and capital improvements toward developments with an average income below the Established Income Range to encourage applicant families whose income is above the Established Income Range to accept units in those developments;
(C) Establishing a preference for admission of working families in developments below the Established Income Range;
(D) Skipping a family on the waiting list to reach another family in an effort to further the goals of the PHA's deconcentration policy;
(E) Providing such other strategies as permitted by statute and determined by the PHA in consultation with the residents and the community, through the PHA Annual Plan process, to be responsive to the local context and the PHA's strategic objectives.
(2)
Determination of compliance with deconcentration requirement.
HUD shall consider a PHA to be in compliance with this subpart if:
(i) The PHA's income analysis shows that the PHA has no general occupancy family developments to which the deconcentration requirements apply; that is, the average incomes of all covered developments are within the Established Income Range;
(ii) The PHA has covered developments with average incomes above or below the Established Income Range and the PHA provides a sufficient explanation in its Annual Plan that supports that the income mix of such development or developments is consistent with and furthers the goal of deconcentration of poverty and income mixing and also the locally determined goals of the PHA's Annual and Five Year Plans, and the PHA therefore need not take further action to deconcentrate poverty and mix incomes; or
(iii) The PHA's deconcentration policy provides specific strategies the PHA will take that can be expected to promote deconcentration of poverty and income mixing in developments with average incomes outside of the Established Income Range.
(3)
Right of return.
If a PHA has provided that a family that resided in a covered public housing development has a right to admission to a public housing unit in that development after revitalization, the requirements of
paragraph (c) of this section do not preclude fulfilling that commitment or a PHA's commitment to return a family to another development after revitalization.
(4)
Family's discretion to refuse a unit.
A family has the sole discretion whether to accept an offer of a unit made under a PHA's deconcentration policy. The PHA may not take any adverse action toward any eligible family for choosing not to accept an offer of a unit under the PHA's deconcentration policy. In accordance with the PHA's established policies, the PHA may uniformly limit the number of offers received by applicants.
(5)
Relationship to income targeting requirement.
Nothing in this section relieves a PHA of the obligation to meet the requirement to admit annually at least 40 percent families whose incomes are below 30 percent of area median income as provided by section 16(a)(2) of the 1937 Act, 42 U.S.C. 1437n(a)(2).
(d)
Relationship between poverty deconcentration and fair housing.
The requirements for poverty deconcentration in paragraph (c) of this section and for fair housing in 24 CFR 903.15(d) arise under separate statutory authorities.

# Subpart B—PHA Plans and Fair Housing Requirements
§ 903.3
What is the purpose of this subpart?
(a) This subpart specifies the requirements for PHA plans, required by section 5A of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437c-1) (the Act), as amended.
(b) The purpose of the plans is to provide a strategic planning framework for PHA management operations and capital planning:
(1) Local accountability; and
(2) An easily identifiable source by which public housing residents, participants in the tenant-based and project-based assistance program, and other members of the public may locate basic PHA policies, rules and requirements concerning the PHA's operations, programs and services.
(c) Title VII of the Housing and Economic Reform Act, Public Law 110-289, section 2702, amends 42 U.S.C. 1437c-1(b) to provide qualified PHAs an exemption from the requirement of section 5A of the Act to submit an annual PHA Plan. The term “qualified PHA” means a public housing agency that meets the following requirements:
(1) The sum of the number of public housing dwelling units administered by the agency, and the number of vouchers under section 8(o) of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437f(o)) administered by the agency, is 550 or fewer; and
(2) The agency is not designated under section 42 U.S.C. 1437d(j)(2) as a troubled public housing agency, and does not have a failing score under SEMAP during the prior 12 months.
[78 FR 63770, Oct. 24, 2013, as amended at 89 FR 38292, May 7, 22024]
§ 903.4
What are the public housing agency plans?
(a)
Types of plans.
There are two public housing agency plans. They are:
(1) The 5-Year Plan (the 5-Year Plan) that a public housing agency (PHA) must submit to HUD once every five PHA fiscal years. The 5-Year Plan covers the five PHA fiscal years immediately following the date on which the 5-Year Plan is due to HUD; and
(2) The Annual Plan (Annual Plan) that the PHA must submit to HUD for each fiscal year immediately following the date on which the Annual Plan is due to HUD and for which the PHA receives:
(i) Section 8 assistance (tenant-based assistance (24 CFR part 982) and project-based assistance (24 CFR part 983) under Section 8(o) of the U.S. Housing Act of 1937, 42 U.S.C. 1437f(o)); or
(ii) Amounts from the public housing operating fund or capital fund (under section 9 of the U.S. Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437g) (public housing)).
(b)
Format.
HUD may prescribe the format of submission (including electronic format submission) of the plans. HUD also may prescribe the format of attachments to the plans and documents related to the plan that the PHA does not submit but may be required to
make available locally. PHAs will receive appropriate notice of any prescribed format.
(c)
Applicability.
The requirements of this subpart only apply to a PHA that receives the type of assistance described in paragraph (a) of this section.
(d)
Authority for waivers.
In addition to the waiver authority provided in § 5.110 of this title, the Secretary may, subject to statutory limitations, waive any provision of this title on a program-wide basis, and delegate this authority in accordance with section 106 of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Reform Act of 1989 (42 U.S.C. 3535(q)) where the Secretary determines that such waiver is necessary for the effective implementation of this part.
[65 FR 81222, Dec. 22, 2000, as amended 89 FR 38292, May 7, 2024]
§ 903.5
When must a PHA submit the plans to HUD?
(a)
5-Year Plan.
(1) The first PHA fiscal year that is covered by the requirements of this part as amended on December 22, 2000, is the PHA fiscal year that begins October 2001. This 5-Year Plan submitted by a PHA must be submitted for the 5-year period beginning October 1, 2001.
(2) For all PHAs, the first 5-Year Plans are due 75 days before the commencement of their fiscal year.
