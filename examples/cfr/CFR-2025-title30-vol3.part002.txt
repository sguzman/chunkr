§ 917.10
State regulatory program approval.
The Kentucky State program as resubmitted on December 30, 1981, and amended and clarified on February 22, 1982, was conditionally approved, effective May 18, 1982. Beginning on that
date, the Kentucky Department for Natural Resources and Environmental Protection was deemed the regulatory authority in Kentucky for surface coal mining and reclamation operations and for coal exploration operations on non-Federal and non-Indian lands. Copies of the approved program are available for review at:
(a) Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement, Lexington Field Office, 2675 Regency Road, Lexington, Kentucky 40503-2922.
(b) Department for Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement, Number 2, Hudson Hollow Complex, Frankfort, Kentucky 40601.

§ 917.11
Conditions of State regulatory program approval.
The approval of the Kentucky State program is subject to the state revising its program to correct the deficiencies listed in this section. The program revisions may be made, as appropriate, to the statute, to the regulations, to the program narrative, or by means of a legal opinion. This section indicates, for the general guidance of the State, the component of the program to which the Secretary recommends the change be made.

§ 917.12
State regulatory program and proposed program amendment provisions not approved.
(a) The Director does not approve the following provisions of the proposed program amendment concerning permit renewals that Kentucky submitted on April 23, 1998:
(1) The phrase “* * * if a permit has expired or * * *” in KRS 350.060(16).
(2) The following sentence in KRS 350.060(16): “Upon the submittal of a permit renewal application, the operator or permittee shall be deemed to have timely filed the permit renewal application and shall be entitled to continue, under the terms of the expired permit, the surface coal mining operation, pending the issuance of the permit renewal.”
(b) Subsections (2) through (6) of the amendment submitted as House Bill 599 on May 9, 2000, are hereby not approved, effective June 20, 2001.
(c) The amendment submitted by letter dated April 12, 2002, proposing a new section of the Kentucky Revised Statutes at Chapter 350 and referenced as Kentucky House Bill 405, is hereby not approved, effective November 20, 2002.
(d) The phrase “* * * coal mining activities and * * *” in KRS 350.445(3)(g) is not approved.
(e) The exemption from the engineer inspection requirements of subsection 9 for an impoundment with no embankment structure, that is completely incised, or is created by a depression left by backfilling and grading, that is not a sedimentation pond or coal mine waste impoundment and is not otherwise intended to facilitate active mining at section 1(9)(c) at 405 KAR 16/18:100 is not approved. The exemption from examination for an impoundment with no embankment structure, that is completely incised or created by a depression left by backfilling and grading but not meeting MSHA requirements at 30 CFR 77.216 or not meeting the Class B and C classifications at section 1(10)(b) is not approved to the extent that it is not implemented and managed in accordance with the provisions of OSM Directive TSR-2.
(f) The changes to Kentucky's Notice of Assessment of Civil Penalties and Penalty Assessment Conference Officer's Report that specify that prepayment of a proposed assessment or penalty is no longer required are not approved.
(g) We are deferring our decision on the bi-annual actuarial review provision of 350 KRS 350.509 until such time as we are able to evaluate the stability of the Kentucky Reclamation Guaranty Fund (KRGF) over its first three full years of implementation.
(h) We are not approving 405 KAR 10:015 8(7).
(i) We are not approving revisions to KRS 350.0301 made by 2018 Ky. Acts ch. 85 that would have eliminated a requirement that Kentucky promulgate regulations providing that operators
must place proposed civil penalty assessments into an escrow account prior to a formal hearing on the amount of the assessment.

§ 917.30
State-Federal cooperative agreement.

# Cooperative Agreement
The Governor of the Commonwealth of Kentucky (the Governor) and the Secretary of the Department of the Interior (the Secretary) enter into a Cooperative Agreement (Agreement) to read as follows:

# Article I: Introduction, Purpose, and Responsible Agencies

# A. Authority
This Agreement is authorized by Section 523(c) of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act (Act), 30 U.S.C. 1273(c), which allows a State with a permanent regulatory program approved by the Secretary under 30 U.S.C. 1253, to elect to enter into an Agreement for the regulation and control of coal exploration operations not subject to 43 CFR Group 3400 and surface coal mining and reclamation operations on Federal lands. This Agreement provides for State regulation consistent with the Act, the Federal lands program (30 CFR Chapter VII, Subchapter D) and the approved Kentucky State Program (Program) for surface coal mining and reclamation operations on Federal lands.

# B. Purposes
The purposes of this Agreement are to (a) foster Federal-State cooperation on the regulation of surface coal mining and reclamation operations and coal exploration operations not subject to 43 CFR Group 3400, (b) minimize intergovernmental duplication of effort, and (c) provide for uniform and effective application of the Program on all lands in Kentucky in accordance with the Act and the Program.

# C. Responsible Administrative Agencies
The Kentucky Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Cabinet (NREPC), acting through the Department for Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (DSMRE), shall be responsible for administering this Agreement on behalf of the Governor. The Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSM) shall administer this Agreement on behalf of the Secretary.

# Article II: Effective Date
After being signed by the Secretary and the Governor, this Agreement shall be effective on October 1, 1998. This Agreement shall remain in effect until terminated as provided for in Article XI.

# Article III: Definitions
The terms and phrases used in this Agreement, which are defined in the Act, 30 CFR Parts 700, 701 and 740 and defined in the KRS 350 and the rules and regulations promulgated pursuant to that Act, shall have the same meanings as set forth in said definitions. Where there is a conflict between the above referenced State and Federal definitions, the definitions used in the approved State Program will apply except in the case of a term which defines the Secretary's continuing responsibilities under the Act or other laws.

# Article IV: Applicability
In accordance with the Federal lands program, the laws, regulations, terms and provisions of the Program are applicable to Federal lands in Kentucky except as otherwise stated in this Agreement, The Act, 30 CFR 740.4 and 745.13 or other applicable Federal laws, Executive Orders or regulations.
Orders and decisions issued by the NREPC in accordance with the Program that are appealable shall be appealed to the reviewing authority in accordance with the Program. Orders and decisions issued by the Secretary or his authorized agents that are appealable shall be appealed to the Department of the Interior's Office of Hearings and Appeals.

# Article V: General Requirements
The Governor and the Secretary affirm that they will comply with all provisions of this Agreement.

# A. Authority of State Agency
NREPC has and shall continue to have the authority under State law to carry out this agreement.

# B. Funding
Upon application by NREPC, and subject to appropriations, OSM will provide the State with funds to defray the costs associated with carrying out its responsibilities under this Agreement as provided in Section 705(c) of the Act and 30 CFR part 735. Such funds will cover the full cost incurred by NREPC in carrying out those responsibilities. The amount of the grant will be determined using the procedures specified in the Federal Assistance Manual Chapter 3-10 and appendix III.
For purposes of this agreement, actual costs of NREPC's administration of its approved program on Federal lands in accordance with this agreement shall be that percentage of NRECP's total program expenditures during any specific grant period that equals the percentage of Federal lands within all lands under permit in the State of Kentucky for that specific grant period.
If NREPC applies for a grant but sufficient funds have not been appropriated to OSM, OSM and NREPC will meet to decide upon appropriate measures that will insure that mining operations on Federal lands located in Kentucky are regulated in accordance with the approved Program. The NREPC also reserves the right to terminate this agreement should OSM be unable to adequately fund this program.

# C. Reports and Records
NREPC will make annual reports to OSM containing information with respect to compliance with terms of this Agreement pursuant to 30 CFR 745.12(d).
Upon request, NREPC and OSM will exchange information generated under this Agreement, except where prohibited by Federal or State law.
OSM will provide NREPC with a copy of any final evaluation reports prepared concerning State administration and enforcement of this Agreement. NREPC comments on the report will be attached before being sent to the Congress or other interested parties.

# D. Personnel
NREPC shall have the personnel necessary to fully implement this Agreement in accordance with the provision of the Act, applicable regulations, the Federal lands program and the approved Program.

# E. Equipment and Facilities
NREPC will assure itself access to equipment, laboratories and facilities to perform all inspections, investigations, studies, tests and analyses that are necessary to carry out the requirements of this Agreement.

# F. Permit Application Fees and Civil Penalties
The amount of the fee accompanying an application for a permit for operations on Federal lands in Kentucky shall be determined in accordance with KRS 350.060 and
Federal law. All permit fees and civil penalties collected from operations on Federal lands will be retained by the State. Permit fees shall be considered Program income. Civil penalties shall not be considered Program income. The financial status report submitted to OSM pursuant to 30 CFR 735.26 shall include the amount of fees and civil penalties collected and attributable to Federal lands during the prior State fiscal year.

# Article VI: Review of Permit Application Package

# A. Responsibilities
NREPC will assume primary responsibility for the analysis, review, and approval, disapproval, or conditional approval of the permit application component of the permit application package (PAP) required by 30 CFR 740.13 for surface coal mining and reclamation operations in Kentucky on Federal lands. NREPC will assume the responsibilities for review of permit applications to the extent authorized in 30 CFR 740.4(c)(1), (2), (3), (4), (6), and (7).
For proposals to conduct surface coal mining operations involving leased Federal coal, OSM is responsible for preparing a mining plan decision document in accordance with 30 CFR 746.13 and obtaining the Secretary's approval.
The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) is responsible for matters concerned exclusively with regulations under 43 CFR Group 3400.
The Secretary reserves the right to act independently of NREPC to carry out responsibilities under laws other than the Act or provisions of the Act not covered by the Program, and in instances of disagreement over the Act and the Federal lands program. The Secretary will make determinations under the Act that cannot be delegated to the State, some of which have been delegated to OSM.
Responsibilities and decisions which can be delegated to NREPC under other applicable Federal laws may be specified in working agreements between OSM and the State with the concurrence of any Federal agency involved and without amendment to this agreement.

# B. Permit Application Package
NREPC shall require an applicant proposing to conduct surface coal mining and reclamation operations on Federal lands to submit a PAP with an appropriate number of copies to NREPC. NREPC will furnish OSM, the Federal land management agency, and any other agency with jurisdiction or responsibility over Federal lands affected by operations proposed in the PAP with an appropriate number of copies of the PAP. The PAP will be in the form required by NREPC and will include any supplemental information required by OSM, the Federal land management agency, and any other agency with jurisdiction or responsibility over Federal lands affected by operations proposed in the PAP.
At a minimum, the PAP will satisfy the requirements of 30 CFR 740.13(b) and include the information necessary for NREPC to make a determination of compliance with the Program, and for OSM, the appropriate Federal land management agencies, and any other agencies with jurisdiction or responsibilities over Federal lands affected by operations proposed in the PAP to make determinations of compliance with applicable requirements of the Act, the Federal lands program, other Federal laws, Executive Orders, and regulations for which they are responsible.

# C. Review Procedures
NREPC will be the primary point of contact for applicants regarding the review of the PAP for compliance with the Program and State laws and regulations. OSM will review the applicable portions of the PAP for compliance with the non-delegated responsibilities of the Act and for compliance with the requirements of other Federal laws, Executive Orders, and regulations.
OSM and NREPC will develop a work plan and schedule for PAP reviews that comply with the time limitations established by the approved State program, and each agency will designate a person as the Federal lands liaison. The Federal lands liaisons will serve as the primary points of contact between OSM and NREPC throughout the review process. Not later than 45 calendar days after receipt of an administratively complete PAP, unless a different schedule is agreed upon, OSM will furnish NREPC with its review comments on the PAP and specify any requirements for additional data.
OSM and NREPC will coordinate with each other during the review process as needed. NREPC will send to OSM copies of any correspondence with the applicant and any information received from the applicant regarding the PAP.
OSM will send to NREPC copies of all OSM correspondence which may have a bearing on the PAP.
OSM will provide technical assistance to NREPC when requested, and will have access to NREPC files concerning operations on Federal lands. NREPC will keep OSM informed of findings made during the review process which bear on the responsibilities of OSM or other Federal agencies.

# D. Coordination Between NREPC, OSM, and Other Federal Agencies
NREPC will, to the extent authorized, consult with the Federal land management agency and BLM pursuant to 30 CFR
740.4(c)(2) and (3), respectively. NREPC will also be responsible for obtaining the comments and determinations of other agencies with jurisdiction or responsibility over the Federal lands affected by the operations proposed in the PAP. NREPC will request all Federal agencies to furnish their findings or any request for additional information to NREPC within 45 calendar days of the date of receipt of the PAP. OSM will, upon request, assist NREPC in obtaining such information.
In accordance with 30 CFR 745.12(g)(2), where lands containing leased Federal coal are involved, NREPC will provide OSM, in the form specified by OSM in consultation with NREPC, with written findings indicating that each permit application is in compliance with the terms of the regulatory program and a technical analysis of each permit application to assist OSM in meeting its responsibilities under other applicable Federal laws and regulations.
Where leased Federal coal is involved, OSM will consult with and obtain the concurrences of BLM, the Federal land management agency, and any other agency with jurisdiction or responsibility over the Federal lands affected by the operations proposed in the PAP as required to make its recommendation for the Secretary's decision on the mining plan.
Where BLM contacts the applicant in carrying out its responsibilities under 43 CFR Group 3400, BLM will immediately inform NREPC of its actions and provide NREPC with a copy of documentation of all decisions within 5 calendar days.

# E. Permit Application Decision and Permit Issuance
NREPC will prepare a State decision package, including written findings and supporting documentation, indicating whether the PAP is in compliance with the Program. NREPC will make the decision on approval, disapproval, or conditional approval of the permit on Federal lands.
Any permit issued by NREPC will incorporate any lawful terms or conditions imposed by the Federal land management agency, including conditions relating to post-mining land use, and will be conditioned upon compliance with the requirements of the Federal land management agency.
NREPC may make a decision on approval, disapproval, or conditional approval of the permit on Federal lands in accordance with the Program prior to the necessary Secretarial decision on the mining plan when leased Federal coal is involved, provided that NREPC advises the operator in the permit that Secretarial approval of the mining plan must be obtained before the operator may conduct surface coal mining operations on the Federal lease. NREPC will reserve the right to amend or rescind any requirements of the permit to conform with any terms or conditions imposed by the Secretary in the approval of the mining plan.
After making its decision on the PAP, NREPC will send a notice to the applicant, OSM, the Federal land management agencies, and any other agency with jurisdiction or responsibility over Federal lands affected by the operations proposed in the PAP. A copy of the permit and written findings will be provided to OSM upon request.

# F. Review Procedures for Permit Revisions; Renewals; and Transfer, Assignment, or Sale of Permit Rights
Any permit revision or renewal for a surface coal mining and reclamation operation on Federal lands will be reviewed and approved, or disapproved, by NREPC after consultation with OSM on whether such revision or renewal constitutes a mining plan modification pursuant to 30 CFR 746.18. OSM will inform NREPC within 10 calendar days of receiving a copy of a proposed permit revision or renewal, whether the permit revision or renewal constitutes a mining plan modification.
Transfer, assignment, or sale of permit rights on Federal lands shall be processed in accordance with the Program and 30 CFR 740.13(e).

# Article VII: Inspections
NREPC will conduct inspections of all surface coal mining and reclamation operations on Federal lands, in accordance with 30 CFR 740.4(c)(5) and the Program and prepare and file inspection reports in accordance with the Program. NREPC, subsequent to conducting any inspection pursuant to 30 CFR 740.4(c)(5), and in a timely fashion which will not exceed 45 calendar days, will file with OSM's Lexington Field Office a legible copy of the completed State inspection report.
NREPC will be the point of contact and primary inspection authority in dealing with the operator concerning operations and compliance with the requirements covered by this Agreement, except as described hereinafter. Nothing in this Agreement will prevent inspections by authorized Federal or State land management agencies for purposes other than those covered by this Agreement. The Department of the Interior acting through OSM, the Federal land management agency or any other agency with jurisdiction or responsibility over Federal lands to be affected under the proposed PAP, may conduct any inspections necessary to comply with obligations under 30 CFR Parts 842 and 843 and any laws other than the Act.
OSM will give NREPC reasonable notice of its intent to conduct an inspection under 30 CFR 842.11 in order to provide NREPC inspectors with an opportunity to accompany OSM inspectors. When OSM is responding to
a citizen complaint of an imminent danger to the public health and safety, or of significant, imminent environmental harm to land, air or water resources pursuant to 30 CFR 842.11(b)(1)(ii)(c), it will contact NREPC and provide the opportunity for a joint Federal/State inspection. Inability of NREPC to make an immediate joint inspection will not be cause for OSM to delay a Federal inspection where a citizen has alleged, and OSM has reason to believe, that an imminent danger to the public health and safety, or significant, imminent environmental harm to land, air or water resources exists. All citizen complaints which do not involve an imminent danger or significant, imminent environmental harm will be referred to NREPC for action in accordance with OSM regulations, policies, and procedures.

# Article VIII: Enforcement
NREPC will have primary enforcement authority under the Act concerning compliance with the requirements of this Agreement and the Program in accordance with 30 CFR 740.4(c)(5). Enforcement authority given to the Secretary under other Federal laws and Executive Orders including, but not limited to, those listed in appendix A (attached) is reserved to the Secretary.
During any joint inspections by OSM and NREPC, NREPC will have primary responsibility for enforcement procedures including issuance of orders of cessation, notices of violation, and assessment of penalties. NREPC will inform OSM prior to issuance of any decision to suspend or revoke a permit on Federal lands.
During any inspection made solely by OSM or any joint inspection where NREPC and OSM fail to agree regarding the propriety of any particular enforcement action, OSM may take any enforcement action necessary to comply with 30 CFR Parts 843, 845, and 846. Such enforcement action will be based on the standards in the Program, the Act, or both, and will be taken using the procedures and penalty system contained in 30 CFR Parts 843, 845, and 846.
NREPC and OSM will within 5 calendar days notify each other of all violations of applicable laws, regulations, orders, or approved mining permits subject to this Agreement, and of all actions taken with respect to such violations.
Personnel of NREPC and OSM will be mutually available to serve as witnesses in enforcement actions taken by either party.
This Agreement does not affect or limit the Secretary's authority to enforce violations of Federal laws other than the Act.

# Article IX: Bonds
NREPC and the Secretary will require each permittee who conducts operations on Federal lands to submit a performance bond payable to the State of Kentucky for an amount adequate to cover the operator's responsibilities under the Act and Program. Such performance bond will be conditioned upon compliance with all requirements of the Act, the Program, State rules and regulations, and any other requirements imposed by the Department of the Interior. Such bond will state on its face that in the event the Federal Lands Cooperative Agreement between Kentucky and the U.S. Department of the Interior is terminated, the portion of the bond covering the Federal lands increment(s) shall be assigned to the United States. The bond shall also state that if subsequent to the forfeiture of the bond, the Cooperative Agreement is terminated, any unspent or uncommitted proceeds of the portion of the bond covering the Federal lands increment(s) shall be assigned to and forwarded to the United States. NREPC will advise OSM within 30 calendar days of any adjustments to the performance bond made pursuant to the Program.
Prior to releasing the permittee from any obligation under such bond for surface coal mining operations involving leased Federal coal, NREPC will obtain the concurrence of OSM. OSM concurrence will include coordination with the Federal land management agency and any other agency with jurisdiction or responsibility over Federal lands affected by the surface coal mining and reclamation operation.
Submission of a performance bond does not satisfy the requirements for a Federal lease bond required by 43 CFR subpart3474 or lessee protection bond required in addition to a performance bond, in certain circumstances, by Section 715 of the Act. Where Federal lease bonds or protections are required, OSM or the appropriate Federal agency is responsible for the collection and maintenance of such bonds.

# Article X: Designating Areas Unsuitable for All or Certain Types of Surface Coal Mining and Reclamation Operations and Activities, Valid Existing Rights (VER), and Compatibility Determinations

# A. Unsuitability Petitions
1. Authority to designate Federal lands as unsuitable for mining pursuant to a petition is reserved to the Secretary.
2. When either NREPC or OSM receives a petition to designate land areas unsuitable for all or certain types of surface coal mining operations that could impact adjacent Federal or non-Federal lands pursuant to Section 522(c) of the Act, the agency receiving the petition will notify the other agency of receipt within 5 calendar days and of the anticipated schedule for reaching a decision,
and request and fully consider data, information and recommendations of the other agency. OSM will coordinate with the Federal land management agency and any other agency with jurisdiction or responsibility over Federal lands within or adjacent to the petition area and will solicit comments from these agencies.

# B. VER and Compatibility Determinations
The following actions will be taken when requests for determinations of VER pursuant to Section 522(e)(1) or (2) of the Act or for determinations of compatibility pursuant to Section 522(e)(2) of the Act are received:
1. For Federal lands where proposed operations are prohibited or limited by Section 522(e)(1) or (2) of the Act and 30 CFR 761.11(a) or (b), OSM will make the VER determination.
2. OSM will process requests for determinations of compatibility under Section 522(e)(2) of the Act and 30 CFR 761.11(b) and 761.12(c).

# Article XI: Termination of Cooperative Agreement
This Agreement may be terminated by the Governor or the Secretary under the provisions of 30 CFR 745.15.

# Article XII: Reinstatement of Cooperative Agreement
If this Agreement has been terminated in whole or in part, it may be reinstated under the provisions of 30 CFR 745.16. The Secretary reserves the powers and authority specified in 30 CFR 745.13.

# Article XIII: Amendment of Cooperative Agreement
This Agreement may be amended by mutual agreement of the Governor and the Secretary in accordance with 30 CFR 745.14.

# Article XIV: Changes in State or Federal Standards
The Secretary or NREPC may, from time to time, promulgate new or revised performance or reclamation requirements or enforcement and administrative procedures. Each party will, if it determines it to be necessary to keep this Agreement in force, change or revise its regulations or request necessary legislative action.
Such changes will be made under the procedures of 30 CFR part 732 for changes to the Program and under the procedures of Section 501 of the Act for changes to the Federal lands program.
NREPC and OSM will provide each other with copies of any changes to their respective laws, rules, regulations, policy statements, guidelines or standards pertaining to the enforcement and administration of this Agreement.

# Article XV: Changes in Personnel and Organization
Each party to this Agreement will notify the other, when necessary, of any changes in personnel, organization and funding, or other changes that may affect the implementation of this Agreement to ensure coordination of responsibilities and facilitate cooperation.

# Article XVI: Reservation of Rights
This Agreement will not be construed as waiving or preventing the assertion of any rights in this Agreement that the State or the Secretary may have under laws other than the Act or their regulations, including but not limited to those listed in Appendix A.

§ 921.700
Massachusetts Federal program.
(a) This part contains all rules that are applicable to surface coal mining operations in Massachusetts which have been adopted under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977.
(b) The rules in this part cross-reference pertinent parts of the permanent program regulations in this chapter. The full text of a rule is in the permanent program rule cited under the relevant section of the Massachusetts Federal program.
(c) The rules in this part apply to all surface coal mining operations in Massachusetts conducted on non-Federal and non-Indian lands. The rules in Subchapter D of this chapter apply to operations on Federal lands in Massachusetts.
(d) The recordkeeping and reporting requirements of this part are the same as those of the permanent program regulations which have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3507.
(e) There are no Massachusetts laws which provide more stringent environmental control and regulation of surface coal mining operations than do the provisions of the Surface Mining and Reclamation Act and the regulations in 30 CFR chapter VII.
(f) The following are Massachusetts laws that interfere with the achievement of the purposes and requirements of the Act and are, in accordance with section 504(g) of the Act, preempted and superseded insofar as they apply to surface coal mining operations regulated under the Act:
(1) The Coal Mining Regulatory and Reclamation Act of 1977, as amended, Mass. Ann. Laws. Ch. 21B, Sections 1-15.
(2) Statutes governing licenses for minerals exploration, Mass. Ann. Laws Ch. 21, section 54-56.
(g) The Secretary may grant a limited variance from the performance standards of §§ 921.815 through 921.828 of this part if the applicant for coal exploration approval or a surface mining permit submitted pursuant to §§ 921.772 through 921.785 demonstrates in the application that:
(1) Such a variance is necessary because of the nature of Massachusetts' terrain, climate, biological, chemical or other relevant physical conditions; and
(2) The proposed variance is not less effective than the environmental protection requirements of the regulations in this program and is consistent with the Act.

Michigan Federal program.
(a) This part contains all rules that are applicable to surface coal mining
operations in Michigan which have been adopted under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977.
(b) The rules in this part cross-reference pertinent parts of the permanent program regulations in this chapter. The full text of a rule is in the permanent program rule cited under the relevant section of the Michigan Federal program.
(c) The rules in this part apply to all surface coal mining operations in Michigan conducted on non-Federal and non-Indian lands. The rules in Subchapter D of this chapter apply to operations on Federal lands in Michigan.
(d) The information collection requirements contained in this part do not require approval by the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3507 because there are fewer than ten respondents annually.
(e) The following provisions of Michigan laws provide, where applicable, for more stringent environmental control and regulation of surface coal mining operations than do the provisions of the Act and the regulations in this chapter. Therefore, pursuant to section 505(b) of the Act, they shall not be construed to be inconsistent with the Act:
(1) The Michigan Reclamation of Mining Lands, Act 92 (1970), MCL section 425.181
et seq.
as amended, to the extent that it regulates surface coal mining operations which affect two acres or less; or where less than 250 tons of coal are removed or intended to be removed for commercial use or sale in one location or; or where the extraction of coal is incidental to the extraction of other minerals and where coal does not exceed 16
2/3
per centum of the tonnage of minerals removed for purposes of commercial use or sale; or coal explorations subject to section 512 of the Act (30 U.S.C. 1262) or; where the extraction of coal is an incidental part of Federal, State, or local government-financed highway or other construction.
(2) Michigan Farmland and Open Space Preservation Act, MCL section 554.701, pertaining to land use restrictions including mineral extraction.
(3) Michigan Solid Waste Regulations pertaining to solid waste management, MCL section 299.401, R-325.3231.
(4) Michigan noxious weed statute and regulations containing the noxious weed list, MCL section 243.61.
(f) The following are Michigan laws that interfere with the achievement of the purposes and requirements of the Act and are, in accordance with section 504(g) of the Act, preempted and superseded:
The Michigan Reclamation of Mining Lands Act, MCL section 425.181
et seq.
as amended, but not to the extent that it regulates surface coal mining operations which affect two acres or less; or where less than 250 tons of coal are removed or intended to be removed for commercial use in one location; or where the extraction of coal is incidental to the extraction of other minerals and where coal does not exceed 16
2/3
per centum of the tonnage of minerals removed for purposes of commercial use or sale; or coal explorations subject to section 512 of the Act (30 U.S.C. 1262); or where the extraction of coal is an incidental part of Federal, State, or local government-financed highway or other construction.

§ 926.30
State-Federal cooperative agreement.

# Cooperative Agreement
The Governor of the State of Montana (Governor) and the Secretary of the Department of the Interior (Secretary) enter into a State-Federal Cooperative Agreement (Agreement) to read as follows:

# Article I: Authority, Purposes, and Responsible Agencies

# A. Authority
This Agreement is authorized by section 523(c) of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act (SMCRA), 30 U.S.C. 1273(c), which allows a State with a permanent regulatory program approved by the Secretary, under 30 U.S.C. 1253, to elect to enter into an agreement for State control and regulation of surface coal mining and reclamation operations on Federal lands. This Agreement provides for State regulation of coal exploration operations
1
not subject to 43 CFR Group 3400, and surface coal mining and reclamation operations and activities in Montana on Federal lands consistent with SMCRA, the Federal lands program (30 CFR) Chapter VII, Subchapter D), and the Montana State Program (State Program), including among other things, the Montana Strip and Underground Mine Reclamation Act, part 2, Chapter 4, Title 82, Montana Code Annotated (State Act or MCA).
1
The term “Exploration Operations” is referred to as “Prospecting” in the Montana State Program.

# B. Purposes
The purposes of the Agreement are to (1) foster State-Federal cooperation in the regulation of surface coal mining and reclamation operations on Federal lands and coal exploration operations not subject to 43 CFR Group 3400; (2) minimize intergovernmental
overlap and duplication; and (3) provide effective and uniform application of the State Program on all non-Indian lands in Montana.

# C. Responsible Agencies
The Montana Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) shall administer this Agreement on behalf of the Governor. The Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSM) shall administer this Agreement on behalf of the Secretary.

# Article II: Effective Date
Upon signing by the Secretary and the Governor, this Agreement will take effect 30 days after final publication as a rule making in the
Federal Register.
2
This Agreement shall remain in effect until terminated as provided in Article XI.
2
See explanation in Article II at 46 FR 20983, April 8, 1981.

# Article III: Definitions
The term and phrases used in this Agreement, except the term “permit application package (PAP),” will be given the meanings set forth in SMCRA, 30 CFR Parts 700, 701, 740, and 761, and the State Program, including the State Act and the regulations promulgated pursuant to the State Act. Where there is a conflict between the above-referenced State and Federal definitions, the definitions used in the State Program will apply, unless otherwise required by Federal regulation.
The term “permit application package (PAP)” for the purposes of this Agreement, means a proposal to conduct surface coal mining and reclamation operations on Federal lands, including an application for a permit, permit revision, permit amendment, or permit renewal, and all information required by SMCRA, the Federal regulations, the State Program, this Agreement, and all other applicable laws and regulations, including, with respect to leased Federal coal, the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 (MLA) and its implementing regulations.

# Article IV: Applicability
In accordance with the Federal lands program, the laws, regulations, terms and conditions of the State Program are applicable to Federal lands in Montana except as otherwise stated in this Agreement, SMCRA, 30 CFR 740.4, 740.11(a), and 745.13 or other applicable Federal laws, Executive Orders, or regulations.

# Article V: Requirements for the Agreement
The Governor and the Secretary affirm that they will comply with all provisions of this Agreement.

# A. Funds
1. The State shall devote adequate funds to the administration and enforcement on Federal lands in Montana of the requirements contained in the State Program. If the State complies with the terms of this Agreement, and if necessary funds have been appropriated, OSM shall reimburse the State as provided in section 705(c) of SMCRA and 30 CFR 735.16 for the costs associated with carrying out responsibilities under this Agreement. The amount of such funds shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 3-10 and appendix 111 of the Federal Assistance Manual.
2. If DEQ applies for a grant but sufficient funds have not been appropriated to OSM, OSM and DEQ shall promptly meet to decide on appropriate measures that will insure that surface coal mining and reclamation operations on Federal lands in Montana are regulated in accordance with the State Program.
3. Funds provided to DEQ under this Agreement will be adjusted in accordance with the program income provisions of 43 CFR part 12.

# B. Reports and Records
1. DEQ shall submit annual reports to OSM containing information with respect to its compliance with the terms of this Agreement pursuant to 30 CFR 745.12(d). Upon request, DEQ and OSM shall exchange, except where prohibited by Federal or State law, information developed under this Agreement. OSM shall provide DEQ with a copy of any final evaluation report prepared concerning State administration and enforcement of this Agreement. DEQ comments on the report will be attached before being sent to the Congress or other interested parties.

# C. Personnel
DEQ shall maintain the necessary personnel to fully implement this Agreement in accordance with the provisions of SMCRA, the Federal lands program, and the State Program.

# D. Equipment and Facilities
DEQ shall assure itself access to equipment, laboratories, and facilities with which all inspections, investigations, studies, tests, and analyses can be performed and which are necessary to carry out the requirements of this Agreement.

# E. Permit Application Fees and Civil Penalties
The amount of the fee accompanying the PAP shall be determined in accordance with section 82-4-223(1), of MCA, and the applicable provisions of Federal law. All permit fees and civil penalty fines shall be accounted for in accordance with the provisions of 43 CFR

B. During any joint inspection by OSM and DEQ, DEQ will have primary responsibility for enforcement procedures, including issuance of cessation orders and notices of violation. DEQ shall consult with OSM prior to issuance of any decision to suspend, rescind or revoke a permit on Federal lands. DEQ shall notify BLM of any suspension, rescission or revocation of a permit containing leased Federal coal pursuant to 30 CFR 740.13(f)(2).
C. During any inspection made solely by OSM or any joint inspection where DEQ an OSM fail to agree regarding the propriety of any particular enforcement action, OSM may take any enforcement action necessary to comply with 30 CFR Parts 842, 843, 845 and 846.
D. DEQ and OSM shall promptly notify each other of all violations and of all actions taken with respect to such violations.
E. Personnel of DEQ and OSM shall be mutually available to serve as witnesses in enforcement actions taken by either party.
F. This Agreement does not affect or limit the Secretary's authority to enforce violations of Federal laws other than SMCRA.

# Article IX: Bonds
A. DEQ and the Secretary shall require all operators on Federal lands to submit a single performance bond jointly payable to both the United States and DEQ. The board shall be of sufficient amount to cover the operator's responsibilities under SMCRA and the State Program. The bond shall be conditioned upon continued compliance with all requirements of SMCRA, 30 CFR Chapter VII, the State Program, and the permit. Such bond shall provide that if this Agreement is terminated under the provisions of 30 CFR 745.15, the portion of the bond covering the Federal lands shall be payable only to the United States.
B. DEQ will have primary responsibility for the approval and release of performance bonds required for surface coal mining and reclamation operations on Federal lands. However, release of a performance bond on lands subject to an approved mining plan requires the concurrence of OSM as provided in 30 CFR 740.15(d)(3). Prior to such concurrence, OSM shall coordinate with other Federal agencies having the authority over the lands involved. DEQ shall annually advice OSM of adjustments to the performance bond.
C. Performance bonds will be subject to forfeiture with the concurrence of OSM, in accordance with the procedures and requirements of the State Program. OSM may not withhold its concurrence unless DEQ's forfeiture decision is not in accordance with the requirements and procedures of the State program.
D. Submission of a performance bond does not satisfy the requirements for either a Federal lease bond required by 43 CFR part 3474 or a lessee protection bond which is required in certain circumstances by section 715 of SMCRA.

# Article X: Designating Land Areas Unsuitable for All or Certain Types of Surface Coal Mining and Reclamation Operations and Activities, and Valid Existing Rights and Compatibility Determinations

1. For Federal lands within the boundaries of any areas specified under section 522(e)(1) of SMCRA, the Secretary will make the VER determination. If surface coal mining and reclamation operations would be conducted on both Federal and non-Federal lands within such areas, the Secretary will make the VER determination for the Federal lands and DEQ will make the VER determination for State and private lands.
2. For Federal lands within the boundaries of any national forest where proposed surface coal mining and reclamation operations are prohibited or limited by section 522(e)(2) of SMCRA and 30 CFR 761.11(b), the Secretary will make VER determinations. OSM will process requests for determinations of compatibility under section 522(e)(2) of SMCRA and part 30 CFR 761.12(c).
3. Where a VER determination is requested for Federal lands protected under section 522(e)(3), DEQ will make the VER determination. DEQ will determine, in consultation with the State Historic Preservation Officer, whether any proposed operation will adversely affect any publicly-owned park or historic place listed on the National Register of Historic Sites (NRHS).
Surface coal mining and reclamation operations of Federal lands protected under section 522(e)(3) of SMCRA may be permitted if approved jointly by DEQ, and the Federal, State, or local agency with jurisdiction over the park or historic place. DEQ will coordinate with any agency with jurisdiction over the publicly-owned park or historic place to develop mutually acceptable terms and conditions for incorporation into the permit in order to mitigate environmental impacts.
4. DEQ will process determinations of VER on Federal lands for all areas limited or prohibited by section 522(e)(4) and (5) of SMCRA as unsuitable for mining.
5. For operations on Federal lands, whenever DEQ is responsible for making the VER determinations, DEQ will consult with OSM and any affected agency.

DEQ and OSM shall advise each other in writing of changes in the location of their respective offices, addresses, telephone numbers, as well as changes in the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of their respective personnel.
B. Should the State Act be amended to transfer administration of the State Act to another agency, all references to DEQ in this Agreement shall be deemed to apply to the successor regulatory agency as of the date of the transfer. The provisions in this Agreement shall thereafter apply to that agency.

# Article XVI: Reservation of Rights
In accordance with 30 CFR 745.13, this Agreement shall not be construed as waiving or preventing the assertion of any rights that have not been expressly addressed in this Agreement that the State or the Secretary may have under laws other than the Act and the State Program, including, but not limited to those listed in appendix A.

Any documentation or information submitted by the operator for the sole purpose of complying with the 3-year requirement of section 7(c) of the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920, 30 U.S.C. 181
et seq.,
will be forwarded to the Minerals Management Service (MMS). If such documentation is submitted as part of a permit application package, a copy of the entire package will be forwarded to MMS.
The permit application package or application for a permit revision or renewal shall be in the form required by Mining and Minerals, shall satisfy the requirements of 30 CFR 741.12(b) and 30 CFR 741.13, and shall include the information required by, or necessary for, Mining and Minerals and the Secretary to make a determination of compliance with:
(a) Section 69-25A-1,
et seq.,
NMSA 1978;
(b) New Mexico Coal Surface Mining Commission Rule 80-1;
(c) Applicable terms and conditions of the Federal coal lease;
(d) Applicable requirements of the 30 CFR part 211 regulations pertaining to the Mineral Leasing Act requirements; and

12. Mining and Minerals shall assume the primary authority pursuant to sections 510(a) and 523(c) of the Federal Act for the analysis, review, and approval of the permit application or application for a permit revision or renewal according to the standards of the Program. OSM shall assist Mining and Minerals in the analysis of the permit application or application for a permit revision or renewal according to the procedures set forth in appendix B. The Department shall concurrently carry out its responsibilities under the Mineral Leasing Act, as amended (MLA), the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), and other public laws (including but not limited to those in appendix A) that cannot, under the Federal Act, be delegated to the State. The Department shall carry out these responsibilities according to the procedures set forth in appendix B so as to avoid, to the maximum extent possible, duplication of the responsibilities of the State set forth in this Agreement and the State Program. The Secretary will consider the information in the permit application package and, where appropriate, make the decisions required by the Federal Act, MLA, NEPA and other public laws listed above.
13. Mining and Minerals shall be the primary point of contact with the operator. The Department will independently initiate contacts with the applicant regarding permit application packages or applications for a permit revision or renewal only where necessary to carry out its statutory responsibilities. When such action may generate correspondence with the applicant, a copy of all correspondence with the applicant that may have a bearing on decisions regarding the mining operation shall be sent to Mining and Minerals.
14. Mining and Minerals shall maintain a file of all original correspondence with the applicant and any information received from the applicant which may have a bearing on decisions regarding the permit application package or application for a permit revision or renewal. At the request of the Secretary or his designated agents, Mining and Minerals shall make available the Mining and Minerals files and send copies of such correspondence and information when requested to do so.

§ 933.700
North Carolina Federal program.
(a) This part contains all rules that are applicable to surface coal mining operations in North Carolina which have been adopted under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977.
(b) The rules in this part cross-reference pertinent parts of the permanent program regulations in this chapter. The full text of a rule is in the permanent program rule cited under the relevant section of the North Carolina Federal program.
(c) The rules in this part apply to all surface coal mining operations in North Carolina conducted on non-Federal and non-Indian lands. The rules in Subchapter D of this chapter apply to operations on Federal lands in North Carolina.
(d) The information collection requirements contained in this part do not require approval by the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3507 because there are fewer than ten respondents annually.
(e) The following provisions of North Carolina laws and regulations provide, where applicable, for more stringent environmental control and regulation of some aspects of surface coal mining operations than do the provisions of the Act and the regulations in this chapter. Therefore, pursuant to section 505(b) of the Act, they shall not be construed to be inconsistent with the Act unless in a particular instance the rules in this chapter are found by OSM to establish more stringent environmental controls.
(1) North Carolina General Statute (NCGS) 74-51, concerning conditions under which a mining permit may be granted, authorized the North Carolina Department of Natural Resources and Community Development to deny a permit for a mining operation which will have a significantly adverse effect on the purposes of a publicly owned park, forest, or recreation area and may condition permit approval on a requirement of visual screening, vegetative or otherwise, so as to screen the
view of the operation from public highways, public parks, or residential areas where the Department finds such screening to be feasible and desirable, or determines that such screening measures are either not feasible or not desirable.
(2) North Carolina mining laws and regulations apply to mining operations affecting an area greater than one acre. To the extent that North Carolina mining law and regulations cited in paragraph (f) of this section apply to coal mining operations not regulated by the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act, they are not preempted by this Federal program for North Carolina.
(3) North Carolina Dam Safety Law of 1967, North Carolina General Statutes (NCGS) 143-215.23 through 143-215.37.
(4) Geophysical Exploration regulations, Title 15, North Carolina Administrative Code, Subchapter 5C, applies to any coal exploration involving the use of explosives.
(f) The following are North Carolina laws and regulations that generally interfere with the achievement of the purposes and requirements of the Act and are, in accordance with section 504(g) of the Act, preempted and superseded to the extent that they regulate coal exploration or surface coal mining and reclamation operations regulated by the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act. Other North Carolina laws may interfere with the achievement of the proposes of goals of the Act in an individual situation, and may be preempted and superseded as they affect a particular coal exploration or surface mining operation by publication of the notice to that effect in the
Federal Register.
(1) North Carolina Mining Act of 1971, as amended, NCGS 74-46 through 74-68, except to the extent that the Mining Act is preserved as provided in paragraph (e) of this section.
(2) Title 15, North Carolina Administrative Code, Subchapters 5A, 5B, and 5F Mining and Mineral Resources, except to the extent that those regulations are preserved as provided in paragraph (e) of this section.
(g) The Secretary may grant a limited variance from the performance standards of §§ 933.815 through 933.828 of this part if the applicant for coal exploration approval or a surface mining permit submitted pursuant to §§ 933.772 through 933.785 demonstrates in the application that: (1) Such variance is necessary because of the unique nature of North Carolina's terrain, climate, biological, chemical, or other relevant physical conditions; and (2) the proposed alternative will achieve equal or greater environmental protection than does the performance requirement from which the variance is requested.

# Article V: Policies and Procedures: Review of a Permit Application Package or an Application for a Permit Renewal or Revision
A.
Contents of Permit Application Package:
The Commission and the Secretary will require that an operator proposing to mine on Federal land shall submit an identical permit application package in an appropriate number of copies to the Commission and OSM. Any documentation or information submitted by the operator for the sole purpose of complying with the 3-year requirement of section 7(c) of the Mineral Leasing Act (30 U.S.C. 181
et seq.
) will be submitted directly to the Bureau of Land Management, Department of the Interior. The permit application package shall be in the form required by the Commission and include any
supplemental information required by the Secretary. The permit application package shall satisfy the requirements of 30 CFR Chapter VII, Subchapter D and shall include the information required by, or necessary for, the Commission and the Secretary, acting within their statutory authority, to make a determination of compliance with:
(1) Chapter 38-14.1 and Chapter 38-18 of the North Dakota Century Code;
(2) Article 69-05.2 of the North Dakota Administrative Code (NDAC);
(3) Applicable terms and conditions of the Federal coal lease;
(4) Applicable requirements of the Bureau of Land Management's 30 CFR part 211
1
regulations pertaining to the Mineral Leasing Act; and
1
Editorial Note:
30 CFR part 211 was redesignated as 43 CFR part 3480 at 48 FR 41589, Sept. 16, 1983.
(5) Applicable requirements of other Federal laws and the Program, including but not limited to those in appendix A of this Agreement.
B.
Review Procedures:
1. The Commission shall assume primary responsibility for the analysis, review, and approval of permit applications required by 30 CFR Chapter VII, Subchapter D for surface coal mining on Federal lands in North Dakota. OSM shall, as requested, assist the Commission in this analysis and review.
2. The Commission shall be the primary point of contact for operators regarding the approval of the permit application package, except on matters concerned exclusively with the 30 CFR part 211
1
regulations administered by the Bureau of Land Management. The Commission will be responsible for informing the applicant of all joint State-Federal or Federal determinations, except matters concerned exclusively with the 30 CFR part 211
1
regulations. The Commission shall send to the Bureau of Land Management all correspondence with the applicant which may have a bearing on decisions regarding Mineral Leasing Act requirements. Except in exigent circumstances, OSM shall generally not independently initiate contacts with applicants regarding completeness or deficiencies of permit application packages with respect to matters which are properly within the jurisdiction of the Commission. The Commission may arrange for an operator to send written communications and documents regarding a permit application package directly to OSM. The Secretary reserves the right to act independently of the Commission to carry out his responsibilities under laws other than the Federal Act. A copy of any independent correspondence with the applicant required to carry out these responsibilities which may have a bearing on decisions regarding the permit application package shall be sent to the State.
3. OSM is responsible for ensuring that any information OSM receives from an applicant regarding the permit application package is sent to the Commission and the Commission will send any information received from the applicant to OSM. OSM shall have access to Commission files for mines on Federal lands. OSM and the Commission shall regularly coordinate with each other during the permit application package review process.
4. OSM shall be responsible for obtaining, in a timely manner, the views of all Federal agencies with jurisdiction or responsibility over a permit application package on Federal lands in North Dakota and for making these views known to the Commission within 90 days of the receipt of the application by OSM. The Commission shall keep OSM informed of findings during the review which bear on the responsibilities of other Federal agencies. OSM shall take appropriate steps to facilitate discussions between the Commission and the concerned agencies wherever desirable to resolve issues or problems identified in the review.
5. Upon receipt of a permit application package, both OSM and the Commission shall each designate its application manager. The application managers shall serve as the primary point of contact between OSM and the Commission throughout the review process and shall be responsible for identifying areas of avoidable duplication of review and analysis, which shall be eliminated where possible. Not later than 15 days after an application has been received, OSM and the Commission shall discuss the application and agree upon a work plan and schedule for the review of the application. OSM shall thereafter inform the Commission of any specific or general areas of concern, including the scope of required environmental analyses under the National Environmental Policy Act, which require special handling or analysis. The Commission shall likewise inform OSM where OSM assistance will be needed to perform any specific or general analysis or prepare any studies or similar work.
6. The Commission shall prepare a technical-environmental analysis on the permit application package. Copies of drafts of this document shall be sent to OSM for review and comment. OSM shall independently evaluate the documents and inform the Commission within 30 days of any changes that should be made. The Commission shall consider the comments of OSM and send a final technical-environmental analysis to OSM which will form the basis for and be included in the decision document which OSM will prepare for the Secretary's consideration. The Commission shall approve or disapprove the permit application by written decision in
accordance with the Program. The Secretary's decision on the mining plan and those other Federal responsibilities which cannot be delegated (including but not limited to those listed in appendix A) shall be made concurrently with or as soon as possible after the final decision of the Commission on the permit. The permit issued by the Commission shall condition the initiation of surface coal mining operations on Federal lands within the permit area on obtaining mining plan approval from the Secretary. The Commission shall, in the approved permit, reserve the right to amend or rescind its action to conform with action taken, or with terms or conditions imposed, by the Secretary when approving the mining plan. After the Commission makes its decision on the permit, it shall send a notice to the applicant and OSM with a statement of findings and conclusions in support of the action.
7. The Commission may approve and issue permits, permit renewals, and permit revisions for surface disturbances associated with surface coal mining and reclamation operations, and disturbance of the surface may commence without need for an approved mining plan on lands where:
(a) The surface estate is non-Federal and non-Indian;
(b) The mineral estate is Federal and is unleased;
(c) The Commission consults with the Bureau of Land Management through OSM in order to insure that actions are not taken which would substantially and adversely affect the Federal mineral estate; and
(d) The proposed surface disturbances are planned to support surface coal mining and reclamation operations on adjacent non-Federal lands and this is specified in the permit, permit renewal, or permit revision.
8. Any permit renewal requested pursuant to applicable State laws and rules for a surface coal mining and reclamation operation on Federal lands, and for which a mining plan has been approved by the Secretary, shall be reviewed and approved or disapproved by the Commission in consultation with OSM for Federal responsibility under other laws. The Commission shall inform OSM and BLM of the approval or disapproval of the renewal and provide OSM and BLM with copies of the application documents.
9. The Commission shall inform OSM of each permit revision request with respect to surface coal mining and reclamation operations on Federal lands containing leased Federal coal. For other Federal lands, the Commission shall inform the Federal land management agency of each permit revision request. Surface coal mining and reclamation operations shall not occur pursuant to the revision unless the permit revision request has been approved by the Commission and:
(a) With respect to Federal lands containing leased Federal coal—
(i) The Secretary has determined that the permit revision does not constitute a mining plan modification, or
(ii) If the revision does constitute a mining plan modification, the modification has been approved by the Secretary.
(b) With respect to other Federal lands, the Commission has consulted with the Federal land management agency to ensure that the permit revision is consistent with Federal laws and regulations other than the Act.
10. When the Commission and OSM cannot resolve differences that develop during permit application package review or cannot agree on the final actions to be taken by the Commission and the Department, the matter shall be referred to the Governor and the Secretary for resolution.

# Article VI: Inspections
The Commission shall conduct inspections on Federal lands and prepare and file inspection reports in accordance with the approved Program.
A.
Inspection Reports:
The Commission shall, within 15 days of conducting any inspection on Federal lands, file with OSM an inspection report describing (1) the general conditions of the lands under the permit; (2) whether the operator is complying with applicable performance and reclamation requirements; and (3) the manner in which specific operations are being conducted.
B.
Commission Authority:
The Commission shall be the point of contact and primary inspection authority in dealing with the operator concerning operations and compliance with the requirements covered by this Agreement, except as described in this Agreement and the Secretary's regulations. Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent inspections by authorized Federal or State agencies for purposes other than those covered by this Agreement.
C.
OSM Authority:
For the purpose of evaluating the manner in which this Agreement is being carried out and to insure that performance and reclamation standards are being met, OSM may conduct inspections of surface coal mining and reclamation operations on Federal lands without prior notice to the Commission. In order to facilitate a joint Federal-State inspection, when OSM is responding to a citizen complaint of an imminent danger to the health or safety of the public or of a significant, imminent environmental harm pursuant to 30 CFR 842.11(b)(1)(i), it will contact the Commission if circumstances and time permit, prior to the Federal inspection. The Department may conduct any inspections necessary to comply with 30 CFR part 842 and 30 CFR 740.17 (as 30 CFR 740.17 relates to obligations under laws other than the Federal Act). If an inspection is made without Commission inspectors,
OSM shall provide the Commission with a copy of the inspection report within 15 days after the inspections.
D.
Witness Availability:
Personnel of the State and the Department shall be mutually available to serve as witnesses in enforcement actions taken by either party.

# Article VII: Enforcement
A.
Commission Enforcement:
The Commission shall have primary enforcement authority on Federal lands in accordance with the Program and this Agreement. During any joint inspection by OSM and the Commission, the Commission shall take appropriate enforcement action, including issuance of orders of cessation and notices of violation. OSM and the Commission shall consult prior to issuance of any decision to suspend or revoke a permit.
B.
Notification:
The Commission and OSM shall promptly notify each other of all violations of applicable laws, regulations, orders, approved mining and reclamation plans and permits subject to this Agreement and of all actions taken with respect to such violations.
C.
Secretary's Authority:
(1) This Agreement does not affect or limit the Secretary's authority to enforce violations of laws other than the Federal Act. (2) During any inspection made solely by OSM or any joint inspection where the Commission and OSM fail to agree regarding the propriety of any particular enforcement action, OSM may take any enforcement action necessary to comply with 30 CFR parts 843 and 845. Such enforcement action shall be based on the substantive standards included in the approved Program and shall be taken using the procedures and penalty system contained in 30 CFR parts 843 and 845.

# Article VIII: Bonds
A.
Bond Coverage and Terms:
The Commission and OSM shall require all operators on Federal lands to submit a single performance bond to cover the operator's responsibilities under the Federal Act and the Program, payable to both the United States and North Dakota. The performance bond shall be of sufficient amount to comply with the requirements of both State and Federal law and release of the performance bond shall be conditioned upon compliance with all applicable requirements. If this Agreement is terminated, the bond will continue in effect and to the extent that Federal lands are involved will be payable to the United States.
Submission of a performance bond does not satisfy the requirements for a Federal lease bond required by 43 CFR subpart3474 or a lessee protection bond required in addition to a performance bond, in certain circumstances, by section 715 of the Federal Act.
B.
Bond Release:
The Commission shall obtain OSM's concurrence prior to releasing the operator from any performance bonding obligation required under the Program for any Federal lands containing leased Federal coal. For surface coal mining and reclamation operations on other Federal lands, the Commission shall obtain the concurrence of the Federal land management agency prior to releasing the performance bond. The Commission shall advise OSM of any release of and adjustments made to the performance bond.
C.
Forfeiture:
The operator's performance bond shall be subject to forfeiture with the consent of OSM, in accordance with the procedures and requirements of the Program.

# Article IX: Designation of Lands as Unsuitable
The Commission and OSM shall cooperate in the review and processing of petitions to designate lands as unsuitable for surface coal mining operations. When either agency receives a petition which could have an impact on lands the designation of which as unsuitable for mining would be the responsibility of the other agency, the agency shall: (1) Notify the other of its receipt of the petition and of the anticipated schedule for reaching a decision; and (2) request and fully consider data, information and views of the other. The authority to designate Federal lands as unsuitable for mining is reserved to the Secretary or his designated representative.

# Article X: Termination of Cooperative Agreement

§ 935.30
State-Federal Cooperative Agreement.
The Governor of the State of Ohio, acting through the Department of Natural Resources, Division of Reclamation (Division), and the Secretary of the Department of the Interior, acting through the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSMRE), enter into a Cooperative Agreement (Agreement) to read as follows:

# Article I: Introduction, Purpose, and Responsible Administrative Agency
A. Authority: This Agreement is authorized by section 523(c) of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act (Act), 30 U.S.C. 1273(c), which allows a State with a permanent regulatory program approved by the Secretary under 30 U.S.C. 1253, to elect to enter into an Agreement with the Secretary of the Department of the Interior for State regulation of surface coal mining and reclamation operations on Federal lands. This Agreement provides for State regulation of surface coal mining and reclamation operations and of coal exploration operations not subject to 43 CFR part 3480, subparts 3480 through 3487, on Federal lands in Ohio which are under the jurisdiction of the United States Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, except those lands containing leased Federal coal, consistent with State and Federal laws governing such activities in Ohio, the Federal lands program (30 CFR parts 740-745) and the Ohio State program (approved State program).
B.
Purpose:
The purpose of this Agreement is to (a) foster Federal-State cooperation in the regulation of surface coal mining and reclamation operations; (b) eliminate intergovernmental overlap and duplication; and (c) provide uniform and effective application of the approved State program on all lands in Ohio, except those containing leased Federal coal, in accordance with the Act, the approved State program, and this Agreement.
C.
Responsible Administrative Agencies:
The Division shall be responsible for administering this Agreement on behalf of the Governor. The Assistant Secretary, Land and Minerals Management, acting through OSM, shall administer this Agreement on behalf of the Secretary in accordance with the regulations in 30 CFR Chapter VII. The Federal lands in Ohio covered by this Agreement are only those under the jurisdiction of the United States Department of Agriculture, Forest Service (Forest Service) and include all or parts of the Wayne National Forest. It is understood by both parties that the Forest Service will continue to be involved in mining operations on its respective lands pursuant to its laws, regulations, agreements and restrictions. These requirements are in addition to the requirements discussed in this Agreement.

# Article II: Effective Date
After it has been signed by the Secretary and the Governor, this Agreement shall be effective upon publication in the
Federal Register
as a final rule. This Agreement shall remain in effect until terminated as provided in Article V.B. or X.

# Article III: Definitions
Any terms and phrases used in this Agreement which are defined in the Act, 30 CFR parts 700, 701, and 740, or the approved State program shall be given the meanings set forth in said definitions. Where there is a conflict between the above referenced State and Federal definitions, the definitions used in the approved State program will apply, except in the case of a term or phrase which defines the Secretary's non-delegable responsibilities under the Act and other laws.

# Article IV: Applicability
In accordance with the Federal lands program in 30 CFR parts 740-745, the laws, regulations, terms and conditions of the approved State program (conditionally approved on August 10, 1982, 30 CFR part 935, or as hereinafter amended in accordance with 30 CFR 732.17) are applicable to surface coal mining and reclamation operations on Federal lands in Ohio except as otherwise stated in this Agreement, the Act, 30 CFR 745.13, or other applicable laws or regulations.
This Agreement does not apply to surface coal mining and reclamation operations on lands containing leased Federal coal. This Agreement applies only to lands under the jurisdiction of the Forest Service.

# Article V: General Requirements
The Governor and the Secretary affirm that they will comply with all the provisions of this Agreement and will continue to meet all the conditions and requirements specified in this Article.
A.
Authority of State Agency:
The Division has and shall continue to have the authority under State law to carry out this Agreement.
B.
Funds:
Upon application by the Division and subject to the availability of appropriations, the Department shall provide the State with the funds to defray the costs associated with carrying out responsibilities under this Agreement as provided in section 705(c) of the Act and 30 CFR part 735. If the State requests funds and sufficient funds have not been appropriated to OSM, OSM and the Division shall meet promptly to decide on appropriate measures that will ensure that surface coal mining and reclamation operations are regulated in accordance with the approved State program. If agreement cannot be reached, then either party may terminate the Agreement. Funds provided to the State under this Agreement shall be reduced; in proportion to the amount of fees collected by the State that are attributable to the Federal lands covered by this Agreement.
C.
Reports and Records:
The Division shall make annual reports to OSMRE on the results of the Division's implementation and administration of this Agreement, pursuant to 30 CFR 745.12(d). Upon request, the Division and OSMRE shall exchange information developed under this Agreement, except where prohibited by Federal law. OSMRE shall provide the Division with a copy of any final evaluation report prepared concerning the Division's administration and enforcement of this Agreement.
D.
Personnel:
The Division shall have the necessary personnel to implement this Agreement fully in accordance with the provisions of the Act and the approved State program.
E.
Equipment and Laboratories:
The Division will assure itself access to facilities which are necessary to carry out the requirements of the Agreement.

# Article VI: Review of Permit Application Package
The Division shall assume the primary responsibility for the review of permit application packages for surface coal mining and reclamation and coal exploration operations on Forest Service lands covered by this Agreement. The Division shall coordinate the review of permit application packages with the Forest Service and other Federal agencies which may be affected by the proposed surface coal mining and reclamation operation to ensure compliance with Federal laws other than the Act and regulations other than the approved State program. When requested by the State, OSMRE shall assist the State in identifying Federal agencies other than the Forest Service which may be affected by the mining proposal.
A.
Submission of Permit Application Package:
The Division shall require an operator proposing to mine on Forest Service lands to submit a permit application package in an appropriate number of copies to the Division. The permit application package shall be in the format required by the Division and include any supplemental information (as specified by OSMRE or the Forest Service) needed to satisfy the requirements of non-delegable requirements of the Act, Federal laws other than the Act, and regulations other than the approved State program.
B.
Coordination With Affected Agencies:
Upon receipt, the Division shall transmit a copy of the complete permit application package to the Forest Service and to other Federal agencies affected by the proposed surface coal mining and reclamation operation with a request for review pursuant to 30 CFR 740.13(c)(4). OSM shall determine whether or not a proposed surface coal mining and reclamation operation is prohibited or limited by the requirements of section 522(e) of the Act (30 U.S.C. 1272(e)) and 30 CFR parts 760-762 with respect to Federal areas designated by Congress as unsuitable for mining and shall make any necessary determinations under section 522(b) of the Act. The Division shall obtain, in a timely manner, the comments of the Forest Service and other Federal agencies affected by the mining proposal.
C.
Contact With the Applicant:
As a matter of practice, OSMRE will not independently initiate contacts with the applicant regarding permit application packages. However, OSMRE reserves the right to act independently of the Division to carry out any non-delegable responsibilities under the Act, or under other Federal laws and regulations, provided, however, that OSMRE shall inform the Division of the necessity of such action taken and send copies of all relevant correspondence to the Division.
D.
File and Records:
The Division shall maintain a title of all original correspondence with the applicant and any information received which may have a bearing on decisions regarding surface coal mining and reclamation operations on Forest Service lands. Upon request, the Division shall provide, for OSMRE or Forest Service review, copies of any titles and records for surface coal mining and reclamation operations on Forest Service lands.
E.
Permit Application Decision and Permit Issuance:
After consultation with the Forest Service and after making a finding of compliance with the approved State program and other applicable requirements, the Division may approve a permit application or application for permit revision or renewal and issue a permit. The permit issued by the Division shall condition the initiation of surface coal mining and reclamation operations on compliance with the requirements of the approved State program and, as applicable, requirements of OSM or the Forest Service pursuant to Federal laws other than the Act and regulations other than the approved State program. After the Division issues its decision on the permit application, it shall promptly send a notice of the action to OSM and to the Forest Service.

# Article VII: Inspections
The Division shall conduct inspections on Forest Service lands covered by this Agreement and prepare and file inspection reports in accordance with the approved State program.
A.
Inspection Reports:
The Division shall, within 15 days of conducting any inspection on Federal lands, file with OSM an inspection report describing (1) the general conditions of the lands under the permit; (2) whether the operator is complying with the applicable performance and reclamation requirements; and (3) the manner in which specific operations are being conducted.
B.
Division Authority:
The Division shall be the point of contact and primary inspection authority in dealing with the operator concerning operations and compliance with the requirements covered by this Agreement, except as described in this Agreement and the Secretary's regulations. Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent inspections by authorized Federal or State agencies for purposes other than those covered by this Agreement.
C.
OSM Authority:
For the purpose of evaluating the manner in which this Agreement is being carried out and to insure that performance and reclamation standards are being met, OSM may conduct inspections of surface coal mining and reclamation operations on Federal lands, without prior notice to the Division. In order to facilitate a joint Federal-State inspection, when OSM is responding to a citizen complaint of an imminent danger to the health or safety of the public or of a significant, imminent environmental harm pursuant to 30 CFR 842.11(b)(1)(i), it will contact the Division, if circumstances and time permit, prior to the Federal inspection. OSM may conduct any inspections necessary to comply with 30 CFR part 842. If an inspection is made without Division inspectors, OSM shall provide the Division with a copy of the inspection report within 10 days after inspection.
D.
Witness Availability:
Personnel of the State and OSM shall be mutually available to serve as witnesses in enforcement actions taken by either party.

# Article VIII: Enforcement
A.
Division Enforcement:
The Division shall have primary enforcement authority on Federal lands covered by this Agreement in accordance with the approved State program
and this Agreement. During any joint inspection by OSM and the Division, the Division shall take appropriate enforcement action, including issuance of orders of cessation and notices of violation.
B.
Notification:
The Division shall promptly notify the Forest Service of all violations of applicable laws, regulations, orders, and approved permits for surface coal mining and reclamation operations on lands administered by the Forest Service.
C.
Secretary's Authority:
(1) This Agreement does not affect or limit the Secretary's authority to enforce violations of laws other than the Act. (2) During an inspection made solely by OSM or any joint inspection where the Division and OSMRE fail to agree regarding the propriety of any particular enforcement action, OSM may take any enforcement action necessary to comply with 30 CFR parts 843 and 845. Such enforcement action shall be based on the Act or the applicable substantive provisions included in the regulations of the approved State program and shall be taken using the procedures and penalty system contained in 30 CFR parts 843 and 845.

# Article IX: Bonds
A.
Performance Bond:
The Division shall require all operators on Federal lands covered by this Agreement to submit a performance bond to cover the operator's responsibilities under the Federal Act and the approved State program, payable to both the United States and Ohio. The performance bond shall be of sufficient amount to comply with the requirements of the approved State program and any other conditions of the permit. Release of the performance bond shall be conditioned upon compliance with all applicable requirements. The Division shall obtain the concurrence of the Forest Service prior to releasing the operator from any obligation under the performance bond. If this Agreement is terminated, (1) the bond will revert to being payable only to the United States to the extent that Federal lands are involved, and (2) the bond will be delivered by the Division to OSM if only Federal lands are covered by the bond.
B.
Forfeiture:
In the event of forfeiture by an operator of the performance bond for surface coal mining and reclamation operations on Federal lands covered by this Agreement, the State shall use funds received from bond forfeiture and, where necessary, funds from the Ohio Reclamation Forfeiture Special Account (pursuant to section 1513.18 of the Ohio Revised Code) to ensure that reclamation is accomplished in accordance with the approved State program and the approved permit.

# Article X: Termination of Cooperative Agreement
This Agreement may be terminated by the Governor or the Secretary under the provisions of 30 CFR 745.15.

# Article XI: Reinstatement of Cooperative Agreement
If this Agreement has been terminated in whole or in part it may be reinstated under the provisions of 30 CFR 745.16.

# Article XII: Amendment of Cooperative Agreement
This Agreement may be amended by mutual agreement of the Governor and the Secretary in accordance with 30 CFR 745.14.

# Article XIII: Changes in State or Federal Standards
A.
Effect of Changes:
The Secretary or the State may promulgate new Federal or State regulations, including new or revised performance or reclamation requirements or enforcement or administration procedures. OSM and the Division shall immediately inform each other of any final changes and of any effect such changes may have on the cooperative agreement. If it is determined to be necessary to keep this Agreement in force, the Division shall request necessary State legislative action and each party shall revise its regulations or promulgate new regulations, as applicable. Such changes shall be made under the procedures of 30 CFR part 732 for changes to the approved State program and sections 501 and 523 of the Federal Act for changes to the Federal lands program.
B.
Copies of Changes:
The State and OSM shall provide each other with copies of any changes to their respective laws, rules, regulations, and standards pertaining to the enforcement and administration of this Agreement.

# Article XIV: Changes in Personnel and Organization
The Division and the Secretary shall, consistent with 30 CFR part 745, advise each other of substantial changes in statutes, regulations, funding, staff, or other changes which could affect the administration and enforcement of this Agreement.

# Article XV: Reservation of Rights
In accordance with 30 CFR 745.13, this Agreement shall not be construed as waiving or preventing the assertion of any rights that have not been expressly addressed in this Agreement that the State or the Secretary may have under other laws or regulations, including but not limited to those listed in appendix A.

§ 936.30
State-Federal Cooperative Agreement.
The Governor of the State of Oklahoma and the Secretary of the Department of the Interior (Secretary) enter into a Cooperative Agreement (Agreement) to read as follows:

# Article I: Introduction, Purpose, and Responsible Agencies
A. This Agreement is authorized by section 523(c) of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act (Act), 30 U.S.C. 1273(c), which allows a State with a permanent regulatory program approved by the Secretary under 30 U.S.C. 1253, to elect to enter into an Agreement for the regulation and control of surface coal mining, operations on Federal lands. This Agreement provides for State regulation consistent with the Act, the Federal lands program (30 CFR, chapter VII, subchapter D) and the Oklahoma State program (Program) for surface coal mining and reclamation operations on Federal lands.
B. The purposes of this Agreement are to (a) foster Federal-State cooperation on the regulation of surface coal mining (b) minimize intergovernmental overlap and duplication and (c) provide uniform and effective application of the Program on all non-Indian lands in Oklahoma in accordance with the Act and the Program.
C. The Oklahoma Department of Mines (ODM), under the direction of the Oklahoma Mining Commission, shall be responsible for administering this Agreement on behalf of the Governor. The Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSMRE) shall administer this Agreement on behalf of the Secretary.

# Article II: Effective Date
After being signed by the Secretary and the Governor, this Agreement shall be effective 30 days after publication in the
Federal Register
as a final rule. This Agreement shall remain in effect until terminated as provided in Article XI.

# Article III: Definitions
The terms and phrases used in this Agreement which are defined in the Act, 30 CFR parts 700, 701, and 740, the Program, the Oklahoma Coal Reclamation Act of 1979, and in the rules and regulations promulgated pursuant to those Acts, shall be given the meanings set forth in said definitions. Where there is conflict between the above-referenced State and Federal definitions, the definitions used in the approved State program will apply except in the case of a term which defines the Secretary's continuing responsibilities under the Act and other laws.

# Article IV: Applicability
A. In accordance with the Federal lands program, the laws, regulations, terms and conditions of the Oklahoma Program are applicable to Federal lands in Oklahoma except as otherwise stated in this Agreement, the Act, 30 CFR 740.4 and 745.13, or other applicable Federal laws, Executive Orders, or regulations.
B. The following permits will not be transferred to the State by this Agreement and will remain under the jurisdiction of OSMRE: 1. CFI-Bokoshe (Federal Permit OK-0002), 2. Stigler No. 9 (Federal Permit OK-0009), 3. Bokoshe No. 10 (Federal Permit OK-0001), and 4. McCurtain No. 2 (Federal Permit OK-0002).
C. Orders and decisions issued by ODM in accordance with the Program that are appealable shall be appealed to the reviewing authority in accordance with the Program. Orders and decisions issued by the Department that are appealable shall be appealed to the Department of the Interior's Office of Hearings and Appeals.

# Article V: General Requirements
The Governor and the Secretary affirm that they will comply with all the provisions of this Agreement.

# A. Authority of State Agency
ODM has and shall continue to have the authority under State law to carry out this Agreement.

# B. Funds
Upon Application by ODM and subject to appropriations, OSMRE will provide the State with the funds to defray the cost associated with carrying out its responsibilities under this Agreement as provided in section 705(c) of the Federal Act, the grant agreement, and 30 CFR 735.16. Such funds will cover the full cost incurred by ODM in carrying out those responsibilities, provided that such cost does not exceed the estimated cost the Federal government would have expended to carry out such responsibilities in the absence of this Agreement; and provided that such State incurred cost per permitted acre of Federal land does not exceed the per permitted acre cost for similar administration and enforcement activities of the Program on non-Federal and non-Indian lands during the same time period.
The ratio or cost split of Federal to non-Federal dollars allocated under this Agreement will be determined by OSMRE and ODM based on the projected cost for regulation of mines within Federal lands that are under the jurisdiction of the State, in consideration of the relative amounts of Federal and non-Federal lands involved. The designation of mines based on Federal land will be prepared by ODM and submitted to OSMRE's
Tulsa Field Office. OSMRE will work with ODM to estimate the amount the Federal government would have expended for regulation of surface coal mining operations on Federal lands in Oklahoma in the absence of this Agreement.
OSMRE and the State will discuss the OSMRE Federal land cost estimate, the ODM prepared list of acres by mine, and the State's overall cost estimate. After resolution of any issues, ODM will submit its grant application to OSMRE's Tulsa Field Office. The Federal lands/non-Federal lands ratio will be applied to the final eligible total State expenditures to arrive at the total Federal reimbursement due the State. This ratio or cost split will be agreed upon by July of the year preceding the applicable fiscal year in order to enable the State to budget funds for the Program.
The State may use the existing year's budget totals, adjusted for inflation and workload considerations, in estimating the regulatory cost for the following grant year. OSMRE will notify ODM as soon as possible if such projections are unrealistic.
If ODM applies for a grant but sufficient funds have not been appropriated to OSMRE, OSMRE and ODM will promptly meet to decide on appropriate measures that will insure that mining operations on Federal lands in Oklahoma are regulated in accordance with the Program.
Funds provided to ODM under this Agreement will be adjusted in accordance with Office of Management and Budget Circular A-102 Attachment E.

# C. Reports and Records
ODM will make annual reports to OSMRE containing information with respect to compliance with terms of this Agreement pursuant to 30 CFR 745.12(d). ODM and OSMRE will exchange, upon request, except where prohibited by Federal or State law, information developed under this Agreement.
OSMRE will provide ODM with a copy of any final evaluation report prepared concerning State administration and enforcement of this Agreement. ODM comments on the report will be appended before transmission to the Congress or other interested parties.

# D. Personnel
ODM shall have the necessary personnel to fully implement this Agreement in accordance with the provisions of the Act, Federal lands program and the Program.

# E. Equipment and Laboratories
ODM will assure itself access to equipment, laboratories, and facilities to perform all inspections, investigations, studies, tests, and analyses that are necessary to carry out the requirements of the Agreement.

# F. Permit Application Fees and Civil Penalties
The amount of the fee accompanying an application for a permit for operations on Federal lands in Oklahoma shall be determined in accordance with section 745.1 of the Oklahoma Coal Reclamation Act of 1979, section 771.25 of the State regulations and the applicable provisions of the Program and Federal law. All permit fees and civil penalties collected from operations on Federal lands will be retained by the State and shall be deposited with the State Treasurer in the Oklahoma Department of Mines Revolving Fund. Permit fees will be considered Program income. The financial status report submitted pursuant to 30 CFR 735.26 shall include the amount of fees collected and attributable to Federal lands during the prior State fiscal year.

# Article VI: Review of Permit Application Package

# A. Submission of Permit Application Package
ODM and the Secretary will require an applicant proposing to conduct surface coal mining and reclamation operations and activities on Federal lands to submit a permit application package (PAP) with an appropriate number of copies to ODM. ODM will furnish OSMRE and other Federal agencies with an appropriate number of copies of the PAP. The PAP will be in the form required by ODM and will include any supplemental information required by OSMRE and the Federal land management agency. Where section 522(e)(3) of the Act applies, ODM will work with the agency with jurisdiction over the publicly owned park, including units of the National Park System, or place included in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) to determine what supplemental information will be required.
At a minimum, the PAP will satisfy the requirements of 30 CFR part 740 and include the information necessary for ODM to make a determination of compliance with the Program and for OSMRE and the appropriate Federal agencies to make determinations of compliance with applicable requirements of the Act, the Federal lands program, and other Federal laws, Executive Orders, and the regulations for which they are responsible.

# B. Review Procedures Where Leased Federal Coal is Involved
1. ODM will assume the responsibilities listed in 30 CFR 740.4(c) (1), (2), (3), (4), (6), and (7) to the extent authorized.
In accordance with 30 CFR 740.4(c)(1), ODM will assume primary responsibility for the analysis, review, and approval or disapproval of the permit application component of the PAP for surface coal mining and reclamation operations and activities in Oklahoma where
a mining plan is required. OSMRE will, at the request of the State, assist to the extent possible in this analysis and review.
The Secretary will concurrently carry out his responsibilities that cannot be delegated to ODM under the Federal lands program, the Mineral Leasing Act (MLA), the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), this Agreement, and other applicable Federal laws. The Secretary will carry out these responsibilities in a timely manner and will avoid, to the extent possible, duplication of the responsibilities of the State as set forth in this Agreement and the Program. The Secretary will consider the information in the PAP and where appropriate, make decisions required by the Act, MLA, NEPA, and other Federal laws.
Responsibilities and decisions which can be delegated to the State under other applicable Federal laws may be specified in working Agreements between OSMRE and ODM with concurrence of any Federal agency involved, and without amendment to this Agreement.
2. ODM will be the primary point of contact for applicants regarding the review of the PAP for compliance with the Program and State laws and regulations. On matters concerned exclusively with regulations under 43 CFR part 3480, subparts 3480 through 3487, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) will be the primary point of contact with the applicant. ODM will send to OSMRE copies of any correspondence with the applicant and any information received from the applicant regarding the PAP. OSMRE will send to ODM copies of all OSMRE correspondence which may have a bearing on the PAP. OSMRE will request additional information from the applicant through ODM. Copies of OSMRE's request will be sent directly to the operator by OSMRE to help expedite the permit review process. The requested information will be submitted to OSMRE through ODM.
BLM will inform ODM of its actions and provide ODM with a copy of documentation on all decisions. ODM will be responsible for informing the applicant of all joint State-Federal determinations. Where necessary to make the determination to recommend that the Secretary approve the mining plan, OSMRE will consult with and obtain the concurrences of BLM, the Federal land management agency, and other Federal agencies as required.
The Secretary reserves the right to act independently of ODM to carry out his responsibilities under laws other than the Act or provisions of the Act not covered by the Program, and in instances of disagreement over the Act and the Federal lands program.
3. ODM will, to the extent authorized, consult with the Federal land management agency and BLM pursuant to 30 CFR 740.4(c) (2) and (3), respectively. ODM will also be responsible for obtaining the comments and determinations of other Federal agencies with jurisdiction or responsibility over the Federal lands affected by the operations proposed in the PAP. ODM will request all Federal agencies to furnish their findings on any request for additional information to ODM within 45 days of the date of receipt of the PAP. OSMRE will assist ODM in obtaining this information upon request of ODM.
ODM will be responsible for approval and release of performance bonds and liability insurance under 30 CFR 740.4(c)(4).
ODM will prepare documentation to comply with the requirements of NEPA under 30 CFR 740.4(c)(7); however, OSMRE will retain the responsibility for the exceptions in 30 CFR 740.4(c)(7)(i)-(vii).
4. OSMRE will assist ODM in carrying out ODM's responsibilities by:
(a) Coordinating resolution of conflicts and difficulties between ODM and other Federal agencies in a timely manner;
(b) Assisting in scheduling joint meetings, upon request, between State and Federal agencies;
(c) Where OSMRE is assisting ODM in reviewing the PAP, furnishing to ODM the work product within 50 calendar days of receipt of the State's request for such assistance, unless a different time is agreed upon by OSMRE and ODM;
(d) Exercising its responsibilities in a timely manner, governed to the extent possible by the deadlines established in the Program; and
(e) Assuming all responsibility for ensuring compliance with any Federal lessee protection bond requirement.
5. Review of the PAP:
(a) OSMRE and ODM will coordinate with each other during the review process as needed. ODM will keep OSMRE informed of findings made during the review process which bear on the responsibilities of OSMRE or other Federal agencies. OSMRE will ensure that any information OSMRE receives which has a bearing on decisions regarding the PAP is promptly sent to ODM.
(b) ODM will review the PAP for compliance with the Program and State law and regulations.
(c) OSMRE will review the applicable portions of the PAP for compliance with the non-delegated responsibilities of the Act and for compliance with the requirements of other Federal laws, Executive orders, and regulations.
(d) OSMRE and ODM will develop a work plan and schedule for PAP review and each will identify a person as the project leader. The project leaders will serve as the primary points of contact between OSMRE and ODM throughout the review process. Not later than 50 days after receipt of the PAP, unless a different time is agreed upon, OSMRE will furnish ODM with its review comments on the PAP and specify any requirements for
additional data. To the extent practicable, ODM will provide OSMRE all available information that may aid OSMRE in preparing any findings.
(e) ODM will prepare a State decision package, including written findings and supporting documentation, indicating whether the PAP is in compliance with the Program. The review and finalization of the State decision package will be conducted in accordance with procedures for processing PAP's agreed upon by ODM and OSMRE.
(f) ODM may make a decision on approval or disapproval of the permit on Federal lands in accordance with the Program prior to the necessary Secretarial decision on the mining plan, provided that ODM advises the operator in the permit that Secretarial approval of the mining plan must be obtained before the operator may conduct coal development or mining operations on the Federal lease. ODM will reserve the right to amend or rescind any requirements of the permit to conform with any terms or conditions imposed by the Secretary in the approval of the mining plan.
(g) The permit will include, as applicable, terms and conditions required by the lease issued pursuant to the MLA and by any other applicable Federal laws and regulations, including conditions imposed by the Federal land management agency relating to post-mining land use, and those of other affected agencies, and will be conditioned on compliance with the requirements of the Federal land management agency with jurisdiction.
(h) In the case that valid existing rights (VER) are determined to exist on Federal lands under section 522(e)(3) of the Act where the proposed operation will adversely affect a unit of the National Park Service (NPS), ODM will work with the NPS to develop mutually agreed upon terms and conditions for incorporation into the permit to mitigate environmental impacts as set forth under Article X of this Agreement.
(i) After making its decision on the PAP, ODM will send a notice to the applicant, OSMRE, the Federal land management agency, and any agency with jurisdiction over the publicly owned park or historic place included in the NRHP affected by a decision under section 522(e)(3) of the Act. A copy of the written findings and the permit will also be submitted to OSMRE.
(j) OSMRE will provide technical assistance to ODM when requested, if available resources allow. OSMRE will have access to ODM files concerning operations on Federal lands.

# C. Review Procedures for Permit Revisions or Renewals
1. Any permit revision or renewal for an operation on Federal lands will be reviewed and approved or disapproved by ODM after consultation with OSMRE on whether such revision or renewal constitutes a mining plan modification. OSMRE will inform ODM within 30 days of receiving a copy of a proposed revision or renewal, whether the permit revision or renewal constitutes a mining plan modification. Where approval of a mining plan modification is required, OSMRE and ODM will follow the review procedures where leased Federal coal is involved as outlined in this Agreement.
2. OSMRE may establish criteria to determine which permit revisions and renewals clearly do not constitute mining plan modifications.
3. Permit revisions or renewals on Federal lands which are determined by OSMRE not to constitute mining plan modifications or that meet the criteria for not being mining plan modifications will be reviewed and approved by ODM.
4. Transfer, sale, or assignment of permit rights on Federal lands shall be processed in accordance with the Oklahoma Program and 30 CFR 740.13(e).

# Article VII: Inspections
A. ODM will conduct inspections of all surface coal mining and reclamation operations on Federal lands, except for those operations listed in Article IV, in accordance with 30 CFR 740.4(c)(5) and the Program and prepare and file inspection reports in accordance with the Program.
B. ODM will, subsequent to conducting any inspection pursuant to 30 CFR 740.4(c)(5), and on a timely basis, file with OSMRE's Tulsa Field Office a legible copy of the completed State inspection report.
C. ODM will be the point of contact and primary inspection authority in dealing with the operator concerning operations and compliance with the requirements covered by the Agreement, except as described hereinafter. Nothing in this Agreement will prevent inspections by authorized Federal or State agencies for purposes other than those covered by this Agreement. The Department may conduct any inspections necessary to comply with 30 CFR parts 842 and 843 and its obligations under laws other than the Act.
D. OSMRE will ordinarily give ODM reasonable notice of its intent to conduct an inspection under 30 CFR 842.11 in order to provide State inspectors with an opportunity to join in the inspection. When OSMRE is responding to a citizen complaint of an imminent danger to the public health and safety, or of significant, imminent environmental harm to land, air or water resources pursuant to 30 CFR 842.11(b)(1)(ii)(C), it will contact ODM no less than 24 hours prior to the Federal inspection, if practicable, to facilitate a joint Federal/State inspection. All citizen complaints which do not involve an imminent danger or significant, imminent environmental harm will be referred to ODM
for action. The Secretary reserves the right to conduct inspections without prior notice to ODM to carry out his responsibilities under the Act.

# Article VIII: Enforcement
A. ODM will have primary enforcement authority under the Act concerning compliance with the requirements of this Agreement and the Program in accordance with 30 CFR 740.4(c)(5). Enforcement authority given to the Secretary under other Federal laws and Executive orders including, but not limited to, those listed in appendix A (attached) is reserved to the Secretary.
B. During any joint inspection by OSMRE and ODM, ODM will have primary responsibility for enforcement procedures including issuance of orders of cessation, notices of violation, and assessment of penalties. ODM will inform OSMRE prior to issuance of any decision to suspend or revoke a permit on Federal lands.
C. During any inspection made solely by OSMRE or any joint inspection where ODM and OSMRE fail to agree regarding the propriety of any particular enforcement action, OSMRE may take any enforcement action necessary to comply with 30 CFR parts 843, 845, and 846. Such enforcement action will be based on the standards in the Program, the Act, or both, and will be taken using the procedures and penalty system contained in 30 CFR parts 843, 845, and 846.
D. ODM and OSMRE will promptly notify each other of all violations of applicable laws, regulations, orders, or approved mining permits subject to this Agreement, and of all actions taken with respect to such violations.
E. Personnel of ODM and OSMRE will be mutually available to serve as witness in enforcement actions taken by either party.
F. This Agreement does not affect or limit the Secretary's authority to enforce violations of Federal laws other than the Act.

# Article IX: Bonds
A. ODM and the Secretary will require each operator who conducts operations on Federal lands to submit a single performance bond payable to Oklahoma and the United States to cover the operator's responsibilities under the Act and the Program. Such performance bond will be conditioned upon compliance with all requirements of the Act, the Program, State rules and regulations, and any other requirements imposed by the Department. Such bond will provide that if this Agreement is terminated, the portion of the bond covering the Federal lands will be payable only to the United States. ODM will advise OSMRE of any adjustments to the performance bond made pursuant to the Program.
B. Prior to releasing the operator from any obligation under such bond, ODM will obtain the concurrence of OSMRE. OSMRE concurrence will include coordination with other Federal agencies having authority over the lands involved.
C. Performance bonds will be subject to forfeiture with the concurrence of OSMRE, in accordance with the procedures and requirements of the Program.
D. Submission of a performance bond does not satisfy the requirements for a Federal lease bond required by 43 CFR subpart 3474 or lessee protection bond required in addition to a performance bond, in certain circumstances, by section 715 of the Act.

# Article X: Designating Land Areas Unsuitable for All or Certain Types of Surface Coal Mining and Reclamation Operations and Activities and Valid Existing Rights and Compatibility Determinations

# A. Unsuitability Petitions.
1. Authority to designate Federal lands as unsuitable for mining pursuant to a petition is reserved to the Secretary.
2. When either ODM or OSMRE receives a petition that could impact adjacent Federal or non-Federal lands pursuant to section 522(c) of the Act, the agency receiving the petition will notify the other of receipt and the anticipated schedule for reaching a decision, and request and fully consider data, information and recommendations of the other. OSMRE will coordinate with the Federal land management agency with jurisdiction over the petition area, and will solicit comments from the agency.

# B. Valid Existing Rights and Compatibility Determinations
The following actions will be taken when requests for determination of valid existing rights (VER) pursuant to section 522(e) of the Act or for determinations of compatibility pursuant to section 522(e)(2) of the Act are received prior to or at the time of submission of a PAP that involves surface coal mining and reclamation operations and activities:
1. For Federal lands within the boundaries of any areas specified under section 522(e)(1) of the Act, OSMRE will determine whether VER exist for such areas.
For non-Federal lands within section 522(e)(1) areas ODM, with the consultation and concurrence of OSMRE, will determine whether operations on such lands will or will not affect Federal lands. For such non-Federal lands affecting Federal lands, OSMRE will make the VER determination.
Under section 522(e)(1), for non-Federal lands within the boundaries of the National Park System, ODM, with the consultation and concurrence of OSMRE, will determine
whether operations on such lands will or will not affect the Federal interest. For such non-Federal lands within the boundaries of the National Park System which affect the Federal interest, OSMRE will make the VER determinations.
2. For Federal lands within the boundaries of any national forest where proposed operations are prohibited or limited by section 522(e)(2) of the Act and 30 CFR 761.11(b), OSMRE will make the VER determination.
OSMRE will process requests for determinations of compatibility under section 522(e)(2) of the Act and 30 CFR 761.12(c).
3. For Federal lands, ODM, with the consultation and concurrence of OSMRE, will determine whether any proposed operations will adversely affect units of the National Park System with respect to the prohibitions or limitations of section 522(e)(3) of the Act. For such operations adversely affecting units of the National Park System, ODM, with the consultation and concurrence of OSMRE, will make the VER determination.
For Federal lands, ODM will determine whether any proposed operation will adversely affect any publicly owned parks other than those covered in the preceding paragraph and, in consultation with the State Historic Preservation Officer, places listed in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP), with respect to the prohibitions or limitations of section 522(e)(3) of the Act.
For Federal lands other than those on which the proposed operation will adversely affect units of the National Park System, ODM will make the VER determination for operations which are prohibited or limited by section 522(e)(3) of the Act. In the case that VER is determined to exist on Federal lands under section 522(e)(3) of the Act where a proposed operation will adversely affect a unit of the National Park System, ODM will work with the NPS to develop mutually agreed upon terms and conditions for incorporation into the permit in order to mitigate environmental impacts.
In the case that VER is determined not to exist under section 522(e)(3) of the Act or 30 CFR 761.11(c), no surface coal mining operations and activities will be permitted unless jointly approved by ODM and the Federal, State or local agency with jurisdiction over the publicly owned park or place included in the NRHP.
4. ODM will process determinations of VER on Federal lands for all areas limited or prohibited by section 522(e)(4) and (5) of the Act as unsuitable for mining. For operations on Federal lands, ODM will coordinate with any affected agency or agency with jurisdiction over the proposed surface coal mining and reclamation operation.

§ 937.700
Oregon Federal program.
(a) This part contains all rules that are applicable to surface coal mining operations in Oregon which have been adopted under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977.
(b) The rules in this part cross-reference pertinent parts of the permanent program regulations in this chapter. The full text of a rule is in the permanent program rule cited under the relevant section of the Oregon Federal program.
(c) The rules in this part apply to all surface coal mining operations in Oregon conducted on non-Federal and non-Indian lands. The rules in Subchapter D of this chapter apply to operations on Federal lands in Oregon.
(d) The information collection requirements contained in this part do not require approval by the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3507 because there are fewer than ten respondents annually.
(e) The following provisions of Oregon laws provide, where applicable, for more stringent environmental control and regulation of surface coal mining operations than do the provisions of the Act and the regulations in this chapter. Therefore, pursuant to Section 505(b) of the Act, they shall not be construed to be inconsistent with the Act:
(1) Oregon Revised Statutes (ORS) 468.700-468.997, pertaining to the control of water pollution.
(2) ORS 498.002 and ORS 498.705, protecting fish and wildlife and their habitats.
(3) ORS 509.125, prohibiting deleterious substances from being introduced into State waters.
(4) ORS 509.140, requiring the approval of the Fish and Wildlife Commission before explosives may be used to construct a dam or similar structure.
(5) ORS 509.600, prohibiting the injury or destruction of fish within 600 feet of any fishway. Prior approval of the Director, the Department of Fish and Wildlife, is required before constructing a dam or obstruction in State waters.
(6) ORS 509.615, requiring that artificial watercourses must be screened.
(f) The following are Oregon laws that interfere with the achievement of the purposes and requirements of the Act and are, in accordance with section 504(g) of the Act, pre-empted and superseded with respect to coal mining, except to the extent they provide for regulation of surface coal mining and reclamation operations which are exempt from the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977:
(1) Oregon Surface Mining and Mine Land Reclamation Act, as amended, ORS 517.750-ORS 517.990.
(2) Oregon Administrative Rules (OAR), Department of Geology and Mineral Industries, Division 30, Rules and Regulations, Oregon Mined Land Reclamation Act, OAR 632-30-005 through OAR 632-30-060.
(3) ORS 273.551 and ORS 273.775 to ORS 273.790. The contractual and leasing responsibility of the Division of Lands over State lands and minerals is not affected by this Federal program.
(4) ORS 275.340. Pre-empted to the extent that the State of Oregon construes this statute as delegating to cities and counties the authority to issue surface coal mining permits and related exploration permits.

§ 938.12
State statutory, regulatory, and proposed program amendment provisions not approved.

(b) We are not approving the following portions of provisions of the proposed program amendment that Pennsylvania submitted on November 22, 1999:
(1) Sections 25 Pa. Code 86.124(f) and 25 Pa. Code 86.125(j) are not approved to the extent that these sections would allow Pennsylvania more time to complete a final written decision on a lands unsuitable for surface mining activities petition than is allowed by the provisions of the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 764.19(b).
(c) We are not approving the following portions of provisions of the proposed program amendment that Pennsylvania submitted on December 18, 1998:
(1) 4.2(f)(4) of PASMCRA. We are not approving Subsection (4) to the extent that it would allow Phase 3 bond release.

(5) 25 Pa. Code 87.119 and 88.107. With regard to coal mining activities, we are not approving Subsection (a) to the extent that it would allow the replaced water supply to be of a lesser quantity and quality than the premining water supply or does not provide for temporary replacement of water supplies. We are not approving Subsection (a)(1)(v) to the extent it would pass on operating and maintenance costs of a replacement water supply in excess of the operating and maintenance costs of the premining water supply to the landowner or water supply user. We are not approving Section (a)(2) to the extent that an operator is not required to provide for all increased operating and maintenance costs of a restored or replaced water supply. Finally, we are not approving Subsection (a)(3) to the extent it would allow a waiver from the requirements for replacing a water supply outside the requirements of 30 CFR 701.5 regarding the definition of the term, “replacement of water supply.”
(6) 25 Pa. Code 87.119(g) and 88.107(g). These sections are not approved.
(7) 25 Pa. Code 87.119(i) and 88.107(i). We are not approving Subsection (i) to the extent that it would allow Phase 3 bond release.
(d) We are not approving the word “augmented” in the last sentence of subsection 86.151(d) that we found to be less effective on April 8, 1993 (58 FR 18154).
(e) We are deferring our decision on the inclusion of
minimal-impact post-mining discharge
in the definition of
post-mining pollutional discharge
until such time as the State submits the definition of minimal-impact post-mining discharge to us as a proposed program amendment.

(a) This part contains all rules that are applicable to surface coal mining and reclamation operations in Rhode Island which have been adopted under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977.
(b) The rules in this part cross-reference pertinent parts of the permanent program regulations in this chapter. The full text of a rule is in the permanent program rule cited under the relevant section of the Rhode Island Federal program.
(c) The rules in this part apply to all surface coal mining and reclamation operations in Rhode Island conducted on non-Federal and non-Indian lands. The rules in subchapter D of this chapter apply to operations on Federal lands in Rhode Island.
(d) The information collection requirements contained in this part do not require approval by the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3507 because there are fewer than ten respondents annually.
(e) The following provisions of Rhode Island laws provide, where applicable, for more stringent environmental control and regulation of surface coal mining and reclamation operations than do the provisions of the Act and the regulations in this chapter. Therefore, pursuant to Section 505(b) of the Act, they shall not be construed to be inconsistent with the Act:
(1) R.I. General Laws Sections 23-19.1-1 to 23-19.1-22, regulating treatment, disposal, and transportation of hazardous wastes within the State of Rhode Island.
(2) R.I. General Laws Sections 46-12-1 to 46-12-37, controlling the pollution of any of the State's waterways.
(f) There are no Rhode Island laws that generally interfere with the achievement of the purposes and requirements of the Act and which must be superseded and preempted pursuant to Section 504(g). Some Rhode Island laws may in an individual situation interfere with the achievement of the purposes and requirements of the Act and may be preempted and superseded with respect to the performance standards of §§ 939.815 through 939.828 as they affect a particular coal exploration or surface mining operation by publication of a notice to that effect in the

South Dakota Federal program.
(a) This part contains all rules that are applicable to surface coal mining operations in South Dakota which have been adopted under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977.
(b) The rules in this part cross-reference pertinent parts of the permanent program regulations in this chapter. The full text of a rule is in the permanent program rule cited under the relevant section of the South Dakota Federal program.
(c) The rules in this part apply to all surface coal mining operations in South Dakota conducted on non-Federal and non-Indian lands. The rules in Subchapter D of this chapter apply to operations on Federal lands in South Dakota.
(d) The recordkeeping and reporting requirements of this part are the same as those of the permanent program regulations which have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3507.
(e) The following provisions of South Dakota laws provide, where applicable, for more stringent environmental control and regulation of surface coal mining operations than do the provisions of the Act and the regulations in this chapter. Therefore, pursuant to section 505(b) of the Act, they shall not be construed to be inconsistent with the Act:
(1) South Dakota Compiled Laws Annotated (S. D. Comp. Laws Ann.) Chap. 45-6B, section 33(1)-(5) on lands unsuitable for mining.
(2) S. D. Comp. Laws Ann. Chap. 45-6C, sections 16, 19, 27, and 28.
(3) Weed Control, S. D. Comp. Laws Ann. Chap. 38-22.
(4) Protection of fishing waters, S. D. Comp. Laws Ann. Chap. 41-13.
(5) Remedies for protection of the environment, S. D. Comp. Laws Ann. Chap. 34A-10.
(6) Air pollution control, S. D. Comp. Laws Ann. Chap. 34A-1.

(8) Solid waste disposal, S. D. Comp. Laws Ann. Chap. 34A-6.
(9) Groundwater, S. D. Comp. Laws Ann. Chap. 46-6.
(f) The following are South Dakota laws that interfere with the achievement of the purposes and requirements of the Act and are, in accordance with section 504(g) of the Act, preempted and superseded with respect to surface coal mining, except to the extent that they regulate surface coal mining operations which affect two acres or less, or which otherwise are not regulated by the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act.
(1) S. D. Comp. Laws Ann. Chap. 45-6B, except with respect to the criteria for designating lands unsuitable for mining, section 33(1)-(5).
(2) S. D. Comp. Laws Ann. Chap. 45-6C, except with respect to the requirements to consult with the owner of surface lands to be explored and the right of the owner to establish reasonable restrictions on exploration travel (section 16), the requirement to post an exploration reclamation bond (section 19), the prohibition of explosives use in exploration within one-half mile of a flowing water well or a domestic water well without the owner's permission (section 27), and the requirement to cap, plug, and seal all exploration test holes (section 28).
(g) The Secretary may grant a limited variance from the performance standards of §§ 941.815 through 941.828 of this part if the applicant for coal exploration approval or a surface mining permit submitted pursuant to §§ 941.772 through 941.785 demonstrates in the application that:
(1) Such variance is necessary because of the unique nature of South Dakota's terrain, climate, biological, chemical, or other relevant physical conditions; and
(2) The proposed alternative will achieve equal or greater environmental protection than does the performance requirement from which the variance is requested.

§ 944.30
State-Federal Cooperative Agreement.
The Governor of the State of Utah (Governor) and the Secretary of the Department of the Interior (Secretary) enter into a Cooperative Agreement (Agreement) to read as follows:

# Article I: Introduction, Purposes and Responsible Agencies
A. Authority: This Agreement is authorized by section 523(c) of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act (SMCRA), 30 U.S.C. 1273(c), which allows a State with a permanent regulatory program approved by the Secretary of the Interior under 30 U.S.C. 1253, to elect to enter into an agreement for State regulation of surface coal mining and reclamation operations on Federal lands.
This Agreement provides for State regulation of coal exploration operations not subject to 43 CFR part 3480 through 3487, and surface coal mining and reclamation operations and activities in Utah on Federal lands (30 CFR Chapter VII Subchapter D), consistent with SMCRA and the Utah Code Annotated (State Act) governing such activities and the Utah State Program (Program).
B. Purposes: The purposes of this Agreement are to (a) foster Federal-State cooperation in the regulation of surface coal mining and reclamation operations and activities and coal exploration operations not subject to 43 CFR part 3480, Subparts 3480 through 3487; (b) minimize intergovernmental overlap and duplication; and (c) provide uniform and effective application of the Program on all lands in Utah in accordance with SMCRA, the Program, and this Agreement.
C. Responsible Administrative Agencies: The Utah Division of Oil, Gas, and Mining (DOGM) will be responsible for administering this Agreement on behalf of the Governor. The Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSMRE) will administer this Agreement on behalf of the Secretary.

# Article II: Effective Date
After being signed by the Secretary and the Governor, this Agreement will take effect 30 days after publication in the
Federal Register
as a final rule. This agreement will remain in effect until terminated as provided in Article XI.

# Article III: Definitions
The terms and phrases used in this Agreement which are defined in SMCRA 30 CFR parts 700, 701 and 740, the Program, including the State Act, and the rules and regulations promulgated pursuant to that Act, will be given the meanings set forth in said definitions.
Where there is a conflict between the above referenced State and Federal definitions, the definitions used in the Program will apply.

# Article IV: Applicability
In accordance with the Federal lands program, the laws, regulations, terms and conditions of the Program are applicable to Federal lands in Utah except as otherwise stated in this Agreement, SMCRA 30 CFR 740.4, 740.11(a) and 745.13, and other applicable Federal laws, Executive Orders, or regulations.

# Article V: General Requirements
The Governor and the Secretary affirm that they will comply with all the provisions of this Agreement.
A. Authority of State Agency: DOGM has and will continue to have the authority under State law to carry out this Agreement
B. Funds: 1. Upon application by DOGM and subject to appropriations, OSMRE will provide the State with the funds to defray the costs associated with carrying out its responsibilities under this Agreement as provided in section 705(c) of the Federal Act, the grant agreement, and 30 CFR 735.16. Such funds will cover the full cost incurred by DOGM in carrying out these responsibilities, provided that such cost does not exceed the estimated cost the Federal government would have expended on such responsibilities in the absence of this Agreement; and provided that such State-incurred cost per permitted acre of Federal lands does not exceed the per permitted area costs for similar administration and enforcement activities of the Program on non-Federal and non-Indian lands during the same time period.
2. The ratio or cost split of Federal to non-Federal dollars allocated under the cooperative agreement will be determined by OSMRE and DOGM based on the projected costs for regulation of mines within Federal lands, in consideration of the relative amounts of Federal and non-Federal land involved. The designation of mines, based on Federal and non-federal land, will be prepared by DOGM and submitted to OSMRE's Albuquerque Field Office. OSMRE's Albuquerque Field Office and OSMRE's Western Field Operations office will work with DOGM to estimate the amount the Federal government would have expended for regulation of Federal lands in Utah in the absence of this Agreement.
3. OSMRE and the State will discuss the OSMRE Federal lands cost estimate, the DOGM-prepared list of acres by mine, and the State's overall cost estimate. After resolution of any issues, DOGM will submit its grant application to OSMRE's Albuquerque Field Office. The Federal lands/non-Federal lands ratio will be applied to the final eligible total State expenditures to arrive at the total Federal reimbursement due the State. Assuming timely submission, this ratio or cost split will be agreed upon by July of the year preceding the applicable fiscal year in order to enable the State to budget funds for the Program.
The State may use the existing year's budget totals, adjusted for inflation and workload considerations in estimating the regulatory costs for the following grant year. OSMRE will notify DOGM as soon as possible if such projections are unrealistic.
4. If DOGM applies for a grant but sufficient funds have not been appropriated to OSMRE, OSMRE and DOGM will promptly meet to decide on appropriate measures that will insure that mining operations on Federal lands in Utah are regulated in accordance with the Program.
5. Funds provided to the DOGM under this Agreement will be adjusted in accordance
with Office of Management and Budget Circular A-102, Attachment E.
C. Reports and Records: DOGM will make annual reports to OSMRE containing information with respect to compliance with the terms of this Agreement pursuant to 30 CFR 745.12(d). DOGM and OSMRE will exchange, upon request, except where prohibited by Federal or State law, information developed under this Agreement.
OSMRE will provide DOGM with a copy of any final evaluation report prepared concerning State administration and enforcement of this Agreement. DOGM comments on the report will be appended before transmission to the Congress or other interested parties.
D. Personnel: DOGM will maintain the necessary personnel to fully implement this Agreement in accordance with the provisions of SMCRA the Federal lands program, and the Program.
E. Equipment and Laboratories: DOGM will assure itself access to equipment, laboratories, and facilities with which all inspections, investigations, studies, tests, and analyses can be performed which are necessary to carry out the requirements of the Agreement.
F. Permit Application Fees and Civil Penalties: The amount of the fee accompanying an application for a permit for operations on Federal lands in Utah will be determined in accordance with 40-10-6(5), Utah Code Annotated 1953 as amended and UMC/SMC 771.25 of the State regulations, and the applicable provisions of the Program and Federal law. All permit fees and civil penalty fines collected from operations on Federal lands will be retained by the State and will be deposited with the State Treasurer. Permit fees will be considered program income. Civil penalty fines will not be considered program income and will be deposited in an account for use in reclaiming abandoned mine sites. The financial status report submitted pursuant to 30 CFR 735.26 will include a report of the amount of fees collected during the State's prior fiscal year.

# Article VI: Review of Permit Application Package
A. Submission of Permit Application Package: DOGM and the Secretary require an applicant proposing to conduct surface coal mining and reclamation operations and activities on Federal lands to submit a permit application package (PAP) in an appropriate number of copies to DOGM. DOGM will furnish OSMRE and other Federal agencies with an appropriate number of copies of the PAP. The PAP will be in the form required by DOGM and will include any supplemental information required by OSMRE and the Federal land management agency. Where section 522(e)(3) of SMCRA applies, DOGM will work with the agency with jurisdiction over the publicly owned park, including units of the National Park System, or historic property included in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) to determine what supplemental information will be required.
At a minimum, the PAP will satisfy the requirements of 30 CFR part 740 and include the information necessary for DOGM to make a determination of compliance with the Program and for OSMRE and the appropriate Federal agencies to make determinations of compliance with applicable requirements of SMCRA, the Federal lands program, and other Federal laws, Executive Orders, and regulations for which they are responsible.
B. Review Procedures Where There is No Leased Federal Coal Involved: 1. DOGM will assume the responsibilities for review of permit applications where there is no leased Federal coal to the extent authorized in 30 CFR 740.4(c) (1), (2), (4), (6) and (7). In addition to consultation with the Federal land management agency pursuant to 30 CFR 740.4 (c)(2), DOGM will be responsible for obtaining, except for non-significant revisions or amendments, the comments and determinations of other Federal agencies with jurisdiction or responsibility over Federal lands affected by the operations proposed in the PAP. DOGM will request such Federal agencies to furnish their findings or any requests for additional information to DOGM within 45 calendar days of the date of receipt of the PAP. OSMRE will assist DOGM in obtaining this information, upon request.
Responsibilities and decisions which can be delegated to DOGM under other applicable Federal laws may be specified in working agreements between OSMRE and the State, with the concurrence of any Federal agency involved, and without amendment to this agreement.
2. DOGM will assume primary responsibility for the analysis, review and approval or disapproval of the permit application component of the PAP required by 30 CFR 740.13 for surface coal mining and reclamation operations and activities in Utah on Federal lands not requiring a mining plan pursuant to the Mineral Leasing Act (MLA). DOGM will review the PAP for compliance with the Program and State Act and regulations. DOGM will be the primary point of contact for applicants regarding decisions on the PAP and will be responsible for informing the applicant of determinations.
3. The Secretary will make his non-delegable determinations under SMCRA, some of which have been delegated to OSMRE.
4. OSMRE and DOGM will coordinate with each other during the review process as needed. OSMRE will provide technical assistance to DOGM when requested, if available resources allow. DOGM will keep OSMRE informed of findings made during the review process which bear on the responsibilities of
OSMRE or other Federal agencies. OSMRE may provide assistance to DOGM in resolving conflicts with Federal land management agencies. OSMRE will be responsible for ensuring that any information OSMRE receives from an applicant is promptly sent to DOGM. OSMRE will have access to DOGM files concerning operations on Federal lands. OSMRE will send to DOGM copies of all resulting correspondence between OSMRE and the applicant that may have a bearing on decisions regarding the PAP. The Secretary reserves the right to act independently of DOGM to carry out his responsibilities under laws other than SMCRA.
5. DOGM will make a decision on approval or disapproval of the permit on Federal lands.
(a) Any permit issued by DOGM will incorporate any terms or conditions imposed by the Federal land management agency, including conditions relating to post-mining land use, and will be conditioned on compliance with the requirements of the Federal land management agency. In the case that VER is determined to exist on Federal lands under section 522(e)(3) of SMCRA where the proposed operation will adversely affect a unit of the National Park System (NPS), DOGM will work with the NPS to develop mutually agreed upon terms and conditions for incorporation into the permit to mitigate environmental impact as set forth under Article X of this agreement.
(b) The permit will include terms and conditions required by other applicable Federal laws and regulations.
(c) After making its decision on the PAP, DOGM will send a notice to the applicant, OSMRE, the Federal land management agency, and any agency with jurisdiction over a publicly owned park or historic property included in the NRHP which would be affected by a design under section 522(e)(3) of SMCRA. A copy of the permit and written findings will be submitted to OSMRE if requested.
C. Review Procedures Where Leased Federal Coal is Involved: 1. DOGM will assume the responsibilities listed in 30 CFR 740.4(c) (1), (2), (3), (4), (6) and (7), to the extent authorized.
In accordance with 30 CFR 740.4(c)(1), DOGM will assume primary responsibility for the analysis, review and approval or disapproval of the permit application component of the PAP for surface coal mining and reclamation operations and activities in Utah where a mining plan is required. OSMRE will, at the request of the State, assist to the extent possible in this analysis and review.
The Secretary will concurrently carry out his responsibilities that cannot be delegated to DOGM under the Federal lands program, MLA, the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), this Agreement, and other applicable Federal laws. The Secretary will carry out these responsibilities in a timely manner and will avoid, to the extent possible, duplication of the responsibilities of the State as set forth in this Agreement and the Program. The Secretary will consider the information in the PAP and, where appropriate, make decisions required by SMCRA, MLA, NEPA, and other Federal laws.
Responsibilities and decisions which can be delegated to the State under other applicable Federal laws may be specified in working agreements between OSMRE, and DOGM, with concurrence of any Federal agency involved, and without amendment to this Agreement.
2. DOGM will be the primary point of contact for applicants regarding the review of the PAP for compliance with the Program and State law and regulations. On matters concerned exclusively with regulations under 43 CFR part 3480, Subparts 3480 through 3847, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) will be the primary contact with the applicant. DOGM will send to OSMRE copies of any correspondence with the applicant and any information received from the applicant regarding the PAP. OSMRE will send to DOGM copies of all OSMRE correspondence with the applicant which may have a bearing on the PAP. As a matter of practice, OSMRE will not independently initiate contacts with applicants regarding completeness or deficiencies of the PAP with respect to matters covered by the Program.
BLM will inform DOGM of its actions and provide DOGM with a copy of documentation on all decisions. DOGM will be responsible for informing the applicant of all joint State-Federal determinations. Where necessary to make the determination to recommend that the Secretary approve the mining plan, OSMRE will consult with and obtain the concurrences of the BLM, the Federal land management agency and other Federal agencies as required.
The Secretary reserves the right to act independently of DOGM to carry out his responsibilities under laws other than SMCRA or provisions of SMCRA not covered by the Program, and in instances of disagreement over SMCRA and the Federal lands program.
DOGM will to the extent authorized, consult with the Federal land management agency and BLM pursuant to 30 CFR 740.4(c) (2) and (3), respectively. DOGM will also be responsible for obtaining the comments and determinations of other Federal agencies with jurisdiction or responsibility over Federal lands affected by the operations proposed in the PAP. DOGM will request all Federal agencies to furnish their findings or any requests for additional information to DOGM within 45 days of the date of receipt
of the PAP. OSMRE will assist DOGM in obtaining this information, upon request of DOGM.
3. DOGM will be responsible for approval and release of performance bonds under 30 CFR 740.4(c)(4), and for review and approval of exploration operations not subject to 43 CFR part 3480, under 30 CFR 740.4(c)(6).
DOGM will prepare documentation to comply with the requirements of NEPA under 30 CFR 740.4(c)(7); however, OSMRE will retain the responsibility for the exceptions in 30 CFR 740.4(c)(7)(i)-(vii).
OSMRE will assist DOGM in carrying out DOGM's responsibilities by:
(a) Coordinating resolution of conflicts and difficulties between DOGM and other Federal agencies in a timely manner.
(b) Assisting in scheduling joint meetings, upon request, between State and Federal agencies.
(c) Where OSMRE is assisting DOGM in reviewing the PAP, furnishing to DOGM the work product within 50 calendar days of receipt of the State's request for such assistance, unless a different time is agreed upon by OSMRE and DOGM.
(d) Exercising its responsibilities in a timely manner, governed to the extent possible by the deadlines established in the Program.
(e) Assuming all responsibility for ensuring compliance with any Federal lessee protection board requirement.
4. Review of the PAP: (a) OSMRE and DOGM will coordinate with each other during the review process as needed. DOGM will keep OSMRE informed of findings made during the review process which bear on the responsibilities of OSMRE or other Federal agencies. OSMRE will ensure that any information OSMRE receives which has a bearing on decisions regarding the PAP is promptly sent to DOGM.
(b) DOGM will review the PAP for compliance with the Program and State law and regulations.
(c) OSMRE will review the operation and reclamation plan portion of the permit application, and any other appropriate portions of the PAP, for compliance with the non-delegable responsibilities of SMCRA and for compliance with the requirements of other Federal laws and regulations.
(d) OSMRE and DOGM will develop a work plan and schedule for PAP review and each will identify a person as the project leader. The project leaders will serve as the primary points of contact between OSMRE and DOGM throughout the review process. Not later than 50 days after receipt of the PAP, unless a different time is agreed upon, OSMRE will furnish DOGM with its review comments on the PAP and specify any requirements for additional data. To the extent practicable, DOGM will provide OSMRE all available information that may aid OSMRE in preparing any findings.
(e) DOGM will prepare a State decision package, including written findings and supporting documentation, indicating whether the PAP is in compliance with the Program. The review and finalization of the State decision package will be conducted in accordance with procedures for processing PAPs agreed upon by DOGM and OSMRE.
(f) DOGM may make a decision on approval or disapproval of the permit on Federal lands in accordance with the Program prior to the necessary Secretarial decision on the mining plan, provided that DOGM advises the operator in the permit that Secretarial approval of the mining plan must be obtained before the operator may conduct coal development or mining operations on the Federal lease. DOGM will reserve the right to amend or rescind any requirements of the permit to conform with any terms or conditions imposed by the Secretary in the approval of the mining plan.
(g) The permit will include, as applicable, terms and conditions required by the lease issued pursuant to the MLA and by any other applicable Federal laws and regulations, including conditions imposed by the Federal land management agency relating to post-mining land use, and those of other affected agencies, and will be conditioned on compliance with the requirements of the Federal land management agency with jurisdiction.
(h) In the case that VER is determined to exist on Federal lands under section 522(e)(3) of SMCRA where the proposed operation will adversely affect a unit of the NPS, DOGM will work with the NPS to develop mutually agreed upon terms and conditions for incorporation into the permit to mitigate environmental impacts as set forth under Article X of this agreement.
(i) After making its decision on the PAP, DOGM will send a notice to the applicant, OSMRE, the Federal land management agency, and any agency with jurisdiction over the publicly owned park or historic property included in the NRHP affected by a decision under section 522(e)(3) of SMCRA. A copy of the written findings and the permit will also be submitted to OSMRE.
5. OSMRE will provide technical assistance to DOGM when requested, if available resources allow. OSMRE will have access to DOGM files concerning operations on Federal lands.
D. Review Procedures for Permit Revisions, Amendments, or Renewals: 1. Any permit revision, amendment, or renewal for an operation on Federal lands will be reviewed and approved or disapproved by DOGM after consultation with OSMRE on whether such revision, amendment, or renewal constitutes a mining plan modification. OSMRE will inform DOGM within 30 days of receiving a
copy of a proposed revision, amendment, or renewal, whether the permit revision, amendment, or renewal constitutes a mining plan modification. Where approval of a mining plan modification is required, OSMRE and DOGM will follow the procedures outlined in paragraphs C.1. through C.5. of this Article.
2. OSMRE may establish criteria to determine which permit revisions, amendments, and renewals clearly do not constitute mining plan modifications.
3. Permit revisions, amendments, or renewals on Federal lands which are determined by OSMRE not to constitute mining plan modifications under paragraph D.1. of this Article or that meet the criteria for not being mining plan modifications as established under paragraph D.2. of this Article will be reviewed and approved following the procedures outlined in paragraphs B.1. through B.5. of this Article.

# Article VII: Inspections
A. DOGM will conduct inspections on Federal lands in accordance with 30 CFR 740.4(c)(5) and prepare and file inspection reports in accordance with the Program.
B. DOGM will, subsequent to conducting any inspection pursuant to 30 CFR 740.4(c)(5), and on a timely basis, file with OSMRE a legible copy of the completed State inspection report.
C. DOGM will be the point of contact and primary inspection authority in dealing with the operator concerning operations and compliance with the requirements covered by the Agreement, except as described hereinafter. Nothing in this Agreement will prevent inspections by authorized Federal or State agencies for purposes other than those covered by this Agreement. The Department may conduct any inspections necessary to comply with 30 CFR parts 842 and 843 and its obligations under laws other than SMCRA.
D. OSMRE will ordinarily give DOGM reasonable notice of its intent to conduct an inspection under 30 CFR 842.11 in order to provide State inspectors with an opportunity to join in the inspection. When OSMRE is responding to a citizen complaint of an imminent danger to the public health and safety, or of significant, imminent environmental harm to land, air or water resources, pursuant to 30 CFR 842.11(b)(1)(ii)(C), it will contact DOGM no less than 24 hours prior to the Federal inspection, if practicable, to facilitate a joint Federal/State inspection. All citizen complaints which do not involve an imminent danger of significant, imminent environmental harm will be referred to DOGM for action. The Secretary reserves the right to conduct inspections without prior notice to DOGM to carry out his responsibilities under SMCRA.

# Article VIII: Enforcement
A. DOGM will have primary enforcement authority under SMCRA concerning compliance with the requirements of this Agreement and the Program in accordance with 30 CFR 740.4(c)(5). Enforcement authority given to the Secretary under other Federal laws and Executive orders including, but not limited to, those listed in appendix A (attached) is reserved to the Secretary.
B. During any joint inspection by OSMRE and DOGM, DOGM will have primary responsibility for enforcement procedures, including issuance of orders of cessation, notices of violation, and assessment of penalties. DOGM will inform OSMRE prior to issuance of any decision to suspend or revoke a permit on Federal lands.
C. During any inspection made solely by OSMRE or any joint inspection where DOGM and OSMRE fail to agree regarding the propriety of any particular enforcement action, OSMRE may take any enforcement action necessary to comply with 30 CFR parts 843 and 845. Such enforcement action will be based on the standards in the Program, SMCRA, or both, and will be taken using the procedures and penalty system contained in 30 CFR parts 843 and 845.
D. DOGM and OSMRE will promptly notify each other of all violations of applicable laws, regulations, orders, or approved mining permits subject to this Agreement, and of all actions taken with respect to such violations.
E. Personnel of DOGM and OSMRE will be mutually available to serve as witness in enforcement actions taken by either party.
F. This Agreement does not affect or limit the Secretary's authority to enforce violations of Federal laws other than SMCRA.

# Article IX: Bonds
A. DOGM and the Secretary will require each operator who conducts operations on Federal lands to submit a single performance bond payable to Utah and the United States to cover the operator's responsibilities under SMCRA and the Program. Such performance bond will be conditioned upon compliance with all requirements of the SMCRA, the Program, State rules and regulations, and any other requirements imposed by the Department. Such bond will provide that if this Agreement is terminated, the portion of the bond covering the Federal lands will be payable only to the United States. DOGM will advise OSMRE or annual adjustments to the performance bond, pursuant to the Program.
B. Prior to releasing the operator from any obligation under such bond, DOGM will obtain the concurrence of OSMRE. OSMRE concurrence will include coordination with other Federal agencies having authority over the lands involved.
C. Performance bonds will be subject to forfeiture with the concurrence of OSMRE, in accordance with the procedures and requirements of the Program.
D. Submission of a performance bond does not satisfy the requirements for a Federal lease bond required by 43 CFR subpart3474 or lessee protection bond required in addition to a performance bond, in certain circumstances, by section 715 of SMCRA.

# Article X: Designating Land Areas Unsuitable for All or Certain Types of Surface Coal Mining and Reclamation Operations and Activities and Valid Existing Rights and Compatibility Determinations

# A. Unsuitability Petitions.
1. Authority to designate Federal lands as unsuitable for mining pursuant to a petition is reserved to the Secretary.
2. When either DOGM or OSMRE receives a petition that could impact adjacent Federal or non-Federal lands pursuant to section 522(c) of SMCRA, the agency receiving the petition will notify the other of receipt and the anticipated schedule for reaching a decision, and request and fully consider data, information and recommendations of the other. OSMRE will coordinate with the Federal land management agency with jurisdiction over the petition area, and will solicit comments from the agency.

# B. Valid Existing Rights and Compatibility Determinations
The following actions will be taken when requests for determinations of VER pursuant to section 522(e) of SMCRA, or for determinations of compatibility pursuant to section 522(e)(2) of SMCRA are received prior to or at the time of submission of a PAP that involves surface coal mining and reclamation operations and activities:
1. For Federal lands within the boundaries of any areas specified under section 522(e)(1) of SMCRA, OSMRE will determine whether VER exists for such areas.
For non-Federal lands within section 522(e)(1) areas DOGM, with the consultation and concurrence of OSMRE, will determine whether operations on such lands will or will not affect Federal lands. For such non-Federal lands affecting Federal lands, OSMRE will make the VER determination.
Under section 522(e)(1), for non-Federal lands within the boundaries of the National Park System, DOGM, with the consultation and concurrence of OSMRE, will determine whether operations on such lands will or will not affect the Federal interest. For such non-Federal lands within the boundaries of the National Park System which affect the Federal interest, OSMRE will make the VER determination.
2. For Federal lands within the boundaries of any national forest where proposed operations are prohibited or limited by section 522(e)(2) of SMCRA and 30 CFR 761.11(b), OSMRE will make the VER determination.
OSMRE will process requests for determinations of compatibility under section 522(e)(2) of SMCRA.
3. For Federal lands, DOGM, with the consultation and concurrence of OSMRE, will determine whether any proposed operation will adversely affect units of the National Park System with respect to the prohibitions or limitations of section 522(e)(3) of SMCRA. For such operations adversely affecting units of the National Park System, DOGM, with the consultation and concurrence of OSMRE, will make the VER determination.
For Federal lands, DOGM will determine whether any proposed operation will adversely affect all publicly owned parks other than those covered in the preceding paragraph and, in consultation with the State Historic Preservation Officer, places listed in the National Register of Historic Places, with respect to the prohibitions or limitations of section 522(e)(3) of SMCRA.
For Federal lands other than those on which the proposed operation will adversely affect units of the National Park System, DOGM will make the VER determination for operations which are prohibited or limited by section 522(e)(3) of SMCRA. In the case that VER is determined to exist on Federal lands under section 522(e)(3) of SMCRA where a proposed operation will adversely affect a unit of the NPS, DOGM will work with the NPS to develop mutually agreed upon terms and conditions for incorporation into the permit in order to mitigate environmental impacts.
In the case that VER is determined not to exist under section 522(e)(3) of SMCRA or 30 CFR 761.11(c), no surface coal mining operations and activities will be permitted unless jointly approved by DOGM and the Federal, State or local agency with jurisdiction over the publicly owned park or historic place.
4. DOGM will process determinations of VER on Federal lands for all areas limited or prohibited by section 522(e) (4) and (5) of SMCRA as unsuitable for mining. For operations on Federal lands, DOGM will coordinate with any affected agency or agency with jurisdiction over the proposed surface coal mining and reclamation operation.

§ 946.10
State regulatory program approval.
The Virginia regulatory program, as submitted on March 3, 1980, as amended and clarified on June 16, 1980, as resubmitted on August 13, 1981, and as clarified in a meeting with OSMRE on September 21 and 22, 1981, and in a letter to the director of the Office of Surface Mining on October 15, 1981, is conditionally approved, effective December 15, 1981. Effective January 1, 1985, the Department of Mines, Minerals and Energy replaces the Department of Conservation and Economic Development as the regulatory authority in Virginia for all surface coal mining and reclamation operations and all exploration operations on non-Federal and non-Indian lands. Copies of the approved program as amended are available for review at the following locations:
(a) Virginia Division of Mined Land Reclamation, P.O. Drawer 900, Big Stone Gap, Virginia 24219.
(b) Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement, Big Stone Gap Field Office, P.O. Drawer 1216, Powell Valley Square Shopping Center, room 220, Route 23, Big Stone Gap, Virginia 24219.

§ 946.12
State program provisions and amendments not approved.
(a) The following provisions are disapproved effective April 22, 1983: Paragraphs 3.01(a)(1), 3.01(a)(4) and 3.01 (a)(5) of the Virginia Coal Surface Mining and Reclamation Regulations for Operations Disturbing Two Surface Acres or Less.
(b) The following provisions of the coal surface mining reclamation regulations promulgated pursuant to Chapter 19, Title 45.1 of the Code of Virginia (1950), as submitted on November 8, 1985, as hereby disapproved:
(1) The definition of “affected area” in section 480-03-19.700.5 to the extent that it could be interpreted as excluding all public roads with more than incidental public use;
(2) Section 480-03-19.761.11(h), which prohibits mining on certain Federal lands, in its entirety; and
(c)(1) We are not approving the words, “or the UCP revision current at the time of issuance of the letter of credit,” in the definition of “Collateral bond,” paragraph (d), at 4 VAC 25-130-700.5; and
(2) We are not approving the words, “or revision current at the time of issuance of the letter of credit” at 4 VAC 25-130-800.21(c)(1).
(d) We are not approving the following portions of provisions of the proposed program amendment that Virginia submitted on June 12, 2015:
(1) We are deferring our decision on the removal of 4 VAC 25-130-801.13(d) of the self-bonding regulations until all previously approved self-bonds have either been lawfully released based on an accurate determination that the permittee has satisfactorily completed all reclamation obligations or replaced with an adequate substitute financial assurance under the approved Virginia regulatory program.
(2) We are deferring our decision on the provisions of 45.1-270.4.B and C of the Virginia Code that address reclamation tax revenue to the extent
that they impose a cap of $20 million. We are approving the continuing collection of the tax beyond $2 million but deferring our decision on the cessation of the tax collection when the Fund reaches $20 million until such time as Virginia either takes legislative action to remove the cap from this statute or demonstrates that $20 million is a sufficient amount of money to complete the reclamation, including water treatment, on any site covered by the Fund.

§ 946.30
State-Federal Cooperative Agreement.
This is a Cooperative Agreement (Agreement) between the Commonwealth of Virginia (State) acting by and through the Governor, and the United States Department of the Interior (Department), acting by and through the Secretary of the Interior (Secretary).

# Article I: Introduction, Purpose, and Responsible Administrative Agency
A.
Authority:
This Agreement is authorized by section 523(c) of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act (SMCRA or the Act), 30 U.S.C. 1273(c), which provides that any State with a permanent regulatory program approved under 30 U.S.C. 1253 may enter into an agreement with the Secretary to assume the responsibilities of regulating surface coal mining and reclamation operations on Federal lands within that State. This Agreement provides for such regulation within the Commonwealth of Virginia (State) consistent with SMCRA, the Virginia State Program, and the Federal Lands Program (30 CFR Chapter VII, Subchapter D).
B.
Purpose:
The purpose of this Agreement is to (1) foster State-Federal cooperation in the regulation of coal mining including coal exploration on Federal lands containing non-Federal coal; (2) minimize intergovernmental overlap and duplication; and (3) provide uniform and effective application of the Virginia State Program (State Program) on all Federal lands except those containing leased Federal coal. This agreement does not apply on Indian lands.
C.
Responsible Administrative Agencies:
The Division of Mined Land Reclamation (DMLR) of the Department of Mines, Minerals and Energy is responsible for administering the Agreement on behalf of the Governor. The Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSMRE) is responsible for administering this Agreement on behalf of the Secretary. The Federal lands in Virginia covered by this Agreement are predominantly administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, and include in part the Jefferson National Forest and the George Washington National Forest. It is understood by all parties that the Forest Service or the applicable Federal agency will continue to regulate mining operations on lands under its jurisdiction pursuant to the laws, regulations, agreements, and restrictions governing those lands. These requirements are in addition to the requirements discussed in this Agreement.

# Article II: Effective Date
The Agreement shall take effect May 7, 1987. This Agreement shall remain in effect until terminated as provided in Article XI.

# Article III: Definitions
The terms and phrases used in this Agreement which are defined in the Act, 30 CFR Chapter VII, and the approved State Program shall be given the meanings set forth in said definitions. Where there is a conflict among the above referenced State and Federal definitions, the definitions used in the approved State Program will apply unless prohibited by Federal law.
The term “Federal lands covered by the agreement” means all Federal lands in Virginia except those lands containing leased Federal coal or those consisting of Federal surface over unleased Federal coal.

# Article IV: Applicability
The laws, rules, terms, and conditions of the State Program are applicable to all Federal lands in Virginia. The State is authorized to conduct regulatory activities on all Federal lands with cooperative agreement.

# Article V: Requirements for Cooperative Agreement
The Governor and the Secretary affirm that they will comply with all of the provisions of this Agreement and will continue to meet all the conditions and requirements specified in the Agreement.
A.
Authority of State Agency:
DMLR has and shall continue to have authority under State law to carry out this Agreement.
B.
Funds:
Upon application by the DMLR and subject to the availability of appropriations, the Department shall provide the State with the funds to defray the costs associated with carrying out responsibilities under this Agreement as provided by section 705(c) of the SMORA and 30 CFR part 735. If sufficient funds have not been appropriated to OSMRE, OSMRE and DMLR shall meet promptly to decide on measures that will insure that mining operations are regulated in accordance with the State Program. If agreement cannot be reached, then either party may terminate the Agreement in accordance with Article XI.
Funds provided to the State shall be adjusted in accordance with the Office of Management and Budget Circular A-102, Attachment E.
C.
Reports and Records:
DMLR shall make annual reports to OSMRE pursuant to 30 CFR 745.12(d) on the results of the State's implementation and administration of this cooperative agreement. DMLR and OSMRE
shall exchange, upon request, information developed under this Agreement except where prohibited by Federal law. OSMRE shall provide DMLR with a copy of any final evaluation report concerning State administration and enforcement of this Agreement.
D.
Personnel:
DMLR shall provide the necessary personnel to fully implement this Agreement in accordance with the provisions of the Federal and State Acts and the State Program.
E.
Equipment and Laboratories:
DMLR shall have access to equipment, laboratories, and facilities necessary to carry out inspections, investigations, studies, tests, and analyses necessary to implement this Agreement.
F.
Permit Application Fees:
The amount of the fee accompanying an application for a permit shall be determined in accordance with the Virginia Coal Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1979 and 19 CV 45.1-235.(E). All permit fees, including fees for permits, permit revisions, renewals, transfers, sales or assignments, application fees, and civil penalties collected from operations on Federal lands covered by this agreement shall be retained by the State and deposited with the State Treasurer. The financial status report submitted pursuant to 30 CFR 735.26 shall include a report of the amount of the permit application and other fees collected and attributable to Federal lands during the prior Federal fiscal year. This amount shall be disposed of in accordance with Federal regulations and OMB Circular No. A-102 Attachment E.

# Article VI: Review of Permit Application Package(s)
A.
Permit Application Package:
DMLR shall require an operator proposing to conduct surface coal mining and reclamation operations on Federal lands covered by this Agreement to submit the appropriate permit application package (PAP) for a permit, permit revision, or permit renewal in an appropriate number of copies to DMLR. DMLR will furnish OSMRE a copy if OSMRE so requests. The permit application package shall be in the form required by DMLR and include any supplemental information required by the Federal land management agency. The PAP shall include the information required by, or necessary for, DMLR to make a determination of compliance with the State program and, under 30 CFR 740.4(c)(2), with any conditions or special requirements imposed by the Federal land management agency.
As requested, OSMRE will assist DMLR in identifying Federal agencies which may be affected by the proposed mining operation.
B.
Review Procedures:
1. DMLR shall assume primary responsibility for the analysis, review, and approval or disapproval of PAPs for a permit, permit revision, or permit renewal for operations on Federal lands covered by this agreement. DMLR shall also assume primary responsibility for the review and analysis of applications for transfer, assignment or sale of permit rights required by 30 CFR 740.13 for surface coal mining operations on Federal lands covered by this agreement. DMLR shall be the primary point of contact for operators regarding PAPs and applications for the transfer, sale, or assignment of permit rights and will be responsible for informing the applicant of all joint State-Federal or Federal determinations.
2. Upon receipt of PAP that involves surface coal mining and reclamation operations on lands covered by this Agreement, DMLR shall (a) transmit a copy of the complete PAP to the Federal land management agency with a request for review pursuant to 30 CFR 740.13(c)(4); (b) provide OSMRE with information necessary to allow OSMRE to determine whether or not a proposed surface coal mining and reclamation operation is prohibited or limited by the requirements of Section 522(e) of SMORA (30 U.S.C. 1272(e)) and 30 CFR part 761 and part 762; (c) determine whether leased Federal coal or Federal surface over unleased Federal coal is involved and immediately inform OSMRE in these situations; and (d) obtain, in a timely manner, the views and determinations of any other Federal agencies with jurisdiction or responsibility over Federal lands affected by a PAP in Virginia. These consultation comments shall be forwarded to OSMRE to be considered in any compatibility or valid existing rights determination;
3. OSMRE will provide technical assistance when requested, if available resources allow, and will process requests for determinations of compatibility and valid existing rights under 30 CFR part 761 and part 762. OSMRE will be responsible for ensuring that any information OSMRE receives from an applicant is promptly sent to DMLR. OSMRE shall have access to DMLR files concerning mines on Federal lands. The Secretary reserves the right to act independently of DMLR to carry out his responsibilities under laws other than SMORA. A copy of all correspondence with the applicant that may have a bearing on decisions regarding the PAP shall be sent to the State.
4. DMLR shall prepare the required technical analysis and written findings on the PAP. If requested by the Federal land management agency, a draft of these documents shall be sent to it for review and comment.
5. Any permit including permit revisions, renewals, transfers, sales, or assignments approved or issued by DMLR shall incorporate any terms or conditions imposed by OSMRE or the Federal land management agency, including conditions relating to post mining land use. After DMLR reaches a decision on a PAP, it shall send a notice to the applicant, the Federal land management agency, and OSMRE with a statement of all findings
and conclusions on which the decision is based.

# Article VII: Inspections
A.
DMLR Authority:
DMLR shall be the point of contact and primary inspection authority in dealing with the operator concerning operations on lands covered by this Agreement, except as described in this Agreement and the Secretary's regulations. DMLR must conduct inspections on Federal lands covered by this agreement and shall, within 30 days of conducting an inspection on Federal lands, prepare and file with OSMRE a legible copy of the State's completed inspection report. Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent inspections by authorized Federal or State agencies.
B.
DOI Authority:
The Secretary reserves the right to conduct inspections without prior notice of DMLR to carry out his responsibilities under SMORA. For the purposes of evaluating the manner in which this Agreement is being carried out and to insure that performance and reclamation standards are being met, OSMRE may periodically conduct inspections of surface coal mining and reclamation operations on Federal lands. OSMRE will attempt to give DMLR notice of its intent to conduct inspections and encourage joint inspections. However, pursuant to 30 CFR part 842 or 30 CFR part 877, OSMRE may conduct an inspection without the State when responding to information that there exists any condition, practice, or violation which creates an imminent danger to the health or safety of the public or is causing or could reasonably be expected to cause a significant, imminent environmental harm to land, air, or water resources. If an inspection is make without DMLR inspectors, OSMRE shall provide DMLR with a copy of the inspection report within 15 days after inspection.

# Article VIII: Enforcement
A.
DMLR Enforcement:
DMLR shall have primary enforcement authority on Federal lands covered by this Agreement in accordance with the State Program and this Agreement, and DMLR shall take appropriate enforcement action whenever necessary, including issuance of orders of cessation and notices of violation.
DMLR shall promptly notify the Federal land management agency of all violations of applicable laws, regulations, orders, and approved permits subject to this Agreement and of all actions taken with respect to such violations.
B.
Secretary's Authority:
(1) This Agreement does not affect or limit the Secretary's authority to enforce provisions of laws other than the SMORA. (2) During an inspection made solely by OSMRE or any joint inspection where DMLR and OSMRE fail to agree regarding the propriety of any particular enforcement action, OSMRE may take any enforcement action necessary to comply with 30 CFR parts 843 and 845 or with SMORA. Such enforcement action shall be based on the substantive standards included in the approved State Program and shall be taken using the procedures and penalty system contained in 30 CFR parts 843 and 845. (3) Nothing in this agreement shall preclude the Secretary from performing his responsibilities in

§ 947.700
Washington Federal program.
(a) This part contains all rules that are applicable to surface coal mining operations in Washington which have been adopted under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977.
(b) Most of the rules in this part cross-reference pertinent parts of the permanent program regulations in this chapter. The full text of a rule is in the permanent program rule cited under the relevant section of the Washington Federal program.
(c) The rules in this part apply to all surface coal mining operations in Washington conducted on non-Federal and non-Indian lands. The rules in Subchapter D of this chapter apply to operations on Federal lands in Washington.
(d) The information collection requirements contained in this part do not require approval by the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3507 because there are fewer than ten respondents annually.
(e) The following provisions of Washington laws generally provide for more stringent environmental control and regulation of some aspects of surface coal mining operations than do the provisions of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act and the regulations in this chapter. Therefore, pursuant to section 505(b) of the Act, they shall not generally be construed to be inconsistent with the Act, unless in a particular instance the rules in this Chapter are found by OSM to establish more stringent environmental controls:
(1) Washington Clean Air Act, RCW 70.94.
(2) Washington Food Fish and Shell Fish Laws pertaining to the Department of Fisheries on operation in streams, RCW 75.
(3) Washington Hydraulic Projects Approval Law, RCW 75.20.100.
(4) Washington Forest Practices Act, RCW 76.09.
(5) Washington Water Code, RCW 90.03.
(6) Washington Water Pollution Control Act, RCW 90.48.
(7) Washington Minimum Water Flows and Levels Act, RCW 90.22.
(8) Washington Shoreline Management Act, RCW 90.58.
(9) Washington Pesticide Control Act, RCW 15.58.
(f) The following are the Washington law and regulations that generally interfere with the achievement of the purposes and requirements of the Act and are, in accordance with section 504(g) of the Act, preempted and superseded. Other Washington laws may in an individual situation interfere with the purposes and achievements of the Act and may be preempted and superseded with respect to the performance standards of §§ 947.815 through 947.828 as they affect a particular coal exploration or surface mining operation by publication of a notice to that effect in the
Federal Register.
(1) The Washington Surface Mining Act of 1971, Revised Code of Washington (RCW) 78.44, as related to surface coal mining, except to the extent that it regulates surface coal mining operations which affect two acres or less or which otherwise are not regulated by the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act.
(2) Surface Mined Land Reclamation regulations, Washington Administrative Code (WAC) 332-18, as they apply to surface coal mining, except to the extent that such regulations apply to surface coal mining operations which affect two acres or less or which otherwise are not regulated by the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act.
(g) The Secretary may grant a limited variance from the performance standards of §§ 947.815 through 947.828 of this part if the applicant for coal exploration approval or a surface coal mining reclamation permit submitted pursuant to §§ 947.772 through 947.785 of this part demonstrates in the application:
(1) That such a variance is necessary because of the nature of the terrain, climate, biological, chemical, or other relevant physical conditions in the area of the mine; and
(2) If applicable, that the proposed variance is no less effective than the environmental protection requirements of the regulations in this program and is consistent with the Act.

(b) The following modified definitions shall be applicable under § 701.5 of this chapter:
(1)
Arid and semiarid area
means, in the context of alluvial valley floors, an area of the interior western United States, west of the 100th meridian west longitude, experiencing water deficits, where water use by native vegetation equals or exceeds that supplied by precipitation. All coalfields located in North Dakota west of the 100th meridian west longitude, all coalfields in Montana, Wyoming, Utah, Colorado, New Mexico, Idaho, Nevada, and Arizona, the Eagle Pass field in Texas, and the Stone Canyon and the Ione fields in California are in arid and semiarid areas, except that all coalfields located in the State of Washington west of the crest of the Cascade Mountain Range are not in arid or semiarid areas.
(2)
Forestry (Forest Land).
Includes land used or managed for the long-term production of wood, wood fiber, or wood derived products. All land which is capable of supporting a merchantable stand of timber and is not being actively used in a manner or for a use which is incompatible with timber growing is also included. Land used for facilities in support of forest harvest and management operations which is adjacent to or an integral part of these operations is also included.
(c) Records required by § 701.14 of this chapter to be made available locally to the public shall be retained at the county recorder's office of the county
in which an operation is located, and at the nearest OSM Field Office.

This part contains all rules applicable only within West Virginia that have been adopted under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977.
[46 FR 5954, Jan. 21, 1981]
§ 948.10
State regulatory program approval.
The West Virginia program, as submitted on March 3, 1980, as clarified on July 16, 1980, and as resubmitted on December 19, 1980, is conditionally approved, effective January 21, 1981. Beginning on that date and continuing until July 11, 1985, the Department of Natural Resources was deemed the regulatory authority in West Virginia for all surface coal mining and reclamation operations and all exploration operations on non-Federal and non-Indian lands. Beginning on July 11, 1985, the Department of Energy was deemed the regulatory authority pursuant to the program transfer provisions of Enrolled Committee Substitute for House Bill 1850, as signed by the Governor of West Virginia on May 3, 1985. Beginning on October 16, 1991, the Division of Environmental Protection was deemed the regulatory authority pursuant to Enrolled Committee Substitute for House Bill 217 that was signed by the Governor on October 25, 1991. On December 3, 1991, OSM found that it was not necessary to amend the State program to effect the redesignation of the regulatory authority from the Division of Energy to the Division of Environmental Protection (58 FR 42904, August 12, 1993). Beginning on April 14, 2001, the Department of Environmental Protection was deemed the regulatory authority pursuant to Enrolled Committee Substitute for House Bill 2218.
The bill, which was signed by the Governor on April 30, 2001, transferred programs and redesignated the Division of Environmental Protection as the Department of Environmental Protection within the executive branch. Copies of the conditionally approved program, as amended, are available at:
(a) Office of Surface Mining, Charleston Field Office, 1027 Virginia Street East, Charleston, West Virginia 25301-2816. Telephone: (304) 347-7158.
(b) West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection, Division of Mining and Reclamation, 10 McJunkin Road, Nitro, West Virginia 25143-2506. Telephone: (304) 759-0510.

§ 948.12
State statutory, regulatory, and proposed program amendment provisions not approved.
(a) We are not approving the following provisions of the proposed program amendment that West Virginia submitted on May 11, 1998:
(1) CSR 38-2-3.14, to the extent that it could be interpreted as applying to the on-site reprocessing of abandoned coal mine waste piles or to the extent that it would apply to the removal of abandoned coal refuse piles where, on average, the material to be removed meets the definition of coal in 30 CFR 700.5.

(e) Section 22A-3-23(c)(3) of the Code of West Virginia is found inconsistent with Section 519(c)(3) of SMCRA to the extent that it states:
“Provided, however,
That such a release may be made where the quality of the untreated postmining water discharged is better
than or equal to the premining water quality discharged from the mining site.”
(f) Section 22A-3-12(e) of the Code of West Virginia is found inconsistent with Section 515(e) of SMCRA.

(3) At CSR 38-2-2.119 regarding structure, the last sentence which provides that, “The term does not include structures built and/or utilized for the purpose of carrying out the surface mining operation.”
(4) At CSR 38-2-6.5.h, we are not approving its deletion because the deletion of CSR 38-2-6.5.h would make CSR 199-1-3.6.g and 3.11 less effective than the Federal blasting requirements.
(k) We are not approving the following portions of provisions of the proposed program amendment that West Virginia submitted on May 15, 2017:
(1) We are deferring our decision on the deletion of provisions from W.Va. Code 22-3-11(g)(2) regarding the development of a long-range planning process for the selection and prioritization of sites to be reclaimed.

State-Federal Cooperative Agreement.

# Cooperative Agreement
This is a Cooperative Agreement (Agreement) between the State of West Virginia (State) acting by and through the Governor, and the United States Department of the Interior (Department), acting by and through the Secretary of the Interior (Secretary).

# Article I: Introduction, Purpose and Responsible Administrative Agency
A.
Authority:
This Agreement is authorized by section 523(c) of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act (the Federal Act), 30 U.S.C. 1273(c), which allows a State with a permanent regulatory program approved under 30 U.S.C. 1253 to elect to enter into an Agreement for the regulation and control of surface coal mining and reclamation operations on Federal lands within that State. This Agreement provides for such regulation within West Virginia except on lands containing leased Federal coal consistent with the State and Federal Acts, the West Virginia State Program (State program), and the Federal Lands Program (section 523(a) of the Federal Act and 30 CFR parts 740-745).
B.
Purpose:
The purpose of the Agreement is to: (1) Foster State-Federal cooperation in the regulation of surface coal mining and reclamation operations on Federal lands; (2) eliminate unnecessary intergovernmental overlap and duplication; and (3) provide uniform and effective application of the State program on all lands except those containing leased Federal coal in West Virginia.
C.
Responsible Administrative Agencies:
The Department of Natural Resources, Reclamation Division (DNR) is responsible for administering this Agreement on behalf of the Governor on Federal lands throughout the State. The Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSM) is responsible for administering this Agreement on behalf of the Secretary, in accordance with the regulations in 30 CFR Chapter VII. The Federal lands in West Virginia covered by this Agreement are predominantly those under the jurisdiction of the United States Department of Agriculture, Forest Service. It is understood by all parties that the Forest Service or the Federal land management agency, if other than the Forest Service, will continue to govern mining operations on Federal lands covered by this agreement pursuant to laws, regulations, agreements, and restrictions for which the respective agency is responsible. These requirements are in addition to the requirements discussed in this Agreement.

# Article II: Effective Date
After it has been signed by the Governor and the Secretary, the Agreement shall take effect upon publication in the
Federal Register
as a final rule. This Agreement shall remain in effect until terminated as provided in Article X.

# Article III: Definitions
Terms and phrases used in this Agreement which are defined in 30 CFR parts 700, 701 and 740, and the State program shall be given the meanings set forth in said definitions.

# Article IV: Applicability
A.
Applicability to Federal Lands:
In accordance with the Federal Lands Program in 30 CFR part 740, the laws, rules, terms, and conditions of the State program (as conditionally approved effective January 21, 1981, 30 CFR part 948, or as hereinafter amended in accordance with 30 CFR 732.17) are applicable to Federal lands within West Virginia. This Agreement does not apply to operations on Federal lands containing leased Federal coal.
B.
Filing of Appeals:
Orders and decisions issued by DNR in accordance with the State program that are appealable shall be appealed to the State of West Virginia's Reclamation Board of Review. Orders and decisions issued by the Department that are appealable shall be appealed to the Department of the Interior's Office of Hearings and Appeals.

# Article V: Requirements for Cooperative Agreement
The Governor and the Secretary affirm that they will comply with all of the provisions of this Agreement and will continue to meet all the conditions and requirements specified in this Article.

# Article VI: Review of a Permit Application Package
A.
Contents of Permit Application Package:
DNR and the Secretary shall require an operator proposing to conduct surface coal mining and reclamation operations on Federal lands covered by this Agreement to submit a permit application package in an appropriate number of copies to DNR. DNR will furnish OSM a copy if OSM so requests. The permit application package shall be in the form required by DNR and include any supplemental information required by OSM or the Federal land management agency. The permit application package shall include the information required by, or necessary for, DNR to make a determination of compliance under 30 CFR 740.4(c)(2) with any conditions or special requirements imposed by the Federal land management agency and with the requirements of the State program, including:
1.
W. Va. Code,
Section 20-6-1
et seq.
, as amended;
2. Applicable regulations of the West Virginia Surface Mining Reclamation Regulations, 20-6-Series VIII (1981);
3. Requirements of the West Virginia DNR Reclamation Division “Technical Handbook of Standards and Specifications for Mining Operations (1981).”
B.
Review Procedures:
1. DNR shall assume primary responsibility for the analysis, review, and approval or disapproval of permit application packages required by 30 CFR 740.13 for surface coal mining and reclamation operations on Federal lands in West Virginia except those containing leased Federal coal. DNR shall be the primary point of contact for operators regarding decisions on the permit application package and will be responsible for informing the applicant of all joint State-Federal or Federal determinations.
2. Upon receipt of a permit application package that involves surface coal mining and reclamation operations on Federal lands covered by this agreement, DNR shall (1) transmit a copy of the complete permit application package to the Federal land management agency with a request for review pursuant to 30 CFR 740.13(b)(4), and (2) provide OSM with relevant information to allow OSM to determine whether or not the proposed surface coal mining and reclamation operation is prohibited or limited by the requirements of section 522(e) of the Federal Act (30 U.S.C. 1272(e)) and 30 CFR parts 760-762 with respect to Federal areas designated by Congress as unsuitable for mining. DNR shall be responsible for obtaining, in a timely manner, the views and determinations of any other Federal agencies with jurisdiction or responsibility over Federal lands affected by a permit application package in West Virginia.
3. OSM will provide technical assistance to DNR when requested if available resources allow and will process requests for determinations of compatibility and valid existing rights under 30 CFR part 761 relating to Federal areas designated by Congress as unsuitable for mining. OSM will be responsible for ensuring that any information OSM receives from an applicant is promptly sent to DNR. OSM shall have access to DNR files concerning mines on Federal lands. The Secretary reserves the right to act independently of DNR to carry out his responsibilities under laws other than the Federal Act. A copy of all resulting correspondence with the applicant that may have a bearing on decisions regarding the permit application package shall be sent to the State.
4. DNR shall prepare the required technical analysis and written findings on the permit application package. If requested by the Federal land management agency, a draft of these documents shall be sent to it for review and comment.
5. The permit issued by DNR shall incorporate any terms or conditions imposed by the Federal land management agency, including conditions relating to post-mining land use, and shall condition the initiation of surface coal mining operations on compliance with the requirements of the Federal land management agency. After DNR issues the decision on the permit application package, it shall send a notice to the applicant, the Federal land management agency, and OSM with a statement of findings and conclusions in support of the action.

# Article VII: Inspections
DNR shall conduct inspections on Federal lands covered by this agreement and prepare and file inspection reports in accordance with the approved Program
A.
Inspection Reports:
DNR shall, within 15 days of conducting any inspection on Federal lands, file with OSM an inspection report describing (1) the general conditions of the lands under the permit; (2) whether the operator is complying with applicable performance and reclamation requirements; and (3) the manner in which specific operations are being conducted.
B.
DNR Authority:
DNR shall be the point of contact and primary inspection authority in dealing with the operator concerning operations and compliance with the requirements covered by this Agreement, except as described in this Agreement and the Secretary's regulations. Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent inspections by authorized Federal or State agencies for purposes other than those covered by this Agreement.
C.
OSM Authority:
OSM may conduct inspections of surface coal mining and reclamation operations on Federal lands for the purpose of evaluating the manner in which this Agreement is being carried out and to insure that performance and reclamation standards are being met. In order to facilitate a joint Federal-State inspection, OSM will ordinarily give DNR notice of its intent to conduct an inspection. When OSM is responding to a citizen complaint of an imminent danger to the health or safety of the public or a significant, imminent environmental harm pursuant to 30 CFR 842.11(b)(1)(i), it will contact DNR if circumstances and time allow, prior to the Federal inspection. OSM may conduct any inspections necessary to comply with 30 CFR part 842. If an inspection is made without DNR inspectors, OSM shall provide DNR with a copy of the inspection report within 15 days after inspection. The Secretary reserves the right to conduct inspections without prior notice to DNR to carry out his responsibilities under the Act.
D.
Witness Availability:
Personnel of the State and of the Department of the Interior shall be mutually available to serve as witnesses in enforcement actions taken by either party.

# Article VIII: Enforcement
A.
DNR Enforcement:
DNR shall have primary enforcement authority on Federal lands covered by this agreement in accordance with the State program and this Agreement. During any joint inspection by OSM and DNR, DNR shall take appropriate enforcement action, including issuance of orders of cessation and notices of violation.
B.
Notification:
DNR shall promptly notify the Federal land management agency of all violations of applicable laws, regulations, orders, and approved permits subject to this Agreement and of all actions taken with respect to such violations.
C.
Secretary's Authority:
(1) This Agreement does not affect or limit the Secretary's authority to enforce provisions of laws other than the Act. (2) During an inspection made solely by OSM or any joint inspection where DNR and OSM fail to agree regarding the propriety of any particular enforcement action, OSM may take any enforcement action necessary to comply with 30 CFR parts 843 and 845. Such enforcement action shall be based on the Act or the substantive requirements of the State program and shall be taken using the procedures and penalty system contained in 30 CFR parts 843 and 845.

# Article V: Policies and Procedures: Permit Application Package Review
6. The State and OSMRE agree and hereby require that an applicant proposing to conduct surface coal mining operations on lands subject to the Federal lands program shall submit a permit application package (PAP) in an appropriate number of copies to the State and OSMRE. If any material is submitted to the State by an applicant for the sole purpose of complying with the 3-year requirement of section 7(c) of the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920, 30 U.S.C. 181
et seq.,
the State will forward such material through OSMRE to the Bureau of Land Management (BLM). If the material is submitted as part of the PAP, a copy of the entire package will be sent through OSMRE to BLM. The PAP shall be in the form required by the State, and shall include any supplemental information required by OSMRE. The PAP shall include the information required by, or necessary for, the State and the Secretary to make a determination of compliance with:
(a) W.S. 35-11-406(a) and (b) (1980);
(b) Chapter II, Land Quality Division Rules and Regulations, Department of Environmental Quality, or other chapters where these may supersede Chapter II;
(c) Applicable terms and conditions of the Federal coal lease; and
(d) Applicable requirements of the Program, and other Federal laws and regulations, including, but not limited to those listed in Appendix A.
7. a.
State Responsibility.
The State shall assume primary responsibility for the analysis, review, and approval or disapproval of the permit application component of the PAP for surface coal mining and reclamation operations on lands subject to the Federal lands program.
b.
OSMRE Responsibility.
(1) OSMRE will, at the request of the State, assist the State in its analysis and review of the PAP. (2) The Department shall concurrently carry out its responsibilities which cannot be delegated to the State under the Act, the Mineral Leasing Act (MLA), as amended, the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), and other applicable Federal laws (including but not limited to these in Appendix A). The Department shall carry out those responsibilities in accordance with the Federal lands program and this Agreement in a timely manner so as to eliminate, to the maximum extent possible, duplication of the responsibilities of the State set forth in this Agreement and the Program. The Secretary will consider the information in the PAP and, where appropriate, make decisions required by the Act, MLA, NEPA, and other Federal laws.
c.
Responsibility for Handling Other Federal Laws.
The State must consider the comments of Federal agencies in the context of permit issuance and will document these comments in the record of permit decisions. Permits issued by the State shall include, to the extent allowed by Wyoming law, terms and conditions required by the lease issued pursuant to the Mineral Leasing Act and by other applicable Federal laws and regulations in accordance with 30 CFR 740.13(c)(1). When Federal agencies recommend permit conditions and these conditions are not adopted, the State will provide OSMRE with documentation as to why they were not incorporated as permit conditions.
Upon notification from the State that certain permit conditions are not incorporated, OSMRE will determine whether such conditions are necessary and may be attached to other Federal authorizations. If not other Federal authorizations are required, then OSMRE may issue a supplemental SMCRA permit attaching only those conditions which are necessary to assure compliance with other Federal laws. The State shall not be required to enforce the conditions of the Federal permit.
d.
Working Agreements.
Responsibilities and decisions which can and cannot be delegated to the State under the Act and other applicable Federal laws may be specified in working agreements between OSMRE and the State with the concurrence of any Federal agency involved, and without amendment to this Agreement.
8. The State will be the primary point of contact for applicants regarding the review of the PAP, except on matters concerned exclusively with the regulations in 43 CFR parts 3480-3487 administered by the BLM and on matters unrelated to the review of the PAP. The State will be responsible for informing the applicant of any joint State-Federal determinations. The State shall send to OSMRE copies of any correspondence with the applicant and any information received from the applicant which may have a bearing on decisions regarding the PAP. OSMRE would not independently initiate contacts with applicants regarding completeness or deficiencies of the PAP with respect to matters covered by the Program; however, the Department reserves the right to act independently of the State to carry out its responsibilities under laws other than the Act or provisions of the Act not covered by the Program, and in instances of disagreement over the Act and the Federal lands program. OSMRE shall send to the State copies of all independent correspondence with the applicant which may have a bearing on decisions regarding the PAP.
9. The State shall assume the responsibilities listed in 30 CFR 740.4(c)(1), (4), (5), (6), and (7). OSMRE will retain the responsibilities listed in 30 CFR 740.4(c)(2), (3) and the exceptions in 30 CFR 740.4(c)(7)(i)-(vii). In addition to the procedures outlined in paragraphs 9, 10, and 11, OSMRE shall assist the State in carrying out its responsibilities by:
(a) Distributing copies of the PAP to, and coordinating the review of the PAP among all Federal agencies which have responsibilities relating to decisions on the package. This shall be done in a manner which ensures timely identification, communication and resolution of issues relating to those Federal agencies' statutory requirements. OSMRE shall request that such other Federal agencies furnish their findings or any requests for additional data to OSMRE within 45 calendar days of the date OSMRE transmits to them a copy of the PAP.
(b) Providing the State with the analyses and conclusions of other Federal agencies regarding those portions of the PAP which affect their statutory responsibilities.
(c) Resolving conflicts and difficulties between or among other Federal agencies in a timely manner.
(d) Assisting in scheduling joint meetings as necessary between State and Federal agencies.
(e) Where OSMRE is assisting the State in reviewing the permit application, furnishing the State with the work product within 45 calendar days of receipt of the State's request for such assistance, or earlier if mutually agreed upon by OSMRE and the State.
(f) Exercising its responsibilities in a timely manner as set forth in a mutually agreed upon schedule, governed to the extent possible by the deadlines established in the Program.
(g) Assuming all responsibility for ensuring compliance with any Federal lessee protection bond requirement.
10. This paragraph describes the procedures that OSMRE and the State will follow in the review of a PAP for surface coal mining and reclamation operations where a mining plan is required under the Mineral Leasing Act:
(a) OSMRE and the State shall coordinate with each other during the review process as needed. The State shall keep OSMRE informed of findings made during the review process which bear on the responsibilities of OSMRE and other Federal agencies. OSMRE shall ensure that any information OSMRE receives which has a bearing on decisions regarding the PAP is promptly sent to the State.
(b) The State shall review the PAP for compliance with the Program and State laws and regulations.
(c) OSMRE shall review the appropriate portions of the PAP for compliance with the non-delegable responsibilities of the Act and the requirements of other Federal laws and regulations consistent with paragraphs 7 and 8 of this Agreement.
(d) OSMRE and the State shall develop a work plan and schedule for PAP review and each shall identify a person as project leader. The State and OSMRE project leaders shall serve as the primary point of contact between OSMRE and the State throughout the review process. Not later than 50 days after receipt, OSMRE shall furnish the State with its preliminary findings and specify any requirements for additional data. OSMRE shall advise the State on the need for it to perform any work as part of the preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement as soon as possible in the review process.
(e) The State shall prepare a State decision package on the PAP. To the fullest extent allowed by the State and Federal law and regulations, the State and OSMRE will cooperate so that duplication will be eliminated in conducting the technical analyses and meeting NEPA requirements for the proposed mining operation. Copies of the draft State decision package shall be sent to OSMRE for review and comment. OSMRE shall evaluate the package and inform the State within 30 days, whenever possible, of any changes that should be made. The State shall consider these comments and send a final State decision package to OSMRE for action in a timely manner consistent with the Federal lands program. OSMRE shall have 30 days after receipt to request any changes to the State's final decision package.
(f) The State may proceed to issue the permit in accordance with the Program prior to the necessary Secretarial approval, provided that the State advises the permittee in the permit of the necessity for Secretarial approval of a mining plan prior to beginning operations to mine Federal coal. The State shall reserve the right to amend or rescind any requirements of the approved permit to conform with any terms or conditions imposed by the Secretary in his approval of the mining plan.
11. This paragraph describes the procedures that the State and OSMRE will follow in processing a PAP for surface coal mining and reclamation operations which does not require Secretarial approval of a mining plan under the Mineral Leasing Act:
(a) Upon receipt of a PAP for such operations, OSMRE shall consult with and obtain the determinations or conditions of any other Federal agencies with jurisdiction or responsibility over Federal lands affected by the operations proposed in the PAP. To the extent possible, these determinations and conditions and any determinations required by OSMRE pursuant to section 522 of the Act, shall be forwarded to the State within the time frame allowed by State law for processing permit applications.
(b) The State shall review the PAP for compliance with the Program and State laws and regulations.
(c) The State may proceed to issue the permit.
(d) After issuing the permit, the State shall send OSMRE and the Federal land management agency a copy of the signed permit form and State decision package.
12. The following procedures will be used in processing permit revisions or renewals:
(a) Any permit revision or renewal for operations on lands subject to the Federal lands program shall be reviewed and approved or disapproved by the State after consultation with OSMRE on whether the revision or renewal constitutes a mining plan modification under 30 CFR 746.18. OSMRE shall inform the State within 30 days of receiving a copy of a proposed revision or renewal, whether it constitutes a mining plan modification. Where approval of a mining plan modification is required, OSMRE and the State will follow the procedures outlined in paragraph 10 of this Article.
(b) Permit revisions or renewals for operations not constituting a mining plan modification and not meeting the criteria that may be established under (c) of this paragraph shall be reviewed and approved or disapproved following the procedures outlined in paragraph 11 of this Article.
(c) OSMRE may establish criteria to determine which types of permit revisions and renewals do not constitute mining plan modifications and will not affect the non-delegable responsibilities of OSMRE and other Federal agencies. Revisions or renewals meeting such criteria may be approved by the State prior to informing OSMRE of the approval and submission of copies of the revision or renewal to OSMRE.

# Article VI: Inspections
13. The State shall conduct inspections on lands subject to the Federal lands program and prepare and file inspection reports in accordance with the Program.
14. The State shall, subsequent to conducting any inspection, and on a timely basis, file with the Secretary an inspection report adequately describing (1) the general conditions of the lands under the permit and license; (2) the manner in which the operations are being conducted; and (3) whether the operator is complying with applicable performance and reclamation requirements.
15. The State will be the point of contact and the inspection authority in dealing with the operator concerning operations and compliance with the requirements covered by this Agreement, except as described hereinafter. Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent inspections by authorized Federal or State agencies for purposes other than those covered by this Agreement. The Department may conduct any inspections necessary to comply with 30 CFR part 842 and 30 CFR 843.12(a)(2) and its obligations under laws other than the Act.
16. OSMRE shall give the State reasonable notice of its intent to conduct an inspection in order to provide State inspectors with an opportunity to join in the inspection. When the Department is responding to a citizen complaint of an imminent environmental danger or a threat to human health pursuant to 30 CFR part 842.11(b)(1)(ii)(C), it will contact the State no less than 24 hours if practicable, prior to the Federal inspection to facilitate a joint Federal/State inspection. The Secretary reserves the right to conduct inspections without prior notice to the State as necessary to carry out his responsibilities under the Act.
17. Personnel of the State and representatives of the Department shall be mutually available to serve as witnesses in enforcement actions taken by either party.

# Article VII: Enforcement
18. The State shall have primary enforcement authority under the Act concerning compliance with the requirements of this Agreement and the Program.
19. During any joint inspection by the Department and the State, the State shall have primary responsibility for enforcement procedures, including issuance of orders of cessation, notices of violation, and assessment of penalties. The Department and the State shall consult prior to issuance of any decision to suspend or revoke a permit.
20. During any inspection made solely by the Department or any joint inspection where the State and the Department fail to agree regarding the propriety of any particular enforcement action, the Department may take any enforcement action necessary to comply with 30 CFR parts 843 and 845. Such enforcement action shall be based on the standards in the Program, the Act, the permit, or all three, and shall be taken using the procedures and penalty system contained in 30 CFR parts 843 and 845.
21. The State and the Department shall promptly notify each other of all violations of applicable laws, regulations, orders, or approved mining plans and permits subject to this Agreement, and of all actions taken with respect to such violations.
22. This Agreement does not affect or limit the Secretary's authority to enforce violations of Federal laws other than the Act.

# Article VIII: Bonds
23. The State and the Secretary shall require each operator on lands subject to the Federal lands program to submit a single performance bond payable to both the United States and the State of Wyoming that is sufficient to cover the operator's responsibilities under the Act and the program. Such performance bond shall be conditioned upon compliance with requirements of the Program, the Act and the permit. Such bond shall provide that if this Agreement is terminated, the bond shall be payable only to the United States to the extent that lands covered by the Federal lands program are involved.
24. Prior to releasing the operator from any obligation under a bond required by the Program on lands subject to the Federal lands program, the State shall obtain the concurrence of the Department. Departmental concurrence shall be based on field measurements, observations, and coordination with other Federal agencies having authority over the affected lands. The State shall also advise the Department annually of adjustments to the bond pursuant to the Program.
25. Performance bonds shall be subject to forfeiture, with the concurrence of the Department, in accordance with the procedures and requirements of the Program.

§ 1202.51
Scope and definitions.
(a) This subpart is applicable to Federal and Indian (Tribal and allotted) oil and gas leases (except leases on the Osage Indian Reservation, Osage County, Oklahoma) and OCS sulfur leases.
(b) The definitions in § 1206.20 of this chapter are applicable to subparts B, C, D, and J of this part.
[53 FR 1217, Jan. 15, 1988, as amended at 64 FR 43513, Aug. 10, 1999; 81 FR 43369, July 1, 2016; 82 FR 36953, Aug. 7, 2017; 85 FR 62019, Oct. 1, 2020]
§ 1202.52
Royalties.
(a) Royalties on oil, gas, and OCS sulfur shall be at the royalty rate specified in the lease, unless the Secretary, pursuant to the provisions of the applicable mineral leasing laws, reduces, or in the case of OCS leases, reduces or eliminates, the royalty rate or net profit share set forth in the lease.
(b) For purposes of this subpart, the use of the term
royalty(ies)
includes the term
net profit share(s).
§ 1202.53
Minimum royalty.
For leases that provide for minimum royalty payments, the lessee shall pay the minimum royalty as specified in the lease.

# Subpart C—Federal and Indian Oil
§ 1202.100
Royalty on oil.
(a) Royalties due on oil production from leases subject to the requirements of this part, including condensate separated from gas without processing, shall be at the royalty rate established by the terms of the lease. Royalty shall be paid in value unless the Office of Natural Resources Revenue (ONRR) requires payment in-kind. When paid in value, the royalty due shall be the value, for royalty purposes, determined pursuant to part 1206 of this title multiplied by the royalty rate in the lease.
(b)(1) All oil (except oil unavoidably lost or used on, or for the benefit of, the lease, including that oil used off-lease for the benefit of the lease when such off-lease use is permitted by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation, and Enforcement (BOEMRE) or BLM, as appropriate) produced from a Federal or Indian lease to which this part applies is subject to royalty.
(2) When oil is used on, or for the benefit of, the lease at a production facility handling production from more than one lease with the approval of the BSEE or BLM, as appropriate, or at a
production facility handling unitized or communitized production, only that proportionate share of each lease's production (actual or allocated) necessary to operate the production facility may be used royalty-free.
(3) Where the terms of any lease are inconsistent with this section, the lease terms shall govern to the extent of that inconsistency.
(c) If BLM determines that oil was avoidably lost or wasted from an onshore lease, or that oil was drained from an onshore lease for which compensatory royalty is due, or if BSEE determines that oil was avoidably lost or wasted from an offshore lease, then the value of that oil shall be determined in accordance with 30 CFR part 1206.
(d) If a lessee receives insurance compensation for unavoidably lost oil, royalties are due on the amount of that compensation. This paragraph shall not apply to compensation through self-insurance.
(e)(1) In those instances where the lessee of any lease committed to a federally approved unitization or communitization agreement does not actually take the proportionate share of the agreement production attributable to its lease under the terms of the agreement, the full share of production attributable to the lease under the terms of the agreement nonetheless is subject to the royalty payment and reporting requirements of this title. Except as provided in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, the value, for royalty purposes, of production attributable to unitized or communitized leases will be determined in accordance with 30 CFR part 1206. In applying the requirements of 30 CFR part 1206, the circumstances involved in the actual disposition of the portion of the production to which the lessee was entitled but did not take shall be considered as controlling in arriving at the value, for royalty purposes, of that portion as though the person actually selling or disposing of the production were the lessee of the Federal or Indian lease.
(2) If a Federal or Indian lessee takes less than its proportionate share of agreement production, upon request of the lessee ONRR may authorize a royalty valuation method different from that required by paragraph (e)(1) of this section, but consistent with the purposes of these regulations, for any volumes not taken by the lessee but for which royalties are due.
(3) For purposes of this subchapter, all persons actually taking volumes in excess of their proportionate share of production in any month under a unitization or communitization agreement shall be deemed to have taken ratably from all persons actually taking less than their proportionate share of the agreement production for that month.
(4) If a lessee takes less than its proportionate share of agreement production for any month but royalties are paid on the full volume of its proportionate share in accordance with the provisions of this section, no additional royalty will be owed for that lease for prior periods when the lessee subsequently takes more than its proportionate share to balance its account or when the lessee is paid a sum of money by the other agreement participants to balance its account.
(f) For production from Federal and Indian leases which are committed to federally-approved unitization or communitization agreements, upon request of a lessee ONRR may establish the value of production pursuant to a method other than the method required by the regulations in this title if: (1) The proposed method for establishing value is consistent with the requirements of the applicable statutes, lease terms, and agreement terms; (2) persons with an interest in the agreement, including, to the extent practical, royalty interests, are given notice and an opportunity to comment on the proposed valuation method before it is authorized; and (3) to the extent practical, persons with an interest in a Federal or Indian lease committed to the agreement, including royalty interests, must agree to use the proposed method for valuing production from the agreement for royalty purposes.

53 FR 1271, Jan. 15, 1988, unless otherwise noted.
§ 1202.150
Royalty on gas.
(a) Royalties due on gas production from leases subject to the requirements of this subpart, except helium produced from Federal leases, shall be at the rate established by the terms of the lease. Royalty shall be paid in value unless ONRR requires payment in kind. When paid in value, the royalty due shall be the value, for royalty purposes, determined pursuant to 30 CFR part 1206 of this title multiplied by the royalty rate in the lease.
(b)(1) All gas (except gas unavoidably lost or used on, or for the benefit of, the lease, including that gas used off-lease for the benefit of the lease when such off-lease use is permitted by the BSEE or BLM, as appropriate) produced from a Federal lease to which this subpart applies is subject to royalty.
(2) When gas is used on, or for the benefit of, the lease at a production facility handling production from more than one lease with the approval of BSEE or BLM, as appropriate, or at a production facility handling unitized or communitized production, only that proportionate share of each lease's production (actual or allocated) necessary to operate the production facility may be used royalty free.
(3) Where the terms of any lease are inconsistent with this subpart, the lease terms shall govern to the extent of that inconsistency.
(c) If BLM determines that gas was avoidably lost or wasted from an onshore lease, or that gas was drained from an onshore lease for which compensatory royalty is due, or if BSEE determines that gas was avoidably lost or wasted from an OCS lease, then the value of that gas shall be determined in accordance with 30 CFR part 1206.
(d) If a lessee receives insurance compensation for unavoidably lost gas, royalties are due on the amount of that compensation. This paragraph shall not apply to compensation through self-insurance.
(e)(1) In those instances where the lessee of any lease committed to a Federally approved unitization or communitization agreement does not actually take the proportionate share of the production attributable to its Federal lease under the terms of the agreement, the full share of production attributable to the lease under the terms of the agreement nonetheless is subject to the royalty payment and reporting requirements of this title. Except as provided in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, the value for royalty purposes of production attributable to unitized or communitized leases will be determined in accordance with 30 CFR part 1206. In applying the requirements of 30 CFR part 1206, the circumstances involved in the actual disposition of the portion of the production to which the lessee was entitled but did not take shall be considered as controlling in arriving at the value for royalty purposes of that portion, as if the person actually selling or disposing of the production were the lessee of the Federal lease.
(2) If a Federal lessee takes less than its proportionate share of agreement production, upon request of the lessee ONRR may authorize a royalty valuation method different from that required by paragraph (e)(1) of this section, but consistent with the purpose of these regulations, for any volumes not taken by the lessee but for which royalties are due.
(3) For purposes of this subchapter, all persons actually taking volumes in excess of their proportionate share of production in any month under a unitization or communitization agreement shall be deemed to have taken ratably from all persons actually taking less than their proportionate share of the agreement production for that month.
(4) If a lessee takes less than its proportionate share of agreement production for any month but royalties are
paid on the full volume of its proportionate share in accordance with the provisions of this section, no additional royalty will be owed for that lease for prior periods at the time the lessee subsequently takes more than its proportionate share to balance its account or when the lessee is paid a sum of money by the other agreement participants to balance its account.
(f) For production from Federal leases which are committed to federally-approved unitization or communitization agreements, upon request of a lessee ONRR may establish the value of production pursuant to a method other than the method required by the regulations in this title if: (1) The proposed method for establishing value is consistent with the requirements of the applicable statutes, lease terms and agreement terms; (2) to the extent practical, persons with an interest in the agreement, including royalty interests, are given notice and an opportunity to comment on the proposed valuation method before it is authorized; and (3) to the extent practical, persons with an interest in a Federal lease committed to the agreement, including royalty interests, must agree to use the proposed method for valuing production from the agreement for royalty purposes.

§ 1202.151
Royalty on processed gas.
(a)(1) A royalty, as provided in the lease, shall be paid on the value of:
(i) Any condensate recovered downstream of the point of royalty settlement without resorting to processing; and
(ii) Residue gas and all gas plant products resulting from processing the gas produced from a lease subject to this subpart.
(2) ONRR shall authorize a processing allowance for the reasonable, actual costs of processing the gas produced from Federal leases. Processing allowances shall be determined in accordance with 30 CFR part 1206 subpart D for gas production from Federal leases and 30 CFR part 1206 subpart E for gas production from Indian leases.
(b) A reasonable amount of residue gas shall be allowed royalty free for operation of the processing plant, but no allowance shall be made for boosting residue gas or other expenses incidental to marketing, except as provided in 30 CFR part 1206. In those situations where a processing plant processes gas from more than one lease, only that proportionate share of each lease's residue gas necessary for the operation of the processing plant shall be allowed royalty free.
(c) No royalty is due on residue gas, or any gas plant product resulting from processing gas, which is reinjected into a reservoir within the same lease, unit area, or communitized area, when the reinjection is included in a plan of development or operations and the plan has received BLM or Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) approval for onshore or offshore operations, respectively, until such time as they are finally produced from the reservoir for sale or other disposition off-lease.

§ 1202.351
Royalties on geothermal resources.
(a)(1) Royalties on geothermal resources, including byproducts, or on electricity produced using geothermal resources, will be at the royalty rate(s) specified in the lease, unless the Secretary of the Interior temporarily waives, suspends, or reduces that rate(s). Royalties are determined under 30 CFR part 1206, subpart H.
(2) Fees in lieu of royalties on geothermal resources are prescribed in 30 CFR part 1206, subpart H.
(3) Except for the amount credited against royalties for in-kind deliveries of electricity to a State or county under § 1218.306, you must pay royalties and direct use fees in money.
(b)(1) Except as specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, royalties or fees are due on—
(i) All geothermal resources produced from a lease and that are sold or used by the lessee or are reasonably susceptible to sale or use by the lessee, or
(ii) All proceeds derived from the sale of electricity produced using geothermal resources produced from a lease.
(2) For purposes of this subparagraph, the terms “Class I lease,” “Class II lease,” and “Class III lease” have the same meanings prescribed in § 1206.351.
(i) For Class I leases, ONRR will allow free of royalty—
(A) Geothermal resources that are unavoidably lost or reinjected before use on or off the lease, as determined by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), or that are reasonably necessary to generate plant parasitic electricity or electricity for Federal lease operations; and
(B) A reasonable amount of commercially demineralized water necessary for power plant operations or otherwise used on or for the benefit of the lease.
(ii) For Class II and Class III leases where the lessee uses geothermal resources for commercial production or generation of electricity, or where geothermal resources are sold at arm's length for the commercial production or generation of electricity, ONRR will allow free of royalty or direct use fees geothermal resources that are:
(A) Unavoidably lost or reinjected before use on or off the lease, as determined by BLM;
(B) Reasonably necessary for the lessee to generate plant parasitic electricity or electricity for Federal lease operations, as approved by BLM; or
(C) Otherwise used for Federal lease operations related to commercial production or generation of electricity, as approved by BLM.
(iii) For Class II and Class III leases where the lessee uses the geothermal resources for a direct use or in a direct use facility, as defined in § 1206.351, resources that are used to generate electricity for Federal lease operations or that are otherwise used for Federal lease operations are subject to direct use fees, except for geothermal resources that are unavoidably lost or reinjected before use on or off the lease, as determined by BLM.
(3) Royalties on byproducts are due at the time the recovered byproduct is used, sold, or otherwise finally disposed of. Byproducts produced and added to stockpiles or inventory do not require payment of royalty until the byproducts are sold, utilized, or otherwise finally disposed of. The ONRR may ask BLM to increase the lease bond to protect the lessor's interest when BLM determines that stockpiles or inventories become excessive.
(c) If BLM determines that geothermal resources (including byproducts) were avoidably lost or wasted from the lease, or that geothermal resources (including byproducts) were drained from the lease for which compensatory royalty (or compensatory fees in lieu of compensatory royalty) are due, the value of those geothermal resources, or the royalty or fees owed, will be determined under 30 CFR part 1206, subpart H.
(d) If a lessee receives insurance or other compensation for unavoidably lost geothermal resources (including byproducts), royalties at the rates specified in the lease (or fees in lieu of royalties) are due on the amount of, or as a result of, that compensation. This paragraph will not apply to compensation through self-insurance.

Minimum royalty.
In no event shall the lessee's annual royalty payments for any producing lease be less than the minimum royalty established by the lease.
§ 1202.353
Measurement standards for reporting and paying royalties and direct use fees.
(a) For geothermal resources used to generate electricity, you must report the quantity on which royalty is due on Form ONRR-2014 (Report of Sales and Royalty Remittance) as follows:
(1) For geothermal resources for which royalty is calculated under § 1206.352(a), you must report quantities in:
(i) Thousands of pounds to the nearest whole thousand pounds if the contract for the geothermal resources specifies delivery in terms of weight; or
(ii) Millions of Btu to the nearest whole million Btu if the sales contract for the geothermal resources specifies delivery in terms of heat or thermal energy.
(2) For geothermal resources for which royalty is calculated under § 1206.352(b), you must report the quantities in kilowatt-hours to the nearest whole kilowatt-hour.
(b) For geothermal resources used in direct use processes, you must report the quantity on which a royalty or direct use fee is due on Form ONRR-2014 in:
(1) Millions of Btu to the nearest whole million Btu if valuation is in terms of heat or thermal energy used or displaced;
(2) Millions of gallons to the nearest million gallons of geothermal fluid produced if valuation or fee calculation is in terms of volume;
(3) Millions of pounds to the nearest million pounds of geothermal fluid produced if valuation or fee calculation is in terms of mass; or
(4) Any other measurement unit ONRR approves for valuation and reporting purposes.
(c) For byproducts, you must report the quantity on which royalty is due on Form ONRR-2014 consistent with ONRR-established reporting standards.
(d) For commercially demineralized water, you must report the quantity on which royalty is due on Form ONRR-2014 in hundreds of gallons to the nearest hundred gallons.
(e) You need not report the quality of geothermal resources, including byproducts, to ONRR. However, you must maintain quality measurements for audit purposes. Quality measurements include, but are not limited to:
(1) Temperatures and chemical analyses for fluid geothermal resources; and

# Subpart J—Gas Production From Indian Leases

# Source:
64 FR 43514, Aug. 10, 1999, unless otherwise noted.
§ 1202.550
How do I determine the royalty due on gas production?
If you produce gas from an Indian lease subject to this subpart, you must determine and pay royalties on gas production as specified in this section.
(a)
Royalty rate.
You must calculate your royalty using the royalty rate in the lease.
(b)
Payment in value or in kind.
You must pay royalty in value unless:
(1) The Tribal lessor requires payment in kind; or
(2) You have a lease on allotted lands and ONRR requires payment in kind.
(c)
Royalty calculation.
You must use the following calculations to determine royalty due on the production from or attributable to your lease.
(1) When paid in value, the royalty due is the unit value of production for royalty purposes, determined under 30 CFR part 1206, multiplied by the volume of production multiplied by the royalty rate in the lease.
(2) When paid in kind, the royalty due is the volume of production multiplied by the royalty rate.
(d)
Reduced royalty rate.
The Indian lessor and the Secretary may approve a request for a royalty rate reduction. In your request you must demonstrate economic hardship.
(e)
Reporting and paying.
You must report and pay royalties as provided in part 1218 of this title.
§ 1202.551
How do I determine the volume of production for which I must pay royalty if my lease is not in an approved Federal unit or communitization agreement (AFA)?
(a) You are liable for royalty on your entitled share of gas production from your Indian lease, except as provided in §§ 1202.555, 1202.556, and 1202.557.
(b) You and all other persons paying royalties on the lease must report and pay royalties based on your takes. If another person takes some of your entitled share but does not pay the royalties owed, you are liable for those royalties.
(c) You and all other persons paying royalties on the lease may ask ONRR for permission to report and pay royalties based on your entitlements. In that event, ONRR will provide valuation instructions consistent with this part and part 1206 of this title.
§ 1202.552
How do I determine how much royalty I must pay if my lease is in an approved Federal unit or communitization agreement (AFA)?
You must pay royalties each month on production allocated to your lease under the terms of an AFA. To determine the volume and the value of your production, you must follow these three steps:
(a) You must determine the volume of your entitled share of production allocated to your lease under the terms of an AFA. This may include production from more than one AFA.
(b) You must value the production you take using 30 CFR part 1206. If you take more than your entitled share of production, see § 1202.553 for information on how to value this production. If you take less than your entitled share of production, see § 1202.554 for information on how to value production you are entitled to but do not take.
§ 1202.553
How do I value my production if I take more than my entitled share?
If you take more than your entitled share of production from a lease in an AFA for any month, you must determine the weighted-average value of all of the production that you take using the procedures in 30 CFR part 1206, and use that value for your entitled share of production.
§ 1202.554
How do I value my production that I do not take if I take less than my entitled share?
If you take none or only part of your entitled production from a lease in an AFA for any month, use this section to
value the production that you are entitled to but do not take.
(a) If you take a significant volume of production from your lease during the month, you must determine the weighted average value of the production that you take using 30 CFR part 1206, and use that value for the production that you do not take.
(b) If you do not take a significant volume of production from your lease during the month, you must use paragraph (c) or (d) of this section, whichever applies.
(c) In a month where you do not take production or take an insignificant volume, and if you would have used § 1206.172(b) to value the production if you had taken it, you must determine the value of production not taken for that month under § 1206.172(b) as if you had taken it.
(d) If you take none of your entitled share of production from a lease in an AFA, and if that production cannot be valued under § 1206.172(b), then you must determine the value of the production that you do not take using the first of the following methods that applies:
(1) The weighted average of the value of your production (under 30 CFR part 1206) in that month from other leases in the same AFA.
(2) The weighted average of the value of your production (under 30 CFR part 1206) in that month from other leases in the same field or area.
(3) The weighted average of the value of your production (under 30 CFR part 1206) during the previous month for production from leases in the same AFA.
(4) The weighted average of the value of your production (under 30 CFR part 1206) during the previous month for production from other leases in the same field or area.
(5) The latest major portion value that you received from ONRR calculated under § 1206.174 for the same ONRR-designated area.
(e) You may take less than your entitled share of AFA production for any month, but pay royalties on the full volume of your entitled share under this section. If you do, you will owe no additional royalty for that lease for that month when you later take more than your entitled share to balance your account. The provisions of this paragraph (e) also apply when the other AFA participants pay you money to balance your account.
§ 1202.555
What portion of the gas that I produce is subject to royalty?
(a) All gas produced from or allocated to your Indian lease is subject to royalty except the following:
(1) Gas that is unavoidably lost.
(2) Gas that is used on, or for the benefit of, the lease.
(3) Gas that is used off-lease for the benefit of the lease when the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) approves such off-lease use.
(4) Gas used as plant fuel as provided in § 1206.179(e).
(b) You may use royalty-free only that proportionate share of each lease's production (actual or allocated) necessary to operate the production facility when you use gas for one of the following purposes:
(1) On, or for the benefit of, the lease at a production facility handling production from more than one lease with BLM's approval.
(2) At a production facility handling unitized or communitized production.
(c) If the terms of your lease are inconsistent with this subpart, your lease terms will govern to the extent of that inconsistency.
§ 1202.556
How do I determine the value of avoidably lost, wasted, or drained gas?
If BLM determines that a volume of gas was avoidably lost or wasted, or a volume of gas was drained from your Indian lease for which compensatory royalty is due, then you must determine the value of that volume of gas under 30 CFR part 1206.
§ 1202.557
Must I pay royalty on insurance compensation for unavoidably lost gas?
If you receive insurance compensation for unavoidably lost gas, you must pay royalties on the amount of that compensation. This paragraph does not apply to compensation through self-insurance.
§ 1202.558
What standards do I use to report and pay royalties on gas?
(a) You must report gas volumes as follows:
(1) Report gas volumes and Btu heating values, if applicable, under the same degree of water saturation. Report gas volumes and Btu heating value at a standard pressure base of 14.73 psia and a standard temperature of 60 degrees Fahrenheit. Report gas volumes in units of 1,000 cubic feet (Mcf).
(2) You must use the frequency and method of Btu measurement stated in your contract to determine Btu heating values for reporting purposes. However, you must measure the Btu value at least semi-annually by recognized standard industry testing methods even if your contract provides for less frequent measurement.
(b) You must report residue gas and gas plant product volumes as follows:
(1) Report carbon dioxide (CO
2
), nitrogen (N
2
), helium (He), residue gas, and any gas marketed as a separate product by using the same standards specified in paragraph (a) of this section.
(2) Report natural gas liquid (NGL) volumes in standard U.S. gallons (231 cubic inches) at 60 degrees F.
(3) Report sulfur (S) volumes in long tons (2,240 pounds).

# Subpart A—General Provisions
§ 1204.1
What is the purpose of this part?
This part explains how you as a lessee or designee of a Federal onshore or Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) oil and gas lease may obtain prepayment or accounting and auditing relief for production from certain marginal properties. This part does not apply to production from Indian leases, even if the Indian lease is within an agreement that qualifies as a marginal property.
§ 1204.2
What definitions apply to this part?
Agreement
means a federally approved communitization agreement or unit participating area.
Barrels of oil equivalent (BOE)
means the combined equivalent production of oil and gas stated in barrels of oil. Each barrel of oil production is equal to one BOE. Also, each 6,000 cubic feet of gas production is equal to one BOE.
Base period
means the 12-month period from July 1 through June 30 immediately preceding the calendar year for which you take or request marginal property relief. For example, if you request relief for calendar year 2006, your base period is July 1, 2004, through June 30, 2005.
Combined equivalent production
means the total of all oil and gas production for the marginal property, stated in BOE.
Designee
means the person designated by a lessee under § 1218.52 to make all or part of the royalty or other payments due on a lease on the lessee's behalf.
Producing wells
means only those producing oil or gas wells that contribute to the sum of BOE used in the calculation under § 1204.4(c). Producing wells do not include injection or water wells. Wells with multiple zones commingled downhole are considered as a single well.
Property
means a lease, a portion of a lease, or an agreement that may be a marginal property if it meets the qualification requirements of § 1204.4.
State concerned (State)
means the State that receives a statutorily prescribed portion of the royalties from a Federal onshore or OCS lease.
§ 1204.3
What alternatives are available for marginal properties?
If you have production from a marginal property, ONRR and the State may allow you the following options:
(a)
Prepay royalty.
ONRR and the State may allow you to make a lump-sum advance payment of royalties instead of monthly royalty payments for the remainder of the lease term. See subpart B for prepayment of royalty requirements.
(b)
Take accounting and auditing relief.
ONRR and the State may allow various accounting and auditing relief options to encourage you to continue to produce and develop your marginal property. See subpart C for accounting and auditing relief requirements.
§ 1204.4
What is a marginal property under this part?
(a) To qualify as a marginal property eligible for royalty prepayment or accounting and auditing relief under this part, the property must meet the following requirements:
If your lease is . . .
Then . . .
And . . .
(1) Not in an agreement
The lease must qualify as a marginal property under paragraph (b) of this section
(2) Entirely or partly committed to one agreement
The entire agreement must qualify as a marginal property under paragraph (b) of this section
Agreement production allocable to your lease may be eligible for relief under this part. Any production from your lease that is not committed to the agreement also may be eligible for separate relief under paragraph (a)(4) of this table.
(3) Entirely or partly committed to more than one agreement
Each agreement must qualify separately as a marginal property under paragraph (b) of this section
For any agreement that does qualify, that agreement's production allocable to your lease may be eligible for relief under this part. Any production from your lease that is not committed to an agreement also may be eligible for separate relief under paragraph (a)(4) of this table.
(4) Partly committed to an agreement and you have production from the part of the lease that is not committed to the agreement
The part of the lease that is not committed to the agreement must qualify separately as a marginal property under paragraph (b) of this section
(b) To qualify as a marginal property for a calendar year, the combined equivalent production of the property during the base period must equal an average daily well production of less than 15 barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) per well per day calculated under paragraph (c) of this section.
(c) To determine the average daily well production for a property, divide the sum of the BOE for all producing wells on the property during the base period by the sum of the number of days that each of those wells actually produced during the base period. If the property is an agreement, your calculation under this paragraph must include all wells included in the agreement, even if they are not on a Federal onshore or OCS lease.
§ 1204.5
What statutory requirements must I meet to obtain royalty prepayment or accounting and auditing relief?
(a) ONRR and the State may allow royalty prepayment or accounting and auditing relief for your marginal property production if ONRR and the State jointly determine that the prepayment or accounting and auditing relief is in the best interests of the Federal Government and the State to:
(1) Promote production;
(2) Reduce the administrative costs of ONRR and the State; and
(3) Increase net receipts to the Federal Government and the State.
(b) At any time, if ONRR and the State determine that either prepayment or accounting and auditing relief no longer meets the criteria in paragraph (a) of this section, ONRR, with the State's concurrence, may discontinue any prepayment or accounting and auditing relief options granted for production from any marginal property.
(1) ONRR will provide you written notice of the decision to discontinue relief.
(i) If you took the cumulative reports and payments relief option under § 1204.202, your relief will terminate at the end of the calendar year in which you received the notice.
(ii) If you were approved for prepayment relief under subpart B of this part or other relief under § 1204.203, ONRR's notice will tell you when your relief terminates.
(2) ONRR's decision to discontinue relief is not subject to administrative appeal.
§ 1204.6
May I appeal if ONRR denies my request for prepayment or other relief?
If ONRR denies your request for prepayment relief under subpart B of this part or other relief under § 1204.203, you may appeal under 30 CFR part 1290.
Subpart B—Prepayment of Royalty [Reserved]

# Subpart C—Accounting and Auditing Relief
§ 1204.200
What is the purpose of this subpart?
This subpart explains how you as a lessee or designee may obtain accounting and auditing relief for your Federal onshore or OCS lease production from a marginal property. The two types of accounting and auditing relief that you can receive under this subpart are cumulative reports and payment relief
(explained in § 1204.202) and other accounting and auditing relief appropriate for your property (explained in § 1204.203).
§ 1204.201
Who may obtain accounting and auditing relief?
(a) You may obtain accounting and auditing relief under this subpart:
(1) If you are a lessee or a designee for a Federal lease with production from a property that qualifies as a marginal property under § 1204.4;
(2) If you meet any additional requirements for specific types of relief under this subpart; and
(3) Only for the fractional interest in production from the marginal property for which you report and pay royalty. You may obtain relief even if the other lessees or designees for your lease or agreement do not request relief.
(b) You may not obtain one or both of the relief options specified in this subpart on any portion of production from a marginal property if:
(1) The marginal property covers multiple States; and
(2) One of the States determines under § 1204.208 that it will not allow the relief option you seek.
§ 1204.202
What is the cumulative royalty reports and payments relief option?
(a) The cumulative royalty reports and payments relief option allows you to submit one royalty report and payment annually for production during a calendar year. You are eligible for this option only if the total volume produced from the marginal property (not just your share of the production) is 1,000 BOE or less during the base period.
(b) To use the cumulative royalty reports and payments relief option, you must do all of the following:
(1) Notify ONRR in writing by January 31 of the calendar year for which you begin taking your relief. See § 1204.205(a) for what your notification must contain;
(2) Submit your royalty report and payment in accordance with 30 CFR 1218.51(g) by the end of February of the year following the calendar year for which you reported annually, unless you have an estimated payment on file. If you have an estimated payment on file, you must submit your royalty report and payment by the end of March of the year following the calendar year for which you reported annually;
(3) Use the sales month prior to the month that you submit your annual report and payment under paragraph (b)(2) of this section on your Report of Sales and Royalty Remittance, Form ONRR-2014, for the entire previous calendar year's production for which you are paying annually. (For example, for a report in February use January as your sales month, and for a report in March use February as your sales month, to report production for the entire previous calendar year for which you are paying annually);
(4) Report one line of cumulative royalty information on Form ONRR-2014 for the calendar year, the same as if it were a monthly report; and
(5) Report allowances on Form ONRR-2014 on the same annual basis as the royalties for your marginal property production.
(c) If you do not pay your royalty by the date due in paragraph (b) of this section, you will owe late payment interest determined under 30 CFR 1218.54 from the date your payment was due under this section until the date ONRR receives it.
(d) If you take relief you are not qualified for, you may be liable for civil penalties. Also you must:
(1) Pay ONRR late payment interest determined under § 1218.54 from the date your payment was due until the date ONRR receives it; and
(2) Amend your Form ONRR-2014 to reflect the required monthly reporting.
(e) If you dispose of your ownership interest in a marginal property for which you have taken relief under this section (or if you are a designee who reports and pays royalty for a lessee who has disposed of its ownership interest), you must:
(1) Report and pay royalties for the portion of the calendar year for which you had an ownership interest; and
(2) Make the report and payment by the end of the month after you dispose of the ownership interest in the marginal property. If you do not report and pay timely, you will owe interest determined under § 1218.54 from the date
the payment was due under this section.
[69 FR 55088, Sept. 13, 2004, as amended at 78 FR 30200, May 22, 2013]
§ 1204.203
What is the other relief option?
(a) Under this relief option, you may request any type of accounting and auditing relief that is appropriate for production from your marginal property, provided it is not prohibited under § 1204.204 and meets the statutory requirements of § 1204.5. Examples of relief options you could request are:
(1) To report and pay royalties using a valuation method other than that required under 30 CFR part 1206 that approximates royalties payable under that part 1206; and
(2) To reduce your royalty audit burden. However, ONRR will not consider any request that eliminates ONRR's or the States' right to audit.
(b) You must request approval from ONRR under § 1204.205(b), and receive approval under § 1204.206 before taking relief under this option.
§ 1204.204
What accounting and auditing relief will ONRR not allow?
ONRR will not approve your request for accounting and auditing relief under this subpart if your request:
(a) Prohibits ONRR or the State from conducting any form of audit;
(b) Permanently relieves you from making future royalty reports or payments;
(c) Provides for less frequent royalty reports and payments than annually;
(d) Provides for you to submit royalty reports and payments at separate times;
(e) Impairs ONRR's ability to properly or efficiently account for or distribute royalties;
(f) Requests relief for a lease under which the Federal Government takes its royalties in kind;
(g) Alters production reporting requirements;
(h) Alters lease operation or safety requirements;
(i) Conflicts with rent, minimum royalty, or lease requirements; or
(j) Requests relief for production from a marginal property located in whole or in part in a State that has determined that it will not allow such relief under § 1204.208.
§ 1204.205
How do I obtain accounting and auditing relief?
(a) To take cumulative reports and payments relief under § 1204.202, you must notify ONRR in writing by January 31 of the calendar year for which you begin taking your relief.
(1) Your notification must contain:
(i) Your company name, ONRR-assigned payor code, address, phone number, and contact name; and
(ii) The specific ONRR lease number and agreement number, if applicable.
(2) You may file a single notification for multiple marginal properties.
(b) To obtain other relief under § 1204.203, you must file a written request for relief with ONRR.
(1) Your request must contain:
(i) Your company name, ONRR-assigned payor code, address, phone number, and contact name;
(ii) The ONRR lease number and agreement number, if applicable; and
(iii) A complete and detailed description of the specific accounting or auditing relief you seek.
(2) You may file a single request for multiple marginal properties if you are requesting the same relief for all properties.
§ 1204.206
What will ONRR do when it receives my request for other relief?
When ONRR receives your request for other relief under § 1204.205(b), it will notify you in writing as follows:
(a) If your request for relief is complete, ONRR may either approve, deny, or modify your request in writing after consultation with any State required under § 1204.207(b).
(1) If ONRR approves your request for relief, ONRR will notify you of the effective date of your accounting or auditing relief and other specifics of the relief approved.
(2) If ONRR denies your relief request, ONRR will notify you of the reasons for denial and your appeal rights under § 1204.6.
(3) If ONRR modifies your relief request, ONRR will notify you of the modifications.
(i) You have 60 days from your receipt of ONRR's notice to either accept or reject any modification(s) in writing.
(ii) If you reject the modification(s) or fail to respond to ONRR's notice, ONRR will deny your relief request. ONRR will notify you in writing of the reasons for denial and your appeal rights under § 1204.6.
(b) If your request for relief is not complete, ONRR will notify you in writing that your request is incomplete and identify any missing information.
(1) You must submit the missing information within 60 days of your receipt of ONRR's notice that your request is incomplete.
(2) After you submit all required information, ONRR may approve, deny, or modify your request for relief under paragraph (a) of this section.
(3) If you do not submit all required information within 60 days of your receipt of ONRR's notice that your request is incomplete, ONRR will deny your relief request. ONRR will notify you in writing of the reasons for denial and your appeal rights under § 1204.6.
(4) You may submit a new request for relief under this subpart at any time after ONRR returns your incomplete request.
[69 FR 55088, Sept. 13, 2004, as amended at 78 FR 30200, May 22, 2013]
§ 1204.207
Who will approve, deny, or modify my request for accounting and auditing relief?
(a) If there is not a State concerned for your marginal property, only ONRR will decide whether to approve, deny, or modify your relief request.
(b) If there is a State concerned for your marginal property that has determined in advance under § 1204.208 that it will allow either or both of the relief options under this subpart, ONRR will decide whether to approve, deny, or modify your relief request after consulting with the State concerned.
[69 FR 55088, Sept. 13, 2004, as amended at 76 FR 38561, July 1, 2011]
§ 1204.208
May a State decide that it will or will not allow one or both of the relief options under this subpart?
(a) A State may decide in advance that it will or will not allow one or both of the relief options specified in this subpart for a particular calendar year. If a State decides that it will not consent to one or both of the relief options, ONRR will not grant that type of marginal property relief.
(b) To help States decide whether to allow one or both of the relief options specified in this subpart, for each calendar year ONRR will send States a Report of Marginal Properties by October 1 preceding the calendar year.
(c) If a State decides under paragraph (a) of this section that it will or will not allow one or both of the relief options in this subpart during the next calendar year, within 30 days of the State's receipt of the Report of Marginal Properties under paragraph (b) of this section, the State must:
(1) Notify the Director for Office of Natural Resources Revenue, in writing, of its intent to allow or not allow one or both of the relief options under this subpart; and
(2) Specify in its notice of intent to ONRR which relief option(s) it will allow or not allow.
(d) If a State decides in advance under paragraph (a) of this section that it will not allow one or both of the relief options specified in this subpart, it may decide for subsequent calendar years that it will allow one or both of the relief options in this subpart. If it so decides, within 30 days of the State's receipt of the Report of Marginal Properties under paragraph (b) of this section, the State must:
(1) Notify the Director for Office of Natural Resources Revenue, in writing, of its intent to allow one or both of the relief options allowed under this subpart during the next calendar year; and
(2) Specify in its notice of intent to ONRR which relief option(s) it will allow.
(e) If a State does not notify ONRR under paragraph (c) or (d) of this section, the State will be deemed to have decided not to allow either of the relief options under this subpart for the next calendar year.
(f) ONRR will publish a notice of the State's intent to allow or not allow certain relief options under this section in the
Federal Register
no later than 30 days before the beginning of the applicable calendar year.
§ 1204.209
What if a property ceases to qualify for relief obtained under this subpart?
(a) A marginal property must qualify for relief under this subpart for each calendar year based on production during the base period for that calendar year. The notice or request you provided to ONRR under § 1204.205 for the first calendar year that the property qualified for relief remains effective for successive calendar years if the property continues to qualify.
(b) If a property is no longer eligible for relief for any reason during a calendar year other than the reason under § 1204.210 or paragraph (c) of this section, the relief for the property terminates as of December 31 of that calendar year. You must notify ONRR in writing by December 31 that the relief for the property has terminated.
(c) If you dispose of your interest in a marginal property during the calendar year, your relief terminates as of the end of the sales month in which you disposed of the property. Report and pay royalties for your production using the procedures in § 1204.202(e).
§ 1204.210
What if a property is approved as part of a nonqualifying agreement?
If the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) or BOEM retroactively approves a marginal property that qualified for relief for inclusion as part of an agreement that does not qualify for relief under this subpart, the property no longer qualifies for relief under this subpart then:
(a) ONRR will not retroactively rescind the marginal property relief for production from your property under § 1204.211;
(b) Your marginal property relief terminates as of December 31 of the calendar year that you receive the BLM or BOEM approval of your marginal property as part of a nonqualifying agreement; and
(c) For the calendar year in which you receive the BLM or BOEMRE approval, and for any previous period affected by the approval, the volumes on which you report and pay royalty for your lease must be amended to reflect all volumes produced on or allocated to your lease under the nonqualifying agreement as modified by BLM or BOEM. Report and pay royalties for your production using the procedures in § 1204.202(b).
(d) If you owe additional royalties based on the retroactive agreement approval and do not pay your royalty by the date due in § 1204.202(b), you will owe late payment interest determined under § 1218.54 from the date your payment was due under § 1204.202 (b)(2) until the date ONRR receives it.
[69 FR 55088, Sept. 13, 2004, as amended at 78 FR 30200, May 22, 2013]
§ 1204.211
When may ONRR rescind relief for a property?
(a) ONRR may retroactively rescind the relief for your property if ONRR determines that your property was not eligible for the relief obtained under this subpart because:
(1) You did not submit a notice or request for relief under § 1204.205;
(2) You submitted erroneous information in the notice or request for relief you provided to ONRR under § 1204.205 or in your royalty or production reports; or
(3) Your property is no longer eligible for relief because production increased, but you failed to provide the notice required under § 1204.209(b).
(b) ONRR may rescind relief for your property if ONRR decides to take royalty in kind.
§ 1204.212
What if I took relief for which I was ineligible?
If you took relief under this subpart for a period for which you were not eligible, you:
(a) May owe additional royalties and late payment interest determined under § 1218.54 from the date your additional payments were due until the date ONRR receives them; and
(b) May be subject to civil penalties.
§ 1204.213
May I obtain relief for a property that benefits from other Federal or State incentive programs?
You may obtain accounting and auditing relief for production from a marginal property under this subpart even if the property benefits from other Federal or State production incentive programs.
§ 1204.214
Is minimum royalty due on a property for which I took relief?
(a) If you took cumulative royalty reports and payment relief on a property under this subpart, minimum royalty is still due for that property by the date prescribed in your lease and in the amount prescribed therein.
(b) If you pay minimum royalty on production from a marginal property during a calendar year for which you are taking cumulative royalty reports and payment relief, and:
(1) The annual payment you owe under this subpart is greater than the minimum royalty you paid, you must pay the difference between the minimum royalty you paid and your annual payment due under this subpart; or
(2) The annual payment you owe under this subpart is less than the minimum royalty you paid, you are not entitled to a credit because you must pay at least the minimum royalty amount on your lease each year.
§ 1204.215
Are the information collection requirements in this subpart approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)?
OMB approved the information collection requirements contained in this subpart under 44 U.S.C. 3501
et seq.
ONRR identifies the approved OMB control number in 30 CFR 1210.10.

Processing
means any process designed to remove elements or compounds (hydrocarbon and non-hydrocarbon) from gas, including absorption, adsorption, or refrigeration. Field processes which normally take place on or near the lease, such as natural pressure reduction, mechanical separation, heating, cooling, dehydration, and compression, are not considered processing. The changing of pressures and/or temperatures in a reservoir is not considered processing. The use of a Joule-Thomson (JT) unit to remove NGLs from gas is considered processing regardless of where the JT unit is located, provided that you market the NGLs as NGLs.

Roll
means an adjustment to the NYMEX price that is calculated as follows: Roll = .6667 × (P
0
−P
1
) + .3333 × (P
0
−P
2
), where: P
0
= the average of the daily NYMEX settlement prices for deliveries during the prompt month that is the same as the month of production, as published for each day during
the trading month for which the month of production is the prompt month; P
1
= the average of the daily NYMEX settlement prices for deliveries during the month following the month of production, published for each day during the trading month for which the month of production is the prompt month; and P
2
= the average of the daily NYMEX settlement prices for deliveries during the second month following the month of production, as published for each day during the trading month for which the month of production is the prompt month. Calculate the average of the daily NYMEX settlement prices using only the days on which such prices are published (excluding weekends and holidays).
(1)
Example 1. Prices in Out Months are Lower Going Forward:
The month of production for which you must determine royalty value is December. December was the prompt month (for year 2011) from October 21 through November 18. January was the first month following the month of production, and February was the second month following the month of production. P
0,
therefore, is the average of the daily NYMEX settlement prices for deliveries during December published for each business day between October 21 and November 18. P
1
is the average of the daily NYMEX settlement prices for deliveries during January published for each business day between October 21 and November 18. P
2
is the average of the daily NYMEX settlement prices for deliveries during February published for each business day between October 21 and November 18. In this example, assume that P
0
= $95.08 per bbl, P
1
= $95.03 per bbl, and P
2
= $94.93 per bbl. In this example (a declining market), Roll = .6667 × ($95.08−$95.03) + .3333 × ($95.08−$94.93) = $0.03 + $0.05 = $0.08. You add this number to the NYMEX price.
(2)
Example 2. Prices in Out Months are Higher Going Forward:
The month of production for which you must determine royalty value is November. November was the prompt month (for year 2012) from September 21 through October 22. December was the first month following the month of production, and January was the second month following the month of production. P
0,
therefore, is the average of the daily NYMEX settlement prices for deliveries during November published for each business day between September 21 and October 22. P
1
is the average of the daily NYMEX settlement prices for deliveries during December published for each business day between September 21 and October 22. P
2
is the average of the daily NYMEX settlement prices for deliveries during January published for each business day between September 21 and October 22. In this example, assume that P
0
= $91.28 per bbl, P
1
= $91.65 per bbl, and P
2
= $92.10 per bbl. In this example (a rising market), Roll = .6667 × ($91.28−$91.65) + .3333 × ($91.28−$92.10) = (−$0.25) + (−$0.27) = (−$0.52). You add this negative number to the NYMEX price (effectively, a subtraction from the NYMEX price).
Sale
means a contract between two persons where:
(1) The seller unconditionally transfers title to the oil, gas, or gas plant product to the buyer and does not retain any related rights, such as the right to buy back similar quantities of oil, gas, or gas plant product from the buyer elsewhere;
(2) The buyer pays money or other consideration for the oil, gas, or gas plant product; and
(3) The parties' intent is for a sale of the oil, gas, or gas plant product to occur.
Section 6 lease
means an OCS lease subject to section 6 of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, as amended, 43 U.S.C. 1335.
Spot price
means the price under a spot sales contract where:
(1) A seller agrees to sell to a buyer a specified amount of oil at a specified price over a specified period of short duration.
(2) No cancellation notice is required to terminate the sales agreement.
(3) There is no obligation or implied intent to continue to sell in subsequent periods.
Trading month
means the period extending from the second business day before the 25th day of the second calendar month preceding the delivery month (or, if the 25th day of that
month is a non-business day, the second business day before the last business day preceding the 25th day of that month) through the third business day before the 25th day of the calendar month preceding the delivery month (or, if the 25th day of that month is a non-business day, the third business day before the last business day preceding the 25th day of that month), unless the NYMEX publishes a different definition or different dates on its official website,
www.cmegroup.com
, in which case, the NYMEX definition will apply.
Transportation allowance
means a deduction in determining royalty value for the reasonable, actual costs that the lessee incurs for moving:
(1) Oil to a point of sale or delivery off of the lease, unit area, or communitized area. The transportation allowance does not include gathering costs.
(2) Unprocessed gas, residue gas, or gas plant products to a point of sale or delivery off of the lease, unit area, or communitized area, or away from a processing plant. The transportation allowance does not include gathering costs.
WTI differential
means the average of the daily mean differentials for location and quality between a grade of crude oil at a market center and West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil at Cushing published for each day for which price publications perform surveys for deliveries during the production month, calculated over the number of days on which those differentials are published (excluding weekends and holidays). Calculate the daily mean differentials by averaging the daily high and low differentials for the month in the selected publication. Use only the days and corresponding differentials for which such differentials are published.

# Subpart B—Indian Oil

# Source:
80 FR 24805, May 1, 2015, unless otherwise noted.
§ 1206.50
What is the purpose of this subpart?
(a) This subpart applies to all oil produced from Indian (Tribal and allotted) oil and gas leases (except leases on the Osage Indian Reservation, Osage County, Oklahoma). This subpart does not apply to Federal leases, including Federal leases for which revenues are shared with Alaska Native Corporations. This subpart:
(1) Explains how you as a lessee must calculate the value of production for royalty purposes consistent with Indian mineral leasing laws, other applicable laws, and lease terms.
(2) Ensures the United States discharges its trust responsibilities for administering Indian oil and gas leases under the governing Indian mineral leasing laws, treaties, and lease terms.
(b) If you dispose of or report production on behalf of a lessee, the terms “you” and “your” in this subpart refer to you and not to the lessee. In this circumstance, you must determine and report royalty value for the lessee's oil by applying the rules in this subpart to your disposition of the lessee's oil.
(c) If the regulations in this subpart are inconsistent with:
(1) A Federal statute;
(2) A settlement agreement between the United States, Indian lessor, and a lessee resulting from administrative or judicial litigation;
(3) A written agreement between the Indian lessor, lessee, and the ONRR Director establishing a method to determine the value of production from any lease that ONRR expects at least would approximate the value established under this subpart; or
(4) An express provision of an oil and gas lease subject to this subpart then the statute, settlement agreement, written agreement, or lease provision will govern to the extent of the inconsistency.
(d) ONRR or Indian Tribes, which have a cooperative agreement with ONRR to audit under 30 U.S.C. 1732, may audit, or perform other compliance reviews, and require a lessee to adjust royalty payments and reports.

means an amount paid or received (whether in money or in barrels of oil) under an exchange agreement that results from differences in location between oil delivered in exchange and oil received in the exchange. A location differential may represent all or part of the difference between the price received for oil delivered and the price paid for oil received under a buy/sell exchange agreement.
Major Portion Price
means the highest price paid or offered at the time of production for the major portion of oil produced from the same designated area for the same crude oil type.
Marketable condition
means lease products that are sufficiently free from impurities and otherwise in a condition that they will be accepted by a purchaser under a sales contract typical for the field or area.
Net
means to reduce the reported sales value to account for transportation instead of reporting a transportation allowance as a separate entry on Form ONRR-2014.
NYMEX Calendar Month Average Price
means the average of the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) daily settlement prices for light sweet oil delivered at Cushing, Oklahoma, calculated as follows:
(1) Sum the prices published for each day during the calendar month of production (excluding weekends and holidays) for oil to be delivered in the nearest month of delivery for which NYMEX futures prices are published corresponding to each such day.
(2) Divide the sum by the number of days on which those prices are published (excluding weekends and holidays).
Oil
means a mixture of hydrocarbons that existed in the liquid phase in natural underground reservoirs and remains liquid at atmospheric pressure after passing through surface separating facilities and is marketed or used as such. Condensate recovered in lease separators or field facilities is considered to be oil.
ONRR
means the Office of Natural Resources Revenue of the Department of the Interior.
Operating rights owner,
also known as a working interest owner, means any person who owns operating rights in a lease subject to this subpart. A record title owner is the owner of operating rights under a lease until the operating rights have been transferred from record title (see Bureau of Land Management regulations at 43 CFR 3100.0-5(d)).
Person
means any individual, firm, corporation, association, partnership, consortium, or joint venture (when established as a separate entity).
Processing
means any process designed to remove elements or compounds (hydrocarbon and non-hydrocarbon) from gas, including absorption, adsorption, or refrigeration. Field processes that normally take place on or near the lease, such as natural pressure reduction, mechanical separation, heating, cooling, dehydration, and compression, are not considered processing. The changing of pressures and/or temperatures in a reservoir is not considered processing.
Prompt month
means the nearest month of delivery for which NYMEX futures prices are published during the trading month.
Quality differential
means an amount paid or received under an exchange agreement (whether in money or in barrels of oil) that results from differences in API gravity, sulfur content, viscosity, metals content, and other quality factors between oil delivered and oil received in the exchange. A quality differential may represent all or part of the difference between the price received for oil delivered and the price paid for oil received under a buy/sell agreement.
Roll
means an adjustment to the NYMEX price that is calculated as follows: Roll = .6667 × (P
0
−P
1
) + .3333 × (P
0
−P
2
), where: P
0
= the average of the
daily NYMEX settlement prices for deliveries during the prompt month that is the same as the month of production, as published for each day during the trading month for which the month of production is the prompt month; P
1
= the average of the daily NYMEX settlement prices for deliveries during the month following the month of production, published for each day during the trading month for which the month of production is the prompt month; and P
2
= the average of the daily NYMEX settlement prices for deliveries during the second month following the month of production, as published for each day during the trading month for which the month of production is the prompt month. Calculate the average of the daily NYMEX settlement prices using only the days on which such prices are published (excluding weekends and holidays). ONRR reserves the option of terminating the use of the roll when ONRR believes that the roll is no longer a common industry practice. ONRR also retains the option to redefine how to calculate the roll to comport with changes in industry practice. To terminate or otherwise redefine how to calculate the roll, ONRR will explain its rationale for terminating or redefining how to calculate the roll by publishing a notice in the
Federal Register,
to provide an opportunity for comment.

Example 1: Prices in out months are lower going forward.
The month of production for which you must determine royalty value is December 2012. December was the prompt month from October 23 through November 20. January was the first month following the month of production, and February was the second month following the month of production. P
0,
therefore, is the average of the daily NYMEX settlement prices for deliveries during December published for each business day between October 23 and November 20. P
1
is the average of the daily NYMEX settlement prices for deliveries during January published for each business day between October 23 and November 20. P
2
is the average of the daily NYMEX settlement prices for deliveries during February published for each business day between October 23 and November 20. In this example, assume that P
0
= $95.08 per bbl; P
1
= $95.03 per bbl; and P
2
= $94.93 per bbl. In this example (a declining market), Roll = .6667 × ($95.08−$95.03) + .3333 × ($95.08−$94.93) = $0.03 + $0.05 = $0.08. You add this number to the NYMEX price.
(2)
Example 2: Prices in out months are higher going forward.
The month of production for which you must determine royalty value is November 2012. November was the prompt month from September 21 through October 22. December was the first month following the month of production, and January was the second month following the month of production. P
0,
therefore, is the average of the daily NYMEX settlement prices for deliveries during November published for each business day between September 21 and October 22. P
1
is the average of the daily NYMEX settlement prices for deliveries during December published for each business day between September 21 and October 22. P
2
is the average of the daily NYMEX settlement prices for deliveries during January published for each business day between September 21 and October 22. In this example, assume that P
0
= $91.28 per bbl; P
1
= $91.65 per bbl; and P
2
= $92.10 per bbl. In this example (a rising market), Roll = .6667 × ($91.28−$91.65) + .3333 × ($91.28−$92.10) = (−$0.25) + (−$0.27) = (−$0.52). You add this negative number to the NYMEX price (effectively a subtraction from the NYMEX price).
Sale
means a contract between two persons where:
(1) The seller unconditionally transfers title to the oil to the buyer and does not retain any related rights, such as the right to buy back similar quantities of oil from the buyer elsewhere.
(2) The buyer pays money or other consideration for the oil.
(3) The parties' intent is for a sale of the oil to occur.
Sales type code
means the contract type or general disposition (
e.g.
arm's-length or non-arm's-length) of production from the lease. The sales type code applies to the sales contract, or other disposition, and not to the arm's-length or non-arm's-length nature of a transportation allowance.
Trading month
means the period extending from the second business day
before the 25th day of the second calendar month preceding the delivery month (or, if the 25th day of that month is a non-business day, the second business day before the last business day preceding the 25th day of that month) through the third business day before the 25th day of the calendar month preceding the delivery month (or, if the 25th day of that month is a non-business day, the third business day before the last business day preceding the 25th day of that month), unless the NYMEX publishes a different definition or different dates on its official Web site,
www.nymex.com,
in which case, the NYMEX definition will apply.
Transportation allowance
means a deduction in determining royalty value for the reasonable, actual costs of moving oil to a point of sale or delivery off of the lease, unit area, or communitized area. The transportation allowance does not include gathering costs.
WTI
means West Texas Intermediate.
You
means a lessee, operator, or other person who pays royalties under this subpart.
§ 1206.52
How do I calculate royalty value for oil that I or my affiliate sell(s) or exchange(s) under an arm's-length contract?
(a) The value of production for royalty purposes for your lease is the higher of either the value determined under this section or the IBMP value calculated under § 1206.54. The value of oil under this section for royalty purposes is the gross proceeds accruing to you or your affiliate under the arm's-length contract, less applicable allowances determined under § 1206.56 or § 1206.57. You must use this paragraph (a) to value oil when:
(1) You sell under an arm's-length sales contract.
(2) You sell or transfer to your affiliate or another person under a non-arm's-length contract and that affiliate or person, or another affiliate of either of them, then sells the oil under an arm's-length contract.
(b) If you have multiple arm's-length contracts to sell oil produced from a lease that is valued under paragraph (a) of this section, the value of the oil is the higher of the volume-weighted average of the values established under this section for all contracts for the sale of oil produced from that lease or the IBMP value calculated under § 1206.54.
(c) If ONRR determines that the gross proceeds accruing to you or your affiliate does not reflect the reasonable value of the production due to either:
(1) Misconduct by or between the parties to the arm's-length contract; or
(2) Breach of your duty to market the oil for the mutual benefit of yourself and the lessor, ONRR will establish a value based on other relevant matters.
(i) ONRR will not use this provision to simply substitute its judgment of the market value of the oil for the proceeds received by the seller under an arm's-length sales contract.
(ii) The fact that the price received by the seller under an arm's-length contract is less than other measures of market price is insufficient to establish breach of the duty to market unless ONRR finds additional evidence that the seller acted unreasonably or in bad faith in the sale of oil produced from the lease.
(d) You have the burden of demonstrating that your or your affiliate's contract is arm's-length.
(e) ONRR may require you to certify that the provisions in your or your affiliate's contract include all of the consideration that the buyer paid to you or your affiliate, either directly or indirectly, for the oil.
(f) You must base value on the highest price that you or your affiliate can receive through legally enforceable claims under the oil sales contract.
(1) Absent contract revision or amendment, if you or your affiliate fail(s) to take proper or timely action to receive prices or benefits to which you or your affiliate are entitled, you must pay royalty based upon that obtainable price or benefit.
(2) If you or your affiliate make timely application for a price increase or benefit allowed under your or your affiliate's contract—but the purchaser refuses—and you or your affiliate take reasonable documented measures to force purchaser compliance, you will not owe additional royalties unless or
until you or your affiliate receive additional monies or consideration resulting from the price increase. You may not construe this paragraph (f)(2) to permit you to avoid your royalty payment obligation in situations where a purchaser fails to pay, in whole or in part, or in a timely manner, for a quantity of oil.
(g)(1) You or your affiliate must make all contracts, contract revisions, or amendments in writing, and all parties to the contract must sign the contract, contract revisions, or amendments.
(2) This provision applies notwithstanding any other provisions in this title 30 of the
Code of Federal Regulations
to the contrary.
(h) If you or your affiliate enter(s) into an arm's-length exchange agreement, or multiple sequential arm's-length exchange agreements, then you must value your oil under this paragraph (h).
(1) If you or your affiliate exchange(s) oil at arm's length for WTI or equivalent oil at Cushing, Oklahoma, you must value the oil using the NYMEX price, adjusted for applicable location and quality differentials under paragraph (h)(3) of this section and any transportation costs under paragraph (h)(4) of this section and §§ 1206.56 and 1206.57 or § 1206.58.
(2) If you do not exchange oil for WTI or equivalent oil at Cushing, but exchange it at arm's length for oil at another location and following the arm's-length exchange(s) you or your affiliate sell(s) the oil received in the exchange(s) under an arm's-length contract, then you must use the gross proceeds under your or your affiliate's arm's-length sales contract after the exchange(s) occur(s), adjusted for applicable location and quality differentials under paragraph (h)(3) of this section and any transportation costs under paragraph (h)(4) of this section and §§ 1206.56 and 1206.57 or § 1206.58.
(3) You must adjust your gross proceeds for any location or quality differential, or other adjustments, that you received or paid under the arm's-length exchange agreement(s). If ONRR determines that any exchange agreement does not reflect reasonable location or quality differentials, ONRR may adjust the differentials that you used based on relevant information. You may not otherwise use the price or differential specified in an arm's-length exchange agreement to value your production.
(4) If you value oil under this paragraph (h), ONRR will allow a deduction, under §§ 1206.56 and 1206.57 or § 1206.58, for the reasonable, actual costs to transport the oil:
(i) From the lease to a point where oil is given in exchange.
(ii) If oil is not exchanged to Cushing, Oklahoma, from the point where oil is received in exchange to the point where the oil received in exchange is sold.
(5) If you or your affiliate exchange(s) your oil at arm's length, and neither paragraph (h)(1) nor (2) of this section applies, ONRR will establish a value for the oil based on relevant matters. After ONRR establishes the value, you must report and pay royalties and any late payment interest owed based on that value.
§ 1206.53
How do I calculate royalty value for oil that I or my affiliate do(es) not sell under an arm's-length contract?
(a) The value of production for royalty purposes for your lease is the higher of either the value determined under this section or the IBMP value calculated under § 1206.54. The unit value of your oil not sold under an arm's-length contract under this section for royalty purposes is the volume-weighted average of the gross proceeds paid or received by you or your affiliate, including your refining affiliate, for purchases or sales under arm's-length contracts.
(1) When calculating that unit value, use only purchases or sales of other like-quality oil produced from the field (or the same area if you do not have sufficient arm's-length purchases or sales of oil produced from the field) during the production month.
(2) You may adjust the gross proceeds determined under paragraph (a) of this section for transportation costs under paragraph (c) of this section and §§ 1206.56 and 1206.57 or § 1206.58 before including those proceeds in the volume-weighted average calculation.
(3) If you have purchases away from the field(s) and cannot calculate a price in the field because you cannot determine the seller's cost of transportation that would be allowed under paragraph (c) of this section and §§ 1206.56 and 1206.57 or § 1206.58, you must not include those purchases in your volume-weighted average calculation.
(b) Before calculating the volume-weighted average, you must normalize the quality of the oil in your or your affiliate's arm's-length purchases or sales to the same gravity as that of the oil produced from the lease. Use applicable gravity adjustment tables for the field (or the same general area for like-quality oil if you do not have gravity adjustment tables for the specific field) to normalize for gravity, as shown in the example below.
(1)
Example 1.
Assume that a lessee, who owns a refinery and refines the oil produced from the lease at that refinery, purchases like-quality oil from other producers in the same field at arm's length for use as feedstock in its refinery. Further assume that the oil produced from the lease that is being valued under this section is Wyoming general sour with an API gravity of 23.5°. Assume that the refinery purchases at arm's-length oil (all of which must be Wyoming general sour) in the following volumes of the API gravities stated at the prices and locations indicated:
10,000 bbl
24.5°
$34.70/bbl
Purchased in the field.
8,000 bbl
24.0°
$34.00/bbl
Purchased at the refinery after the third-party producer transported it to the refinery, and the lessee does not know the transportation costs.
9,000 bbl
23.0°
$33.25/bbl
Purchased in the field.
4,000 bbl
22.0°
$33.00/bbl
Purchased in the field.
(2)
Example 2.
Because the lessee does not know the costs that the seller of the 8,000 bbl incurred to transport that volume to the refinery, that volume will not be included in the volume-weighted average price calculation. Further assume that the gravity adjustment scale provides for a deduction of $0.02 per
1/10
degree API gravity below 34°. Normalized to 23.5° (the gravity of the oil being valued under this section), the prices of each of the volumes that the refiner purchased that are included in the volume-weighted average calculation are as follows:
10,000 bbl
24.5°
$34.50/bbl
(1.0° difference over 23.5° = $0.20 deducted).
9,000 bbl
23.0°
$33.35/bbl
(0.5° difference under 23.5° = $0.10 added).
4,000 bbl
22.0°
$33.30/bbl
(1.5° difference under 23.5° = $0.30 added).
(3)
Example 3.
The volume-weighted average price is ((10,000 bbl × $34.50/bbl) + (9,000 bbl × $33.35/bbl) + (4,000 bbl × $33.30/bbl)) / 23,000 bbl = $33.84/bbl. That price will be the value of the oil produced from the lease and refined prior to an arm's-length sale under this section.
(c) If you value oil under this section, ONRR will allow a deduction, under §§ 1206.56 and 1206.57 or § 1206.58, for the reasonable, actual costs:
(1) That you incur to transport oil that you or your affiliate sell(s), which is included in the volume-weighted average price calculation, from the lease to the point where the oil is sold.
(2) That the seller incurs to transport oil that you or your affiliate purchase(s), which is included in the volume-weighted average cost calculation, from the property where it is produced to the point where you or your affiliate purchase(s) it. You may not deduct any
costs of gathering as part of a transportation deduction or allowance.
(d) If paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section result in an unreasonable value for your production as a result of circumstances regarding that production, ONRR's Director may establish an alternative valuation method.
§ 1206.54
How do I fulfill the lease provision regarding valuing production on the basis of the major portion of like-quality oil?
(a) This section applies to any Indian leases that contain a major portion provision for determining value for royalty purposes. This section also applies to any Indian leases that provide that the Secretary may establish value for royalty purposes. The value of production for royalty purposes for your lease is the higher of either the value determined under this section or the gross proceeds you calculated under § 1206.52 or § 1206.53.
(b) You must submit a monthly Form ONRR-2014 using the higher of the IBMP value determined under this section or your gross proceeds under § 1206.52 or § 1206.53. Your Form ONRR-2014 must meet the requirements of 30 CFR 1210.61.
(c) ONRR will determine the monthly IBMP value for each designated area and crude oil type and post those values on our Web site at
www.onrr.gov.
The monthly IBMP value by designated area and crude oil type is calculated as follows:
(1) For Indian leases located in Oklahoma:
ER01MY15.012
(2) For all other Indian leases:
ER01MY15.013
(d) ONRR will calculate the initial LCTD for each designated area (the same designated areas posted on its Web site at
www.onrr.gov
) and crude oil type using the following formula:
ER01MY15.007
(1) For the first full production month after July 1, 2015, ONRR will calculate the monthly Major Portion Prices using data reported on the Form ONRR-2014 for the previous 12 production months prior to July 1, 2015 (Previous Twelve Months). To the extent that ONRR does not have data on the Form ONRR-2014 regarding the crude oil type for the entire previous twelve months, ONRR will assume the crude oil type is the same for those months for which ONRR does not have data as the months for which the crude oil type was reported on the Form ONRR-2014 for the same leases and/or agreements.
(i) ONRR will array the calculated prices net of transportation by month from highest to lowest price for each designated area and crude oil type. For each month, ONRR will calculate the Major Portion Price as that price at which 25 percent plus 1 barrel (by volume) of the oil (starting from the highest) is sold.
(ii) To calculate the average of the monthly Major Portion Prices for the previous 12 months, ONRR will add the
monthly Major Portion Prices calculated in paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section and divide by 12.
(2) For every month following the first full production month after July 1, 2015, ONRR will monitor the LCTD using data reported on the Form ONRR-2014 for the month ending two months before the current production month.
(i) ONRR will use the oil sales volume that lessees report on Form ONRR-2014 to monitor and, if necessary, to modify the LCTD used in the IBMP value.
(ii) ONRR will monitor oil sales volumes not reported under the sales type code OINX, as provided in 30 CFR 1210.61(a) and (b), on the Form ONRR-2014 on a monthly basis by designated area and crude oil type.
(iii) If the monthly oil sales volumes not reported under the sales type code OINX varies more than ± 3 percent from 25 percent of the total reported oil sales volume for the month, then ONRR will revise the LCTD prospectively starting with the following month.
(A) If monthly oil sales volumes not reported under the sales type code OINX on Form ONRR-2014 by the designated area and crude oil type fall below 22 percent, ONRR will increase the LCTD by 10 percent every month until the monthly oil sales volumes reported under the sales type code for gross proceeds on Form ONRR-2014 fall within the ± 3 percent range. In Example 1, assume that the IBMP value is $81.06 and the LCTD for the designated area is 14.28 percent. In the table below, the Percent of Volume not reported as OINX is less than 22 percent, which triggers a modification to the LCTD. ONRR will adjust the LCTD upward by 10 percent (14.28 percent × 1.10). Therefore, for the next month, the LCTD will be 15.71 percent. In the following month, the IBMP value will equal the next month's NYMEX CMA multiplied by (1 − 0.1571). ONRR will continue to make adjustments in subsequent months until monthly sales volumes not reported as OINX fall within 22-28 percent of the total monthly sales volume.

(B) If monthly oil sales volumes not reported under the sales type code OINX on Form ONRR-2014 by designated area and crude oil type exceed 28 percent, then ONRR will decrease the LCTD by 10 percent every month until the monthly oil sales volumes reported under the sales type code for gross proceeds on Form ONRR-2014 fall within the ± 3 percent range. In Example 2, assume that the IBMP value is $81.06 and the LCTD is 14.28 percent. As noted in the table below, however, the Percent of Volume not reported as OINX is 32.69 percent, exceeding the 28 percent threshold, which triggers a modification to the LCTD. ONRR will adjust the LCTD downward by 10 percent (14.28 percent × 0.90). Therefore, for the next month, the LCTD will be 12.85 percent. In the following month, the IBMP will equal the next month's NYMEX CMA multiplied by (1−0.1285). ONRR will continue to make adjustments in subsequent months until monthly sales volumes reported as ARMS fall within 22-28 percent of the total monthly sales volume.

(e) In designated areas where there is insufficient data reported to ONRR on Form ONRR-2014 to determine a differential for a specific crude oil type, ONRR will use its discretion to determine an appropriate IBMP value.
§ 1206.55
What are my responsibilities to place production into marketable condition and to market production?
(a) You must place oil in marketable condition and market the oil for the mutual benefit of the lessee and the lessor at no cost to the Indian lessor unless the lease agreement provides otherwise.
(b) If you must use gross proceeds under an arm's-length contract or your affiliate's gross proceeds under an arm's-length exchange agreement to determine value under § 1206.52 or § 1206.53, you must increase those gross proceeds to the extent that the purchaser, or any other person, provides certain services that the seller normally would be responsible to perform in order to place the oil in marketable condition or to market the oil.
§ 1206.56
What general transportation allowance requirements apply to me?
(a) ONRR will allow a deduction for the reasonable, actual costs to transport oil from the lease to the point off of the lease under § 1206.52 or § 1206.53, as applicable. You may not deduct transportation costs to reduce royalties where you did not incur any costs to move a particular volume of oil. ONRR will not grant a transportation allowance for transporting oil taken as Royalty-In-Kind (RIK).
(b)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, your transportation allowance deduction on the basis of a sales type code may not exceed 50 percent of the value of the oil at the point of sale, as determined under § 1206.52. Transportation costs cannot be transferred between sales type codes or to other products.
(2) Upon your request, ONRR may approve a transportation allowance deduction in excess of the limitation prescribed by paragraph (b)(1) of this section. You must demonstrate that the transportation costs incurred in excess of the limitation prescribed in paragraph (b)(1) of this section were reasonable, actual, and necessary. An application for exception (using Form ONRR-4393, Request to Exceed Regulatory Allowance Limitation) must contain all relevant and supporting documentation necessary for ONRR to make a determination. Under no circumstances may the value, for royalty purposes, under any sales type code, be reduced to zero.
(c) You must express transportation allowances for oil in dollars per barrel. If you or your affiliate's payments for transportation under a contract are not on a dollar-per-barrel basis, you must convert whatever consideration you or your affiliate are paid to a dollar-per-barrel equivalent.
(d) You must allocate transportation costs among all products produced and transported as provided in § 1206.57.
(e) All transportation allowances are subject to monitoring, review, audit, and adjustment.
(f) If, after a review or audit, ONRR determines you have improperly determined a transportation allowance authorized by this subpart, then you must pay any additional royalties due plus late payment interest calculated under § 1218.54 of this chapter or report a credit for, or request a refund of, any
overpaid royalties without interest under § 1218.53 of this chapter.
(g) You may not deduct any costs of gathering as part of a transportation deduction or allowance.
§ 1206.57
How do I determine a transportation allowance if I have an arm's-length transportation contract?
(a)
Arm's-length transportation.
(1) If you incur transportation costs under an arm's-length contract, your transportation allowance is the reasonable, actual costs that you incur to transport oil under that contract. You have the burden of demonstrating that your contract is arm's-length.
(2) You must submit to ONRR a copy of your arm's-length transportation contract(s) and all subsequent amendments to the contract(s) within 2 months of the date that ONRR receives your report, which claims the allowance on Form ONRR-2014.
(3) If ONRR determines that the consideration paid under an arm's-length transportation contract does not reflect the reasonable value of the transportation because of misconduct by or between the contracting parties, or because the lessee otherwise has breached its duty to the lessor to market the production for the mutual benefit of the lessee and the lessor, then ONRR shall require that the transportation allowance be determined in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section. When ONRR determines that the value of the transportation may be unreasonable, ONRR will notify the lessee and give the lessee an opportunity to provide written information justifying the lessee's transportation costs.
(4)(i) If an arm's-length transportation contract includes more than one liquid product, and the transportation costs attributable to each product cannot be determined from the contract, then you must allocate the total transportation costs in a consistent and equitable manner to each of the liquid products transported in the same proportion as the ratio of the volume of each product (excluding waste products which have no value) to the volume of all liquid products (excluding waste products which have no value). Except as provided in this paragraph (a)(4)(i), you may not take an allowance for the costs of transporting lease production, which is not royalty-bearing, without ONRR's approval.
(ii) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section, you may propose to ONRR a cost allocation method on the basis of the values of the products transported. ONRR shall approve the method unless it determines that it is not consistent with the purposes of the regulations in this part.
(5) If an arm's-length transportation contract includes both gaseous and liquid products, and the transportation costs attributable to each product cannot be determined from the contract, you must propose an allocation procedure to ONRR.
(i) You may use the oil transportation allowance determined in accordance with its proposed allocation procedure until ONRR issues its determination on the acceptability of the cost allocation.
(ii) You must submit to ONRR all available data to support your proposal.
(iii) You must submit your initial proposal within 3 months after the last day of the month for which you request a transportation allowance, whichever is later (unless ONRR approves a longer period).
(iv) ONRR will determine the oil transportation allowance based on your proposal and any additional information that ONRR deems necessary.
(6) Where an arm's-length sales contract price includes a provision whereby the listed price is reduced by a transportation factor, ONRR will not consider the transportation factor to be a transportation allowance. You may use the transportation factor to determine your gross proceeds for the sale of the product. The transportation factor may not exceed 50 percent of the base price of the product without ONRR's approval.
(b)
Reporting requirements.
(1) If ONRR requests, you must submit all data used to determine your transportation allowance. You must provide the data within a reasonable period of time that ONRR will determine.
(2) You must report transportation allowances as a separate entry on
Form ONRR-2014. ONRR may approve a different reporting procedure on allotted leases and with lessor approval on Tribal leases.
(3) ONRR may establish, in appropriate circumstances, reporting requirements that are different from the requirements of this section.
§ 1206.58
How do I determine a transportation allowance if I have a non-arm's-length transportation contract or have no contract?
(a)
Non-arm's-length or no contract.
(1) If you have a non-arm's-length transportation contract or no contract, including those situations where you or your affiliate perform(s) transportation services for you, the transportation allowance is based on your reasonable, actual costs as provided in this paragraph (a)(1).
(2) You must submit the actual cost information to support the allowance to ONRR on Form ONRR-4110, Oil Transportation Allowance Report, within 3 months after the end of the calendar year to which the allowance applies. However, ONRR may approve a longer time period. ONRR will monitor the allowance deductions to ensure that deductions are reasonable and allowable. When necessary or appropriate, ONRR may require you to modify your actual transportation allowance deduction.
(3) You must base a transportation allowance for non-arm's-length or no-contract situations on your actual costs for transportation during the reporting period, including operating and maintenance expenses, overhead, and either depreciation and a return on undepreciated capital investment under paragraph (a)(3)(iv)(A) of this section, or a cost equal to the initial capital investment in the transportation system multiplied by a rate of return under paragraph (a)(3)(iv)(B) of this section. Allowable capital costs are generally those for depreciable fixed assets (including costs of delivery and installation of capital equipment), which are an integral part of the transportation system.
(i) Allowable operating expenses include: Operations supervision and engineering; operations labor; fuel; utilities; materials; ad valorem property taxes; rent; supplies; and any other directly allocable and attributable operating expense that the lessee can document.
(ii) Allowable maintenance expenses include: Maintenance of the transportation system; maintenance of equipment; maintenance labor; and other directly allocable and attributable maintenance expenses that the lessee can document.
(iii) Overhead directly attributable and allocable to the operation and maintenance of the transportation system is an allowable expense. State and Federal income taxes and severance taxes and other fees, including royalties, are not allowable expenses.
(iv) You may use either depreciation or a return on depreciable capital investment. After you have elected to use either method for a transportation system, you may not later elect to change to the other alternative without approval from ONRR.
(A) To compute depreciation, you may elect to use either a straight-line depreciation method, based on the life of equipment or on the life of the reserves, which the transportation system services, or on a unit-of-production method. After you make an election, you may not change methods without ONRR's approval. A change in ownership of a transportation system will not alter the depreciation schedule the original transporter/lessee established for the purposes of the allowance calculation. With or without a change in ownership, a transportation system can be depreciated only once. You may not depreciate equipment below a reasonable salvage value.
(B) ONRR will allow as a cost an amount equal to the initial capital investment in the transportation system multiplied by the rate of return determined under paragraph (a)(3)(v) of this section. No allowance will be provided for depreciation.
(v) The rate of return is the industrial rate associated with Standard and Poor's BBB rating. The rate of return you must use is the monthly average rate as published in Standard and Poor's Bond Guide for the first month of the reporting period for which the allowance is applicable and is effective during the reporting period. You must
redetermine the rate at the beginning of each subsequent transportation allowance reporting period (which is determined under paragraph (b) of this section).
(4)(i) You must determine the deduction for transportation costs based on your or your affiliate's cost of transporting each product through each individual transportation system. Where more than one liquid product is transported, you must allocate costs to each of the liquid products transported in the same proportion as the ratio of the volume of each liquid product (excluding waste products which have no value) to the volume of all liquid products (excluding waste products which have no value) and you must make such allocation in a consistent and equitable manner. Except as provided in this paragraph (a)(4)(i), you may not take an allowance for transporting lease production that is not royalty-bearing without ONRR's approval.
(ii) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section, you may propose to ONRR a cost allocation method on the basis of the values of the products transported. ONRR will approve the method unless we determine that it is not consistent with the purposes of the regulations in this part.
(5) Where both gaseous and liquid products are transported through the same transportation system, you must propose a cost allocation procedure to ONRR.
(i) You may use the oil transportation allowance determined in accordance with its proposed allocation procedure until ONRR issues our determination on the acceptability of the cost allocation.
(ii) You must submit to ONRR all available data to support your proposal.
(iii) You must submit your initial proposal within 3 months after the last day of the month for which you request a transportation allowance (unless ONRR approves a longer period).
(iv) ONRR will determine the oil transportation allowance based on your proposal and any additional information that ONRR deems necessary.
(6) You may apply to ONRR for an exception from the requirement that you compute actual costs under paragraphs (a)(1) through (5) of this section.
(i) ONRR will grant the exception only if you have a tariff for the transportation system the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has approved for Indian leases.
(ii) ONRR will deny the exception request if it determines that the tariff is excessive as compared to arm's-length transportation charges by pipelines, owned by the lessee or others, providing similar transportation services in that area.
(iii) If there are no arm's-length transportation charges, ONRR will deny the exception request if:
(A) No FERC cost analysis exists and the FERC has declined to investigate under ONRR timely objections upon filing.
(B) The tariff significantly exceeds the lessee's actual costs for transportation as determined under this section.
(b)
Reporting requirements.
(1) If ONRR requests, you must submit all data used to determine your transportation allowance. You must provide the data within a reasonable period of time that ONRR will determine.
(2) You must report transportation allowances as a separate entry on Form ONRR-2014. ONRR may approve a different reporting procedure on allotted leases and with lessor approval on Tribal leases.
(3) ONRR may require you to submit all of the data that you used to prepare your Form ONRR-4110. You must submit the data within a reasonable period of time that ONRR determines.
(4) ONRR may establish, in appropriate circumstances, reporting requirements that are different from the requirements of this section.
(5) If you are authorized to use your FERC-approved tariff as your transportation cost under paragraph (a)(6) of this section, you must follow the reporting requirements of § 1206.57(b).
(c) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this subpart, for other than arm's-length contracts, no cost will be allowed for oil transportation that results from payments (either volumetric or for value) for actual or theoretical losses. This section does not apply when the transportation allowance is
based upon a FERC or State regulatory agency approved tariff.
(d) The provisions of this section will apply to determine transportation costs when establishing value using a netback valuation procedure or any other procedure that requires deduction of transportation costs.
§ 1206.59
What interest applies if I improperly report a transportation allowance?
(a) If you deduct a transportation allowance on Form ONRR-2014 without complying with the requirements of §§ 1206.56 and 1206.57 or § 1206.58, you must pay additional royalties due plus late payment interest calculated under § 1218.54 of this chapter.
(b) If you erroneously report a transportation allowance that results in an underpayment of royalties, you must pay any additional royalties due plus late payment interest calculated under § 1218.54 of this chapter.
§ 1206.60
What reporting adjustments must I make for transportation allowances?
(a) If your actual transportation allowance is less than the amount that you claimed on Form ONRR-2014 for each month during the allowance reporting period, you must pay additional royalties due, plus late payment interest calculated under § 1218.54 of this chapter from the first day of the first month that you were authorized to deduct a transportation allowance to the date that you repay the difference.
(b) If the actual transportation allowance is greater than the amount that you claimed on Form ONRR-2014 for any month during the period reported on the allowance form, you may report a credit for, or request a refund of, any overpaid royalties without interest under § 1218.53 of this chapter.
(c) If you make an adjustment under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, then you must submit a corrected Form ONRR-2014 to reflect actual costs, together with any payment, using instructions that ONRR provides.
§ 1206.61
How will ONRR determine if my royalty payments are correct?
(a)(1) ONRR may monitor, review, and audit the royalties that you report, and, if ONRR determines that your reported value is inconsistent with the requirements of this subpart, ONRR may direct you to use a different measure of royalty value.
(2) If ONRR directs you to use a different royalty value, you must pay any additional royalties due plus late payment interest calculated under § 1218.54 of this chapter, or you may report a credit for, or request a refund of, any overpaid royalties without interest under § 1218.53 of this chapter.
(b) When the provisions in this subpart refer to gross proceeds, in conducting reviews and audits, ONRR will examine if your or your affiliate's contract reflects the total consideration actually transferred, either directly or indirectly, from the buyer to you or your affiliate for the oil. If ONRR determines that a contract does not reflect the total consideration, you must value the oil sold as the total consideration accruing to you or your affiliate.
§ 1206.62
How do I request a value determination?
(a) You may request a value determination from ONRR regarding any oil produced. Your request must:
(1) Be in writing.
(2) Identify specifically all leases involved, all interest owners of those leases, the designee(s), and the operator(s) for those leases.
(3) Completely explain all relevant facts. You must inform ONRR of any changes to relevant facts that occur before we respond to your request.
(4) Include copies of all relevant documents.
(5) Provide your analysis of the issue(s), including citations to all relevant precedents (including adverse precedents).
(6) Suggest your proposed valuation method.
(b) In response to your request, ONRR may:
(1) Request that the Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs issue a valuation determination.
(2) Decide that ONRR will issue guidance.
(3) Inform you in writing that ONRR will not provide a determination or guidance. Situations in which ONRR typically will not provide any determination or guidance include, but are not limited to:
(i) Requests for guidance on hypothetical situations.
(ii) Matters that are the subject of pending litigation or administrative appeals.
(c)(1) A value determination that the Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs signs is binding on both you and ONRR until the Assistant Secretary modifies or rescinds it.
(2) After the Assistant Secretary issues a value determination, you must make any adjustments to royalty payments that follow from the determination, and, if you owe additional royalties, you must pay the additional royalties due plus late payment interest calculated under § 1218.54 of this chapter.
(3) A value determination that the Assistant Secretary signs is the final action of the Department and is subject to judicial review under 5 U.S.C. 701-706.
(d) Guidance that ONRR issues is not binding on ONRR, the Indian lessor, or you with respect to the specific situation addressed in the guidance.
(1) Guidance and ONRR's decision whether or not to issue guidance or request an Assistant Secretary determination, or neither, under paragraph (b) of this section, are not appealable decisions or orders under 30 CFR part 1290.
(2) If you receive an order requiring you to pay royalty on the same basis as the guidance, you may appeal that order under 30 CFR part 1290.
(e) ONRR or the Assistant Secretary may use any of the applicable valuation criteria in this subpart to provide guidance or make a determination.
(f) A change in an applicable statute or regulation on which ONRR or the Assistant Secretary based any determination or guidance takes precedence over the determination or guidance, regardless of whether ONRR or the Assistant Secretary modifies or rescinds the determination or guidance.
(g) ONRR or the Assistant Secretary generally will not retroactively modify or rescind a value determination issued under paragraph (d) of this section, unless:
(1) There was a misstatement or omission of material facts.
(2) The facts subsequently developed are materially different from the facts on which the guidance was based.
(h) ONRR may make requests and replies under this section available to the public, subject to the confidentiality requirements under § 1206.65.
§ 1206.63
How do I determine royalty quantity and quality?
(a) You must calculate royalties based on the quantity and quality of oil as measured at the point of royalty settlement that BLM approves.
(b) If you determine the value of oil under § 1206.52, § 1206.53, or § 1206.54 based on a quantity and/or quality that is different from the quantity and/or quality at the point of royalty settlement that BLM approves for the lease, you must adjust that value for the differences in quantity and/or quality.
(c) You may not make any deductions from the royalty volume or royalty value for actual or theoretical losses incurred before the royalty settlement point unless BLM determines that any actual loss was unavoidable.
§ 1206.64
What records must I keep to support my calculations of value under this subpart?
If you determine the value of your oil under this subpart, you must retain all data relevant to the determination of royalty value.
(a) You must show:
(1) How you calculated the value that you reported, including all adjustments for location, quality, and transportation.
(2) How you complied with these rules.
(b) On request, you must make available sales, volume, and transportation data for production that you sold, purchased, or obtained from the field or area. You must make this data available to ONRR, Indian representatives, or other authorized persons.
(c) You can find recordkeeping requirements in §§ 1207.5, 1212.50, and 1212.51 of this chapter.
(d) ONRR, Indian representatives, or other authorized persons may review and audit your data, and ONRR will direct you to use a different value if they determine that the reported value is inconsistent with the requirements of this subpart.
§ 1206.65
Does ONRR protect information that I provide?
(a) Certain information that you or your affiliate submit(s) to ONRR regarding the valuation of oil, including transportation allowances, may be exempt from disclosure.
(b) To the extent that applicable laws and regulations permit, ONRR will keep confidential any data that you or your affiliate submit(s) that is privileged, confidential, or otherwise exempt from disclosure.
(c) You and others must submit all requests for information under the Freedom of Information Act regulations of the Department of the Interior at 43 CFR part 2.

# Subpart C—Federal Oil

# Source:
85 FR 62023, Oct. 1, 2020, unless otherwise noted.
§ 1206.100
What is the purpose of this subpart?
(a) This subpart applies to all oil produced from Federal oil and gas leases onshore and on the OCS. It explains how you, as a lessee, must calculate the value of production for royalty purposes consistent with mineral leasing laws, other applicable laws, and lease terms.
(b) If you are a designee and if you dispose of production on behalf of a lessee, the terms “you” and “your” in this subpart refer to you and not to the lessee. In this circumstance, you must determine and report royalty value for the lessee's oil by applying the rules in this subpart to your disposition of the lessee's oil.
(c) If you are a designee and only report for a lessee and do not dispose of the lessee's production, references to “you” and “your” in this subpart refer to the lessee and not the designee. In this circumstance, you as a designee must determine and report royalty value for the lessee's oil by applying the rules in this subpart to the lessee's disposition of its oil.
(d) If the regulations in this subpart are inconsistent with a(an): Federal statute; settlement agreement between the United States and a lessee resulting from administrative or judicial litigation; written agreement between the lessee and ONRR's Director establishing a method to determine the value of production from any lease that ONRR expects would at least approximate the value established under this subpart; express provision of an oil and gas lease subject to this subpart, then the statute, settlement agreement, written agreement, or lease provision will govern to the extent of the inconsistency.
(e) ONRR may audit, monitor, or review and adjust all royalty payments.
§ 1206.101
How do I calculate royalty value for oil I or my affiliate sell(s) under an arm's-length contract?
(a) The value of oil under this section for royalty purposes is the gross proceeds accruing to you or your affiliate under the arm's-length contract less applicable allowances determined under § 1206.111 or § 1206.112. This value does not apply if you exercise an option to use a different value provided in paragraph (c)(1) or (c)(2)(i) of this section or if ONRR decides to value your oil under § 1206.105. You must use this paragraph (a) to value oil when:
(1) You sell under an arm's-length sales contract; OR
(2) You sell or transfer to your affiliate or another person under a non-arm's-length contract and that affiliate or person, or another affiliate of either of them, then sells the oil under an arm's-length contract, unless you exercise the option provided in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section.
(b) If you have multiple arm's-length contracts to sell oil produced from a lease that is valued under paragraph (a) of this section, the value of the oil is the volume-weighted average of the values established under this section for each contract for the sale of oil produced from that lease.
(c)(1) If you enter into an arm's-length exchange agreement, or multiple sequential arm's-length exchange
agreements, and following the exchange(s) that you or your affiliate sell(s) the oil received in the exchange(s) under an arm's-length contract, then you may use either paragraph (a) of this section or § 1206.102 to value your production for royalty purposes. If you fail to make the election required under this paragraph, you may not make a retroactive election, and ONRR may decide your value under § 1206.105.
(i) If you use paragraph (a) of this section, your gross proceeds are the gross proceeds under your or your affiliate's arm's-length sales contract after the exchange(s) occur(s). You must adjust your gross proceeds for any location or quality differential, or other adjustments, that you received or paid under the arm's-length exchange agreement(s). If ONRR determines that any arm's-length exchange agreement does not reflect reasonable location or quality differentials, ONRR may decide your value under § 1206.105. You may not otherwise use the price or differential specified in an arm's-length exchange agreement to value your production.
(ii) When you elect under paragraph (c)(1) of this section to use paragraph (a) of this section or § 1206.102, you must make the same election for all of your production from the same unit, communitization agreement, or lease (if the lease is not part of a unit or communitization agreement) sold under arm's-length contracts following arm's-length exchange agreements. You may not change your election more often than once every two years.
(2)(i) If you sell or transfer your oil production to your affiliate, and that affiliate or another affiliate then sells the oil under an arm's-length contract, you may use either paragraph (a) of this section or § 1206.102 to value your production for royalty purposes.
(ii) When you elect under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section to use paragraph (a) of this section or § 1206.102, you must make the same election for all of your production from the same unit, communitization agreement, or lease (if the lease is not part of a unit or communitization agreement) that your affiliates resell at arm's-length. You may not change your election more often than once every two years.
§ 1206.102
How do I value oil not sold under an arm's-length contract?
This section explains how to value oil that you may not value under § 1206.101 or that you elect under § 1206.101(c)(1) to value under this section, unless ONRR decides to value your oil under 1206.105. First, determine if paragraph (a), (b), or (c) of this section applies to production from your lease, or if you may apply paragraph (d) or (e) of this section with ONRR's approval.
(a)
Production from leases in California or Alaska.
Value is the average of the daily mean ANS spot prices published in any ONRR-approved publication during the trading month most concurrent with the production month. For example, if the production month is June, calculate the average of the daily mean prices using the daily ANS spot prices published in the ONRR-approved publication for all of the business days in June.
(1) To calculate the daily mean spot price, you must average the daily high and low prices for the month in the selected publication.
(2) You must use only the days and corresponding spot prices for which such prices are published.
(3) You must adjust the value for applicable location and quality differentials, and you may adjust it for transportation costs, under § 1206.111.
(4) After you select an ONRR-approved publication, you may not select a different publication more often than once every two years, unless the publication you use is no longer published or ONRR revokes its approval of the publication. If you must change publications, you must begin a new two-year period.
(b)
Production from leases in the Rocky Mountain Region.
This paragraph provides methods and options for valuing your production under different factual situations. You must consistently apply paragraph (b)(2) or (3) of this section to value all of your production from the same unit, communitization agreement, or lease (if the lease or a portion of the lease is not part of a unit or communitization agreement) that you cannot value under § 1206.101
or that you elect under § 1206.101(c)(1) to value under this section.
(1) You may elect to value your oil under either paragraph (b)(2) or (3) of this section. After you select either paragraph (b)(2) or (3) of this section, you may not change to the other method more often than once every two years, unless the method you have been using is no longer applicable and you must apply the other paragraph. If you change methods, you must begin a new two-year period.
(2) Value is the volume-weighted average of the gross proceeds accruing to the seller under your or your affiliate's arm's-length contracts for the purchase or sale of production from the field or area during the production month.
(i) The total volume purchased or sold under those contracts must exceed 50 percent of your and your affiliate's production from both Federal and non-Federal leases in the same field or area during that month.
(ii) Before calculating the volume-weighted average, you must normalize the quality of the oil in your or your affiliate's arm's-length purchases or sales to the same gravity as that of the oil produced from the lease.
(3) Value is the NYMEX price (without the roll), adjusted for applicable location and quality differentials and transportation costs under § 1206.113.
(4) If you demonstrate to ONRR's satisfaction that paragraphs (b)(2) through (3) of this section result in an unreasonable value for your production as a result of circumstances regarding that production, ONRR's Director may establish an alternative valuation method.
(c)
Production from leases not located in California, Alaska, or the Rocky Mountain Region.
(1) Value is the NYMEX price, plus the roll, adjusted for applicable location and quality differentials and transportation costs under § 1206.113.
(2) If ONRR's Director determines that the use of the roll no longer reflects prevailing industry practice in crude oil sales contracts or that the most common formula that industry uses to calculate the roll changes, ONRR may terminate or modify the use of the roll under paragraph (c)(1) of this section at the end of each two-year period as of January 1, 2017, through a notice published in the
Federal Register
not later than 60 days before the end of the two-year period. ONRR will explain the rationale for terminating or modifying the use of the roll in this notice.
(d)
Unreasonable value.
If ONRR determines that the NYMEX price or ANS spot price does not represent a reasonable royalty value in any particular case, ONRR may decide to value your oil under § 1206.105.
(e)
Production delivered to your refinery and the NYMEX price or ANS spot price is an unreasonable value.
If ONRR determines that the NYMEX price or ANS spot price does not represent a reasonable royalty value in any particular case, ONRR may decide to value your oil under § 1206.105.
§ 1206.103
What publications does ONRR approve?
(a) ONRR will periodically publish on
www.onrr.gov
a list of ONRR-approved publications for the NYMEX price and ANS spot price based on certain criteria including, but not limited to:
(1) Publications buyers and sellers frequently use.
(2) Publications frequently mentioned in purchase or sales contracts.
(3) Publications that use adequate survey techniques, including development of estimates based on daily surveys of buyers and sellers of crude oil, and, for ANS spot prices, buyers and sellers of ANS crude oil.
(4) Publications independent from ONRR, other lessors, and lessees.
(b) Any publication may petition ONRR to be added to the list of acceptable publications.
(c) ONRR will specify the tables that you must use in the acceptable publications.
(d) ONRR may revoke its approval of a particular publication if we determine that the prices or differentials published in the publication do not accurately represent NYMEX prices or differentials or ANS spot market prices or differentials.
§ 1206.104
How will ONRR determine if my royalty payments are correct?
(a)(1) ONRR may monitor, review, and audit the royalties that you report, and, if ONRR determines that your reported value is inconsistent with the requirements of this subpart, ONRR may direct you to use a different measure of royalty value or decide your value under § 1206.105.
(2) If ONRR directs you to use a different royalty value, you must either pay any additional royalties due, plus late payment interest calculated under §§ 1218.54 and 1218.102 of this chapter), or report a credit for—or request a refund of—any overpaid royalties.
(b) When the provisions in this subpart refer to gross proceeds, in conducting reviews and audits, ONRR will examine if your or your affiliate's contract reflects the total consideration actually transferred, either directly or indirectly, from the buyer to you or to your affiliate for the oil. If ONRR determines that a contract does not reflect the total consideration, ONRR may decide your value under § 1206.105.
(c) ONRR may decide your value under § 1206.105 if ONRR determines that the gross proceeds accruing to you or your affiliate under a contract do not reflect reasonable consideration because:
(1) There is misconduct by or between the contracting parties; or
(2) You have breached your duty to market the oil for the mutual benefit of yourself and the lessor by selling your oil at a value that is unreasonably low. ONRR may consider a sales price to be unreasonably low if it is 10 percent less than the lowest reasonable measures of market price including—but not limited to—index prices and prices reported to ONRR for like quality oil; or
(3) ONRR cannot determine if you properly valued your oil under § 1206.101 or § 1206.102 for any reason including—but not limited to—your or your affiliate's failure to provide documents that ONRR requests under 30 CFR part 1212, subpart B.
(d) You have the burden of demonstrating that your or your affiliate's contract is arm's-length.
(e) ONRR may require you to certify that the provisions in your or your affiliate's contract include all of the consideration that the buyer paid to you or your affiliate, either directly or indirectly, for the oil.
(f)(1) Absent contract revision or amendment, if you or your affiliate fail(s) to take proper or timely action to receive prices or benefits to which you or your affiliate are entitled, you must pay royalty based upon that obtainable price or benefit.
(2) If you or your affiliate apply in a timely manner for a price increase or benefit allowed under your or your affiliate's contract, but the purchaser refuses and you or your affiliate take reasonable documented measures to force purchaser compliance, you will not owe additional royalties unless or until you or your affiliate receive additional monies or consideration resulting from the price increase. You may not construe this paragraph to permit you to avoid your royalty payment obligation in situations where a purchaser fails to pay, in whole or in part or in a timely manner, for a quantity of oil.
(g)(1) You or your affiliate must make all contracts, contract revisions, or amendments in writing, and all parties to the contract must sign the contract, contract revisions, or amendments.
(2) If you or your affiliate fail(s) to comply with paragraph (g)(1) of this section, ONRR may determine your value under § 1206.105.
(3) This provision applies notwithstanding any other provisions in this title 30 to the contrary.
§ 1206.105
How will ONRR determine the value of my oil for royalty purposes?
If ONRR decides that we will value your oil for royalty purposes under § 1206.104, or any other provision in this subpart, then we will determine value, for royalty purposes, by considering any information that we deem relevant, which may include, but is not limited to, the following:
(a) The value of like-quality oil in the same field or nearby fields or areas
(b) The value of like-quality oil from the refinery or area
(c) Public sources of price or market information that ONRR deems reliable
(d) Information available and reported to ONRR, including but not limited to on form ONRR-2014 and the Oil and Gas Operations Report (Form ONRR-4054)
(e) Costs of transportation or processing if ONRR determines that they are applicable
(f) Any information that ONRR deems relevant regarding the particular lease operation or the salability of the oil
§ 1206.106
What records must I keep to support my calculations of value under this subpart?
If you determine the value of your oil under this subpart, you must retain all data relevant to the determination of royalty value.
(a) You must show both of the following:
(1) How you calculated the value that you reported, including all adjustments for location, quality, and transportation.
(2) How you complied with these rules.
(b) You can find recordkeeping requirements in parts 1207 and 1212 of this chapter.
(c) ONRR may review and audit your data, and ONRR will direct you to use a different value if we determine that the reported value is inconsistent with the requirements of this subpart.
§ 1206.107
What are my responsibilities to place production into marketable condition and to market production?
(a) You must place oil in marketable condition and market the oil for the mutual benefit of the lessee and the lessor at no cost to the Federal government.
(b) If you use gross proceeds under an arm's-length contract in determining value, you must increase those gross proceeds to the extent that the purchaser, or any other person, provides certain services that the seller normally would be responsible to perform to place the oil in marketable condition or to market the oil.
§ 1206.108
How do I request a valuation determination?
(a) You may request a valuation determination from ONRR regarding any oil produced. Your request must:
(1) Be in writing;
(2) Identify, specifically, all leases involved, all interest owners of those leases, the designee(s), and the operator(s) for those leases;
(3) Completely explain all relevant facts; you must inform ONRR of any changes to relevant facts that occur before we respond to your request;
(4) Include copies of all relevant documents;
(5) Provide your analysis of the issue(s), including citations to all relevant precedents (including adverse precedents); and
(6) Suggest your proposed valuation method.
(b) In response to your request, ONRR may:
(1) Request that the Assistant Secretary for Policy, Management and Budget issue a valuation determination;
(2) Decide that ONRR will issue guidance; or
(3) Inform you in writing that ONRR will not provide a determination or guidance. Situations in which ONRR typically will not provide any determination or guidance include, but are not limited to, the following:
(i) Requests for guidance on hypothetical situations
(ii) Matters that are the subject of pending litigation or administrative appeals
(c)(1) A valuation determination that the Assistant Secretary for Policy, Management and Budget signs is binding on both you and ONRR until the Assistant Secretary modifies or rescinds it.
(2) After the Assistant Secretary issues a valuation determination, you must make any adjustments to royalty payments that follow from the determination and, if you owe additional royalties, you must pay the additional royalties due, plus late payment interest calculated under §§ 1218.54 and 1218.102 of this chapter.
(3) A valuation determination that the Assistant Secretary signs is the final action of the Department and is
subject to judicial review under 5 U.S.C. 701-706.
(d) Guidance that ONRR issues is not binding on ONRR, delegated States, or you with respect to the specific situation addressed in the guidance.
(1) Guidance and ONRR's decision whether or not to issue guidance or request an Assistant Secretary determination, or neither, under paragraph (b) of this section, are not appealable decisions or orders under 30 CFR part 1290.
(2) If you receive an order requiring you to pay royalty on the same basis as the guidance, you may appeal that order under 30 CFR part 1290.
(e) ONRR or the Assistant Secretary may use any of the applicable valuation criteria in this subpart to provide guidance or to make a determination.
(f) A change in an applicable statute or regulation on which ONRR or the Assistant Secretary based any determination or guidance takes precedence over the determination or guidance, regardless of whether ONRR or the Assistant Secretary modifies or rescinds the determination or guidance.
(g) ONRR or the Assistant Secretary generally will not retroactively modify or rescind a valuation determination issued under paragraph (d) of this section, unless:
(1) There was a misstatement or omission of material facts; or
(2) The facts subsequently developed are materially different from the facts on which the guidance was based.
(h) ONRR may make requests and replies under this section available to the public, subject to the confidentiality requirements under § 1206.109.
§ 1206.109
Does ONRR protect information that I provide?
(a) Certain information that you or your affiliate submit(s) to ONRR regarding valuation of oil, including transportation allowances, may be exempt from disclosure.
(b) To the extent that applicable laws and regulations permit, ONRR will keep confidential any data that you or your affiliate submit(s) that is privileged, confidential, or otherwise exempt from disclosure.
(c) You and others must submit all requests for information under the Freedom of Information Act regulations of the Department of the Interior at 43 CFR part 2.
§ 1206.110
What general transportation allowance requirements apply to me?
(a) ONRR will allow a deduction for the reasonable, actual costs to transport oil from the lease to the point off of the lease under § 1206.110, § 1206.111, or § 1206.112, as applicable. You may not deduct transportation costs that you incur to move a particular volume of production to reduce royalties that you owe on production for which you did not incur those costs. This paragraph applies when:
(1)(i) The movement to the sales point is not gathering;
(ii) For oil produced on the OCS, the movement of oil from the wellhead to the first platform is not transportation; and
(2) You value oil under § 1206.101 based on a sale at a point off of the lease, unit, or communitized area where the oil is produced; or
(3) You do not value your oil under § 1206.102(a)(3) or (b)(3).
(b) You must calculate the deduction for transportation costs based on your or your affiliate's cost of transporting each product through each individual transportation system. If your or your affiliate's transportation contract includes more than one liquid product, you must allocate costs consistently and equitably to each of the liquid products that are transported. Your allocation must use the same proportion as the ratio of the volume of each liquid product (excluding waste products with no value) to the volume of all liquid products (excluding waste products with no value).
(1) You may not take an allowance for transporting lease production that is not royalty-bearing.
(2) You may propose to ONRR a prospective cost allocation method based on the values of the liquid products transported. ONRR will approve the method if it is consistent with the purposes of the regulations in this subpart.
(3) You may use your proposed procedure to calculate a transportation allowance beginning with the production
month following the month when ONRR received your proposed procedure until ONRR accepts or rejects your cost allocation. If ONRR rejects your cost allocation, you must amend your form ONRR-2014 for the months that you used the rejected method and pay any additional royalty due, plus late payment interest.
(c)(1) Where you or your affiliate transport(s) both gaseous and liquid products through the same transportation system, you must propose a cost allocation procedure to ONRR.
(2) You may use your proposed procedure to calculate a transportation allowance until ONRR accepts or rejects your cost allocation. If ONRR rejects your cost allocation, you must amend your form ONRR-2014 for the months when you used the rejected method and pay any additional royalty and interest due.
(3) You must submit your initial proposal, including all available data, within three months after you first claim the allocated deductions on form ONRR-2014.
(d)(1) Your transportation allowance may not exceed 50 percent of the value of the oil, as determined under § 1206.101 of this subpart.
(2) If ONRR approved your request to take a transportation allowance in excess of the 50-percent limitation under former § 1206.109(c), that approval is terminated as of January 1, 2017.
(e) You must express transportation allowances for oil as a dollar-value equivalent. If your or your affiliate's payments for transportation under a contract are not on a dollar-per-unit basis, you must convert whatever consideration you or your affiliate are paid to a dollar-value equivalent.
(f) ONRR may determine your transportation allowance under § 1206.105 because:
(1) There is misconduct by or between the contracting parties;
(2) ONRR determines that the consideration that you or your affiliate paid under an arm's-length transportation contract does not reflect the reasonable cost of the transportation because you breached your duty to market the oil for the mutual benefit of yourself and the lessor by transporting your oil at a cost that is unreasonably high. We may consider a transportation allowance to be unreasonably high if it is 10 percent higher than the highest reasonable measures of transportation costs including, but not limited to, transportation allowances reported to ONRR and tariffs for gas, residue gas, or gas plant product transported through the same system; or
(3) ONRR cannot determine if you properly calculated a transportation allowance under § 1206.111 or § 1206.112 for any reason, including, but not limited to, your or your affiliate's failure to provide documents that ONRR requests under 30 CFR part 1212, subpart B.
(g) You do not need ONRR's approval before reporting a transportation allowance.
§ 1206.111
How do I determine a transportation allowance if I have an arm's-length transportation contract?
(a)(1) If you or your affiliate incur transportation costs under an arm's-length transportation contract, you may claim a transportation allowance for the reasonable, actual costs incurred, as more fully explained in paragraph (b) of this section, except as provided in § 1206.110(f) and subject to the limitation in § 1206.110(d).
(2) You must be able to demonstrate that your or your affiliate's contract is at arm's-length.
(3) You do not need ONRR's approval before reporting a transportation allowance for costs incurred under an arm's-length transportation contract.
(b) Subject to the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section, you may include, but are not limited to, the following costs to determine your transportation allowance under paragraph (a) of this section; you may not use any cost as a deduction that duplicates all or part of any other cost that you use under this section including, but not limited to:
(1) The amount that you pay under your arm's-length transportation contract or tariff.
(2) Fees paid (either in volume or in value) for actual or theoretical line losses.
(3) Fees paid for administration of a quality bank.
(4) Fees paid to a terminal operator for loading and unloading of crude oil into or from a vessel, vehicle, pipeline, or other conveyance.
(5) Fees paid for short-term storage (30 days or less) incidental to transportation as a transporter requires.
(6) Fees paid to pump oil to another carrier's system or vehicles as required under a tariff.
(7) Transfer fees paid to a hub operator associated with physical movement of crude oil through the hub when you do not sell the oil at the hub. These fees do not include title transfer fees.
(8) Payments for a volumetric deduction to cover shrinkage when high-gravity petroleum (generally in excess of 51 degrees API) is mixed with lower gravity crude oil for transportation.
(9) Costs of securing a letter of credit, or other surety, that the pipeline requires you, as a shipper, to maintain.
(10) Hurricane surcharges that you or your affiliate actually pay(s).
(11) The cost of carrying on your books as inventory a volume of oil that the pipeline operator requires you, as a shipper, to maintain and that you do maintain in the line as line fill. You must calculate this cost as follows:
(i) First, multiply the volume that the pipeline requires you to maintain—and that you do maintain—in the pipeline by the value of that volume for the current month calculated under § 1206.101 or § 1206.102, as applicable.
(ii) Second, multiply the value calculated under paragraph (b)(11)(i) of this section by the monthly rate of return, calculated by dividing the rate of return specified in § 1206.112(i)(3) by 12.
(c) You may not include the following costs to determine your transportation allowance under paragraph (a) of this section:
(1) Fees paid for long-term storage (more than 30 days)
(2) Administrative, handling, and accounting fees associated with terminalling
(3) Title and terminal transfer fees
(4) Fees paid to track and match receipts and deliveries at a market center or to avoid paying title transfer fees
(5) Fees paid to brokers
(6) Fees paid to a scheduling service provider
(7) Internal costs, including salaries and related costs, rent/space costs, office equipment costs, legal fees, and other costs to schedule, nominate, and account for sale or movement of production
(8) Gauging fees
(d) If you have no written contract for the arm's-length transportation of oil, then ONRR will determine your transportation allowance under § 1206.105. You may not use this paragraph (d) if you or your affiliate perform(s) your own transportation.
(1) You must propose to ONRR a method to determine the allowance using the procedures in § 1206.108(a).
(2) You may use that method to determine your allowance until ONRR issues its determination.
§ 1206.112
How do I determine a transportation allowance if I do not have an arm's-length transportation contract?
(a) This section applies if you or your affiliate do(es) not have an arm's-length transportation contract, including situations where you or your affiliate provide your own transportation services. You must calculate your transportation allowance based on your or your affiliate's reasonable, actual costs for transportation during the reporting period using the procedures prescribed in this section.
(b) Your or your affiliate's actual costs may include the following:
(1) Capital costs and operating and maintenance expenses under paragraphs (e), (f), and (g) of this section.
(2) Overhead under paragraph (h) of this section.
(3)(i) Depreciation and a return on undepreciated capital investment under paragraph (i)(1) of this section, or you may elect to use a cost equal to a return on the initial depreciable capital investment in the transportation system under paragraph (i)(2) of this section. After you have elected to use either method for a transportation system, you may not later elect to change to the other alternative without ONRR's approval. If ONRR accepts your request to change methods, you
may use your changed method beginning with the production month following the month when ONRR received your change request.
(ii) A return on the reasonable salvage value under paragraph (i)(1)(iii) of this section after you have depreciated the transportation system to its reasonable salvage value.
(c) To the extent not included in costs identified in paragraphs (e) through (h) of this section.
(1) If you or your affiliate incur(s) the following actual costs under your or your affiliate's non-arm's-length contract, you may include these costs in your calculations under this section:
(i) Fees paid to a non-affiliated terminal operator for loading and unloading of crude oil into or from a vessel, vehicle, pipeline, or other conveyance
(ii) Transfer fees paid to a hub operator associated with physical movement of crude oil through the hub when you do not sell the oil at the hub; these fees do not include title transfer fees
(iii) A volumetric deduction to cover shrinkage when high-gravity petroleum (generally in excess of 51 degrees API) is mixed with lower gravity crude oil for transportation
(iv) Fees paid to a non-affiliated quality bank administrator for administration of a quality bank
(v) The cost of carrying on your books as inventory a volume of oil that the pipeline operator requires you, as a shipper, to maintain—and that you do maintain—in the line as line fill; you must calculate this cost as follows:
(A) First, multiply the volume that the pipeline requires you to maintain—and that you do maintain—in the pipeline by the value of that volume for the current month calculated under § 1206.101 or § 1206.102, as applicable.
(B) Second, multiply the value calculated under paragraph (c)(1)(v)(A) of this section by the monthly rate of return, calculated by dividing the rate of return specified in paragraph (i)(3) of this section by 12.
(2) You may not include in your transportation allowance:
(i) Any of the costs identified under § 1206.111(c); and/or
(ii) Fees paid (either in volume or in value) for actual or theoretical line losses.
(d) You may not use any cost as a deduction that duplicates all or part of any other cost that you use under this section.
(e) Allowable capital investment costs are generally those for depreciable fixed assets (including the costs of delivery and installation of capital equipment) that are an integral part of the transportation system.
(f) Allowable operating expenses include the following:
(1) Operations supervision and engineering
(2) Operations labor
(3) Fuel
(4) Utilities
(5) Materials
(6) Ad valorem property taxes

(1) Maintenance of the transportation system
(2) Maintenance of equipment
(3) Maintenance labor
(4) Other directly allocable and attributable maintenance expenses that you can document
(h) Overhead, directly attributable and allocable to the operation and maintenance of the transportation system, is an allowable expense. State and Federal income taxes and severance taxes and other fees, including royalties, are not allowable expenses.
(i)(1) To calculate depreciation and a return on undepreciated capital investment, you may elect to use either a straight-line depreciation method (based on the life of equipment or on the life of the reserves that the transportation system services), or you may elect to use a unit-of-production method. After you make an election, you may not change methods without ONRR's approval. If ONRR accepts your request to change methods, you may use your changed method beginning with the production month following the month when ONRR received your change request.
(i) A change in ownership of a transportation system will not alter the depreciation schedule that the original transporter/lessee established for purposes of the allowance calculation.
(ii) You may depreciate a transportation system, with or without a change in ownership, only once.
(iii)(A) To calculate the return on undepreciated capital investment, you may use an amount equal to the undepreciated capital investment in the transportation system multiplied by the rate of return that you determine under paragraph (i)(3) of this section.
(B) After you have depreciated a transportation system to the reasonable salvage value, you may continue to include in the allowance calculation a cost equal to the reasonable salvage value multiplied by a rate of return under paragraph (i)(3) of this section.
(2) As an alternative to using depreciation and a return on undepreciated capital investment, as provided under paragraph (b)(3) of this section, you may use as a cost an amount equal to the allowable initial capital investment in the transportation system multiplied by the rate of return determined under paragraph (i)(3) of this section. You may not include depreciation in your allowance.
(3) The rate of return is the industrial rate associated with Standard
Poor's BBB rating.
(i) You must use the monthly average BBB rate that Standard
Poor's publishes for the first month for which the allowance is applicable.
(ii) You must re-determine the rate at the beginning of each subsequent calendar year.
§ 1206.113
What adjustments and transportation allowances apply when I value oil production from my lease using NYMEX prices or ANS spot prices?
This section applies when you use NYMEX prices or ANS spot prices to calculate the value of production under § 1206.102. As specified in this section, you must adjust the NYMEX price to reflect the difference in value between your lease and Cushing, Oklahoma, or adjust the ANS spot price to reflect the difference in value between your lease and the appropriate ONRR-recognized market center at which the ANS spot price is published (for example, Long Beach, California, or San Francisco, California). Paragraph (a) of this section explains how you adjust the value between the lease and the market center, and paragraph (b) of this section explains how you adjust the value between the market center and Cushing when you use NYMEX prices. Paragraph (c) of this section explains how adjustments may be made for quality differentials that are not accounted for through exchange agreements. Paragraph (d) of this section gives some examples. References in this section to “you” include your affiliates, as applicable.
(a) To adjust the value between the lease and the market center:
(1)(i) For oil that you exchange at arm's-length between your lease and the market center (or between any intermediate points between those locations), you must calculate a lease-to-market center differential by the applicable location and quality differentials derived from your arm's-length exchange agreement applicable to production during the production month.
(ii) For oil that you exchange between your lease and the market center (or between any intermediate points between those locations) under an exchange agreement that is not at arm's-length, you must obtain approval from ONRR for a location and quality differential. Until you obtain such approval, you may use the location and quality differential derived from that exchange agreement applicable to production during the production month. If ONRR prescribes a different differential, you must apply ONRR's differential to all periods for which you used your proposed differential. You must pay any additional royalties due resulting from using ONRR's differential, plus late payment interest from the original royalty due date, or you may report a credit for any overpaid royalties, plus interest, under 30 U.S.C. 1721(h).
(2) For oil that you transport between your lease and the market center (or between any intermediate points between those locations), you may take an allowance for the cost of
transporting that oil between the relevant points, as determined under § 1206.111 or 1206.112, as applicable.
(3) If you transport or exchange at arm's-length (or both transport and exchange) at least 20 percent—but not all—of your oil produced from the lease to a market center, you must determine the adjustment between the lease and the market center for the oil that is not transported or exchanged (or both transported and exchanged) to or through a market center as follows:
(i) Determine the volume-weighted average of the lease-to-market center adjustment calculated under paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section for the oil that you do transport or exchange (or both transport and exchange) from your lease to a market center.
(ii) Use that volume-weighted average lease-to-market center adjustment as the adjustment for the oil that you do not transport or exchange (or both transport and exchange) from your lease to a market center.
(4) If you transport or exchange (or both transport and exchange) less than 20 percent of the crude oil produced from your lease between the lease and a market center, you must propose to ONRR an adjustment between the lease and the market center for the portion of the oil that you do not transport or exchange (or both transport and exchange) to a market center. Until you obtain such approval, you may use your proposed adjustment. If ONRR prescribes a different adjustment, you must apply ONRR's adjustment to all periods for which you used your proposed adjustment. You must pay any additional royalties due resulting from using ONRR's adjustment, plus late payment interest from the original royalty due date, or you may report a credit for any overpaid royalties plus interest under 30 U.S.C. 1721(h).
(5) You may not both take a transportation allowance and use a location and quality adjustment or exchange differential for the same oil between the same points.
(b) For oil that you value using NYMEX prices, you must adjust the value between the market center and Cushing, Oklahoma, as follows:
(1) If you have arm's-length exchange agreements between the market center and Cushing under which you exchange to Cushing at least 20 percent of all of the oil that you own at the market center during the production month, you must use the volume-weighted average of the location and quality differentials from those agreements as the adjustment between the market center and Cushing for all of the oil that you produce from the leases during that production month for which that market center is used.
(2) If paragraph (b)(1) of this section does not apply, you must use the WTI differential published in an ONRR-approved publication for the market center nearest to your lease, for crude oil most similar in quality to your production, as the adjustment between the market center and Cushing. For example, for light sweet crude oil produced offshore of Louisiana, you must use the WTI differential for Light Louisiana Sweet crude oil at St. James, Louisiana. After you select an ONRR-approved publication, you may not select a different publication more often than once every two years, unless the publication you use is no longer published or ONRR revokes its approval of the publication. If you must change publications, you must begin a new two-year period.
(3) If neither paragraph (b)(1) nor (2) of this section applies, you may propose an alternative differential to ONRR. Until you obtain such approval, you may use your proposed differential. If ONRR prescribes a different differential, you must apply ONRR's differential to all periods for which you used your proposed differential. You must pay any additional royalties due resulting from using ONRR's differential, plus late payment interest from the original royalty due date, or you may report a credit for any overpaid royalties plus interest under 30 U.S.C. 1721(h).
(c)(1) If you adjust for location and quality differentials or for transportation costs under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, you also must adjust the NYMEX price or ANS spot price for quality based on premiums or penalties determined by pipeline quality bank
specifications at intermediate commingling points or at the market center if those points are downstream of the royalty measurement point that BSEE or BLM, as applicable, approve. You must make this adjustment only if, and to the extent that, such adjustments were not already included in the location and quality differentials determined from your arm's-length exchange agreements.
(2) If the quality of your oil, as adjusted, is still different from the quality of the representative crude oil at the market center after making the quality adjustments described in paragraphs (a), (b), and (c)(1) of this section, you may make further gravity adjustments using posted price gravity tables. If quality bank adjustments do not incorporate or provide for adjustments for sulfur content, you may make sulfur adjustments, based on the quality of the representative crude oil at the market center, of 5.0 cents per one-tenth percent difference in sulfur content.
(i) You may request prior ONRR approval to use a different adjustment.
(ii) If ONRR approves your request to use a different quality adjustment, you may begin using that adjustment for the production month following the month when ONRR received your request.
(d) The examples in this paragraph illustrate how to apply the requirement of this section.
(1)
Example 1.
Assume that a Federal lessee produces crude oil from a lease near Artesia, New Mexico. Further, assume that the lessee transports the oil to Roswell, New Mexico, and then exchanges the oil to Midland, Texas. Assume that the lessee refines the oil received in exchange at Midland. Assume that the NYMEX price is $86.21/bbl, adjusted for the roll; that the WTI differential (Cushing to Midland) is−$2.27/bbl; that the lessee's exchange agreement between Roswell and Midland results in a location and quality differential of−$0.08/bbl; and that the lessee's actual cost of transporting the oil from Artesia to Roswell is $0.40/bbl. In this example, the royalty value of the oil is $86.21−$2.27−$0.08−$0.40 = $83.46/bbl.
(2)
Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in the example in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, except that the lessee transports and exchanges to Midland 40 percent of the production from the lease near Artesia and transports the remaining 60 percent directly to its own refinery in Ohio. In this example, the 40 percent of the production would be valued at $83.46/bbl, as explained in the previous example. In this example, the other 60 percent also would be valued at $83.46/bbl.
(3)
Example 3.
Assume that a Federal lessee produces crude oil from a lease near Bakersfield, California. Further, assume that the lessee transports the oil to Hynes Station and then exchanges the oil to Cushing, which it further exchanges with oil that it refines. Assume that the ANS spot price is $105.65/bbl and that the lessee's actual cost of transporting the oil from Bakersfield to Hynes Station is $0.28/bbl. The lessee must request approval from ONRR for a location and quality adjustment between Hynes Station and Long Beach. For example, the lessee likely would propose using the tariff on Line 63 from Hynes Station to Long Beach as the adjustment between those points. Assume that adjustment to be $0.72, including the sulfur and gravity bank adjustments, and that ONRR approves the lessee's request. In this example, the preliminary (because the location and quality adjustment is subject to ONRR's review) royalty value of the oil is $105.65 −$0.72 −$0.28 = $104.65/bbl. The fact that oil was exchanged to Cushing does not change the use of ANS spot prices for royalty valuation.

§ 1206.117
What interest and penalties apply if I improperly report a transportation allowance?
(a) If you deduct a transportation allowance on form ONRR-2014 that exceeds 50 percent of the value of the oil transported, you must pay additional royalties due, plus late payment interest calculated under §§ 1218.54 and 1218.102 of this chapter, on the excess allowance amount taken from the date when that amount is taken to the date when you pay the additional royalties due.
(b) If you improperly net a transportation allowance against the oil instead of reporting the allowance as a separate entry on form ONRR-2014, ONRR may assess a civil penalty under 30 CFR part 1241.
§ 1206.118
What reporting adjustments must I make for transportation allowances?
(a) If your actual transportation allowance is less than the amount that you claimed on form ONRR-2014 for each month during the allowance reporting period, you must pay additional royalties due, plus late payment interest calculated under §§ 1218.54 and 1218.102 of this chapter from the date when you took the deduction to the date when you repay the difference.
(b) If the actual transportation allowance is greater than the amount that you claimed on form ONRR-2014 for any month during the period reported on the allowance form, you are entitled to a credit plus interest.
§ 1206.119
How do I determine royalty quantity and quality?
(a) You must calculate royalties based on the quantity and quality of oil as measured at the point of royalty settlement that BLM or BSEE approves for onshore leases and OCS leases, respectively.
(b) If you base the value of oil determined under this subpart on a quantity and/or quality that is different from the quantity and/or quality at the point of royalty settlement that BLM or BSEE approves, you must adjust that value for the differences in quantity and/or quality.
(c) You may not make any deductions from the royalty volume or royalty value for actual or theoretical losses. Any actual loss that you sustain before the royalty settlement metering or measurement point is not subject to royalty if BLM or BSEE, whichever is appropriate, determines that such loss was unavoidable.
(d) You must pay royalties on 100 percent of the volume measured at the approved point of royalty settlement. You may not claim a reduction in that measured volume for actual losses beyond the approved point of royalty settlement or for theoretical losses that you claim to have taken place either before or after the approved point of royalty settlement.

# Subpart D—Federal Gas

# Source:
85 FR 62030, Oct. 1, 2020, unless otherwise noted.
§ 1206.140
What is the purpose and scope of this subpart?
(a) This subpart applies to all gas produced from Federal oil and gas leases onshore and on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS). It explains how you, as a lessee, must calculate the value of production for royalty purposes consistent with mineral leasing laws, other applicable laws, and lease terms.
(b) The terms “you” and “your” in this subpart refer to the lessee.
(c) If the regulations in this subpart are inconsistent with a(an): Federal statute; settlement agreement between the United States and a lessee resulting from administrative or judicial litigation; written agreement between the lessee and ONRR's Director establishing a method to determine the value of production from any lease that ONRR expects would at least approximate the value established under this subpart; express provision of an oil and gas lease subject to this subpart, then the statute, settlement agreement, written agreement, or lease provision will govern to the extent of the inconsistency.
(d) ONRR may audit and order you to adjust all royalty payments.
§ 1206.141
How do I calculate royalty value for unprocessed gas that I or my affiliate sell(s) under an arm's-length or non-arm's-length contract?
(a) This section applies to unprocessed gas. Unprocessed gas is:
(1) Gas that is not processed;
(2) Any gas that you are not required to value under § 1206.142 or that ONRR does not value under § 1206.144; or
(3) Any gas that you sell prior to processing based on a price per MMBtu or Mcf when the price is not based on the residue gas and gas plant products.
(b) The value of gas under this section for royalty purposes is the gross proceeds accruing to you or your affiliate under the first arm's-length contract less a transportation allowance determined under § 1206.152. This value does not apply if you exercise the option in paragraph (c) of this section or if ONRR decides to value your gas under § 1206.144. You must use this paragraph (b) to value gas when:
(1) You sell under an arm's-length contract;
(2) You sell or transfer unprocessed gas to your affiliate or another person under a non-arm's-length contract and that affiliate or person, or an affiliate of either of them, then sells the gas under an arm's-length contract, unless you exercise the option provided in paragraph (c) of this section;
(3) You, your affiliate, or another person sell(s) unprocessed gas produced from a lease under multiple arm's-length contracts, and that gas is valued under this paragraph. Unless you exercise the option provided in paragraph (c) of this section, the value of the gas is the volume-weighted average of the values, established under this paragraph, for each contract for the sale of gas produced from that lease; or
(4) You or your affiliate sell(s) under a pipeline cash-out program. In that case, for over-delivered volumes within the tolerance under a pipeline cash-out program, the value is the price that the pipeline must pay you or your affiliate under the transportation contract. You must use the same value for volumes that exceed the over-delivery tolerances, even if those volumes are subject to a lower price under the transportation contract.
(c) If you do not sell under an arm's-length contract, you may elect to value your gas under this paragraph (c). You may not change your election more often than once every two years.
(1)(i) If you can only transport gas to one index pricing point published in an ONRR-approved publication, available
at
www.onrr.gov
, your value, for royalty purposes, is the highest reported monthly bidweek price for that index pricing point for the production month.
(ii) If you can transport gas to more than one index pricing point published in an ONRR-approved publication available at
www.onrr.gov
, your value, for royalty purposes, is the highest reported monthly bidweek price for the index pricing points to which your gas could be transported for the production month, whether or not there are constraints for that production month.
(iii) If there are sequential index pricing points on a pipeline, you must use the first index pricing point at or after your gas enters the pipeline.
(iv) You must reduce the number calculated under paragraphs (c)(1)(i) and (c)(1)(ii) of this section by 5 percent for sales from the OCS Gulf of Mexico and by 10 percent for sales from all other areas, but not by less than 10 cents per MMBtu or more than 30 cents per MMBtu.
(v) After you select an ONRR-approved publication available at
www.onrr.gov
, you may not select a different publication more often than once every two years.
(vi) ONRR may exclude an individual index pricing point found in an ONRR-approved publication if ONRR determines that the index pricing point does not accurately reflect the values of production. ONRR will publish a list of excluded index pricing points available at
www.onrr.gov
.
(2) You may not take any other deductions from the value calculated under this paragraph (c).
(d) If some of your gas is used, lost, unaccounted for, or retained as a fee under the terms of a sales or service agreement, that gas will be valued for royalty purposes using the same royalty valuation method for valuing the rest of the gas that you do sell.
(e) If you have no written contract for the sale of gas or no sale of gas subject to this section and:
(1) There is an index pricing point for the gas, then you must value your gas under paragraph (c) of this section; or
(2) There is not an index pricing point for the gas, then ONRR will decide the value under § 1206.144.
(i) You must propose to ONRR a method to determine the value using the procedures in § 1206.148(a).
(ii) You may use that method to determine value, for royalty purposes, until ONRR issues our decision.
(iii) After ONRR issues our determination, you must make the adjustments under § 1206.143(a)(2).
§ 1206.142
How do I calculate royalty value for processed gas that I or my affiliate sell(s) under an arm's-length or non-arm's-length contract?
(a) This section applies to the valuation of processed gas, including but not limited to:
(1) Gas that you or your affiliate do not sell, or otherwise dispose of, under an arm's-length contract prior to processing.
(2) Gas where your or your affiliate's arm's-length contract for the sale of gas prior to processing provides for payment to be determined on the basis of the value of any products resulting from processing, including residue gas or natural gas liquids.
(3) Gas that you or your affiliate process under an arm's-length keepwhole contract.
(4) Gas where your or your affiliate's arm's-length contract includes a reservation of the right to process the gas, and you or your affiliate exercise(s) that right.
(b) The value of gas subject to this section, for royalty purposes, is the combined value of the residue gas and all gas plant products that you determine under this section plus the value of any condensate recovered downstream of the point of royalty settlement without resorting to processing that you determine under subpart C of this part less applicable transportation and processing allowances that you determine under this subpart, unless you exercise the option provided in paragraph (d) of this section.
(c) The value of residue gas or any gas plant product under this section for royalty purposes is the gross proceeds accruing to you or your affiliate under the first arm's-length contract. This value does not apply if you exercise the option provided in paragraph (d) of this section, or if ONRR decides to value
your residue gas or any gas plant product under § 1206.144. You must use this paragraph (c) to value residue gas or any gas plant product when:
(1) You sell under an arm's-length contract;
(2) You sell or transfer to your affiliate or another person under a non-arm's-length contract, and that affiliate or person, or another affiliate of either of them, then sells the residue gas or any gas plant product under an arm's-length contract, unless you exercise the option provided in paragraph (d) of this section;
(3) You, your affiliate, or another person sell(s), under multiple arm's-length contracts, residue gas or any gas plant products recovered from gas produced from a lease that you value under this paragraph. In that case, unless you exercise the option provided in paragraph (d) of this section, because you sold non-arm's-length to your affiliate or another person, the value of the residue gas or any gas plant product is the volume-weighted average of the gross proceeds established under this paragraph for each arm's-length contract for the sale of residue gas or any gas plant products recovered from gas produced from that lease; or
(4) You or your affiliate sell(s) under a pipeline cash-out program. In that case, for over-delivered volumes within the tolerance under a pipeline cash-out program, the value is the price that the pipeline must pay to you or your affiliate under the transportation contract. You must use the same value for volumes that exceed the over-delivery tolerances, even if those volumes are subject to a lower price under the transportation contract.
(d) If you do not sell under an arm's-length contract, you may elect to value your residue gas and NGLs under this paragraph (d). You may not change your election more often than once every two years.
(1)(i) If you can only transport residue gas to one index pricing point published in an ONRR-approved publication available at
www.onrr.gov
, your value, for royalty purposes, is the highest reported monthly bidweek price for that index pricing point for the production month.
(ii) If you can transport residue gas to more than one index pricing point published in an ONRR-approved publication available at
www.onrr.gov
, your value, for royalty purposes, is the highest reported monthly bidweek price for the index pricing points to which your gas could be transported for the production month, whether or not there are constraints, for the production month.
(iii) If there are sequential index pricing points on a pipeline, you must use the first index pricing point at or after your residue gas enters the pipeline.
(iv) You must reduce the number calculated under paragraphs (d)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section by 5 percent for sales from the OCS Gulf of Mexico and by 10 percent for sales from all other areas, but not by less than 10 cents per MMBtu or more than 30 cents per MMBtu.
(v) After you select an ONRR-approved publication available at
www.onrr.gov
, you may not select a different publication more often than once every two years.
(vi) ONRR may exclude an individual index pricing point found in an ONRR-approved publication if ONRR determines that the index pricing point does not accurately reflect the values of production. ONRR will publish a list of excluded index pricing points on
www.onrr.gov
.
(2)(i) If you sell NGLs in an area with one or more ONRR-approved commercial price bulletins available at
www.onrr.gov
, you must choose one bulletin, and your value, for royalty purposes, is the monthly average price for that bulletin for the production month.
(ii) You must reduce the number calculated under paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section by the amounts that ONRR posts at
www.onrr.gov
for the geographic location of your lease. The methodology that ONRR will use to calculate the amounts is set forth in the preamble to this regulation. This methodology is binding on you and ONRR. ONRR will update the amounts periodically using this methodology.
(iii) After you select an ONRR-approved commercial price bulletin available at
www.onrr.gov
, you may not select a different commercial price bulletin more often than once every two years.
(3) You may not take any other deductions from the value calculated under this paragraph (d).
(4) ONRR will post changes to any of the rates in this paragraph (d) on its website.
(e) If some of your gas or gas plant products are used, lost, unaccounted for, or retained as a fee under the terms of a sales or service agreement, that gas will be valued for royalty purposes using the same royalty valuation method for valuing the rest of the gas or gas plant products that you do sell.
(f) If you have no written contract for the sale of gas or no sale of gas subject to this section and:
(1) There is an index pricing point or commercial price bulletin for the gas, then you must value your gas under paragraph (d) of this section.
(2) There is not an index pricing point or commercial price bulletin for the gas, then ONRR will determine the value under § 1206.144.
(i) You must propose to ONRR a method to determine the value using the procedures in § 1206.148(a).
(ii) You may use that method to determine value, for royalty purposes, until ONRR issues our decision.
(iii) After ONRR issues our determination, you must make the adjustments under § 1206.143(a)(2).
§ 1206.143
How will ONRR determine if my royalty payments are correct?
(a)(1) ONRR may monitor, review, and audit the royalties that you report. If ONRR determines that your reported value is inconsistent with the requirements of this subpart, ONRR will direct you to use a different measure of royalty value or decide your value under § 1206.144.
(2) If ONRR directs you to use a different royalty value, you must either pay any additional royalties due, plus late payment interest calculated under §§ 1218.54 and 1218.102 of this chapter, or report a credit for, or request a refund of, any overpaid royalties.
(b) When the provisions in this subpart refer to gross proceeds, in conducting reviews and audits, ONRR will examine if your or your affiliate's contract reflects the total consideration actually transferred, either directly or indirectly, from the buyer to you or your affiliate for the gas, residue gas, or gas plant products. If ONRR determines that a contract does not reflect the total consideration, ONRR may decide your value under § 1206.144.
(c) ONRR may decide your value under § 1206.144 if ONRR determines that the gross proceeds accruing to you or your affiliate under a contract do not reflect reasonable consideration because:
(1) There is misconduct by or between the contracting parties;
(2) You have breached your duty to market the gas, residue gas, or gas plant products for the mutual benefit of yourself and the lessor by selling your gas, residue gas, or gas plant products at a value that is unreasonably low. ONRR may consider a sales price unreasonably low if it is 10 percent less than the lowest reasonable measures of market price, including, but not limited to, index prices and prices reported to ONRR for like-quality gas, residue gas, or gas plant products; or
(3) ONRR cannot determine if you properly valued your gas, residue gas, or gas plant products under § 1206.141 or § 1206.142 for any reason, including, but not limited to, your or your affiliate's failure to provide documents that ONRR requests under 30 CFR part 1212, subpart B.
(d) You have the burden of demonstrating that your or your affiliate's contract is arm's-length.
(e) ONRR may require you to certify that the provisions in your or your affiliate's contract include(s) all of the consideration that the buyer paid to you or your affiliate, either directly or indirectly, for the gas, residue gas, or gas plant products.
(f)(1) Absent contract revision or amendment, if you or your affiliate fail(s) to take proper or timely action to receive prices or benefits to which you or your affiliate are entitled, you must pay royalty based upon that obtainable price or benefit.
(2) If you or your affiliate make timely application for a price increase or benefit allowed under your or your affiliate's contract, but the purchaser refuses, and you or your affiliate take reasonable, documented measures to force purchaser compliance, you will not owe additional royalties unless or until you or your affiliate receive additional monies or consideration resulting from the price increase. You may not construe this paragraph to permit you to avoid your royalty payment obligation in situations where a purchaser fails to pay, in whole or in part, or in a timely manner, for a quantity of gas, residue gas, or gas plant products.
(g)(1) You or your affiliate must make all contracts, contract revisions, or amendments in writing, and all parties to the contract must sign the contract, contract revisions, or amendments.
(2) If you or your affiliate fail(s) to comply with paragraph (g)(1) of this section, ONRR may decide your value under § 1206.144.
(3) This provision applies notwithstanding any other provisions in this title 30 to the contrary.
§ 1206.144
How will ONRR determine the value of my gas for royalty purposes?
If ONRR decides to value your gas, residue gas, or gas plant products for royalty purposes under § 1206.143, or any other provision in this subpart, then ONRR will determine the value, for royalty purposes, by considering any information that we deem relevant, which may include, but is not limited to:
(a) The value of like-quality gas in the same field or nearby fields or areas.
(b) The value of like-quality residue gas or gas plant products from the same plant or area.
(c) Public sources of price or market information that ONRR deems to be reliable.
(d) Information available or reported to ONRR, including, but not limited to, on form ONRR-2014 and form ONRR-4054.
(e) Costs of transportation or processing if ONRR determines that they are applicable.
(f) Any information that ONRR deems relevant regarding the particular lease operation or the salability of the gas.
§ 1206.145
What records must I keep in order to support my calculations of royalty under this subpart?
If you value your gas under this subpart, you must retain all data relevant to the determination of the royalty that you paid. You can find recordkeeping requirements in parts 1207 and 1212 of this chapter.
(a) You must show:
(1) How you calculated the royalty value, including all allowable deductions; and
(2) How you complied with this subpart.
(b) Upon request, you must submit all data to ONRR. You must comply with any such requirement within the time that ONRR specifies.
§ 1206.146
What are my responsibilities to place production into marketable condition and to market production?
(a) You must place gas, residue gas, and gas plant products in marketable condition and market the gas, residue gas, and gas plant products for the mutual benefit of the lessee and the lessor at no cost to the Federal government.
(b) If you use gross proceeds under an arm's-length contract to determine royalty, you must increase those gross proceeds to the extent that the purchaser, or any other person, provides certain services that you normally are responsible to perform in order to place the gas, residue gas, and gas plant products in marketable condition or to market the gas.
§ 1206.147
When is an ONRR audit, review, reconciliation, monitoring, or other like process considered final?
Notwithstanding any provision in these regulations to the contrary, ONRR does not consider any audit, review, reconciliation, monitoring, or other like process that results in ONRR re-determining royalty due, under this subpart, final or binding as against the Federal government or its beneficiaries unless ONRR chooses to, in writing, formally close the audit period.
§ 1206.148
How do I request a valuation determination?
(a) You may request a valuation determination from ONRR regarding any gas produced. Your request must:
(1) Be in writing;
(2) Identify specifically all leases involved, all interest owners of those leases, the designee(s), and the operator(s) for those leases;
(3) Completely explain all relevant facts. You must inform ONRR of any changes to relevant facts that occur before we respond to your request;
(4) Include copies of all relevant documents;
(5) Provide your analysis of the issue(s), including citations to all relevant precedents (including adverse precedents); and
(6) Suggest your proposed valuation method.
(b) In response to your request, ONRR may:
(1) Request that the Assistant Secretary for Policy, Management and Budget issue a determination;
(2) Decide that ONRR will issue guidance; or
(3) Inform you in writing that ONRR will not provide a determination or guidance. Situations in which ONRR typically will not provide any determination or guidance include, but are not limited to:
(i) Requests for guidance on hypothetical situations; or
(ii) Matters that are the subject of pending litigation or administrative appeals.
(c)(1) A determination that the Assistant Secretary for Policy, Management and Budget signs is binding on both you and ONRR until the Assistant Secretary modifies or rescinds it.
(2) After the Assistant Secretary issues a determination, you must make any adjustments to royalty payments that follow from the determination, and, if you owe additional royalties, you must pay the additional royalties due, plus late payment interest calculated under §§ 1218.54 and 1218.102 of this chapter.
(3) A determination that the Assistant Secretary signs is the final action of the Department and is subject to judicial review under 5 U.S.C. 701-706.
(d) Guidance that ONRR issues is not binding on ONRR, delegated States, or you with respect to the specific situation addressed in the guidance.
(1) Guidance and ONRR's decision whether or not to issue guidance or to request an Assistant Secretary determination, or neither, under paragraph (b) of this section, are not appealable decisions or orders under part 1290 of this title.
(2) If you receive an order requiring you to pay royalty on the same basis as the guidance, you may appeal that order under part 1290 of this title.
(e) ONRR or the Assistant Secretary may use any of the applicable criteria in this subpart to provide guidance or to make a determination.
(f) A change in an applicable statute or regulation on which ONRR based any guidance, or the Assistant Secretary based any determination, takes precedence over the determination or guidance after the effective date of the statute or regulation, regardless of whether ONRR or the Assistant Secretary modifies or rescinds the guidance or determination.
(g) ONRR may make requests and replies under this section available to the public, subject to the confidentiality requirements under § 1206.149.
§ 1206.149
Does ONRR protect information that I provide?
(a) Certain information that you or your affiliate submit(s) to ONRR regarding royalties on gas, including deductions and allowances, may be exempt from disclosure.
(b) To the extent that applicable laws and regulations permit, ONRR will keep confidential any data that you or your affiliate submit(s) that is privileged, confidential, or otherwise exempt from disclosure.
(c) You and others must submit all requests for information under the Freedom of Information Act regulations of the Department of the Interior at 43 CFR part 2.
§ 1206.150
How do I determine royalty quantity and quality?
(a)(1) You must calculate royalties based on the quantity and quality of unprocessed gas as measured at the point of royalty settlement that BLM
or BSEE approves for onshore leases and OCS leases, respectively.
(2) If you base the value of gas determined under this subpart on a quantity and/or quality that is different from the quantity and/or quality at the point of royalty settlement that BLM or BSEE approves, you must adjust that value for the differences in quantity and/or quality.
(b)(1) For residue gas and gas plant products, the quantity basis for computing royalties due is the monthly net output of the plant, even though residue gas and/or gas plant products may be in temporary storage.
(2) If you value residue gas and/or gas plant products determined under this subpart on a quantity and/or quality of residue gas and/or gas plant products that is different from that which is attributable to a lease determined under paragraph (c) of this section, you must adjust that value for the differences in quantity and/or quality.
(c) You must determine the quantity of the residue gas and gas plant products attributable to a lease based on the following procedure:
(1) When you derive the net output of the processing plant from gas obtained from only one lease, you must base the quantity of the residue gas and gas plant products for royalty computation on the net output of the plant.
(2) When you derive the net output of a processing plant from gas obtained from more than one lease producing gas of uniform content, you must base the quantity of the residue gas and gas plant products allocable to each lease on the same proportions as the ratios obtained by dividing the amount of gas delivered to the plant from each lease by the total amount of gas delivered from all leases.
(3) When the net output of a processing plant is derived from gas obtained from more than one lease producing gas of non-uniform content:
(i) You must determine the quantity of the residue gas allocable to each lease by multiplying the amount of gas delivered to the plant from the lease by the residue gas content of the gas, and dividing that arithmetical product by the sum of the similar arithmetical products separately obtained for all leases from which gas is delivered to the plant, and then multiplying the net output of the residue gas by the arithmetic quotient obtained.
(ii) You must determine the net output of gas plant products allocable to each lease by multiplying the amount of gas delivered to the plant from the lease by the gas plant product content of the gas, dividing that arithmetical product by the sum of the similar arithmetical products separately obtained for all leases from which gas is delivered to the plant, and then multiplying the net output of each gas plant product by the arithmetic quotient obtained.
(4) You may request prior ONRR approval of other methods for determining the quantity of residue gas and gas plant products allocable to each lease. If approved, you must apply that method to all gas production from Federal leases that is processed in the same plant. You must do so beginning with the production month following the month when ONRR received your request to use another method.
(d)(1) You may not make any deductions from the royalty volume or royalty value for actual or theoretical losses. Any actual loss of unprocessed gas that you sustain before the royalty settlement meter or measurement point is not subject to royalty if BLM or BSEE, whichever is appropriate, determines that such loss was unavoidable.
(2) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(1) of this section and § 1202.151(c), you must pay royalties due on 100 percent of the volume determined under paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section. You may not reduce that determined volume for actual losses after you have determined the quantity basis, or for theoretical losses that you claim to have taken place. Royalties are due on 100 percent of the value of the unprocessed gas, residue gas, and/or gas plant products, as provided in this subpart, less applicable allowances. You may not take any deduction from the value of the unprocessed gas, residue gas, and/or gas plant products to compensate for actual losses after you have determined the quantity basis or for theoretical losses that you claim to have taken place.
§ 1206.151
[Reserved]
§ 1206.152
What general transportation allowance requirements apply to me?
(a) ONRR will allow a deduction for the reasonable, actual costs to transport residue gas, gas plant products, or unprocessed gas from the lease to the point off of the lease under § 1206.153 or § 1206.154, as applicable. You may not deduct transportation costs that you incur when moving a particular volume of production to reduce royalties that you owe on production for which you did not incur those costs. This paragraph applies when:
(1) You value unprocessed gas under § 1206.141(b) or residue gas and gas plant products under § 1206.142(b) based on a sale at a point off of the lease, unit, or communitized area where the residue gas, gas plant products, or unprocessed gas is produced; and
(2)(i) The movement to the sales point is not gathering.
(ii) For gas produced on the OCS, the movement of gas from the wellhead to the first platform is not transportation.
(b) You must calculate the deduction for transportation costs based on your or your affiliate's cost of transporting each product through each individual transportation system. If your or your affiliate's transportation contract includes more than one product in a gaseous phase, you must allocate costs consistently and equitably to each of the products transported. Your allocation must use the same proportion as the ratio of the volume of each product (excluding waste products with no value) to the volume of all products in the gaseous phase (excluding waste products with no value).
(1) You may not take an allowance for transporting lease production that is not royalty-bearing.
(2) You may propose to ONRR a prospective cost allocation method based on the values of the products transported. ONRR will approve the method if it is consistent with the purposes of the regulations in this subpart.
(3) You may use your proposed procedure to calculate a transportation allowance beginning with the production month following the month when ONRR received your proposed procedure until ONRR accepts or rejects your cost allocation. If ONRR rejects your cost allocation, you must amend your form ONRR-2014 for the months when you used the rejected method and pay any additional royalty due, plus late payment interest calculated under §§ 1218.54 and 1218.102 of this chapter.
(c)(1) Where you or your affiliate transport(s) both gaseous and liquid products through the same transportation system, you must propose a cost allocation procedure to ONRR.
(2) You may use your proposed procedure to calculate a transportation allowance until ONRR accepts or rejects your cost allocation. If ONRR rejects your cost allocation, you must amend your form ONRR-2014 for the months when you used the rejected method and pay any additional royalty due, plus late payment interest calculated under §§ 1218.54 and 1218.102 of this chapter.
(3) You must submit your initial proposal, including all available data, within three months after you first claim the allocated deductions on form ONRR-2014.
(d) If you value unprocessed gas under § 1206.141(c) or residue gas and gas plant products under § 1206.142 (d), you may not take a transportation allowance.
(e)(1) Your transportation allowance may not exceed 50 percent of the value of the residue gas, gas plant products, or unprocessed gas as determined under § 1206.141 or § 1206.142 of this subpart.
(2) If ONRR approved your request to take a transportation allowance in excess of the 50-percent limitation under former § 1206.156(c)(3), that approval is terminated as of January 1, 2017.
(f) You must express transportation allowances for residue gas, gas plant products, or unprocessed gas as a dollar-value equivalent. If your or your affiliate's payments for transportation under a contract are not on a dollar-per-unit basis, you must convert whatever consideration that you or your affiliate are/is paid to a dollar-value equivalent.
(g) ONRR may determine your transportation allowance under § 1206.144 because:
(1) There is misconduct by or between the contracting parties;
(2) ONRR determines that the consideration that you or your affiliate paid under an arm's-length transportation contract does not reflect the reasonable cost of the transportation because you breached your duty to market the gas, residue gas, or gas plant products for the mutual benefit of yourself and the lessor by transporting your gas, residue gas, or gas plant products at a cost that is unreasonably high. We may consider a transportation allowance unreasonably high if it is 10 percent higher than the highest reasonable measures of transportation costs, including, but not limited to, transportation allowances reported to ONRR and tariffs for gas, residue gas, or gas plant products transported through the same system; or
(3) ONRR cannot determine if you properly calculated a transportation allowance under § 1206.153 or § 1206.154 for any reason, including, but not limited to, your or your affiliate's failure to provide documents that ONRR requests under 30 CFR part 1212, subpart B.
(h) You do not need ONRR's approval before reporting a transportation allowance.
§ 1206.153
How do I determine a transportation allowance if I have an arm's-length transportation contract?
(a)(1) If you or your affiliate incur transportation costs under an arm's-length transportation contract, you may claim a transportation allowance for the reasonable, actual costs incurred, as more fully explained in paragraph (b) of this section, except as provided in § 1206.152(g) and subject to the limitation in § 1206.152(e).
(2) You must be able to demonstrate that your or your affiliate's contract is arm's-length.
(b) Subject to the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section, you may include, but are not limited to, the following costs to determine your transportation allowance under paragraph (a) of this section; you may not use any cost as a deduction that duplicates all or part of any other cost that you use under this section:
(1)
Firm demand charges paid to pipelines.
You may deduct firm demand charges or capacity reservation fees that you or your affiliate paid to a pipeline, including charges or fees for unused firm capacity that you or your affiliate have not sold before you report your allowance. If you or your affiliate receive(s) a payment from any party for release or sale of firm capacity after reporting a transportation allowance that included the cost of that unused firm capacity, or if you or your affiliate receive(s) a payment or credit from the pipeline for penalty refunds, rate case refunds, or other reasons, you must reduce the firm demand charge claimed on form ONRR-2014 by the amount of that payment. You must modify form ONRR-2014 by the amount received or credited for the affected reporting period and pay any resulting royalty due, plus late payment interest calculated under §§ 1218.54 and 1218.102 of this chapter.
(2)
Gas Supply Realignment (GSR) costs.
The GSR costs result from a pipeline reforming or terminating supply contracts with producers in order to implement the restructuring requirements of FERC Orders in 18 CFR part 284.
(3)
Commodity charges.
The commodity charge allows the pipeline to recover the costs of providing service.
(4)
Wheeling costs.
Hub operators charge a wheeling cost for transporting gas from one pipeline to either the same or another pipeline through a market center or hub. A hub is a connected manifold of pipelines through which a series of incoming pipelines are interconnected to a series of outgoing pipelines.
(5)
Gas Research Institute (GRI) fees.
The GRI conducts research, development, and commercialization programs on natural gas-related topics for the benefit of the U.S. gas industry and gas customers. GRI fees are allowable, provided that such fees are mandatory in FERC-approved tariffs.
(6)
Annual Charge Adjustment (ACA) fees.
FERC charges these fees to pipelines to pay for its operating expenses.
(7)
Payments (either volumetric or in value) for actual or theoretical losses.
Theoretical losses are not deductible in transportation arrangements unless the transportation allowance is based on arm's-length transportation rates
charged under a FERC or State regulatory-approved tariff. If you or your affiliate receive(s) volumes or credit for line gain, you must reduce your transportation allowance accordingly and pay any resulting royalties plus late payment interest calculated under §§ 1218.54 and 1218.102 of this chapter;
(8)
Temporary storage services.
This includes short-duration storage services that market centers or hubs (commonly referred to as “parking” or “banking”) offer or other temporary storage services that pipeline transporters provide, whether actual or provided as a matter of accounting. Temporary storage is limited to 30 days or fewer.
(9)
Supplemental costs for compression, dehydration, and treatment of gas.
ONRR allows these costs only if such services are required for transportation and exceed the services necessary to place production into marketable condition required under § 1206.146 of this part.
(10)
Costs of surety.
You may deduct the costs of securing a letter of credit, or other surety, that the pipeline requires you or your affiliate, as a shipper, to maintain under a transportation contract.
(11)
Hurricane surcharges.
You may deduct hurricane surcharges that you or your affiliate actually pay(s).
(c) You may not include the following costs to determine your transportation allowance under paragraph (a) of this section:
(1)
Fees or costs incurred for storage.
This includes storing production in a storage facility, whether on or off of the lease, for more than 30 days.
(2)
Aggregator/marketer fees.
This includes fees that you or your affiliate pay(s) to another person (including your affiliates) to market your gas, including purchasing and reselling the gas or finding or maintaining a market for the gas production.
(3)
Penalties that you or your affiliate incur(s) as a shipper.
These penalties include, but are not limited to:
(i)
Over-delivery cash-out penalties.
This includes the difference between the price that the pipeline pays to you or your affiliate for over-delivered volumes outside of the tolerances and the price that you or your affiliate receive(s) for over-delivered volumes within the tolerances.
(ii)
Scheduling penalties.
This includes penalties that you or your affiliate incur(s) for differences between daily volumes delivered into the pipeline and volumes scheduled or nominated at a receipt or delivery point.
(iii)
Imbalance penalties.
This includes penalties that you or your affiliate incur(s) (generally on a monthly basis) for differences between volumes delivered into the pipeline and volumes scheduled or nominated at a receipt or delivery point.
(iv)
Operational penalties.
This includes fees that you or your affiliate incur(s) for violation of the pipeline's curtailment or operational orders issued to protect the operational integrity of the pipeline.
(4)
Intra-hub transfer fees.
These are fees that you or your affiliate pay(s) to hub operators for administrative services (such as title transfer tracking) necessary to account for the sale of gas within a hub.
(5)
Fees paid to brokers.
This includes fees that you or your affiliate pay(s) to parties who arrange marketing or transportation, if such fees are separately identified from aggregator/marketer fees.
(6)
Fees paid to scheduling service providers.
This includes fees that you or your affiliate pay(s) to parties who provide scheduling services, if such fees are separately identified from aggregator/marketer fees.
(7)
Internal costs.
This includes salaries and related costs, rent/space costs, office equipment costs, legal fees, and other costs to schedule, nominate, and account for the sale or movement of production.
(8)
Other non-allowable costs.
Any cost you or your affiliate incur(s) for services that you are required to provide at no cost to the lessor, including, but not limited to, costs to place your gas, residue gas, or gas plant products into marketable condition disallowed under § 1206.146 and costs of boosting residue gas disallowed under § 1202.151(b).
(d) If you have no written contract for the transportation of gas, then ONRR will determine your transportation allowance under § 1206.144. You may not use this paragraph (d) if you
or your affiliate perform(s) your own transportation.
(1) You must propose to ONRR a method to determine the allowance using the procedures in § 1206.148(a).
(2) You may use that method to determine your allowance until ONRR issues its determination.
§ 1206.154
How do I determine a transportation allowance if I have a non-arm's-length transportation contract?
(a) This section applies if you or your affiliate do(es) not have an arm's-length transportation contract, including situations where you or your affiliate provide your own transportation services. You must calculate your transportation allowance based on your or your affiliate's reasonable, actual costs for transportation during the reporting period using the procedures prescribed in this section.
(b) Your or your affiliate's actual costs may include:
(1) Capital costs and operating and maintenance expenses under paragraphs (e), (f), and (g) of this section.
(2) Overhead under paragraph (h) of this section.
(3) Depreciation and a return on undepreciated capital investment under paragraph (i)(1) of this section, or you may elect to use a cost equal to a return on the initial depreciable capital investment in the transportation system under paragraph (i)(2) of this section. After you have elected to use either method for a transportation system, you may not later elect to change to the other alternative without ONRR's approval. If ONRR accepts your request to change methods, you may use your changed method beginning with the production month following the month when ONRR received your change request.
(4) A return on the reasonable salvage value under paragraph (i)(1)(iii) of this section, after you have depreciated the transportation system to its reasonable salvage value.
(c)(1) To the extent not included in costs identified in paragraphs (e) through (g) of this section, if you or your affiliate incur(s) the actual transportation costs listed under § 1206.153(b)(2), (5), and (6) of this subpart under your or your affiliate's non-arm's-length contract, you may include those costs in your calculations under this section. You may not include any of the other costs identified under § 1206.153(b).
(2) You may not include in your calculations under this section any of the non-allowable costs listed under § 1206.153(c).
(d) You may not use any cost as a deduction that duplicates all or part of any other cost that you use under this section.
(e) Allowable capital investment costs are generally those for depreciable fixed assets (including costs of delivery and installation of capital equipment) that are an integral part of the transportation system.
(f) Allowable operating expenses include the following:
(1) Operations supervision and engineering
(2) Operations labor
(3) Fuel
(4) Utilities
(5) Materials
(6) Ad valorem property taxes
(7) Rent
(8) Supplies
(9) Any other directly allocable and attributable operating expense that you can document
(g) Allowable maintenance expenses include the following:
(i) Maintenance of the transportation system
(ii) Maintenance of equipment
(iii) Maintenance labor
(iv) Other directly allocable and attributable maintenance expenses that you can document
(h) Overhead, directly attributable and allocable to the operation and maintenance of the transportation system, is an allowable expense. State and Federal income taxes and severance taxes and other fees, including royalties, are not allowable expenses.
(i)(1) To calculate depreciation and a return on undepreciated capital investment, you may elect to use either a straight-line depreciation method based on the life of equipment or on the life of the reserves that the transportation system services, or you may
elect to use a unit-of-production method. After you make an election, you may not change methods without ONRR's approval. If ONRR accepts your request to change methods, you may use your changed method beginning with the production month following the month when ONRR received your change request.
(i) A change in ownership of a transportation system will not alter the depreciation schedule that the original transporter/lessee established for the purposes of the allowance calculation.
(ii) You may depreciate a transportation system only once with or without a change in ownership.
(iii)(A) To calculate the return on undepreciated capital investment, you may use an amount equal to the undepreciated capital investment in the transportation system multiplied by the rate of return that you determine under paragraph (i)(3) of this section.
(B) After you have depreciated a transportation system to the reasonable salvage value, you may continue to include in the allowance calculation a cost equal to the reasonable salvage value multiplied by a rate of return under paragraph (i)(3) of this section.
(2) As an alternative to using depreciation and a return on undepreciated capital investment, as provided under paragraph (b)(3) of this section, you may use as a cost an amount equal to the allowable initial capital investment in the transportation system multiplied by the rate of return determined under paragraph (i)(3) of this section. You may not include depreciation in your allowance.
(3) The rate of return is the industrial rate associated with Standard
Poor's BBB rating.
(i) You must use the monthly average BBB rate that Standard
Poor's publishes for the first month for which the allowance is applicable.
(ii) You must re-determine the rate at the beginning of each subsequent calendar year.
§ 1206.155
What are my reporting requirements under an arm's-length transportation contract?
(a) You must use a separate entry on form ONRR-2014 to notify ONRR of an allowance based on transportation costs that you or your affiliate incur(s).
(b) ONRR may require you or your affiliate to submit arm's-length transportation contracts, production agreements, operating agreements, and related documents.
(c) You can find recordkeeping requirements in parts 1207 and 1212 of this chapter.
§ 1206.156
What are my reporting requirements under a non-arm's-length transportation contract?
(a) You must use a separate entry on form ONRR-2014 to notify ONRR of an allowance based on non-arm's-length transportation costs that you or your affiliate incur(s).
(b)(1) For new non-arm's-length transportation facilities or arrangements, you must base your initial deduction on estimates of allowable transportation costs for the applicable period.
(2) You must use your or your affiliate's most recently available operations data for the transportation system as your estimate. If such data is not available, you must use estimates based on data for similar transportation systems.
(3) Section 1206.158 applies when you amend your report based on your actual costs.
(c) ONRR may require you or your affiliate to submit all data used to calculate the allowance deduction. You can find recordkeeping requirements in parts 1207 and 1212 of this chapter.
§ 1206.157
What interest and penalties apply if I improperly report a transportation allowance?
(a)(1) If ONRR determines that you took an unauthorized transportation allowance, then you must pay any additional royalties due, plus late payment interest calculated under §§ 1218.54 and 1218.102 of this chapter.
(2) If you understated your transportation allowance, you may be entitled to a credit, with interest.
(b) If you deduct a transportation allowance on form ONRR-2014 that exceeds 50 percent of the value of the gas, residue gas, or gas plant products
transported, you must pay late payment interest on the excess allowance amount taken from the date when that amount is taken until the date when you pay the additional royalties due.
(c) If you improperly net a transportation allowance against the sales value of the residue gas, gas plant products, or unprocessed gas instead of reporting the allowance as a separate entry on form ONRR-2014, ONRR may assess a civil penalty under 30 CFR part 1241.
§ 1206.158
What reporting adjustments must I make for transportation allowances?
(a) If your actual transportation allowance is less than the amount that you claimed on form ONRR-2014 for each month during the allowance reporting period, you must pay additional royalties due, plus late payment interest calculated under §§ 1218.54 and 1218.102 of this chapter from the date when you took the deduction to the date when you repay the difference.
(b) If the actual transportation allowance is greater than the amount that you claimed on form ONRR-2014 for any month during the period reported on the allowance form, you are entitled to a credit, plus interest.
§ 1206.159
What general processing allowances requirements apply to me?
(a)(1) When you value any gas plant product under § 1206.142(c) of this subpart, you may deduct from the value the reasonable, actual costs of processing.
(2) You do not need ONRR's approval before reporting a processing allowance.
(b) You must allocate processing costs among the gas plant products. You must determine a separate processing allowance for each gas plant product and processing plant relationship. ONRR considers NGLs to be one product.
(c)(1) You may not apply the processing allowance against the value of the residue gas.
(2) The processing allowance deduction on the basis of an individual product may not exceed 66
2/3
percent of the value of each gas plant product determined under § 1206.142(c). Before you calculate the 66
2/3
-percent limit, you must first reduce the value for any transportation allowances related to post-processing transportation authorized under § 1206.152.
(3) If ONRR approved your request to take a processing allowance in excess of the limitation in paragraph (c)(2) of this section under former § 1206.158(c)(3), that approval is terminated as of January 1, 2017.
(4) If ONRR approved your request to take an extraordinary cost processing allowance under former § 1206.158(d), ONRR terminates that approval as of January 1, 2017.
(d)(1) ONRR will not allow a processing cost deduction for the costs of placing lease products in marketable condition, including dehydration, separation, compression, or storage, even if those functions are performed off the lease or at a processing plant.
(2) Where gas is processed for the removal of acid gases, commonly referred to as “sweetening,” ONRR will not allow processing cost deductions for such costs unless the acid gases removed are further processed into a gas plant product.
(A) In such event, you are eligible for a processing allowance determined under this subpart.
(B) ONRR will not grant any processing allowance for processing lease production that is not royalty bearing.
(e) ONRR may determine your processing allowance under § 1206.144 because:
(1) There is misconduct by or between the contracting parties;
(2) ONRR determines that the consideration that you or your affiliate paid under an arm's-length processing contract does not reflect the reasonable cost of the processing because you breached your duty to market the gas, residue gas, or gas plant products for the mutual benefit of yourself and the lessor by processing your gas, residue gas, or gas plant products at a cost that is unreasonably high. We may consider a processing allowance unreasonably high if it is 10 percent higher than the highest reasonable measures of processing costs, including, but not limited to, processing allowances reported to ONRR; or
(3) ONRR cannot determine if you properly calculated a processing allowance under § 1206.160 or § 1206.161 for any reason, including, but not limited to, your or your affiliate's failure to provide documents that ONRR requests under 30 CFR part 1212, subpart B.
§ 1206.160
How do I determine a processing allowance if I have an arm's-length processing contract?
(a)(1) If you or your affiliate incur processing costs under an arm's-length processing contract, you may claim a processing allowance for the reasonable, actual costs incurred, as more fully explained in paragraph (b) of this section, except as provided in paragraphs (a)(3)(i) and (a)(3)(ii) of this section and subject to the limitation in § 1206.159(c)(2).
(2) You must be able to demonstrate that your or your affiliate's contract is arm's-length.
(b)(1) If your or your affiliate's arm's-length processing contract includes more than one gas plant product, and you can determine the processing costs for each product based on the contract, then you must determine the processing costs for each gas plant product under the contract.
(2) If your or your affiliate's arm's-length processing contract includes more than one gas plant product, and you cannot determine the processing costs attributable to each product from the contract, you must propose an allocation procedure to ONRR.
(i) You may use your proposed allocation procedure until ONRR issues its determination.
(ii) You must submit all relevant data to support your proposal.
(iii) ONRR will determine the processing allowance based upon your proposal and any additional information that ONRR deems necessary.
(iv) You must submit the allocation proposal within three months of claiming the allocated deduction on form ONRR-2014.
(3) You may not take an allowance for the costs of processing lease production that is not royalty-bearing.
(4) If your or your affiliate's payments for processing under an arm's-length contract are not based on a dollar-per-unit basis, you must convert whatever consideration that you or your affiliate paid to a dollar-value equivalent.
(c) If you have no written contract for the arm's-length processing of gas, then ONRR will determine your processing allowance under § 1206.144. You may not use this paragraph (c) if you or your affiliate perform(s) your own processing.
(1) You must propose to ONRR a method to determine the allowance using the procedures in § 1206.148(a).

After you have elected to use either method for a processing plant, you may not later elect to change to the other alternative without ONRR's approval. If ONRR accepts your request to change methods, you may use your changed method beginning with the production month following the month when ONRR received your change request.
(4) A return on the reasonable salvage value under paragraph (h)(1)(iii)
of this section, after you have depreciated the processing plant to its reasonable salvage value.
(c) You may not use any cost as a deduction that duplicates all or part of any other cost that you use under this section.

# Subpart E—Indian Gas

# Source:
64 FR 43515, Aug. 10, 1999, unless otherwise noted.
§ 1206.170
What does this subpart contain?
This subpart contains royalty valuation provisions applicable to Indian lessees.
(a) This subpart applies to all gas production from Indian (tribal and allotted) oil and gas leases (except leases on the Osage Indian Reservation). The purpose of this subpart is to establish the value of production for royalty purposes consistent with the mineral leasing laws, other applicable laws, and lease terms. This subpart does not apply to Federal leases.
(b) If the specific provisions of any Federal statute, treaty, negotiated agreement, settlement agreement resulting from any administrative or judicial proceeding, or Indian oil and gas lease are inconsistent with any regulation in this subpart, then the Federal statute, treaty, negotiated agreement, settlement agreement, or lease will govern to the extent of that inconsistency.
(c) You may calculate the value of production for royalty purposes under methods other than those the regulations in this title require, but only if you, the tribal lessor, and ONRR jointly agree to the valuation methodology. For leases on Indian allotted lands, you and ONRR must agree to the valuation methodology.
(d) All royalty payments you make to ONRR are subject to monitoring, review, audit, and adjustment.
(e) The regulations in this subpart are intended to ensure that the trust responsibilities of the United States with respect to the administration of Indian oil and gas leases are discharged in accordance with the requirements of the governing mineral leasing laws, treaties, and lease terms.
§ 1206.171
What definitions apply to this subpart?
The following definitions apply to this subpart and to subpart J of part 1202 of this title:
Accounting for comparison
means the same as dual accounting.
Active spot market
means a market where one or more ONRR-acceptable publications publish bidweek prices (or if bidweek prices are not available, first of the month prices) for at least one index-pricing point in the index zone.
Allowance
means a deduction in determining value for royalty purposes. Processing allowance means an allowance for the reasonable, actual costs of processing gas determined under this subpart. Transportation allowance means an allowance for the reasonable, actual cost of transportation determined under this subpart.
Approved Federal Agreement (AFA)
means a unit or communitization agreement approved under departmental regulations.
Area
means a geographic region at least as large as the defined limits of an oil or gas field, in which oil or gas lease products have similar quality, economic, or legal characteristics. An area may be all lands within the boundaries of an Indian reservation.
Arm's-length contract
means a contract or agreement that has been arrived at in the marketplace between independent, nonaffiliated persons with opposing economic interests regarding that contract. For purposes of this subpart, two persons are affiliated if one person controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with another person. The following percentages (based on the instruments of ownership of the voting securities of an entity, or based on other forms of ownership) determine if persons are affiliated:
(1) Ownership in excess of 50 percent constitutes control.
(2) Ownership of 10 through 50 percent creates a presumption of control.
(3) Ownership of less than 10 percent creates a presumption of noncontrol which ONRR may rebut if it demonstrates actual or legal control, including the existence of interlocking directorates. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this subpart, contracts between relatives, either by blood or by marriage, are not arm's-length contracts. ONRR may require the lessee to certify the percentage of ownership or control of the entity. To be considered arm's-length for any production month, a contract must meet the requirements of this definition for that production month as well as when the contract was executed.
Audit
means a review, conducted under generally accepted accounting
and auditing standards, of royalty payment compliance activities of lessees or other persons who pay royalties, rents, or bonuses on Indian leases.
BIA
means the Bureau of Indian Affairs of the Department of the Interior.
BLM
means the Bureau of Land Management of the Department of the Interior.
Compression
means raising the pressure of gas.
Condensate
means liquid hydrocarbons (normally exceeding 40 degrees of API gravity) recovered at the surface without resorting to processing. Condensate is the mixture of liquid hydrocarbons that results from condensation of petroleum hydrocarbons existing initially in a gaseous phase in an underground reservoir.
Contract
means any oral or written agreement, including amendments or revisions thereto, between two or more persons and enforceable by law that with due consideration creates an obligation.

and
that production must be sold pursuant to that contract to the extent that production occurs from that lease or well.
Drip condensate
means any condensate recovered downstream of the facility measurement point without resorting to processing. Drip condensate includes condensate recovered as a result of its becoming a liquid during the transportation of the gas removed from the lease or recovered at the inlet of a gas processing plant by mechanical means, often referred to as scrubber condensate.
Dual Accounting
(or
accounting for comparison
) refers to the requirement to pay royalty based on a value which is the higher of the value of gas prior to processing less any applicable allowances as compared to the combined value of drip condensate, residue gas, and gas plant products after processing, less applicable allowances.
Entitlement
(or
entitled share
) means the gas production from a lease, or allocable to lease acreage under the terms of an AFA, multiplied by the operating rights owner's percentage of interest ownership in the lease or the acreage.

Field
means a geographic region situated over one or more subsurface oil and gas reservoirs encompassing at least the outermost boundaries of all oil and gas accumulations known to be within those reservoirs vertically projected to the land surface. Onshore fields are usually given names and their official boundaries are often designated by oil and gas regulatory agencies in the respective States in which the fields are located.
Gas
means any fluid, either combustible or noncombustible, hydrocarbon or nonhydrocarbon, which is extracted from a reservoir and which has neither independent shape nor volume, but tends to expand indefinitely. It is a substance that exists in a gaseous or rarefied state under standard temperature and pressure conditions.
Gas plant products
means separate marketable elements, compounds, or mixtures, whether in liquid, gaseous, or solid form, resulting from processing gas. However, it does not include residue gas.
Gathering
means the movement of lease production to a central accumulation or treatment point on the lease, unit, or communitized area; or a central accumulation or treatment point off the lease, unit, or communitized area as approved by BLM operations personnel.
Gross proceeds
(for royalty payment purposes) means the total monies and other consideration accruing to an oil and gas lessee for the disposition of unprocessed gas, residue gas, and gas plant products produced. Gross proceeds includes, but is not limited to, payments to the lessee for certain services such as compression, dehydration, measurement, or field gathering to the extent that the lessee is obligated to perform them at no cost to the Indian lessor, and payments for gas processing rights. Gross proceeds, as applied to
gas, also includes but is not limited to reimbursements for severance taxes and other reimbursements. Tax reimbursements are part of the gross proceeds accruing to a lessee even though the Indian royalty interest is exempt from taxation. Monies and other consideration, including the forms of consideration identified in this paragraph, to which a lessee is contractually or legally entitled but which it does not seek to collect through reasonable efforts are also part of gross proceeds.
Index
means the calculated composite price ($/MMBtu) of spot-market sales published by a publication that meets ONRR-established criteria for acceptability at the index-pricing point.
Index-pricing point
(IPP) means any point on a pipeline for which there is an index.
Index zone
means a field or an area with an active spot market and published indices applicable to that field or area that are acceptable to ONRR under § 1206.172(d)(2).
Indian allottee
means any Indian for whom land or an interest in land is held in trust by the United States or who holds title subject to Federal restriction against alienation.
Indian tribe
means any Indian tribe, band, nation, pueblo, community, rancheria, colony, or other group of Indians for which any land or interest in land is held in trust by the United States or which is subject to Federal restriction against alienation.
Lease
means any contract, profit-share arrangement, joint venture, or other agreement issued or approved by the United States under a mineral leasing law that authorizes exploration for, development or extraction of, or removal of lease products—or the land area covered by that authorization, whichever is required by the context. For purposes of this subpart, this definition excludes Federal leases.
Lease products
means any leased minerals attributable to, originating from, or allocated to a lease.
Lessee
means any person to whom the United States, a tribe, and/or individual Indian landowner issues a lease, and any person who has been assigned an obligation to make royalty or other payments required by the lease. This includes any person who has an interest in a lease (including operating rights owners) as well as an operator or payor who has no interest in the lease but who has assumed the royalty payment responsibility.
Like-quality lease products
means lease products which have similar chemical, physical, and legal characteristics.
Marketable condition
means a condition in which lease products are sufficiently free from impurities and otherwise so conditioned that a purchaser will accept them under a sales contract typical for the field or area.
Minimum royalty
means that minimum amount of annual royalty that the lessee must pay as specified in the lease or in applicable leasing regulations.
Natural gas liquids (NGL's)
means those gas plant products consisting of ethane, propane, butane, or heavier liquid hydrocarbons.
Net-back method
(or
work-back method
) means a method for calculating market value of gas at the lease under which costs of transportation, processing, and manufacturing are deducted from the proceeds received for, or the value of, the gas, residue gas, or gas plant products, and any extracted, processed, or manufactured products, at the first point at which reasonable values for any such products may be determined by a sale under an arm's-length contract or comparison to other sales of such products.
Net output
means the quantity of residue gas and each gas plant product that a processing plant produces.
Net profit share
means the specified share of the net profit from production of oil and gas as provided in the agreement.
ONRR
means the Office of Natural Resources Revenue, Department of the Interior. ONRR includes, where appropriate, tribal auditors acting under agreements under the Federal Oil and Gas Royalty Management Act of 1982, 30 U.S.C. 1701
et seq.
or other applicable agreements.
Operating rights owner
(or
working interest owner
) means any person who owns operating rights in a lease subject to this subpart. A record title owner is the owner of operating rights under a

Person
means any individual, firm, corporation, association, partnership, consortium, or joint venture (when established as a separate entity).
Point of royalty measurement
means the same as facility measurement point.
Processing
means any process designed to remove elements or compounds (hydrocarbon and nonhydrocarbon) from gas, including absorption, adsorption, or refrigeration. Field processes which normally take place on or near the lease, such as natural pressure reduction, mechanical separation, heating, cooling, dehydration, desulphurization (or “sweetening”), and compression, are not considered processing. The changing of pressures and/or temperatures in a reservoir is not considered processing.
Residue
gas means that hydrocarbon gas consisting principally of methane resulting from processing gas.
Sales type code
means the contract type or general disposition (e.g., arm's-length or non-arm's-length) of production from the lease. The sales type code applies to the sales contract, or other disposition, and not to the arm's-length or non-arm's-length nature of a transportation or processing allowance.
Spot sales agreement
means a contract wherein a seller agrees to sell to a buyer a specified amount of unprocessed gas, residue gas, or gas plant products at a specified price over a fixed period, usually of short duration. It also does not normally require a cancellation notice to terminate, and does not contain an obligation, or imply an intent, to continue in subsequent periods.
Takes
means when the operating rights owner sells or removes production from, or allocated to, the lease, or when such sale or removal occurs for the benefit of an operating rights owner.
