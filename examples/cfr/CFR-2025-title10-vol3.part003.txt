# 3.1.3.1. General
If the portable electric spa can be installed or configured with multiple options of voltage, maximum amperage, or both, use the hierarchy in section 3.1.3.2 of this appendix to determine the configuration for testing.

# 3.1.3.2. Hierarchy
Use the as-shipped configuration, if such a configuration is provided.
If no configuration is provided in the as-shipped condition, use the option specified in the manufacturer's instructions as the recommended configuration for normal consumer use.
If no configuration is provided in the as-shipped condition and the manufacturer's instructions do not provide a recommended configuration for normal consumer use, use the maximum voltage specified in the manufacturer's installation instructions and maximum amperage that the manufacturer's installation instructions specify for use with the maximum voltage.

# 3.1.4. Fill Volume
Follow the manufacturer's instructions for filling the portable electric spa with water, connecting and/or priming the pump(s), and starting up the spa. After verifying that the spa is operating normally and that all water lines are filled, power off the spa and adjust the fill level as needed to meet the following specifications before starting the test.
If the manufacturer's instructions specify a single fill level, fill to that level with a tolerance of ±0.125 inches.
If the manufacturer's instructions specify a range of fill levels and not a single fill level, fill to the middle of that range with a tolerance of ±0.125 inches.
If the manufacturer's instructions do not specify a fill level or range of fill levels, fill to the halfway point between the bottom of
the skimmer opening and the top of the skimmer opening with a tolerance of ±0.125 inches.
If the manufacturer's instructions do not specify a fill level or range of fill levels, and there is no wall skimmer, fill to 6.0 inches ±0.125 inches below the overflow level of the spa.
Measure the volume of water added to the spa with a water meter while filling the spa. Measure any water removed from the spa using a water meter, graduated container, or scale, each with an accuracy of ±2 percent of the quantity measured. The fill volume is the volume of water held by the spa when the spa is filled as specified above.

# 1. Objectives
This appendix establishes procedures, interpretations, and policies to guide the Department of Energy (“DOE” or the “Department”) in the consideration and promulgation of new or revised appliance energy conservation standards and test procedures under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA). This appendix applies to both covered consumer products and covered commercial/industrial equipment. The Department's objectives in establishing these procedures include:
(a)
Provide for early input from stakeholders.
The Department seeks to provide opportunities for public input early in the rulemaking process so that the initiation and direction of rulemakings isinformed by comment from interested parties. DOE will be able to seek early input from interested parties in determining whether establishing new or amending existing energy conservation standards will result in significant savings of energy
and is economically justified and technologically feasible. In the context of test procedure rulemakings, DOE will be able to seek early input from interested parties in determining whether—
(1) Establishing a new or amending an existing test procedure will better measure the energy efficiency, energy use, water use (as specified in EPCA), or estimated annual operating cost of a covered product/equipment during a representative average use cycle or period of use (for consumer products); and
(2) Will not be unduly burdensome to conduct.
(b)
Increase predictability of the rulemaking timetable.
The Department seeks to make informed, strategic decisions about how to deploy its resources on the range of possible standards and test procedure development activities, and to announce these prioritization decisions so that all interested parties have a common expectation about the timing of different rulemaking activities. Further, DOE will offer the opportunity to provide input on the prioritization of rulemakings through a request for comment as DOE begins preparation of its Regulatory Agenda each spring.
(c)
Eliminate problematic design options early in the process.
The Department seeks to eliminate from consideration, early in the process, any design options that present unacceptable problems with respect to manufacturability, consumer utility, or safety, so that the detailed analysis can focus only on viable design options. DOE will be able to eliminate from consideration design options if it concludes that manufacture, installation or service of the design will be impractical, or that the design option will have a material adverse impact on the utility of the product, or if the design option will have a material adverse impact on safety or health. DOE will also be able to eliminate from consideration proprietary design options that represent a unique pathway toachieving a given efficiency level. This screening will be done at the outset of a rulemaking.
(d)
Fully consider non-regulatory approaches.
The Department seeks to understand the effects of market forces and voluntary programs on encouraging the purchase of energy efficient products so that the incremental impacts of a new or revised standard can be accurately assessed and the Department can make informed decisions about where standards and voluntary programs can be used most effectively. DOE will continue to be able to support voluntary efforts by manufacturers, retailers, utilities, and others to increase product/equipment efficiency.
(e)
Conduct thorough analysis of impacts.
In addition to understanding the aggregate social and private costs and benefits of standards, the Department seeks to understand the distribution of those costs and benefits among consumers, manufacturers, and others, as well as the uncertainty associated with these analyses of costs and benefits, so that any adverse impacts on subgroups and uncertainty concerning any adverse impacts can be fully considered in selecting a standard. DOE will be able to consider the variability of impacts on significant groups of manufacturers and consumers in addition to aggregate social and private costs and benefits, report the range of uncertainty associated with these impacts, and take into account cumulative impacts of regulation on manufacturers. The Department will also be able to conduct appropriate analyses to assess the impact that new or amended test procedures will have on manufacturers and consumers.
(f)
Use transparent and robust analytical methods.
The Department seeks to use qualitative and quantitative analytical methods that are fully documented for the public and that produce results that can be explained and reproduced, so that the analytical underpinnings for policy decisions on standards are as sound and well-accepted as possible.
(g)
Support efforts to build consensus on standards.
The Department seeks to encourage development of consensus proposals, including proposals developed in accordance with the Negotiated Rulemaking Act (5 U.S.C. 561
et seq.
), for new or revised standards because standards with such broad-based support are likely to balance effectively the various interests affected by such standards.

# 2. Scope
The procedures, interpretations, and policies described in this appendix apply to rulemakings concerning new or revised Federal energy conservation standards and test procedures, and related rule documents (
i.e.,
coverage determinations) for consumer products in Part A and commercial and industrial equipment under Part A-1 of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA), as amended, except covered ASHRAE equipment in Part A-1 are governed separately under section 9 in this appendix.

# 3. Application
(a) This appendix contains procedures, interpretations, and policies that are generally applicable to the development of energy conservation standards and test procedures. The Department may, as necessary, deviate from this appendix to account for the specific circumstances of a particular rulemaking. In those instances where the Department may find it necessary or appropriate to deviate from these procedures, interpretations or policies, DOE will provide interested parties with notice of the deviation and an explanation.
(b) If the Department concludes that changes to the procedures, interpretations or policies in this appendix are necessary or appropriate, DOE will provide notice in the
Federal Register
of modifications to this appendix with an accompanying explanation. DOE expects to consult with interested parties prior to any such modification.
(c) This appendix is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity.

# 4. Setting Priorities for Rulemaking Activity
(a) In establishing its priorities for undertaking energy conservation standards and test procedure rulemakings, DOE will consider the following factors, consistent with applicable legal obligations:
(1) Potential energy savings;
(2) Potential social and private, including environmental or energy security, benefits;
(3) Applicable deadlines for rulemakings;
(4) Incremental DOE resources required to complete the rulemaking process;
(5) Other relevant regulatory actions affecting the products/equipment;
(6) Stakeholder recommendations;
(7) Evidence of energy efficiency gains in the market absent new or revised standards;
(8) Status of required changes to test procedures; and
(9) Other relevant factors.
(b) DOE will offer the opportunity to provide input on prioritization of rulemakings through a request for comment as DOE begins preparation of its Regulatory Agenda each spring.

# 5. Coverage Determination Rulemakings
DOE has discretion to conduct proceedings to determine whether additional consumer products and commercial/industrial equipment should be covered under EPCA if certain statutory criteria are met. (42 U.S.C. 6292(b) and 42 U.S.C. 6295(l) for consumer products; 42 U.S.C. 6312(b) for commercial/industrial equipment). This section describes the process to be used in establishing coverage for consumer products and commercial/industrial equipment.
(a)
Pre-notice of proposed rulemaking (“NOPR”) stage.
In determining whether to consider establishing coverage for a consumer product or commercial/industrial equipment, DOE may publish one or more preliminary documents in the
Federal Register
intended to gather information on key issues. Such document(s) will be published in the
Federal Register,
with accompanying documents referenced and posted in the appropriate docket.
(b)
NOPR stage.
If DOE determines to proceed with a coverage determination process, the Department will publish a notice of proposed determination, providing an opportunity for public comment of not less than 60 days, in which DOE will explain how such products/equipment that it seeks to designate as “covered” meet the statutory criteria for coverage and why such coverage is “necessary or appropriate” to carry out the purposes of EPCA. In the case of commercial equipment, DOE will follow the same process, except that the Department must demonstrate that coverage of the equipment type is “necessary” to carry out the purposes of EPCA.
(c)
Final rule.
DOE will publish a final rule in the
Federal Register
that establishes the scope of coverage for the product/equipment, responds to public comments received on the NOPR, and explains how inclusion of the newly covered product/equipment meets the statutory criteria for coverage and why such coverage is necessary or appropriate to carry out the purposes of EPCA. DOE will finalize coverage for a product/equipment prior to publication of a proposed rule to establish a test procedure.
(d)
Scope of coverage revisions.
If, during the substantive rulemaking proceedings to establish test procedures or energy conservation standards after completing a coverage determination, DOE finds it necessary and appropriate to amend the scope of coverage, DOE will propose an amended coverage determination and finalize coverage prior to moving forward with the test procedure or standards rulemaking.

# 6. Process for Developing Energy Conservation Standards
This section describes the process to be used in developing energy conservation standards for covered products and equipment other than those covered equipment subject to ASHRAE/IES Standard 90.1.
(a)
Pre-NOPR stage
—(1)
General.
In determining whether to consider establishing or amending any energy conservation standard, DOE will publish one or more preliminary, pre-NOPR documents in the
Federal Register
intended to gather information on key issues. Such document(s) could take several forms depending upon the specific proceeding, including a framework document, request for information (RFI), notice of data availability (NODA), preliminary analysis, or advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANOPR). Such document(s) will be published in the
Federal Register,
with any accompanying documents referenced and posted in the appropriate docket.
(2)
Satisfaction of statutory criteria.
As part of such pre-NOPR-stage document(s), DOE will solicit submission of comments, data, and information on whether DOE should proceed with the rulemaking, including whether any new or amended rule would satisfy the relevant statutory criteria to be cost-effective, economically justified, technologically
feasible, and result in a significant savings of energy. Based on the information received in response to such request and its own analysis, DOE will determine whether to proceed with a rulemaking for a new or amended energy conservation standard. If DOE determines at any point in the pre-NOPR stage that no candidate standard level for a new or amended standard is likely to satisfy all of the applicable statutory criteria (
i.e.,
to be technologically feasible and economically justified and result in significant energy savings), DOE will announce that conclusion in the
Federal Register
and proceed with notice-and-comment rulemaking that proposes a determination not to adopt new or amended standards. DOE notes that it will, consistent with its statutory obligations, consider both cost effectiveness and economic justification when issuing a determination not to amend a standard. If DOE receives sufficient information suggesting it could justify a new or amended standard or the information received is inconclusive with regard to the statutory criteria, DOE will move forward with the rulemaking to issue or amend an energy conservation standard. In those instances where the available information either suggested that a new or amended energy conservation standard might be justified or in which the information was inconclusive on this point, and DOE undertakes a rulemaking to establish or amend an energy conservation standard, DOE may still ultimately determine that such a standard is not economically justified, technologically feasible or would not result in a significant savings of energy at a later stage of the rulemaking.
(3)
Design options
—(i)
General.
Once the Department has initiated a rulemaking for a specific product/equipment but before publishing a proposed rule to establish or amend standards, DOE will typically identify the product/equipment categories and design options to be analyzed in detail, as well as those design options to be eliminated from further consideration. During the pre-NOPR stage of the rulemaking, interested parties may be consulted to provide information on key issues, including potential design options, through a variety of rulemaking documents.
(ii)
Identification and screening of design options.
During the pre-NOPR phase of the rulemaking process, the Department will typically develop a list of design options for consideration. Initially, the candidate design options will encompass all those technologies considered to be technologically feasible. Following the development of this initial list of design options, DOE will review each design option based on the factors described in paragraph (a)(3)(iii) of this section and the policies stated in section 7 of this appendix (
i.e.,
Policies on Selection of Standards). The reasons for eliminating or retaining any design option at this stage of the process will be fully documented and published as part of the NOPR and as appropriate for a given rule, in the pre-NOPR document(s). The technologically feasible design options that are not eliminated in this screening analysis will be considered further in the Engineering Analysis described in paragraph (a)(4) of this section.
(iii)
Factors for screening of design options.
The factors for screening design options include:
(A)
Technological feasibility.
Technologies incorporated in commercial products (or equipment) or in working prototypes will be considered technologically feasible.
(B)
Practicability to manufacture, install and service.
If mass production of a technology under consideration for use in commercially-available products (or equipment) and reliable installation and servicing of the technology could be achieved on the scale necessary to serve the relevant market at the time of the effective date of the standard, then that technology will be considered practicable to manufacture, install, and service.
(C) Adverse impacts on product utility or product availability.
(D) Adverse impacts on health or safety.
(E)
Unique-pathway proprietary technologies.
If a design option utilizes proprietary technology that represents a unique pathway to achieving a given efficiency level, that technology will not be considered further.
(4)
Engineering analysis of design options and selection of candidate standard levels.
After design options are identified and screened, DOE will perform the engineering analysis and the benefit/cost analysis and select the candidate standard levels based on these analyses. The results of the analyses will be published in a Technical Support Document (TSD) to accompany the appropriate rulemaking documents.
(i)
Identification of engineering analytical methods and tools.
DOE will select the specific engineering analysis tools (or multiple tools, if necessary, to address uncertainty) to be used in the analysis of the design options identified as a result of the screening analysis.
(ii)
Engineering and life-cycle cost analysis of design options.
DOE and its contractors will perform engineering and life-cycle cost analyses of the design options.
(iii)
Review by stakeholders.
Interested parties will have the opportunity to review the results of the engineering and life-cycle cost analyses. If appropriate, a public workshop will be conducted to review these results. The analyses will be revised as appropriate on the basis of this input.
(iv)
New information relating to the factors used for screening design options.
If further information or analysis leads to a determination that a design option, or a combination of design options, has unacceptable impacts,
that design option or combination of design options will not be included in a candidate standard level.
(v)
Selection of candidate standard levels.
Based on the results of the engineering and life-cycle cost analysis of design options and the policies stated in paragraph (a)(3)(iii) of this section, DOE will select the candidate standard levels for further analysis.
(5)
Analysis of impacts and selection of proposed standard level.
If DOE has determined preliminarily that a candidate standard level is likely to produce the maximum improvement in energy efficiency that is both technologically feasible and economically justified and constitutes significant energy savings, economic analyses of the impacts of the candidate standard levels will be conducted. The Department will propose new or amended standards in a subsequent NOPR based on the results of the impact analysis.
(i)
Identification of issues for analysis.
The Department, in consideration of comments received, will identify issues that will be examined in the impacts analysis.
(ii)
Identification of analytical methods and tools.
DOE will select the specific economic analysis tools (or multiple tools, if necessary, to address uncertainty) to be used in the analysis of the candidate standard levels.
(iii)
Analysis of impacts.
DOE will conduct the analysis of the impacts of candidate standard levels.
(iv)
Factors to be considered in selecting a proposed standard.
The factors to be considered in selection of a proposed standard include:
(A)
Impacts on manufacturers.
The analysis of manufacturer impacts will include: Estimated impacts on cash flow; assessment of impacts on manufacturers of specific categories of products/equipment and small manufacturers; assessment of impacts on manufacturers of multiple product-specific Federal regulatory requirements, including efficiency standards for other products and regulations of other agencies; and impacts on manufacturing capacity, employment, and capital investment.
(B)
Private impacts on consumers.
The analysis of consumer impacts will include: Estimated private energy savings impacts on consumers based on regional average energy prices and energy usage; assessments of the variability of impacts on subgroups of consumers based on major regional differences in usage or energy prices and significant variations in installation costs or performance; consideration of changes to product utility, changes to purchase rate and/or costs of products, and other impacts of likely concern to all or some consumers, based to the extent practicable on direct input from consumers; estimated life-cycle cost with sensitivity analysis; and consideration of the increased first cost to consumers and the time required for energy cost savings to pay back these first costs.
(C) Impacts on competition, including industry concentration analysis.
(D)
Impacts on utilities.
The analysis of utility impacts will include estimated marginal impacts on electric and gas utility generation and capacity.
(E)
National energy, economic, and employment impacts.
The analysis of national energy, economic, and employment impacts will include: estimated energy savings by fuel type; estimated net present value of benefits to all consumers; sensitivity analyses using high and low discount rates reflecting both private transactions and social discount rates and high and low energy price forecasts; and estimates of the direct and indirect impacts on employment by appliance manufacturers, relevant service industries, energy suppliers, suppliers of complementary and substitution products, and the economy in general.
(F)
Impacts on the environment.
The analysis of environmental impacts will include estimated impacts on emissions of carbon and relevant criteria pollutants.
(G)
Impacts of non-regulatory approaches.
The analysis of energy savings and consumer impacts will incorporate an assessment of the impacts of market forces and existing voluntary programs in promoting product/equipment efficiency, usage, and related characteristics in the absence of updated efficiency standards.
(H) New information relating to the factors used for screening design options.
(6)
Public comment and hearing.
The length of the public comment period for pre-NOPR rulemaking documents will be determined on a case-by-case basis and may vary depending upon the circumstances of the particular rulemaking. For pre-NOPR documents, DOE will determine whether a public hearing is appropriate.
(7)
Revisions based on comments.
Based on consideration of the comments received, any necessary changes to the engineering analysis, life-cycle cost analysis, or the candidate standard levels will be made.
(b)
NOPR stage
—(1)
Documentation of decisions on proposed standard selection.
The Department will publish a NOPR in the
Federal Register
that proposes standard levels and explains the basis for the selection of those proposed levels, and DOE will post on its website a draft TSD documenting the analysis of impacts. The draft TSD will also be posted in the appropriate docket at
www.regulations.gov.
As required by 42 U.S.C. 6295(p)(1) of EPCA, the NOPR also will describe the maximum improvement in energy efficiency or maximum reduction in energy use that is technologically feasible and, if the proposed standards would not achieve these levels, the reasons for proposing different standards.
(2)
Public comment and hearing.
There will be not less than 60 days for public comment on the NOPR, with at least one public hearing or workshop. (42 U.S.C. 6295(p)(2) and 42 U.S.C. 6306)
(3)
Revisions to impact analyses and selection of final standard.
Based on the public comments received, DOE will review the proposed standard and impact analyses, and make modifications as necessary. If major changes to the analyses are required at this stage, DOE will publish a supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking (SNOPR), when required. DOE may also publish a NODA or RFI, where appropriate.
(c)
Final rule stage.
The Department will publish a final rule in the
Federal Register
that promulgates standard levels, responds to public comments received on the NOPR (and SNOPR if applicable), and explains how the selection of those standards meets the statutory requirement that any new or amended energy conservation standard produces the maximum improvement in energy efficiency that is both technologically feasible and economically justified and constitutes significant energy savings, accompanied by a final TSD.

# 7. Policies on Selection of Standards
(a)
Purpose.
Section 6 describes the process that will be used to consider new or revised energy efficiency standards and lists a number of factors and analyses that will be considered at specified points in the process. Department policies concerning the selection of new or revised standards, and decisions preliminary thereto, are described in this section. These policies are intended to elaborate on the statutory criteria provided in 42 U.S.C. 6295. The procedures described in this section are intended to assist the Department in making the determinations required by EPCA and do not preclude DOE's consideration of any other information consistent with the relevant statutory criteria. The Department will consider pertinent information in determining whether a new or revised standard is consistent with the statutory criteria.
(b)
Screening design options.
These factors will be considered as follows in determining whether a design option will receive any further consideration:
(1)
Technological feasibility.
Technologies that are not incorporated in commercial products or in commercially-viable, existing prototypes will not be considered further.
(2)
Practicability to manufacture, install and service.
If it is determined that mass production of a technology in commercial products and reliable installation and servicing of the technology could not be achieved on the scale necessary to serve the relevant market at the time of the compliance date of the standard, then that technology will not be considered further.
(3)
Impacts on product utility.
If a technology is determined to have significant adverse impact on the utility of the product/equipment to subgroups of consumers, or result in the unavailability of any covered product type with performance characteristics (including reliability), features, sizes, capacities, and volumes that are substantially the same as products generally available in the U.S. at the time, it will not be considered further.
(4)
Safety of technologies.
If it is determined that a technology will have significant adverse impacts on health or safety, it will not be considered further.
(5)
Unique-pathway proprietary technologies.
If a technology has proprietary protection and represents a unique pathway to achieving a given efficiency level, it will not be considered further, due to the potential for monopolistic concerns.
(c)
Identification of candidate standard levels.
Based on the results of the engineering and cost/benefit analyses of design options, DOE will identify the candidate standard levels for further analysis. Candidate standard levels will be selected as follows:
(1)
Costs and savings of design options.
Design options that have payback periods that exceed the median life of the product or which result in life-cycle cost increases relative to the base case, using typical fuel costs, usage, and private discount rates, will not be used as the basis for candidate standard levels.
(2)
Further information on factors used for screening design options.
If further information or analysis leads to a determination that a design option, or a combination of design options, has unacceptable impacts under the policies stated in this Appendix, that design option or combination of design options will not be included in a candidate standard level.
(3)
Selection of candidate standard levels.
Candidate standard levels, which will be identified in the pre-NOPR documents and on which impact analyses will be conducted, will be based on the remaining design options.
(i) The range of candidate standard levels will typically include:
(A) The most energy-efficient combination of design options;
(B) The combination of design options with the lowest life-cycle cost; and
(C) A combination of design options with a payback period of not more than three years.
(ii) Candidate standard levels that incorporate noteworthy technologies or fill in large gaps between efficiency levels of other candidate standard levels also may be selected.
(d)
Pre-NOPR Stage.
New information provided in public comments on any pre-NOPR documents will be considered to determine
whether any changes to the candidate standard levels are needed before proceeding to the analysis of impacts.
(e)(1)
Selection of proposed standard.
Based on the results of the analysis of impacts, DOE will select a standard level to be proposed for public comment in the NOPR. As required under 42 U.S.C. 6295(o)(2)(A), any new or revised standard must be designed to achieve the maximum improvement in energy efficiency that is determined to be both technologically feasible and economically justified.
(2)
Statutory policies.
The fundamental policies concerning the selection of standards include:
(i) A trial standard level will not be proposed or promulgated if the Department determines that it is not both technologically feasible and economically justified. (42 U.S.C. 6295(o)(2)(A) and 42 U.S.C. 6295(o)(3)(B)) For a trial standard level to be economically justified, the Secretary must determine that the benefits of the standard exceed its burdens by, to the greatest extent practicable, considering the factors listed in 42 U.S.C. 6295(o)(2)(B)(i). A standard level is subject to a rebuttable presumption that it is economically justified if the payback period is three years or less. (42 U.S.C. 6295(o)(2)(B)(iii))
(ii) If the Department determines that interested persons have established by a preponderance of the evidence that a standard level is likely to result in the unavailability in the United States of any covered product/equipment type (or class) with performance characteristics (including reliability), features, sizes, capacities, and volumes that are substantially the same as products generally available in the U.S. at the time of the determination, then that standard level will not be proposed. (42 U.S.C. 6295(o)(4))
(iii) If the Department determines that a standard level would not result in significant conservation of energy, that standard level will not be proposed. (42 U.S.C. 6295(o)(3)(B))
(f)
Selection of a final standard.
New information provided in the public comments on the NOPR and any analysis by the Department of Justice concerning impacts on competition of the proposed standard will be considered to determine whether issuance of a new or amended energy conservation standard produces the maximum improvement in energy efficiency that is both technologically feasible and economically justified and still constitutes significant energy savings or whether any change to the proposed standard level is needed before proceeding to the final rule. The same policies used to select the proposed standard level, as described in this section, will be used to guide the selection of the final standard level or a determination that no new or amended standard is justified.

# 8. Test Procedures
(a)
Pre-NOPR stage
—(1)
General.
In determining whether to consider establishing or amending any test procedure, DOE will publish one or more preliminary documents in the
Federal Register
(
e.g.,
an RFI or NODA) intended to gather information on key issues.
(2)
Satisfaction of statutory criteria.
As part of such document(s), DOE will solicit submission of comments, data, and information on whether DOE should proceed with the rulemaking, including whether: a new test procedure would satisfy the relevant statutory criteria that test procedures be reasonably designed to produce test results which measure energy efficiency, energy use, water use (in the case of showerheads, faucets, water closets and urinals), or estimated annual operating cost of a covered product during a representative average use cycle or period of use, as determined by the Secretary, and shall not be unduly burdensome to conduct; or an amended test procedure would more fully or accurately comply with the aforementioned statutory criteria. Based on the information received in response to such request and its own analysis, DOE will determine whether to proceed with a rulemaking for a new or amended test procedure.
(3) If DOE determines that a new or amended test procedure would not satisfy the applicable statutory criteria, DOE will engage in notice-and-comment rulemaking to issue a determination that a new or amended test procedure is not warranted.
(4) If DOE receives sufficient information suggesting a new or amended test procedure may satisfy the applicable statutory criteria or the information received is inconclusive with regard to the statutory criteria, DOE will move forward with the rulemaking to issue or amend a test procedure.
(5) In those instances where the available information either suggested that a new or amended test procedure might be warranted or in which the information was inconclusive on this point, and DOE undertakes a rulemaking to establish or amend a test procedure, DOE may still ultimately determine that such a test procedure does not satisfy the applicable statutory criteria at a later stage of the rulemaking.
(6)
Public comment and hearing.
The length of the public comment period for pre-NOPR rulemaking documents will be determined on a case-by-case basis and may vary depending upon the circumstances of the particular rulemaking. For pre-NOPR documents, DOE will determine whether a public hearing is appropriate.
(b)
NOPR stage
—(1)
Documentation of decisions on proposed test procedure.
The Department will publish a NOPR in the
Federal Register
that proposes a new or amended
test procedure and explains how the test procedure satisfies the applicable statutory criteria.
(2)
Public comment and hearing.
There will be not less than 60 days for public comment on the NOPR, with at least one public hearing or workshop. (42 U.S.C. 6293(b)(2) and 42 U.S.C. 6306)
(3)
Revisions to the analyses and establishment of a final test procedure.
Based on the public comments received, DOE will review the proposed test procedure, and make modifications as necessary. As part of this process, DOE may issue an RFI, NODA, SNOPR, or other rulemaking document, as appropriate.
(c)
Final rule stage.
The Department will publish a final rule in the
Federal Register
that establishes or amends a test procedure, responds to public comments received on the NOPR (and any subsequent rulemaking documents), and explains how the new or amended test procedure meets the applicable statutory requirements.
(d)
Adoption of industry test methods.
DOE will adopt industry test procedure standards as DOE test procedures for covered products and equipment, but only if DOE determines that such procedures would not be unduly burdensome to conduct and would produce test results that reflect the energy efficiency, energy use, water use (as specified in EPCA) or estimated operating costs of that equipment during a representative average use cycle. DOE may also adopt industry test procedure standards with modifications or craft its own procedures as necessary to ensure compatibility with the relevant statutory requirements, as well as DOE's compliance, certification, and enforcement requirements.
(e)
Issuing final test procedure
—(1)
Process.
Test procedure rulemakings establishing methodologies used to evaluate proposed energy conservation standards will be finalized prior to publication of a NOPR proposing new or amended energy conservation standards. Except as provided in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, new test procedures and amended test procedures that impact measured energy use or efficiency will be finalized at least 180 days prior to the close of the comment period for:
(i) A NOPR proposing new or amended energy conservation standards; or
(ii) A notice of proposed determination that standards do not need to be amended. With regards to amended test procedures, DOE will state in the test procedure final rule whether the amendments impact measured energy use or efficiency.
(2)
Exceptions.
The 180-day period for new test procedures and amended test procedures that impact measured energy use or efficiency specified in paragraph (e)(1) of this section is not applicable to:
(i) Test procedures developed in accordance with the Negotiated Rulemaking Act or by interested persons that are fairly representative of relevant points of view (including representatives of manufacturers of covered products, States, and efficiency advocates), as determined by the Secretary; or
(ii) Test procedure amendments limited to calculation changes (
e.g.,
use factor or adder). Parties submitting a consensus recommendation in accordance with paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section may specify a time period between finalization of the test procedure and the close of the comment for a NOPR proposing new or amended energy conservation standards or a notice of proposed determination that standards do not need to be amended.
(f)
Effective date of test procedures.
If required only for the evaluation and issuance of updated efficiency standards, use of the modified test procedures typically will not be required until the implementation date of updated standards.

# 9. ASHRAE Equipment
EPCA provides unique statutory requirements and a specific set of timelines for certain enumerated types of commercial and industrial equipment (generally, commercial water heaters, commercial packaged boilers, commercial air-conditioning and heating equipment, and packaged terminal air conditioners and heat pumps (
i.e.,
“ASHRAE equipment”)).
(a)
ASHRAE trigger rulemakings for energy conservation standards.
Pursuant to EPCA's statutory scheme for covered ASHRAE equipment, DOE is required to consider amending the existing Federal energy conservation standards for ASHRAE equipment when ASHRAE Standard 90.1 is amended with respect to standards or design requirements applicable to such equipment.
(1) Not later than 180 days after the amendment of ASHRAE Standard 90.1, DOE will publish in the
Federal Register
for public comment an analysis of the energy savings potential of amended energy efficiency standards for the affected equipment.
(2) Not later than 18 months after the amendment of ASHRAE Standard 90.1, DOE must adopt amended energy conservation standards at the new efficiency level in ASHRAE Standard 90.1 as the uniform national standard for the affected equipment, unless DOE determines by rule, and supported by clear and convincing evidence, that a more-stringent standard would result in significant additional conservation of energy and is technologically feasible and economically justified. In such case, DOE must adopt the more-stringent standard for the affected equipment not later than 30 months after amendment of ASHRAE Standard 90.1.
(3) Regarding amendments to ASHRAE Standard 90.1 involving energy conservation
standards, DOE considers an amendment of a standard level to occur when an updated version of ASHRAE Standard 90.1 publishes (
i.e.,
not at the time that an addendum to ASHRAE Standard 90.1 is released or approved). In addition, DOE considers an amendment of standard levels in ASHRAE Standard 90.1 to be only those changes resulting in an increase in stringency of standard levels relative to the current Federal standards or the adoption of a design requirement.
(b)
ASHRAE trigger rulemakings for test procedures.
Pursuant to EPCA's statutory scheme for covered ASHRAE equipment, DOE is required to consider amending the existing Federal test procedures for such equipment when ASHRAE Standard 90.1 is amended with respect to test procedures applicable to such equipment.
(1) DOE shall amend the test procedure for ASHRAE equipment, as necessary, to be consistent with the amended ASHRAE Standard 90.1, unless DOE determines by rule, and supported by clear and convincing evidence, that to do so would not meet the requirements in 42 U.S.C. 6314(a)(2)-(3), which generally provide that the test procedure must produce results which reflect energy efficiency, energy use, and estimated operating costs during a representative average use cycle and not be unduly burdensome to conduct. If DOE makes such a determination, DOE may establish an amended test procedure for such equipment that meets the requirements in 42 U.S.C. 6314(a)(2)-(3).
(2) With regard to test procedures for ASHRAE equipment, EPCA requires DOE to adopt test procedures consistent with applicable industry test standards.
(c)
ASHRAE lookback rulemakings for standards.
EPCA also requires that DOE periodically consider amending energy conservation standards for ASHRAE equipment.
(1) Every 6 years, DOE shall conduct an evaluation of each class of covered equipment. DOE shall publish either a notice of determination that standards do not need to be amended (because they would not result in significant additional conservation of energy and/or would not be technologically feasible and/or economically justified) or a notice of proposed rulemaking including new proposed standards (based on the criteria and procedures in 42 U.S.C. 6313(a)(6)(B) and supported by clear and convincing evidence).
(2) If DOE issues a notice of proposed rulemaking, it shall publish a final rule no more than 2 years later.
(3) If DOE determines that a standard does not need to be amended, not later than 3 years after such a determination, DOE must publish either a notice of determination that standards do not need to be amended (because they would not result in significant additional conservation of energy and/or would not be technologically feasible and/or economically justified) or a notice of proposed rulemaking including new proposed standards (based on the criteria and procedures in 42 U.S.C. 6313(a)(6)(B) and supported by clear and convincing evidence).
(d)
ASHRAE lookback rulemakings for test procedures.
EPCA also requires that DOE periodically consider amending test procedures for ASHRAE equipment. At least once every 7 years, DOE shall conduct an evaluation, and if DOE determines, that amended test procedures would more accurately or fully comply with the requirements in 42 U.S.C. 6314(a)(2)-(3), it shall prescribe test procedures for the applicable equipment. Otherwise, DOE shall publish a notice of determination not to amend a test procedure.

# 10. Direct Final Rules
In accordance with 42 U.S.C. 6295(p)(4), on receipt of a joint proposal, including a consensus recommendation developed in accordance with the Negotiated Rulemaking Act (5 U.S.C. 561
et seq.
), that is submitted by interested persons that are fairly representative of relevant points of view, DOE may issue a direct final rule (DFR) establishing energy conservation standards for a covered product or equipment if DOE determines the recommended standard is in accordance with 42 U.S.C. 6295(o) or 42 U.S.C. 6313(a)(6)(B) as applicable. To be “fairly representative of relevant points of view” the group submitting a joint statement must, where appropriate, include larger concerns and small businesses in the regulated industry/manufacturer community, energy advocates, energy utilities, consumers, and States. However, it will be necessary to evaluate the meaning of “fairly representative” on a case-by-case basis, subject to the circumstances of a particular rulemaking, to determine whether fewer or additional parties must be part of a joint statement in order to be “fairly representative of relevant points of view.”

# 11. Principles for Distinguishing Between Effective and Compliance Dates
(a)
Dates, generally.
The effective and compliance dates for either DOE test procedures or DOE energy conservation standards are typically not identical, and these terms should not be used interchangeably.
(b)
Effective date.
The effective date is the date a rule is legally operative after being published in the
Federal Register
.
(c)
Compliance date.
(1) For test procedures, the compliance date is the specific date when manufacturers are required to use the new or amended test procedure requirements to make representations concerning the energy efficiency or use of a product, including certification that the covered product/equipment meets an applicable energy conservation standard.
(2) For energy conservation standards, the compliance date is the specific date upon which manufacturers are required to meet the new or amended standards for applicable covered products/equipment that are distributed in interstate commerce.

# 12. Principles for the Conduct of the Engineering Analysis
(a) The purpose of the engineering analysis is to develop the relationship between efficiency and cost of the subject product/equipment. The Department will use the most appropriate means available to determine the efficiency/cost relationship, including an overall system approach or engineering modeling to predict the reduction in energy use or improvement in energy efficiency that can be expected from individual design options as discussed in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section. From this efficiency/cost relationship, measures such as payback, life-cycle cost, and energy savings can be developed. The Department will identify issues that will be examined in the engineering analysis and the types of specialized expertise that may be required. DOE will select appropriate contractors, subcontractors, and expert consultants, as necessary, to perform the engineering analysis and the impact analysis. Also, the Department will consider data, information, and analyses received from interested parties for use in the analysis wherever feasible.
(b) The engineering analysis begins with the list of design options developed in consultation with the interested parties as a result of the screening process. The Department will establish the likely cost and performance improvement of each design option. Ranges and uncertainties of cost and performance will be established, although efforts will be made to minimize uncertainties by using measures such as test data or component or material supplier information where available. Estimated uncertainties will be carried forward in subsequent analyses. The use of quantitative models will be supplemented by qualitative assessments as appropriate.
(c) The next step includes identifying, modifying, or developing any engineering models necessary to predict the efficiency impact of any one or combination of design options on the product/equipment. A base case configuration or starting point will be established, as well as the order and combination/blending of the design options to be evaluated. DOE will then perform the engineering analysis and develop the cost-efficiency curve for the product/equipment. The cost efficiency curve and any necessary models will be available to stakeholders during the pre-NOPR stage of the rulemaking.

# 13. Principles for the Analysis of Impacts on Manufacturers
(a)
Purpose.
The purpose of the manufacturer analysis is to identify the likely private impacts of efficiency standards on manufacturers. The Department will analyze the impact of standards on manufacturers with substantial input from manufacturers and other interested parties. This section describes the principles that will be used in conducting future manufacturing impact analyses.
(b)
Issue identification.
In the impact analysis stage, the Department will identify issues that will require greater consideration in the detailed manufacturer impact analysis. Possible issues may include identification of specific types or groups of manufacturers and concerns over access to technology. Specialized contractor expertise, empirical data requirements, and analytical tools required to perform the manufacturer impact analysis also would be identified at this stage.
(c)
Industry characterization.
Prior to initiating detailed impact studies, the Department will seek input on the present and past industry structure and market characteristics. Input on the following issues will be sought:
(1) Manufacturers and their current and historical relative market shares;
(2) Manufacturer characteristics, such as whether manufacturers make a full line of models or serve a niche market;
(3) Trends in the number of manufacturers;
(4) Financial situation of manufacturers;
(5) Trends in product/equipment characteristics and retail markets including manufacturer market shares and market concentration; and
(6) Identification of other relevant regulatory actions and a description of the nature and timing of any likely impacts.
(d)
Cost impacts on manufacturers.
The costs of labor, material, engineering, tooling, and capital are difficult to estimate, manufacturer-specific, and usually proprietary. The Department will seek input from interested parties on the treatment of cost issues. Manufacturers will be encouraged to offer suggestions as to possible sources of data and appropriate data collection methodologies. Costing issues to be addressed include:
(1) Estimates of total private cost impacts, including product/equipment-specific costs (based on cost impacts estimated for the engineering analysis) and front-end investment/conversion costs for the full range of product/equipment models.
(2) Range of uncertainties in estimates of average cost, considering alternative designs and technologies which may vary cost impacts and changes in costs of material, labor, and other inputs which may vary costs.
(3) Variable cost impacts on particular types of manufacturers, considering factors such as atypical sunk costs or characteristics of specific models which may increase or decrease costs.
(e)
Impacts on product/equipment sales, features, prices, and cost recovery.
In order to make manufacturer cash-flow calculations, it is necessary to predict the number of products/equipment sold and their sale price. This requires an assessment of the likely impacts of price changes on the number of products/equipment sold and on typical features of models sold. Past analyses have relied on price and shipment data generated by economic models. The Department will develop additional estimates of prices and shipments by drawing on multiple sources of data and experience including: Actual shipment and pricing experience; data from manufacturers, retailers, and other market experts; financial models, and sensitivity analyses. The possible impacts of candidate/trial standard levels on consumer choices among competing fuels will be explicitly considered where relevant.
(f)
Measures of impact.
The manufacturer impact analysis will estimate the impacts of candidate/trial standard levels on the net cash flow of manufacturers. Computations will be performed for the industry as a whole and for typical and atypical manufacturers. The exact nature and the process by which the analysis will be conducted will be determined by DOE, with input from interested parties, as appropriate. Impacts to be analyzed include:
(1) Industry net present value, with sensitivity analyses based on uncertainty of costs, sales prices, and sales volumes;
(2) Cash flows, by year; and
(3) Other measures of impact, such as revenue, net income, and return on equity, as appropriate. DOE also notes that the characteristics of a typical manufacturers worthy of special consideration will be determined in consultation with manufacturers and other interested parties and may include: Manufacturers incurring higher or lower than average costs; and manufacturers experiencing greater or fewer adverse impacts on sales. Alternative scenarios based on other methods of estimating cost or sales impacts also will be performed, as needed.
(g)
Cumulative Impacts of Other Federal Regulatory Actions.
(1) The Department will recognize and seek to mitigate the overlapping effects on manufacturers of new or revised DOE standards and other regulatory actions affecting the same products or equipment. DOE will analyze and consider the impact on manufacturers of multiple product/equipment-specific regulatory actions. These factors will be considered in setting rulemaking priorities, conducting the early assessment as to whether DOE should proceed with a standards rulemaking, assessing manufacturer impacts of a particular standard, and establishing compliance dates for a new or revised standard that, consistent with any statutory requirements, are appropriately coordinated with other regulatory actions to mitigate any cumulative burden.
(2) If the Department determines that a proposed standard would impose a significant impact on product or equipment manufacturers within approximately three years of the compliance date of another DOE standard that imposes significant impacts on the same manufacturers (or divisions thereof, as appropriate), the Department will, in addition to evaluating the impact on manufacturers of the proposed standard, assess the joint impacts of both standards on manufacturers.
(3) If the Department is directed to establish or revise standards for products/equipment that are components of other products/equipment subject to standards, the Department will consider the interaction between such standards in setting rulemaking priorities and assessing manufacturer impacts of a particular standard. The Department will assess, as part of the engineering and impact analyses, the cost of components subject to efficiency standards.
(h)
Summary of quantitative and qualitative assessments.
The summary of quantitative and qualitative assessments will contain a description and discussion of uncertainties. Alternative estimates of impacts, resulting from the different potential scenarios developed throughout the analysis, will be explicitly presented in the final analysis results.
(1) Key modeling and analytical tools. In its assessment of the likely impacts of standards on manufacturers, the Department will use models that are clear and understandable, feature accessible calculations, and have clearly explained assumptions. As a starting point, the Department will use the Government Regulatory Impact Model (GRIM). The Department will also support the development of economic models for price and volume forecasting. Research required to update key economic data will be considered.
(2) [Reserved]

# 14. Principles for the Analysis of Impacts on Consumers
(a)
Early consideration of impacts on consumer utility.
The Department will consider at the earliest stages of the development of a standard whether particular design options will lessen the utility of the covered products/equipment to the consumer. See paragraph (b) of section 6.
(b)
Impacts on product/equipment availability.
The Department will determine, based on consideration of information submitted during the standard development process, whether a proposed standard is likely to result in the unavailability of any covered
product/equipment type with performance characteristics (including reliability), features, sizes, capacities, and volumes that are substantially the same as products/equipment generally available in the U.S. at the time. DOE will not promulgate a standard if it concludes that it would result in such unavailability.
(c)
Department of Justice review.
As required by law, the Department will solicit the views of the Department of Justice on any lessening of competition likely to result from the imposition of a proposed standard and will give the views provided full consideration in assessing economic justification of a proposed standard. In addition, DOE may consult with the Department of Justice at earlier stages in the standards development process to seek its preliminary views on competitive impacts.
(d)
Variation in consumer impacts.
The Department will use regional analysis and sensitivity analysis tools, as appropriate, to evaluate the potential distribution of impacts of candidate/trial standard levels among different subgroups of consumers. The Department will consider impacts on significant segments of consumers in determining standards levels. Where there are significant negative impacts on identifiable subgroups, DOE will consider the efficacy of voluntary approaches as a means to achieve potential energy savings.
(e)
Payback period and first cost.
(1) In the assessment of consumer impacts of standards, the Department will consider Life-Cycle Cost, Payback Period, and Cost of Conserved Energy to evaluate the savings in operating expenses relative to increases in purchase price. The Department also performs sensitivity and scenario analyses when appropriate. The results of these analyses will be carried throughout the analysis and the ensuing uncertainty described.
(2) If, in the analysis of consumer impacts, the Department determines that a candidate/trial standard level would result in a substantial increase in product/equipment first costs to consumers or would not pay back such additional first costs through energy cost savings in less than three years, Department will assess the likely impacts of such a standard on low-income households, product/equipment sales and fuel switching, as appropriate.

# 15. Consideration of Non-Regulatory Approaches
The Department recognizes that non-regulatory efforts by manufacturers, utilities, and other interested parties can result in substantial efficiency improvements. The Department intends to consider the likely effects of non-regulatory initiatives on product/equipment energy use, consumer utility and life-cycle costs, manufacturers, competition, utilities, and the environment, as well as the distribution of these impacts among different regions, consumers, manufacturers, and utilities. DOE will attempt to base its assessment on the actual impacts of such initiatives to date, but also will consider information presented regarding the impacts that any existing initiative might have in the future. Such information is likely to include a demonstration of the strong commitment of manufacturers, distribution channels, utilities, or others to such non-regulatory efficiency improvements. This information will be used in assessing the likely incremental impacts of establishing or revising standards, in assessing—where possible—appropriate compliance dates for new or revised standards, and in considering DOE support of non-regulatory initiatives.

# 16. Cross-Cutting Analytical Assumptions
In selecting values for certain cross-cutting analytical assumptions, DOE expects to continue relying upon the following sources and general principles:
(a)
Underlying economic assumptions.
The appliance standards analyses will generally use the same economic growth and development assumptions that underlie the most current
Annual Energy Outlook
(
AEO
) published by the Energy Information Administration (EIA).
(b)
Analytic time length.
The appliance standards analyses will use two time lengths—30 years and another time length that is specific to the standard being considered such as the useful lifetime of the product under consideration. As a sensitivity case, the analyses will also use a 9-year regulatory timeline in analyzing the effects of the standard.
(c)
Energy price and demand trends.
Analyses of the likely impact of appliance standards on typical users will generally adopt the mid-range energy price and demand scenario of the EIA's most current
AEO.
The sensitivity of such estimated impacts to possible variations in future energy prices are likely to be examined using the EIA's high and low energy price scenarios.
(d)
Product/equipment-specific energy-efficiency trends, without updated standards.
Product/equipment-specific energy-efficiency trends will be based on a combination of the efficiency trends forecast by the EIA's residential and commercial demand model of the National Energy Modeling System (NEMS) and product-specific assessments by DOE and its contractors with input from interested parties.
(e)
Price forecasting.
DOE will endeavor to use robust price forecasting techniques in projecting future prices of products.
(f)
Private Discount rates.
For residential and commercial consumers, ranges of three different real discount rates will be used. For
residential consumers, the mid-range discount rate will represent DOE's approximation of the average financing cost (or opportunity costs of reduced savings) experienced by typical consumers. Sensitivity analyses will be performed using discount rates reflecting the costs more likely to be experienced by residential consumers with little or no savings and credit card financing and consumers with substantial savings. For commercial users, a mid-range discount rate reflecting DOE's approximation of the average real rate of return on commercial investment will be used, with sensitivity analyses being performed using values indicative of the range of real rates of return likely to be experienced by typical commercial businesses. For national net present value calculations, DOE would use the Administration's approximation of the average real rate of return on private investment in the U.S. economy. For manufacturer impacts, DOE typically uses a range of real discount rates which are representative of the real rates of return experienced by typical U.S. manufacturers affected by the program.
(g)
Social discount rates.
Social discount rates as specified in OMB Circular A-4 will be used in assessing social effects such as costs and benefits.
(h)
Environmental impacts.
(1) DOE calculates emission reductions of carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, methane, nitrous oxides, and mercury likely to be avoided by candidate/trial standard levels based on an emissions analysis that includes the two components described in paragraphs (h)(2) and (3) of this section.
(2) The first component estimates the effect of potential candidate/trial standard levels on power sector and site combustion emissions of carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, mercury, methane, and nitrous oxide. DOE develops the power sector emissions analysis using a methodology based on DOE's latest
Annual Energy Outlook.
For site combustion of natural gas or petroleum fuels, the combustion emissions of carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxides are estimated using emission intensity factors from the Environmental Protection Agency.
(3) The second component of DOE's emissions analysis estimates the effect of potential candidate/trial standard levels on emissions of carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, mercury, methane, and nitrous oxide due to “upstream activities” in the fuel production chain. These upstream activities include the emissions related to extracting, processing, and transporting fuels to the site of combustion as detailed in DOE's Fuel-Fuel-Cycle Statement of Policy (76 FR 51281 (August 18, 2011)). DOE will consider the effects of the candidate/trial standard levels on these emissions after assessing the seven factors required to demonstrate economic justification under EPCA. Consistent with Executive Order 13783, dated March 28, 2017, when monetizing the value of changes in reductions in CO
2
and nitrous oxides emissions resulting from its energy conservation standards regulations, including with respect to the consideration of domestic versus international impacts and the consideration of appropriate discount rates, DOE ensures, to the extent permitted by law, that any such estimates are consistent with the guidance contained in OMB Circular A-4 of September 17, 2003 (Regulatory Analysis).

# Subpart D—Petitions To Exempt State Regulation From Preemption; Petitions To Withdraw Exemption of State Regulation

# Source:
54 FR 6078, Feb. 7, 1989, unless otherwise noted.
§ 430.40
Purpose and scope.
(a) This subpart prescribes the procedures to be followed in connection with petitions requesting a rule that a State regulation prescribing an energy conservation standard, water conservation standard (in the case of faucets, showerheads, water closets, and urinals), or other requirement respecting energy efficiency, energy use, or water use (in the case of faucets, showerheads, water closets, and urinals) of a type (or class) of covered product not be preempted.
(b) This subpart also prescribes the procedures to be followed in connection with petitions to withdraw a rule exempting a State regulation prescribing an energy conservation standard, water conservation standard (in the case of faucets, showerheads, water closets, and urinals), or other requirement respecting energy efficiency, energy use, or water use (in the case of faucets, showerheads, water closets, and urinals) of a type (or class) of covered product.
[63 FR 13318, Mar. 18, 1998]
§ 430.41
Prescriptions of a rule.
(a)
Criteria for exemption from preemption.
Upon petition by a State which has prescribed an energy conservation standard, water conservation standard (in the case of faucets, showerheads,
water closets, and urinals), or other requirement for a type or class of covered equipment for which a Federal energy conservation standard or water conservation standard is applicable, the Secretary shall prescribe a rule that such standard not be preempted if he determines that the State has established by a preponderance of evidence that such requirement is needed to meet unusual and compelling State or local energy interests or water interests. For the purposes of this section, the term “unusual and compelling State or local energy interests or water interests” means interests which are substantially different in nature or magnitude than those prevailing in the U.S. generally, and are such that when evaluated within the context of the State's energy plan and forecast, or water plan and forecast the costs, benefits, burdens, and reliability of energy savings or water savings resulting from the State regulation make such regulation preferable or necessary when measured against the costs, benefits, burdens, and reliability of alternative approaches to energy savings or water savings or production, including reliance on reasonably predictable market-induced improvements in efficiency of all equipment subject to the State regulation. The Secretary may not prescribe such a rule if he finds that interested persons have established, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the State's regulation will significantly burden manufacturing, marketing, distribution, sale or servicing of the covered equipment on a national basis. In determining whether to make such a finding, the Secretary shall evaluate all relevant factors including: the extent to which the State regulation will increase manufacturing or distribution costs of manufacturers, distributors, and others; the extent to which the State regulation will disadvantage smaller manufacturers, distributors, or dealers or lessen competition in the sale of the covered product in the State; the extent to which the State regulation would cause a burden to manufacturers to redesign and produce the covered product type (or class), taking into consideration the extent to which the regulation would result in a reduction in the current models, or in the projected availability of models, that could be shipped on the effective date of the regulation to the State and within the U.S., or in the current or projected sales volume of the covered product type (or class) in the State and the U.S.; and the extent to which the State regulation is likely to contribute significantly to a proliferation of State appliance efficiency requirements and the cumulative impact such requirements would have. The Secretary may not prescribe such a rule if he finds that such a rule will result in the unavailability in the State of any covered product (or class) of performance characteristics (including reliability), features, sizes, capacities, and volumes that are substantially the same as those generally available in the State at the time of the Secretary's finding. The failure of some classes (or types) to meet this criterion shall not affect the Secretary's determination of whether to prescribe a rule for other classes (or types).
(1)
Requirements of petition for exemption from preemption.
A petition from a State for a rule for exemption from preemption shall include the information listed in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) through (a)(1)(vi) of this section. A petition for a rule and correspondence relating to such petition shall be available for public review except for confidential or proprietary information submitted in accordance with the Department of Energy's Freedom of Information Regulations set forth in 10 CFR part 1004:
(i) The name, address, and telephone number of the petitioner;
(ii) A copy of the State standard for which a rule exempting such standard is sought;
(iii) A copy of the State's energy plan or water plan and forecast;

(vi) Such other information as the Secretary may require.
(2) [Reserved]
(b)
Criteria for exemption from preemption when energy emergency conditions or
water emergency conditions (in the case of faucets, showerheads, water closets, and urinals) exist within State.
Upon petition by a State which has prescribed an energy conservation standard or water conservation standard (in the case of faucets, showerheads, water closets, and urinals) or other requirement for a type or class of covered product for which a Federal energy conservation standard or water conservation standard is applicable, the Secretary may prescribe a rule, effective upon publication in the
Federal Register,
that such State regulation not be preempted if he determines that in addition to meeting the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section the State has established that: an energy emergency condition or water emergency condition exists within the State that imperils the health, safety, and welfare of its residents because of the inability of the State or utilities within the State to provide adequate quantities of gas, electric energy, or water to its residents at less than prohibitive costs; and cannot be substantially alleviated by the importation of energy or water or the use of interconnection agreements; and the State regulation is necessary to alleviate substantially such condition.
(1)
Requirements of petition for exemption from preemption when energy emergency conditions or water emergency conditions (in the case of faucets, showerheads, water closets, and urinals) exist within a State.
A petition from a State for a rule for exemption from preemption when energy emergency conditions or water emergency conditions exist within a State shall include the information listed in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) through (a)(1)(vi) of this section. A petition shall also include the information prescribed in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (b)(1)(iv) of this section, and shall be available for public review except for confidential or proprietary information submitted in accordance with the Department of Energy's Freedom of Information Regulations set forth in 10 CFR part 1004:
(i) A description of the energy emergency condition or water emergency condition (in the case of faucets, showerheads, water closets, and urinals) which exists within the State, including causes and impacts.
(ii) A description of emergency response actions taken by the State and utilities within the State to alleviate the emergency condition;
(iii) An analysis of why the emergency condition cannot be alleviated substantially by importation of energy or water or the use of interconnection agreements; and
(iv) An analysis of how the State standard can alleviate substantially such emergency condition.
(2) [Reserved]
(c)
Criteria for withdrawal of a rule exempting a State standard.
Any person subject to a State standard which, by rule, has been exempted from Federal preemption and which prescribes an energy conservation standard or water conservation standard (in the case of faucets, showerheads, water closets, and urinals) or other requirement for a type or class of a covered product, when the Federal energy conservation standard or water conservation standard (in the case of faucets, showerheads, water closets, and urinals) for such product subsequently is amended, may petition the Secretary requesting that the exemption rule be withdrawn. The Secretary shall consider such petition in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, except that the burden shall be on the petitioner to demonstrate that the exemption rule received by the State should be withdrawn as a result of the amendment to the Federal standard. The Secretary shall withdraw such rule if he determines that the petitioner has shown the rule should be withdrawn.
(1)
Requirements of petition to withdraw a rule exempting a State standard.
A petition for a rule to withdraw a rule exempting a State standard shall include the information prescribed in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (c)(1)(vii) of this section, and shall be available for public review, except for confidential or proprietary information submitted in accordance with the Department of Energy's Freedom of Information Regulations set forth in 10 CFR part 1004:
(i) The name, address and telephone number of the petitioner;
(ii) A statement of the interest of the petitioner for which a rule withdrawing an exemption is sought;
(iii) A copy of the State standard for which a rule withdrawing an exemption is sought;
(iv) Specification of each type or class of covered product for which a rule withdrawing an exemption is sought;
(v) A discussion of the factors contained in paragraph (a) of this section;
(vi) Such other information, if any, believed to be pertinent by the petitioner; and
(vii) Such other information as the Secretary may require.
