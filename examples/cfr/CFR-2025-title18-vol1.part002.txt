16 U.S.C. 825, 825c, and 825h; 44 U.S.C. 3501
et seq.
§ 125.1
Promulgation.
This Part is prescribed and promulgated as the regulations governing the preservation of records by public utilities subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission and by licensees holding licenses issued by the Commission, to the extent and in the manner set forth therein.
[Order 617, 65 FR 48155, Aug. 7, 2000]
§ 125.2
General instructions.
(a)
Scope of this part.
(1) The regulations in this part apply to all books of account and other records prepared by or on behalf of the public utility or licensee. See item 40 of the schedule (§ 125.3) for those records that come into possession of the public utility or licensee in connection with the acquisition of property, such as purchase, consolidation, merger, etc.
(2) The regulations in this part should not be construed as excusing compliance with other lawful requirements of any other governmental body, Federal or State, prescribing other record keeping requirements or for preservation of records longer than those prescribed in this part.
(3) To the extent that any Commission regulations may provide for a different retention period, the records should be retained for the longer of the retention periods.
(4) Records other than those listed in the schedule may be destroyed at the option of the public utility or licensee:
Provided, however,
That records which are used in lieu of those listed shall be preserved for the periods prescribed for the records used for substantially similar purposes. And,
provided further,
That retention of records pertaining to added services, functions, plant, etc., the establishment of which cannot be presently foreseen, shall conform to the principles embodied herein.
(5) Notwithstanding the provisions of the Records Retention Schedule, the Commission may, upon the request of the Company, authorize a shorter period of retention for any record listed therein upon a showing by the Company that preservation of such record for a longer period is not necessary or
appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors or consumers.
(b)
Designation of supervisory official.
Each public utility or licensee subject to the regulations in this part shall designate one or more persons with official responsibility to supervise the utility's or licensee's program for preservation and the authorized destruction of its records.
(c)
Protection and storage of records.
The public utility or licensee shall provide reasonable protection for records subject to the regulations in this part from damage by fire, floods, and other hazards and, in the selection of storage spaces, safeguards the records from unnecessary exposure to deterioration from excessive humidity, dryness, or lack of proper ventilation.
(d)
Record storage media.
Each public utility and licensee has the flexibility to select its own storage media subject to the following conditions.
(1) The storage media must have a life expectancy at least equal to the applicable record retention period provided in § 125.3 unless there is a quality transfer from one media to another with no loss of data.
(2) Each public utility and licensee is required to implement internal control procedures that assure the reliability of, and ready access to, data stored on machine readable media. Internal control procedures must be documented by a responsible supervisory official.
(3) Each transfer of data from one media to another must be verified for accuracy and documented. Software and hardware required to produce readable records must be retained for the same period the media format is used.
(e)
Destruction of records.
At the expiration of the retention period, public utilities and licensees may use any appropriate method to destroy records.
(f)
Premature destruction or loss of records.
When records are destroyed or lost before the expiration of the prescribed period of retention, a certified statement listing, as far as may be determined, the records destroyed and describing the circumstances of accidental or other premature destruction or loss must be filed with the Commission within ninety (90) days from the date of discovery of the destruction.
(g)
Schedule of records and periods of retention.
(1) Records related to plant in service must be retained until the facilities are permanently removed from utility service, all removal and restoration activities are completed, and all costs are retired from the accounting records unless accounting adjustments resulting from reclassification and original costs studies have been approved by the regulatory commission having jurisdiction. If the plant is sold, the associated records or copies thereof, must be transferred to the new owners.
(2) Records related to hydroelectric facilities and additions, retirements, and betterments thereto must be retained until:
(i) The Commission has determined the actual legitimate original cost of the facilities, or the licenses are surrendered. If the plant is sold, the associated records or copies thereof, must be transferred to the new owners.
(ii) Records related to the determination of amortization reserves pursuant to section 10(d) of the Federal Power Act must be retained until a final determination and adjudication of the amortization reserves are made.
(h)
Retention periods designated “Destroy at option”.
“Destroy at option” constitutes authorization for destruction of records at managements' discretion if it does not conflict with other legal retention requirements or usefulness of such records in satisfying pending regulatory actions or directives.
(i)
Records of services performed by associated companies.
Public utilities and licensees must assure the availability of records of services performed by and for associated or affiliated companies with supporting cost information for the periods indicated in § 125.3 as necessary to be able to readily furnish detailed information as to the nature of the transaction, the amounts involved, and the accounts used to record the transactions.
(j)
Index of records.
Public utilities and licensees must arrange, file, and index records so records may be readily identified and made available to Commission representatives.
(k)

§ 152.1
Exemption applications and blanket certificates.
(a) Application for exemption from the provisions of the Natural Gas Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission issued pursuant thereto may be made by any person as defined in the Natural Gas Act engaged in, or authorized to engage in the transportation in interstate commerce or the sale in interstate commerce for resale, of natural gas received by such applicant from another person within or at the boundary of a State, if all of the natural gas so received is ultimately consumed in such State:
Provided,
That the natural-gas rates (including rates for sales for resale) and service of the applicant and its natural-gas facilities are subject to regulation by a State Commission, as defined in the Natural Gas Act, and that such State Commission is exercising that jurisdiction.
(b)(1)(i) For purposes of the Commission's regulations implementing the Natural Gas Act, “vehicular natural gas” or “VNG” means natural gas that will be used, in either a gaseous or liquefied state, as fuel in any self-propelled vehicle.
(ii) For purposes of the Commission's regulations implementing the Natural Gas Act, vehicular natural gas, or VNG, is deemed to be ultimately consumed in the state in which the gas is physically delivered into the vehicle's fuel tank regardless of whether the tank is attached to the vehicle at the time it is filled.
(2)(i) Blanket certificates of public convenience and necessity are issued pursuant to section 7(c) of the Natural Gas Act to all persons that engage in sales for resale of VNG that are subject to the Commission's authority under section 1(b) of the NGA, such authorization to be effective upon that person's engagement in the jurisdictional sale. A blanket certificate issued under this paragraph (b)(2)(i) is a certificate of limited jurisdiction which will not subject the certificate holder to any other regulation under the Natural Gas Act jurisdiction of the Commission by virtue of transactions under the certificate. Such certificate will not impair the continued validity of any Natural Gas Act exemption from Commission jurisdiction.
(ii) A blanket certificate issued under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section authorizes the holder to make sales of VNG for resale in interstate commerce at market rates.
(iii) Abandonment of the sales service authorized in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section is authorized pursuant to section 7(b) of the Natural Gas Act upon the expiration of the contractual term or upon termination of each individual sales arrangement.

Applicability of exemption.
Nothing in this part shall be construed to relieve any person exempted from the provisions of the Natural Gas Act by section 1(c) thereof from compliance with valid State regulatory requirements. If an exemption from the provisions of the Natural Gas Act is effective pursuant to section 1(c), the exempted person shall be responsible for calling to the attention of the State Commission by which it is regulated and of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission any future operations in which it may engage which may make the exemption inapplicable to it. The exempted person shall also be responsible for calling to the attention of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission any changes, amendment, or judicial or administrative interpretation of the State law pursuant to which it is regulated, which may make the exemption inapplicable to it.

§ 154.303
Test periods.
Statements A through M, O, P, and supporting schedules, in § 154.312 and § 154.313, must be based upon a test period.
(a) If the natural gas company has been in operation for 12 months on the filing date, then the test period consists of a base period followed by an adjustment period.
(1) The base period consists of 12 consecutive months of the most recently available actual experience. The last day of the base period may not be more than 4 months prior to the filing date.
(2) The adjustment period is a period of up to 9 months immediately following the base period.
(3) The test period may not extend more than 9 months beyond the filing date.
(4) The rate factors (volumes, costs, and billing determinants) established during the base period may be adjusted for changes in revenues and costs which are known and measurable with reasonable accuracy at the time of the filing and which will become effective within the adjustment period. The base period factors must be adjusted to eliminate nonrecurring items. The company may adjust its base period factors to normalize items eliminated as nonrecurring.
(b) If the natural gas company has not been in operation for 12 months on the filing date, then the test period must consist of 12 consecutive months ending not more than one year after the filing date. Rate factors may be adjusted as in paragraph (a)(4) of this section but must not be adjusted for occurrences anticipated after the 12-month period.
(c)(1) Adjustments to base period experience, or to estimates where 12 months' experience is not available, may include the costs for facilities for which either a permanent or temporary certificate has been granted, provided such facilities will be in service within the test period; or a certificate application is pending. The filing must identify facilities, related costs and the docket number of each such outstanding certificate. Subject to paragraph (c)(2) of this section, adjustments to base period experience, or to estimates where 12 months' experience is not available, may include any amounts for facilities that require a certificate of public convenience and necessity, where a certificate has not been issued by the filing date but is expected to be issued before the end of the test period. Adjustments to base period may include costs for facilities that do not require a certificate and are in service by the end of the test period.
(2) When a pipeline files a motion to place the rates into effect, the filing must be revised to exclude the costs associated with any facilities that will not be in service as of the end of the test period, or for which certificate authorization is required but will not be granted as of the end of the test period. At the end of the test period, the pipeline must remove from its rates costs associated with any facility that is not in service or for which certificate authority is required but has not been granted.
(d) The Commission may allow reasonable deviation from the prescribed test period.

§ 154.305
Tax normalization.
(a)
Applicability.
An interstate pipeline must compute the income tax component of its cost-of-service by using tax normalization for all transactions.
(b)
Definitions.
(1)
Tax normalization
means computing the income tax component as if transactions recognized in each period for ratemaking purposes are also recognized in the same amount and in the same period for income tax purposes.
(2)
Commission-approved ratemaking
method means a ratemaking method approved by the Commission in a final decision. This includes a ratemaking method that is part of an approved settlement or arbitration providing that the ratemaking method is to be effective beyond the term of the settlement or arbitration.
(3)
Income tax purposes
means for the purpose of computing actual income tax under the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code or the income tax provisions of the laws of a State or political subdivision of a State (including franchise taxes).
(4)
Income tax component
means that part of the cost-of-service that covers income tax expenses allowable by the Commission.
(5)
Ratemaking purposes
means for the purpose of fixing, modifying, accepting, approving, disapproving, or rejecting rates under the Natural Gas Act.
(6)
Tax effect
means the tax reduction or addition associated with a specific expense or revenue transaction.
(7)
Transaction
means an activity or event that gives rise to an accounting entry.
(c)
Reduction of, and addition to, Rate Base.
(1) The rate base of an interstate pipeline using tax normalization under this section must be reduced by the balances that are properly recordable in Account 281, “Accumulated deferred income taxes-accelerated amortization property”; Account 282, “Accumulated
deferred income taxes—other property”: and Account 283, “Accumulated deferred income taxes—other.” Balances that are properly recordable in Account 190, “Accumulated deferred income taxes,” must be treated as an addition to rate base. Include, as an addition or reduction, as appropriate, amounts in Account 182.3, Other regulatory assets, and Account 254, Other regulatory liabilities, that result from a deficiency or excess in the deferred tax accounts (see paragraph (d) of this section) and which have been, or are soon expected to be, authorized for recovery or refund through rates.
(2) Such rate base reductions or additions must be limited to deferred taxes related to rate base, construction, or other costs and revenues affecting jurisdictional cost-of-service.
(d)
Special rules.
(1) This paragraph applies:
(i) If the rate applicant has not provided deferred taxes in the same amount that would have accrued had tax normalization always been applied; or
(ii) If, as a result of changes in tax rates, the accumulated provision for deferred taxes becomes deficient in, or in excess of, amounts necessary to meet future tax liabilities.
(2) The interstate pipeline must compute the income tax component in its cost-of-service by making provision for any excess or deficiency in deferred taxes.
(3) The interstate pipeline must apply a Commission-approved ratemaking method made specifically applicable to the interstate pipeline for determining the cost-of-service provision described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section. If no Commission-approved ratemaking method has been made specifically applicable to the interstate pipeline, then the interstate pipeline must use some ratemaking method for making such provision, and the appropriateness of such method will be subject to case-by-case determination.
(4) An interstate pipeline must continue to include, as an addition or reduction to rate base, any deficiency or excess attributable to prior flow-through or changes in tax rates (paragraphs (d)(1)(i) and (d)(1)(ii) of this section), until such deficiency or excess is fully amortized in accordance with a Commission approved ratemaking method.
§ 154.306
Cash working capital.
A natural gas company that files a tariff change under this part may not receive a cash working capital adjustment to its rate base unless the company or other participant in a rate proceeding under this part demonstrates, with a fully developed and reliable lead-lag study, a net revenue receipt lag or a net expense payment lag (revenue lead). Any demonstrated net revenue receipt lag will be credited to rate base; and, any demonstrated net expense payment lag will be deducted from rate base.
§ 154.307
Joint facilities.
The Statements required by § 154.312 must show all costs (investment, operation, maintenance, depreciation, taxes) that have been allocated to the natural gas operations involved in the subject rate change and are associated with joint facilities.

Incremental expansions.
(a) For every expansion for which incremental rates are charged, the company must provide a summary with applicable cross-references to § 154.312 and § 154.313, of the costs and revenues associated with the expansion, until the Commission authorizes the costs of the incremental facilities to be rolled-in to the pipeline's rates. For every expansion that has an at-risk provision in the certificate authorization, the costs and revenues associated with the facility must be shown in summary format with applicable cross-references to
§ 154.312 and § 154.313, until the Commission removes the at-risk condition.
(b) The summary statements must provide the formulae and explain the bases used in the allocation of common costs to each incremental facility.
§ 154.310
Zones.
If the company maintains records of costs by zone, and proposes a zone rate methodology based on these costs, the statements and schedules in § 154.312 and § 154.313 must reflect costs detailed by zone.
§ 154.311
Updating of statements.
(a) Certain statements and schedules in § 154.312, that include test period data, must be updated with actual data by month and must be resubmitted in the same format and with consecutive monthly totals for each month of the adjustment period with a single set of updates encompassing a 12-month period. The updated statements or schedules must be filed 45 days after the end of the test period. The updated filing must be provided to parties specifically requesting them.

§ 154.401
RD
D expenditures.
(a)
Requirements.
Upon approval by the Commission, a natural gas company may file to recover research, development, and demonstration (RD
D) expenditures in its rates under this subpart.
(b)
Applications for rate treatment approval.
(1) An application for advance approval of rate treatment may be filed by a natural gas company for RD
D expenditures related to a project or group of projects undertaken by the company or as part of a project undertaken by others. When more than one company supports an RD
D organization, the RD
D organization may submit an application that covers the organization's RD
D program. Approval by the Commission of such an RD
D application and program will constitute approval of the individual companies' contributions to the RD
D organization.
(2) An application for advance approval of rate treatment must include a 5-year program plan and must be filed at least 180 days prior to the commencement of the 5-year period of the plan.
(3) A 5-year program plan must include at a minimum:
(i) A statement of the objectives for the 5-year period that relates the objectives to the interests of ratepayers, the public, and the industry and to the objectives of other major research organizations.
(ii) Budget, technical, and schedule information in sufficient detail to explain the work to be performed and allow an assessment of the probability of success and a comparison with other organizations' research plans.
(iii) The commencement date, expected termination date, and expected annual costs for individual RD
D projects to be initiated during the first year of the plan.
(iv) A discussion of the RD
D efforts and progress since the preparation of the program plan submitted the previous year and an explanation of any changes that have been made in objectives, priorities, or budgets since the plan of the previous year.

D projects in such detail as to satisfy the Commission that the RD
D expenditures qualify as valid, justifiable, and reasonable.
(d) Within 120 days of the filing of an application for rate treatment approval and a 5-year program plan, the Commission will state its decision with respect to acceptance, partial acceptance, or rejection of the plan, or, when the complexity of issues in the plan so requires, will set a date certain by which a final decision will be made, or will order the matter set for hearing. Partial rejection of a plan by the Commission will be accompanied by a decision as to the partial level of acceptance which will be proportionally applied to all contributions listed for jurisdictional companies in the plan. Approval by the Commission of a 5-year plan constitutes approval for rate treatment of all projects identified as starting during the first year of the approved plan. Continued rate treatment will depend upon review and evaluation of subsequent annual applications and 5-year program plans.
§ 154.402
ACA expenditures.
(a)
Requirements.
Upon approval by the Commission, a natural gas pipeline company may adjust its rates, annually, to recover from its customers annual charges assessed by the Commission under part 382 of this chapter pursuant to an annual charge adjustment clause (ACA clause). Prior to the start of each fiscal year, the Commission will post on its Web site the amount of annual charges to be flowed through per unit of energy sold or transported (ACA unit charge) for that fiscal year. A company's ACA clause must be filed with the Commission and must incorporate by reference the ACA unit charge for the upcoming fiscal year as posted on the Commission's Web site. A company must incorporate by reference the ACA unit charge posted on the Commission's Web site in each of its rate schedules applicable to sales or transportation deliveries. The company must apply the ACA unit charge posted on the Commission's Web site to the usage component of rate schedules with two-part rates. A company may recover annual charges through an ACA unit charge only if its rates do not otherwise reflect the costs of annual charges assessed by the Commission under § 382.106(a) of this chapter. The applicable annual charge, required by § 382.103 of this chapter, must be paid before the company applies the ACA unit charge. Upon payment to the Commission of its annual charges, the ACA unit charge for that fiscal year will be incorporated by reference into the company's tariff, effective throughout that fiscal year.
(b)
Application for rate treatment authorization.
A company seeking authorization to use an ACA unit charge must file with the Commission a separate ACA tariff record containing:
(1) A statement that the company is collecting an ACA unit charge, as calculated by the Commission, applicable to all the pipeline's sales and transportation rate schedules,
(2) A statement that the ACA unit charge, as revised annually and posted on the Commission's Web site, is incorporated by reference into the company's tariff,
(3) For companies with existing ACA clauses, a proposed effective date of the
tariff change of October 1 of the fiscal year; for companies seeking to utilize an ACA clause after October 1 of the fiscal year, a proposed effective date 30 days after the filing of the tariff record, unless a shorter period is specifically requested in a waiver petition and approved), and
(4) A statement that the pipeline will not recover any annual charges recorded in FERC Account 928 in a proceeding under subpart D of this part.
(c) Changes to the ACA unit charge must be filed annually, to reflect the annual charge unit rate authorized by the Commission each fiscal year.

§ 154.403
Periodic rate adjustments.
(a) This section applies to the passthrough, on a periodic basis, of a single cost item or revenue item for which passthrough is not regulated under another section of this subpart, and to revisions on a periodic basis of a gas reimbursement percentage.
(b) Where a pipeline recovers fuel use and unaccounted-for natural gas in kind, the fuel reimbursement percentage must be stated in the tariff either on the tariff sheet stating the currently effective rate or on a separate tariff sheet or section in such a way that it is clear what amount of natural gas must be tendered in kind for each service rendered.
(c) A natural gas company that passes through a cost or revenue item or adjusts its fuel reimbursement percentage under this section, must state within the general terms and conditions of its tariff, the methodology and timing of any adjustments. The following must be included in the general terms and conditions:
(1) A statement of the nature of the revenue or costs to be flowed through to the customer;
(2) A statement of the manner in which the cost or revenue will be collected or returned, whether through a surcharge, offset, or otherwise;
(3) A statement of which customers are recipients of the revenue credit and which rate schedules are subject to the cost or fuel reimbursement percentage;
(4) A statement of the frequency of the adjustment and the dates on which the adjustment will become effective;
(5) A step-by-step description of the manner in which the amount to be flowed through is calculated and a step-by-step description of the flowthrough mechanism, including how the costs are classified and allocated. Where the adjustment modifies a rate established under subpart D of this part, the methodology must be consistent with the methodology used in the proceeding under subpart D of this part;
(6) Where costs or revenue credits are accumulated over a past period for periodic recovery or return, the past period must be defined and the mechanism for the recovery or return must be detailed on a step-by-step basis. Where the natural gas company proposes to use a surcharge to clear an account in which the difference between costs or revenues, recovered through rates, and actual costs and revenues accumulate, a statement must be included detailing, on a step-by-step basis, the mechanism for calculating the entries to the account and for passing through the account balance.
(7) Where carrying charges are computed, the calculations must be consistent with the methodology and reporting requirements set forth in § 154.501 using the carrying charge rate required by that section. A natural gas company must normalize all income tax timing differences which are the result of differences between the period in which expense or revenue enters into the determination of taxable income and the period in which the expense or revenue enters into the determination of pre-tax book income. Any balance upon which the natural gas company calculates carrying charges must be adjusted for any recorded deferred income taxes.
(8) Where the natural gas company discounts the rate component calculated pursuant to this section, explain on a step-by-step basis how the natural gas company will adjust for rate discounts in its methodology to reflect changes in costs under this section.
(9) If the costs passed through under a mechanism approved under this section are billed by an upstream natural gas company, explain how refunds received from upstream natural gas companies will be passed through to the natural gas company's customers, including the allocation and classification of such refunds;
(10) A step-by-step explanation of the methodology used to reflect changes in the fuel reimbursement percentage, including the allocation and classification of the fuel use and unaccounted-for natural gas. Where the adjustment modifies a fuel reimbursement percentage established under subpart D of this part, the methodology must be consistent with the methodology used in the proceeding under subpart D of this part;
(11) A statement of whether the difference between quantities actually used or lost and the quantities retained from the customers for fuel use and loss will be recovered or returned in a future surcharge. Include a step-by-step explanation of the methodology used to calculate such surcharge. Any period during which these differences accumulate must be defined.
(d)
Filing requirements.
(1) Filings under this section must include:
(i) A summary statement showing the rate component added to each rate schedule with workpapers showing all mathematical calculations.
(ii) If the filing establishes a new fuel reimbursement percentage or surcharge, include computations for each fuel reimbursement or surcharge calculated, broken out by service, classification, area, zone, or other subcategory.
(iii) Workpapers showing the allocation of costs or revenue credits by rate schedule and step-by-step computations supporting the allocation, segregated into reservation and usage amounts, where appropriate.
(iv) Where the costs, revenues, rates, quantities, indices, load factors, percentages, or other numbers used in the calculations are publicly available, include references by source.
(v) Where a rate or quantity underlying the costs or revenue credits is supported by publicly available data (such as another natural gas company's tariff or EBB), the source must be referenced to allow the Commission and interested parties to review the source. If the rate or quantity does not match the rate or quantity from the source referenced, provide step-by-step instructions to tie the rate in the referenced source to the rate in the filing.
(vi) Where a number is derived from another number by applying a load factor, percentage, or other adjusting factor not referenced in paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section, include workpapers and a narrative to explain the calculation of the adjusting factor.
(2) If the natural gas company is adjusting its rates to reflect changes in transportation and compression costs paid to others:
(i) The changes in transportation and compression costs must be based on the rate on file with the Commission. If the rate is not on file with the Commission or a discounted rate is paid, the rate reflected in the filing must be the rate the natural gas company is contractually obligated to pay;
(ii) The filing must include appropriate credits for capacity released under § 284.243 of this chapter with workpapers showing the quantity released, the revenues received from the release, the time period of the release, and the natural gas pipeline on which the release took place; and,
(iii) The filing must include a statement of the refunds received from each upstream natural gas company which are included in the rate adjustment. The statement must conform to the requirements set forth in § 154.501.
(3) If the natural gas company is reflecting changes in its fuel reimbursement percentage, the filing must include:
(i) A summary statement of actual gas inflows and outflows for each month used to calculate the fuel reimbursement percentage or surcharge. For purposes of establishing the surcharge, the summary statement must be included for each month of the period over which the differences defined in paragraph (c) of this section accumulate.
(ii) Where the fuel reimbursement percentage is calculated based on estimated activity over a future period,
the period must be defined and the estimates used in the calculation must be justified. If any of the estimates are publicly available, include a reference to the source.
(4) The natural gas company must not recover costs and is not obligated to return revenues which are applicable to the period pre-dating the effectiveness of the tariff language setting forth the periodic rate change mechanism, unless permitted or required to do so by the Commission.

Order 2005, 70 FR 8286, Feb. 18, 2005, unless otherwise noted.
§ 157.30
Purpose.
This subpart establishes the procedures for conducting open seasons for the purpose of making binding commitments for the acquisition of initial or voluntary expansion capacity on Alaska natural gas transportation projects, as defined herein.
§ 157.31
Definitions.
(a) “Alaska natural gas transportation project” means any natural gas pipeline system that carries Alaska natural gas to the international border between Alaska and Canada (including related facilities subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission) that is authorized under the Alaska Natural Gas Transportation Act of 1976 or section 103 of the Alaska Natural Gas Pipeline Act.
(b) “Commission” means the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.
(c) “Voluntary expansion” means any expansion in capacity of an Alaska natural gas transportation project above the initial certificated capacity, including any increase in mainline capacity, any extension of mainline pipeline facilities, and any lateral pipeline facilities beyond those certificated in the initial certificate order, voluntarily made by the pipeline. An expansion done pursuant to section 105 of the Alaska Natural Gas Pipeline Act is not a voluntary expansion.
§ 157.32
Applicability.
These regulations shall apply to any application to the Commission for a certificate of public convenience and necessity or other authorization for an Alaska natural gas transportation project, whether filed pursuant to the Natural Gas Act, the Alaska Natural Gas Transportation Act of 1976, or the Alaska Natural Gas Pipeline Act, and to applications for expansion of such projects. Absent a Commission order to the contrary, these regulations are not applicable in the case of an expansion ordered by the Commission pursuant to section 105 of the Alaska Natural Gas Pipeline Act.
§ 157.33
Requirement for open season.
(a) Any application for a certificate of public convenience and necessity or
other authorization for a proposed Alaska natural gas transportation project must include a demonstration that the applicant has conducted an open season for capacity on its proposed project, in accordance with the requirements of this subpart. Failure to provide the requisite demonstration will result in an application being rejected as incomplete.
(b) Initial capacity on a proposed Alaska natural gas transportation project may be acquired prior to an open season through pre-subscription agreements, provided that in any open season as required in paragraph (a) of this section, capacity is offered to all prospective bidders at the same rates and on the same terms and conditions as contained in the pre-subscription agreements. All pre-subscription agreements shall be made public by posting on Internet websites and press releases within ten days of their execution. In the event there is more than one such agreement, all prospective bidders shall be allowed the option of selecting among the several agreements all of the rates, terms and conditions contained in any one such agreement.

The following procedures apply to any certificate holder which undertakes a project to be authorized under a blanket certificate issued pursuant to subparts E or F of part 157 and to any other service subject to § 157.206(b) of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's (Commission) regulations.
Pursuant to § 157.206(b)(7) of the Commission's regulations, the certificate holder shall, upon acceptance of its blanket certificate, be designated as the Commission's non-Federal representative to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) in order to conduct informal consultations with those agencies. For purposes of this appendix, “listed species” and “critical habitat” shall have the same meanings as set forth in 50 CFR 402.02. The certificate holder shall be deemed in compliance with § 157.206(b)(2)(vi) of the Commission's regulations only if, prior to constructing facilities or abandoning facilities by removal under the blanket certificate, it complies with the following procedures:
1. The certificate holder shall contact the appropriate regional office of either the FWS or the NMFS (or both the FWS and the NMFS, if appropriate) as determined pursuant to 50 CFR 402.01 for the purpose of initiating informal consultations.
2. The certificate holder shall be deemed in compliance with § 157.206(b)(2)(vi) of the Commission's regulations if the consulted agency (either the FWS or NMFS, or both if appropriate) initially determines, pursuant to the informal consultations:
(a) That no listed species or its critical habitat occur in the project area; and
(b) That no species proposed to be listed under 16 U.S.C. 1533 or its critical habitat occur in the project area.
3. If the consulted agency, pursuant to the informal consultations, initially determines that any species proposed to be listed under 16 U.S.C. 1533 or its critical habitat occur in the project area, then the certificate holder shall confer with the consulted agency on how potential impact can be avoided or reduced. Upon completion of the conference and the implementation of any mitigating measures the certificate holder elects to implement, and compliance with paragraph 4 of this Appendix, if applicable, the certificate holder shall be deemed in compliance with § 157.206(b)(2)(vi) of the Commission's regulations.
4. (a) If the consulted agency initially determines, pursuant to the informal consultations, that a listed species or its critical habitat may occur in the project area, then the certificate holder shall continue informal consultation with the consulted agency to determine if the proposed project may affect such species or habitat. Continued informal consultations may include discussions with experts (including experts provided by the consulted agency), field surveys, biological assessments, and formulation of mitigation measures.
(b) The certificate holder shall be deemed in compliance with § 157.206(b)(2)(vi) of the Commission's regulations if the consulted agency agrees with the certificate holder's
determination resulting from the continued informal consultations, that the proposed project is not likely to adversely affect a listed species or critical habitat, or that no further consultation is necessary.
(c) If the consulted agency does not agree with such determination by the certificate holder, or if the certificate holder concludes that the proposed project may affect listed species or the critical habitat of such species, then the certificate holder may not proceed with the proposed project under the blanket certificate.

The following procedures apply to any certificate holder which undertakes a project under the authority of a blanket certificate issued pursuant to subparts E or F of part 157 and to any other service subject to § 157.206(b) of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's (Commission) regulations. For the purposes of this appendix, the following definitions apply:
(a) “Listed property” means any district, site, building, structure or object which is listed (1) on the National Register of Historic Places, or (2) in the
Federal Register
as a property determined to be eligible for inclusion on the National Register.
(b) “SHPO” means the State Historic Preservation Officer or any alternative person duly designated, in accordance with section (1)(b) of Appendix II to Subpart F, to advise on cultural resource matters.
(c) “Unlisted property” means any district, site, building, structure or object which is not a listed property.
(d) “THPO” means the Tribal Historic Preservation Officer, as defined at 36 CFR 800.2(c)(2).
The certificate holder shall be deemed to be in compliance with § 157.206(b)(2)(iii) of the Commission's regulations only if, prior to constructing facilities or abandoning facilities by removal under the blanket certificate, it complies with the following procedures:
(1)(a) If federally administered land would be directly affected by the project, then the procedures used by the appropriate Tribal or Federal land managing agency to comply with section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, 16 U.S.C. 470f, shall take precedence over these procedures. The procedures in this appendix apply to State and private lands, and Federal lands for which there are no other Federal procedures.
(b) If there is no SHPO, or THPO, if appropriate, or if the SHPO, or THPO, as appropriate, declines to consult with the certificate holder, the certificate holder shall so inform the environmental staff of the Office of Energy Projects and shall not proceed with these procedures or the project until an alternate consultant has been duly designated.
(2) It shall be the certificate holder's responsibility to identify or cause to be identified listed properties and unlisted properties that satisfy the National Register Criteria for Evaluation (36 CFR 1202.6), that are located within the area of the project's potential environmental impact and that may be affected by the undertaking.
(3) The certificate holder shall:
(a) Check the National Register of Historic Places and consult with the SHPO, or THPO, as appropriate, to identify all listed properties within the area of the project's potential environmental impact;
(b) Consult with the SHPO, or THPO, as appropriate, and to the extent deemed appropriate by the SHPO, or THPO, as appropriate, check public records and consult with other individuals and organizations with historical and cultural expertise, to determine whether unlisted properties that satisfy the National Register Criteria for Evaluation are known or likely to occur within the area of the project's potential environmental impact; and
(c) Consult with the SHPO, or THPO, as appropriate, to determine the need for surveys to identify unknown unlisted properties. The certificate holder shall evaluate the eligibility of any known unlisted properties located within the area of the project's potential environmental impact according to the National Register Criteria for Evaluation.
(4) The certificate holder shall be deemed in compliance with § 157.206(b)(2)(iii) of the Commission's regulations if the SHPO, or THPO, as appropriate, agrees with the certificate holder that no survey is required, and that no listed properties or unlisted properties that satisfy the National Register Criteria for Evaluation occur in the area of the project's potential environmental impact.
(5) If the SHPO, or THPO, as appropriate, determines that surveys are required to ensure that no listed properties, or unlisted properties that satisfy the National Register Criteria for Evaluation, occur within the area of the project's potential environmental impact, the certificate holder shall perform surveys deemed by the SHPO, or THPO, as appropriate, to be of sufficient scope and intensity to identify and evaluate such properties. The certificate holder shall submit the results of the surveys including a statement as to which unlisted properties satisfy
the National Register Criteria for Evaluation, to the SHPO and solicit comments on the surveys and the conclusions.
(6) The certificate holder shall be deemed in compliance with § 157.206(b)(2)(iii) of the Commission's regulations if, upon conclusion of the surveys, the certificate holder and the SHPO, or THPO, as appropriate, agree that no listed properties, and no unlisted properties which satisfy the National Register Criteria for Evaluation, occur in the area of the project's potential environmental impact.
(7) For each listed property, and each unlisted property which satisfies the National Register Criteria for Evaluation, which is located within the area of the project's potential environmental impact, the certificate holder, in consultation with the SHPO, or THPO, as appropriate, shall apply the Criteria of Effect (36 CFR 800.5) to determine whether the project will have an effect upon the historical, architectural, archeological, or cultural characteristics of the property that qualified it to meet National Register Criteria for Evaluation. The certificate holder shall be deemed in compliance with § 157.206(b)(2)(iii) of the Commission's regulations if the certificate holder and the SHPO, or THPO, as appropriate, agree that the project will not affect these characteristics.
(8) If either the certificate holder or the SHPO, or THPO, as appropriate, finds that the project may affect a listed property or an unlisted property which satisfies the National Register Criteria for Evaluation, located within the area of the project's potential environmental impact, then the project shall not be authorized under the blanket certificate unless such properties can be avoided by relocation of the project to an area where the SHPO, or THPO, as appropriate, agrees that no listed properties or unlisted properties that satisfy the National Register Criteria for Evaluation occur. The certificate holder shall be deemed in compliance with § 157.206(b)(2)(iii) of the Commission's regulations if the project is relocated as described above.
(9) If the certificate holder and the SHPO, or THPO, as appropriate, are unable to agree upon the need for a survey, the adequacy of a survey, or the results of application of the National Register Criteria for Evaluation to an unlisted property, the project shall not be authorized under the blanket certificate.

# Disposition of Contested Audit Findings and Proposed Remedies
§ 158.1
Notice to audited person.
An audit conducted by the Commission's staff under authority of the Natural Gas Act may result in a notice of deficiency or audit report or similar document containing a finding or findings that the audited person has not complied with a requirement of the Commission with respect to, but not limited to, the following: A filed tariff or tariffs, contracts, data, records, accounts, books, communications or papers relevant to the audit of the audited person; matters under the Standards of Conduct or the Code of Conduct; and the activities or operations of the audited person. The notice of deficiency, audit report or similar document may also contain one or more proposed remedies that address findings of noncompliance. Where such findings, with or without proposed remedies, appear in a notice of deficiency, audit report or similar document, such document shall be provided to the audited person, and the finding or findings, and any proposed remedies, shall be noted and explained. The audited person shall timely indicate in a written response any and all findings
or proposed remedies, or both, in any combination, with which the audited person disagrees. The audited person shall have 15 days from the date it is sent the notice of deficiency, audit report or similar document to provide a written response to the audit staff indicating any and all findings or proposed remedies, or both, in any combination, with which the audited person disagrees, and such further time as the audit staff may provide in writing to the audited person at the time the document is sent to the audited person. The audited person may move the Commission for additional time to provide a written response to the audit staff and such motion shall be granted for good cause shown. Any initial order that the Commission subsequently may issue with respect to the notice of deficiency, audit report or similar document shall note, but not address on the merits, the finding or findings, or the proposed remedy or remedies, or both, in any combination, with which the audited person disagreed. The Commission shall provide the audited person 30 days to respond to the initial Commission order concerning a notice of deficiency, audit report or similar document with respect to the finding or findings or any proposed remedy or remedies, or both, in any combination, with which it disagreed.
[Order 675-A, 71 FR 29784, May 24, 2006]
§ 158.2
Response to notification.
Upon issuance of a Commission order that notes a finding or findings, or proposed remedy or remedies, or both, in any combination, with which the audited person has disagreed, the audited person may: Acquiesce in the findings and/or proposed remedies by not timely responding to the Commission order, in which case the Commission may issue an order approving them or taking other action; or challenge the finding or findings and/or any proposed remedies, with which it disagreed by timely notifying the Commission in writing that it requests Commission review by means of a shortened procedure or, if there are material facts in dispute which require cross-examination, a trial-type hearing.
[Order 675, 71 FR 9706, Feb. 27, 2006]
§ 158.3
Shortened procedure.
If the audited person subject to a Commission order described in § 158.1 notifies the Commission that it seeks to challenge one or more audit findings, or proposed remedies, or both, in any combination, by the shortened procedure, the Commission shall thereupon issue a notice setting a schedule for the filing of memoranda. The person electing the use of the shortened procedure, and any other interested entities, including the Commission staff, shall file, within 45 days of the notice, an initial memorandum that addresses the relevant facts and applicable law that support the position or positions taken regarding the matters at issue. Reply memoranda shall be filed within 20 days of the date by which the initial memoranda are due to be filed. Only participants who filed initial memoranda may file reply memoranda. Subpart T of part 385 of this chapter shall apply to all filings. Within 20 days after the last date that reply memoranda under the shortened procedure may be timely filed, the audited person who elected the shortened procedure may file a motion with the Commission requesting a trial-type hearing if new issues are raised by a party. To prevail in such a motion, the audited person must show that a party to the shortened procedure raised one or more new issues of material fact relevant to resolution of a matter in the shortened procedure such that fundamental fairness requires a trial-type hearing to resolve the new issue or issues so raised. Parties to the shortened procedure and the Commission staff may file responses to the motion. In ruling upon the motion, the Commission may determine that some or all of the issues be litigated in a trial-type hearing.
[Order 675, 71 FR 9706, Feb. 27, 2006]
§ 158.4
Form and style.
Each memoranda must be complete in itself. All pertinent data should be set forth fully, and each memorandum should set out the facts and argument as prescribed for briefs in § 385.706 of this chapter.
[Order 141, 12 FR 8603, Dec. 19, 1947, as amended by Order 225, 47 FR 19057, May 3, 1982]
§ 158.5
Verification.
The facts stated in the memorandum must be sworn to by persons having knowledge thereof, which latter fact must affirmatively appear in the affidavit. Except under unusual circumstances, such persons should be those who would appear as witnesses if hearing were had to testify as to the facts stated in the memorandum.
§ 158.6
Determination.
If no formal hearing is had the matter in issue will be determined by the Commission on the basis of the facts and arguments submitted.
§ 158.7
Assignment for oral hearing.
In case consent to the shortened procedure is not given, or if at any stage of the proceeding prior to the submission of the case to the Commission any party in interest requests a hearing, the proceeding will be assigned for hearing as provided for by subpart E of part 385 of this chapter. The Commission may also in its discretion set the proceeding for hearing on its own motion at any stage thereof.
[Order 141, 12 FR 8603, Dec. 19, 1947, as amended by Order 225, 47 FR 19057, May 3, 1982]
§ 158.8
Burden of proof.
The burden of proof to justify every accounting entry shall be on the person making, authorizing, or requiring such entry.

# Certification of Compliance with Accounting Regulations
§ 158.10
Examination of accounts.
All natural gas companies not classified as Class C or Class D prior to January 1, 1984 shall secure for each year, the services of an independent certified public accountant, or independent licensed public accountant (licensed on or before December 31, 1970), certified or licensed by a regulatory authority of a State or other political subdivision of the United States, to test compliance in all material respects of those schedules that are indicated in the General Instructions set out in the applicable Annual Report, Form No. 2 or Form No. 2-A, with the Commission's Uniform System of Accounts and published accounting releases. The Commission expects that identification of questionable matters by the independent accountant will facilitate their early resolution and that the independent accountant will seek advisory rulings by the Commission on such items. This examination shall be deemed supplementary to periodic Commission examinations of compliance.
[Order 581, 60 FR 53065, Oct. 11, 1995]
§ 158.11
Report of certification.
Each natural gas company not classified as Class C or Class D prior to January 1, 1984 must file with the Commission by May 18 of the following calendar year, a letter or report of the independent accountant certifying approval, covering the subjects and in the format prescribed in the General Instructions of the applicable Form No. 2 or Form No. 2-A. The letter or report must also identify which, if any, of the examined schedules do not conform to the Commission's requirements and must describe the discrepancies that exist. The Commission will not be bound by the certification of compliance made by an independent accountant under this paragraph.
[Order 710, 73 FR 19399, Apr. 10, 2008]
§ 158.12
Qualifications of accountants.
The Commission will recognize only independent certified public accountants, or independent licensed public accountants who were licensed on or before December 31, 1970, who are in fact independent. For example, an accountant will not be considered independent with respect to any person or any of its parents or subsidiaries in who he has, or had during the period of report, any direct financial interest. The Commission will determine the fact of independence by considering all the relevant circumstances including evidence bearing on the relationships between the accountant and that person or any affiliate thereof.

Production, transmission, and distribution plant.
For the purposes of this system of accounts:
A.
Production system
shall consist of plant and equipment used in the production of gas. It shall include producing lands and leaseholds, gas rights, other land rights, structures, drilling and clearing equipment, gas wells, well head equipment, separation and other facilities used in the production of natural gas. The production system ends where the gas enters a gathering system, transmission system or distribution system, as applicable, in accordance with the practices in the pricing area where such system is located.
B.
Transmission system
means the land, structures, mains, valves, meters, boosters, regulators, tanks, compressors, and their driving units and appurtenances, and other equipment used primarily for transmitting gas from a production plant, delivery point of purchased gas, gathering system, storage area, or other wholesale source of gas, to one or more distribution areas. The transmission system begins at the outlet side of the valve at the connection to the last equipment in a manufactured gas plant, the connection to gathering lines or delivery point of purchased gas, and includes the equipment at such connection that is used to bring the gas to transmission pressure, and ends at the outlet side of the equipment which meters or regulates the entry of gas into the distribution system or into a storage area. It does not include storage land, structures or equipment. Pipeline companies, including those companies which measure deliveries of gas to their own distribution systems, shall include city gate and main line industrial measuring and
regulating stations in the transmission function.
C.
Distribution system
means the mains which are provided primarily for distributing gas within a distribution area, together with land, structures, valves, regulators, services and measuring devices, including the mains for transportation of gas from production plants or points of receipt located within such distribution area to other points therein. The distribution system owned by companies having no transmission facilities connected to such distribution system begins at the inlet side of the distribution system equipment which meters or regulates the entry of gas into the distribution system and ends with and includes property on the customer's premises. For companies which own both transmission and distribution facilities on a continuous line, the distribution system begins at the outlet side of the equipment which meters or regulates the entry of gas into the distribution system and ends with and includes property on the customer's premises. The distribution system does not include storage land, structures, or equipment.
D.
Distribution area
means a metropolitan area or other urban area comprising one or more adjacent or nearby cities, villages or unincorporated areas, including developed areas contiguous to main highways.
30.
Property retired,
as applied to gas plant, means property which has been removed, sold, abandoned, destroyed, or which for any cause has been withdrawn from service.
31.
Regulatory Assets and Liabilities
are assets and liabilities that result from rate actions of regulatory agencies. Regulatory assets and liabilities arise from specific revenues, expenses, gains, or losses that would have been included in net income determinations in one period under the general requirements of the Uniform System of Accounts but for it being probable: 1) that such items will be included in a different period(s) for purposes of developing the rates the utility is authorized to charge for its utility services; or 2) in the case of regulatory liabilities, that refunds to customers, not provided for in other accounts, will be required.
32. A.
Replacing
or
replacement,
when not otherwise indicated in the context, means the construction or installation of gas plant in place of property retired, together with the removal of the property retired.
B.
Research, Development, and Demonstration
(RD
D), means expenditures incurred by natural gas companies either directly or through another person or organization (such as research institute, industry association, foundation, university, engineering company, or similar contractor) in pursuing research, development, and demonstration activities including experiment, design, installation, construction, or operation. This definition includes expenditures for the implementation or development of new and/or existing concepts until technically feasible and commercially feasible operations are verified. Such research, development, and demonstration costs should be reasonably related to the existing or future utility business, broadly defined, of the public utility or licensee or in the environment in which it operates or expects to operate. The term includes, but is not limited to: All such costs incidental to the design, development or implementation of an experimental facility, a plant process, a product, a formula, an invention, a system or similar items, and the improvement of already existing items of a like nature; amounts expended in connection with the proposed development and/or proposed delivery of substitute or synthetic gas supplies (alternate fuel sources for example, an experimental coal gasification plant or an experimental plant synthetically producing gas from liquid hydrocarbons); and the costs of obtaining its own patent, such as attorney's fees expended in making and perfecting a patent application. The term includes preliminary investigations and detailed planning of specific projects for securing for customers non-conventional pipeline gas supplies that rely on technology that has not been verified previously to be feasible. The term does not include expenditures for efficiency surveys; studies of management, management techniques and organization; consumer surveys, advertising, promotions, or items of a like nature.
33.
Retained earnings
(formerly earned surplus) means the accumulated net income of the utility less distribution to stockholders and transfers to other capital accounts.
34.
Retirement units
means those items of gas plant which, when retired, with or without replacement, are accounted for by crediting the book cost thereof to the gas plant account in which included.
35.
Salvage value
means the amount received for property retired, less any expenses incurred in connection with the sale or in preparing the property for sale; or, if retained, the amount at which the material recoverable is chargeable to Materials and Supplies, or other appropriate account.
36.
Service life
means the time between the date gas plant is includible in gas plant in service, or gas plant leased to others, and the date of its retirement. If depreciation is accounted for on a production basis rather than on a time basis, then service life should be measured in terms of the appropriate unit of production.
37.
Service value
means the difference between original cost and net salvage value of gas plant.
38.
Unsuccessful exploration and development costs,
means exploration and development costs related to efforts which do not directly result in the discovery of commercially recoverable hydrocarbon reserves.
39.
Subsidiary company,
means a company which is controlled by the utility through ownership of voting stock. (See “Definitions”—item 5B “Control”). A corporate joint venture in which a corporation is owned by a small group of businesses as a separate and specific business or project for the mutual benefit of the members of the group is a subsidiary company for the purposes of this system of accounts.
40.
Utility,
as used herein and when not otherwise indicated in the context, means any natural gas company to which this system of accounts is applicable.

# General Instructions
1.
Applicability.
Each natural gas company must apply the system of accounts prescribed by the Commission.
Major
—Each natural gas company as defined in the Natural Gas Act, whose combined gas sold for resale and gas transported or stored for a fee exceeds 50 million Mcf at 14.73 psi (60 °F) in each of the three previous calendar years.
Nonmajor
—Natural gas companies that are not classified as a “major company” (as defined above), and had total gas sales or volume transactions exceeding 200,000 Mcf at 14.73 psi (60 °F) in each of the three previous calendar years.
B. This system applies to both Major and Nonmajor natural gas companies. Provisions have been incorporated into this system for those entities which prior to January 1, 1984, were applying the Commission's Uniform System of Accounts Prescribed for Class C and Class D (part 104 of this chapter) now revoked. The notations “(Nonmajor)” and “(Major)” have been used to indicate those instructions and accounts from the previous systems and classifications, which by definition, are not interchangeable without causing a loss of detail for the
Major
(previous Class A and Class B) or an increase in detail burden for the
Nonmajor
(previous Class C and Class D).
C. The class to which any natural gas company belongs shall originally be determined by its annual gas volume in each of the last three consecutive years, or, in the case of a newly established entity, the projected data shall be the basis. Subsequent changes in classification shall be made when the volume for each of the three immediately preceding years exceeds the upper limit, or is less than the lower limit of the classification previously applicable to the natural gas company.
D. Any utility may, at its option, adopt the system of accounts prescribed by the Commission for any larger class of utilities.
2.
Records.
A. Each utility shall keep its books of account, and all other books, records, and memoranda which support the entries in such books of account so as to be able to furnish readily full information as to any item included in any account. Each entry
shall be supported by such detailed information as will permit ready identification, analysis, and verification of all facts relevant thereto.
B. The books and records referred to herein include not only accounting records in a limited technical sense, but all other records, such as minute books, stock books, reports, correspondence, memoranda, etc., which may be useful in developing the history of or facts regarding any transaction.
C. No utility shall destroy any such books or records unless the destruction thereof is permitted by rules and regulations of the Commission.
D. In addition to prescribed accounts, clearing accounts, temporary or experimental accounts, and subdivisions of any accounts, may be kept, provided the integrity of the prescribed accounts is not impaired.
E. All amounts included in the accounts prescribed herein for gas plant and operating expenses shall be just and reasonable and any payments or accruals by the utility in excess of just and reasonable charges shall be included in account 426.5, Other Deductions.
F. The arrangement or sequence of the accounts prescribed herein shall not be controlling as to the arrangement or sequence in report forms which may be prescribed by the Commission.
3.
Numbering system.
A. The account numbering plan used herein consists of a system of three-digit whole numbers as follows:
100-199 Assets and Other Debits.
200-299 Liabilities and Other Credits.
300-399 Plant Accounts.
400-432, 434-435 Income Accounts.
433, 436-439 Retained Earnings Accounts.
480-499 Revenue Accounts.
700-899 Production, Transmission and Distribution Expenses.
900-949 Customer Accounts, Customer Service and Informational, Sales and General and Administrative Expenses.
B. In certain instances, numbers have been skipped in order to allow for possible later expansion or to permit better coordination with the numbering system for other utility departments.
C. The numbers prefixed to account titles are to be considered as part of the titles. Each utility, however, may adopt for its own purposes a different system of account numbers (See also general instruction 2D) provided that the numbers herein prescribed shall appear in the descriptive headings of the ledger accounts and in the various sources of original entry; however, if a utility uses a different group of account numbers and it is not practicable to show the prescribed account numbers in the various sources of original entry, such reference to the prescribed account numbers may be omitted from the various sources of original entry. Moreover, each utility using different account numbers for its own purposes shall keep readily available a list of such account numbers which it uses and a reconciliation of such account numbers with the account numbers provided herein. It is intended that the utility's records shall be so kept as to permit ready analysis by prescribed accounts (by direct reference to sources of original entry to the extent practicable) and to permit preparation of financial and operating statements directly from such records at the end of each accounting period according to the prescribed accounts.
4.
Accounting period.
Each utility shall keep its books on a monthly basis so that for each month all transactions applicable thereto, as nearly as may be ascertained, shall be entered in the books of the utility. Amounts applicable or assignable to specific utility departments shall be so segregated monthly. Each utility shall close its books at the end of each calendar year unless otherwise authorized by the Commission.
5.
Submittal of questions.
To maintain uniformity of accounting, utilities shall submit questions of doubtful interpretation to the Commission for consideration and decision.
6.
Item lists.
Lists of “items” appearing in the texts of the accounts or elsewhere herein are for the purpose of more clearly indicating the application of the prescribed accounting. The lists are intended to be representative, but not exhaustive. The appearance of an item in a list warrants the inclusion of the item in the account mentioned only when the text of the account also indicates inclusion inasmuch as the same item frequently appears in more than one list. The proper entry in each
instance must be determined by the texts of the accounts.
7.
Extraordinary items.
It is the intent that net income shall reflect all items of profit and loss during the period with the exception of prior period adjustments as described in paragraph 7.1 and long-term debt as described in paragraph 17 below. Those items related to the effects of events and transactions which have occurred during the current period and which are of unusual nature and infrequent occurrence shall be considered extraordinary items. Accordingly, they will be events and transactions of significant effect which are abnormal and significantly different from the ordinary and typical activities of the company, and which would not reasonably be expected to recur in the foreseeable future. (In determining significance, items should be considered individually and not in the aggregate. However, the effects of a series of related transactions arising from a single specific and identifiable event or plan of action should be considered in the aggregate.) To be considered as extraordinary under the above guidelines, an item should be more than approximately 5 percent of income, computed before extraordinary items. Commission approval must be obtained to treat an item of less than 5 percent, as extraordinary. (See accounts 434 and 435.)
7.1 Prior period items.
A. Items of profit and loss related to the following shall be accounted for as prior period adjustments and excluded from the determination of net income for the current year.
(1) Correction of an error in the financial statements of a prior year.
(2) Adjustments that result from realization of income tax benefits of pre-acquisition operating loss carryforwards of purchased subsidiaries.
B. All other items of profit and loss recognized during the year shall be included in the determination of net income for that year.
8.
Unaudited items.
Whenever a financial statement is required by the Commission, if it is known that a transaction has occurred which affects the accounts but the amount involved in the transaction and its effect upon the accounts cannot be determined with absolute accuracy, the amount shall be estimated and such estimated amount included in the proper accounts. The utility is not required to anticipate minor items which would not appreciably affect the accounts.
9.
Distribution of pay and expenses of employees.
The charges to gas plant, operating expense and other accounts for services and expenses of employees engaged in activities chargeable to various accounts, such as construction, maintenance, and operations, shall be based upon the actual time engaged in the respective classes of work, or in case that method is impracticable, upon the basis of a study of the time actually engaged during a representative period.
10.
Payroll distribution.
Underlying accounting data shall be maintained so that the distribution of the cost of labor charged direct to the various accounts will be readily available. Such underlying data shall permit a reasonably accurate distribution to be made of the cost of labor charged initially to clearing accounts so that the total labor cost may be classified among construction, cost of removal, gas operating functions (manufactured gas production, natural gas production and gathering, products extraction, underground storage, transmission, distribution, etc.), and nonutility operations.
11.
Accounting to be on accrual basis.
A. The utility is required to keep its accounts on the accrual basis. This requires the inclusion in its accounts of all known transactions of appreciable amount which affect the accounts. If bills covering such transactions have not been received or rendered, the amounts shall be estimated and appropriate adjustments made when the bills are received.
B. When payments are made in advance for items such as insurance, rents, taxes or interest, the amount applicable to future periods shall be charged to account 165, Prepayments, and spread over the periods to which applicable by credits to account 165, and charges to the accounts appropriate for the expenditure.
12.
Records for each plant.
A. Separate records shall be maintained by gas plant accounts of the book cost of each
plant owned, including additions by the utility to plant leased from others, and of the cost of operating and maintaining each plant owned or operated. The term “plant,” as here used, means each manufactured gas production plant, the wells and gathering lines of each distinct production area, each system of interconnected transmission mains, each system of wells and lines of an underground storage project, each large purification or dehydration plant, each compressor station, other than a distribution compressor station, and each products extraction plant.
B. A natural gas company may, with the approval of the Commission, group certain of its systems of gathering lines and wells, small compressor stations, systems of underground storage lines and wells, and systems of interconnected transmission mains for the purpose of complying with the portion of this instruction requiring a segregation of the cost of operating and maintaining each plant.

# Note A:
Where manufactured gas is produced by two or more processes at one location, each process shall be accounted for separately.

# Note B:
Each natural gas company shall maintain operating or accounting records for each well showing (a) acreage on which drilled, (b) dates of drilling period, (c) cost of drilling, (d) depth of well, (e) particulars and depth of each stratum drilled through, (f) geological formation from which gas is obtained, (g) initial rock pressure and open flow capacity, (h) sizes of casing used and the lengths of each size, (i) total cost of well as recorded in gas plant accounts, (j) date well abandoned, for wells once productive, (k) date transferred to underground storage plant, for wells converted to storage use, and (l) date drilling discontinued, for wells determined to be nonproductive. The foregoing data, as appropriate, shall also be maintained for each subsequent change in the depth of each well.
13.
Accounting for other departments.
If the utility also operates other utility departments, such as electric, water, etc., it shall keep such accounts for the other departments as may be prescribed by proper authority and in the absence of prescribed accounts, it shall keep such accounts as are proper or necessary to reflect the results of operating each such department. It is not intended that proprietary and similar accounts which apply to the utility as a whole shall be departmentalized.
14.
Transactions with associated companies.
Each utility shall keep its accounts and records so as to be able to furnish accurately and expeditiously statements of all transactions with associated companies. The statements may be required to show the general nature of the transactions, the amounts involved therein and the amounts included in each account prescribed herein with respect to such transactions. Transactions with associated companies shall be recorded in the appropriate accounts for transactions of the same nature. Nothing herein contained, however, shall be construed as restraining the utility from subdividing accounts for the purpose of recording separately transactions with associated companies.
15.
Contingent assets and liabilities.
Contingent assets represent a possible source of value to the utility contingent upon the fulfillment of conditions regarded as uncertain. Contingent liabilities include items which may under certain conditions become obligations of the utility but which are neither direct nor assumed liabilities at the date of the balance sheet. The utility shall be prepared to give a complete statement of significant contingent assets and liabilities (including cumulative dividends on preference stock) in its annual report and at such other times as may be requested by the Commission.
16. [Reserved]
17.
Long-term debt: Premium, discount and expense, and gain or loss on reacquisition
— A.
Premium, discount and expense.
A separate premium, discount and expense account shall be maintained for each class and series of long-term debt (including receivers' certificates) issued or assumed by the utility. The premium will be recorded in account 225, Unamortized Premium on Long-Term Debt, the discount will be recorded in account 226, Unamortized Discount on Long-Term Debt—Debit, and the expense of issuance shall be recorded in account 181, Unamortized Debt Expense.
The premium, discount and expense shall be amortized over the life of the respective issues under a plan which
will distribute the amounts equitably over the life of the securities. The amortization shall be on a monthly basis, and amounts thereof relating to discount and expense shall be charged to account 428, Amortization of Debt Discount and Expense. The amounts relating to premium shall be credited to account 429, Amortization of Premium on Debt—Credit.
B.
Reacquisition, without refunding.
When long-term debt is reacquired or redeemed without being converted into another form of long-term debt and when the transaction is not in connection with a refunding operation (primarily redemptions for sinking fund purposes), the difference between the amount paid upon reacquisition and the face value; plus any un- amortized premium less any related unamortized debt expense and reacquisition costs; or less any unamortized discount, related debt expense and reacquisition costs applicable to the debt redeemed, retired and canceled, shall be included in account 189, Unamortized Loss on Reacquired Debt, or account 257, Unamortized Gain on Reacquired Debt, as appropriate. The utility shall amortize the recorded amounts equally on a monthly basis over the remaining life of the respective security issues (old original debt). The amounts so amortized shall be charged to account 428.1, Amortization of Loss on Reacquired Debt, or credited to account 429.1, Amortization of Gain on Reacquired Debt—Credit, as appropriate.
C.
Reacquisition, with refunding.
When the redemption of one issue or series of bonds or other long-term obligations is financed by another issue or series before the maturity date of the first issue, the difference between the amount paid upon refunding and the face value; plus any unamortized premium less related debt expense or less any unamortized discount and related debt expense, applicable to the debt refunded, shall be included in account 189, Unamortized Loss on Reacquired Debt, or account 257, Unamortized Gain on Reacquired Debt, as appropriate. The utility may elect to account for such amounts as follows:
(1) Write them off immediately when the amounts are insignificant.
(2) Amortize them by equal monthly amounts over the remainder of the original life of the issue retired, or
(3) Amortize them by equal monthly amounts over the life of the new issue.
Once an election is made, it shall be applied on a consistent basis. The amounts in (1), (2), or (3) above shall be charged to account 428.1, Amortization of Loss on Reacquired Debt, or credited to account 429.1, Amortization of Gain on Reacquired Debt—Credit, as appropriate.
D. Under methods (2) and (3) above, the increase or reduction in current income taxes resulting from the reacquisition should be apportioned over the remainder of the original life of the issue retired or over the life of the new issue, as appropriate, as directed more specifically in paragraphs E and F below.
E. When the utility recognizes the loss in the year of reacquisition as a tax deduction, account 410.1, Provision for Deferred Income Taxes, Utility Operating Income, shall be debited and account 283, Accumulated Deferred Income Taxes—Other, shall be credited with the amount of the related tax effect, such amount to be allocated to the periods affected in accordance with the provisions of account 283.
F. When the utility chooses to recognize the gain in the year of reacquisition as a taxable gain, account 411.1, Provision for Deferred Income Taxes—Credit, Utility Operating Income, shall be credited and account 190, Accumulated Deferred Income Taxes, shall be debited with the amount of the related tax effect, such amount to be allocated to the periods affected in accordance with the provisions of account 190.
G. When the utility chooses to use the optional privilege of deferring the tax on the gain attributable to the reacquisition of debt by reducing the depreciable basis of utility property for tax purposes, pursuant to Section 108 of the Internal Revenue Code, the related tax effects shall be deferred as the income is recognized for accounting purposes, and the deferred amounts shall be amortized over the life of the associated property on a vintage year basis. Account 410.1, Provision for Deferred Income Taxes, Utility Operating Income, shall be debited, and account
282, Accumulated Deferred Income Taxes—Other Property, shall be credited with an amount equal to the estimated income tax effect applicable to the portion of the income, attributable to reacquired debt, recognized for accounting purposes during the period. Account 282 shall be debited and account 411.1, Provision for Deferred Income Taxes—Credit, Utility Operating Income, shall be credited with an amount equal to the estimated income tax effects, during the life of the property, attributable to the reduction in the depreciable basis for tax purposes.
H. The tax effects relating to gain or loss shall be allocated as above to utility operations except in cases where a portion of the debt reacquired is directly applicable to nonutility operations. In that event, the related portion of the tax effects shall be allocated to nonutility operations. Where it can be established that reacquired debt is generally applicable to both utility and nonutility operations, the tax effects shall be allocated between utility and nonutility operations based on the ratio of net investment in utility plant to net investment in non- utility plant.
I. Premium, discount, or expense on debt shall not be included as an element in the cost of construction or acquisition of property (tangible or intangible), except under the provisions of account 432, Allowance for Borrowed Funds Used During Construction—Credit.
J.
Alternate method.
Where a regulatory authority or a group of regulatory authorities having prime rate jurisdiction over the utility specifically disallows the rate principle of amortizing gains or losses on reacquisition of long-term debt without refunding, and does not apply the gain or loss to reduce interest charges in computing the allowed rate of return for rate purposes, then the following alternate method may be used to account for gains or losses relating to reacquisition of long-term debt, with or without refunding.
(1) The difference between the amount paid upon reacquisition of any long-term debt and the face value, adjusted for unamortized discount, expenses or premium, as the case may be, applicable to the debt redeemed shall be recognized currently in income and recorded in account 421, Miscellaneous Nonoperating Income, or account 426.5, Other Deductions.
(2) When this alternate method of accounting is used, the utility shall include a footnote to each financial statement, prepared for public use, explaining why this method is being used along with the treatment given for ratemaking purposes.
18.
Comprehensive interperiod income tax allocation.
A. Where there are timing differences between the periods in which transactions affect taxable income and the periods in which they enter into the determination of pretax accounting income, the income tax effects of such transactions are to be recognized in the periods in which the differences between book accounting income and taxable income arise and in the periods in which the differences reverse using the deferred tax method. In general, comprehensive interperiod tax allocation should be followed whenever transactions enter into the determination of pretax accounting income for the period even though some transactions may affect the determination of taxes payable in a different period, as further qualified below.
B. Utilities are not required to utilize comprehensive interperiod income tax allocation until the deferred income taxes are included as an expense in the rate level by the regulatory authority having rate jurisdiction over the utility. Where comprehensive interperiod tax allocation accounting is not practiced the utility shall include as a note to each financial statement, prepared for public use, a footnote explanation setting forth the utility's accounting policies with respect to interperiod tax allocation and describing the treatment for ratemaking purposes of the tax timing differences by regulatory authorities having rate jurisdiction.
C. Should the utility be subject to more than one agency having rate jurisdiction, its accounts shall appropriately reflect the ratemaking treatment (deferral or flow through) of each jurisdiction.
D. Once comprehensive interperiod tax allocation has been initiated either in whole or in part it shall be practiced
on a consistent basis and shall not be changed or discontinued without prior Commission approval.
E. Tax effects deferred currently will be recorded as deferred debits or deferred credits in accounts 190, Accumulated Deferred Income Taxes, 281, Accumulated Deferred Income Taxes—Accelerated Amortization Property, 282, Accumulated Deferred Income Taxes—Other Property, and 283, Accumulated Deferred Income Taxes—Other, as appropriate. The resulting amounts recorded in these accounts shall be disposed of as prescribed in this system of accounts or as otherwise authorized by the Commission.
19.
Criteria for classifying leases.
A. If at its inception a lease meets one or more of the following criteria, the lease shall be classified as a capital lease. Otherwise, it shall be classified as an operating lease.
(1) The lease transfers ownership of the property to the leasee by the end of the lease term.
(2) The lease contains a bargain purchase option.
(3) The lease term is equal to 75 percent or more of the estimated economic life of the leased property. However, if the beginning of the lease term falls within the last 25 percent of the total estimated economic life of the lease property, including earlier years of use, this criterion shall not be used for purposes of classifying the lease.
(4) the present value at the beginning of the lease term of the minimum lease payments, excluding that portion of the payments representing executory costs such as insurance, maintenance, and taxes to be paid by the lessor, including any profit thereon, equals or exceeds 90 percent of the excess of the fair value of the leased property to the lessor at the inception of the lease over any related investment tax credit retained by the lessor and expected to be realized by the lessor. However, if the beginning of the lease term falls within the last 25 percent of the total estimated economic life of the lease property, including earlier years of use, this criterion shall not be used for purposes of classifying the lease. The lessee utility shall compute the present value of the minimum lease payments using his incremental borrowing rate, unless (a) it is practicable for the utility to learn the implicit rate computed by the lessor, and (b) the implicit rate computed by the lessor is less than the lessee's incremental borrowing rate. If both of those conditions are met, the lessee shall use the implicit rate.
B. If at any time the lessee and lessor agree to change the provisions of the lease, other than by renewing the lease or extending its term, in a manner that would have resulted in a different classification of the lease under the criteria in paragraph A had the changed terms been in effect at the inception of the lease, the revised agreement shall be considered as a new agreement over its term, and the criteria in paragraph A shall be applied for purposes of classifying the lease. Likewise, any action that extends the lease beyond the expiration of the existing lease term, such as the exercise of a lease renewal option other than those already included in the lease term, shall be considered as a new agreement, and shall be classified according to the above provisions, Changes in estimates (for example, changes in estimates of the economic life or of the residual value of the leased property) or changes in circumstances (for example, default by the lessee), shall not give rise to a new classification of a lease for accounting purposes.
20.
Accounting for leases.
A. All leases shall be classified as either capital or operating leases. The accounting for capitalized leases is effective January 1, 1984, except for the retroactive classification of certain leases which, in accordance with FASB No. 71, will not be required to be capitalized until after a three year transition period. For the purpose of reporting to the FERC, the transition period shall be deemed to end December 31, 1986.
B. The utility shall record a capital lease as an asset in account 101.1, Property under Capital Leases (or account 121, Non-utility Property, if appropriate), and an obligation in account 227, Obligations under Capital Leases—Noncurrent, or account 243, Obligations under Capital Leases—Current, at an amount equal to the present value at the beginning of the lease term of minimum lease payments during the lease term, excluding that portion of the
payments representing executory costs such as insurance, maintenance, and taxes to be paid by the lessor, together with any profit thereon. However, if the amount so determined exceeds the fair value of the leased property at the inception of the lease, the amount recorded as the asset and obligation shall be the fair value.
C. The utility, as a lessee, shall recognize an asset retirement obligation (See General Instruction 24) arising from the plant under a capital lease unless the obligation is recorded as an asset and liability under a capital lease. The utility shall record the asset retirement cost by debiting account 101.1, Property under capital leases, or account 121, Nonutility property, as appropriate, and crediting the liability for the asset retirement obligation in account 230, Asset retirement obligations. Asset retirement costs recorded in account 101.1 or account 121 shall be amortized by charging rent expense (See Operating Expense Instruction 3) or account 421, Miscellaneous nonoperating income, as appropriate, and crediting a separate subaccount of the account in which the asset retirement costs are recorded. Charges for the periodic accretion of the liability in account 230, Asset retirement obligations, shall be recorded by a charge to account 411.10, Accretion expense, for gas utility plant, and account 421, Miscellaneous nonoperating income, for nonutility plant and a credit to account 230, Asset retirement obligations.
D. Rental payments on all leases shall be charged to rent expense, fuel expense, construction work in progress, or other appropriate accounts as they become payable.
E. For a capital lease, for each period during the lease term, the amounts recorded for the asset and obligation shall be reduced by an amount equal to the portion of each lease payment which would have been allocated to the reduction of the obligation, if the payment had been treated as a payment on an installment obligation (liability) and allocated between interest expense and a reduction of the obligation so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance.
21.
Gas well records.
Each utility with natural gas operations shall maintain operating or accounting records for each well showing: (a) Acreage on which drilled, (b) dates of drilling period, (c) cost of drilling, (d) depth of well, (e) particulars and depth of each stratum drilled through, (f) geological formation from which gas is obtained, (g) initial rock pressure and open flow capacity, (h) sizes of casing used and lengths of each size, (i) total cost of well as recorded in gas plant accounts, (j) date well abandoned, for wells once productive, (k) date transferred to underground storage plant, for wells converted to storage use, and (l) date drilling discontinued, for wells determined to be nonproductive. The foregoing data, as appropriate, shall also be maintained for each subsequent change in the depth of each well.
22.
Accounting for other comprehensive income.
A. Utilities shall record items of other comprehensive income in account 219, accumulated other comprehensive income. Amounts included in this account shall be maintained by each category of other comprehensive income. Examples of categories of other comprehensive income include, foreign currency items, minimum pension liability adjustments, unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale type securities and cash flow hedge amounts. Supporting records shall be maintained for account 219 so that the company can readily identify the cumulative amount of other comprehensive income for each item included in this account.
B. When an item of other comprehensive income enters into the determination of net income in the current or subsequent periods, a reclassification adjustment shall be recorded in account 219 to avoid double counting of that amount.
C. When it is probable that an item of other comprehensive income will be included in the development of cost of service rates in subsequent periods, that amount of unrealized losses or gains shall be recorded in accounts 182.3 or 254 as appropriate.
23.
Accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities.
A. Utilities shall recognize derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in the financial statements and measure those instruments at fair value, except those falling within recognized exceptions, the most common of which being the normal purchases and sales scope exception. Normal purchases or sales are contracts that provide for the purchase or sale of goods that will be delivered in quantities expected to be used or sold by the utility over a reasonable period in the normal course of business. A derivative instrument is a financial instrument or other contract with all three of the following characteristics:
(1) It has one or more underlyings and a notional amount or payment provision. Those terms determine the amount of the settlement or settlements, and, in some cases, whether or not a settlement is required.
(2) It requires no initial net investment or an initial net investment that is smaller than would be required for other types of contracts that would be expected to have similar response to changes in market factors.
(3) Its terms require or permit net settlement, can readily be settled net by a means outside the contract, or provides for delivery of an asset that puts the recipient in a position not substantially different from net settlement.
B. The accounting for the changes in the fair value of derivative instruments depends upon its intended use and designation. Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments not designated as fair value or cash flow hedges will be recorded in account 175, derivative instrument assets, or account 244, derivative instrument liabilities, as appropriate, with the gains recorded in account 421, miscellaneous nonoperating income, and losses recorded in account 426.4, other deductions.
C. A derivative instrument may be specifically designated as a fair value or cash flow hedge. A hedge may be used to manage risk to price, interest rates, or foreign currency transactions. Utilities shall maintain documentation of the hedge relationship at the inception of the hedge that details the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge, the nature of the risk being hedged, and how hedge effectiveness will be determined.
D. If the utility designates the derivative instrument as a fair value hedge against exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset, liability, or a firm commitment, it will record the change in fair value of the derivative instrument to account 176, derivative instrument assets—hedges, or account 245, derivative instrument liabilities—hedges, as appropriate, with a corresponding adjustment to the subaccount of the item being hedged. The ineffective portion of the hedge transaction shall be reflected in the same income or expense account that will be used when the hedged item enters into the determination of net income. In the case of a fair value hedge of a firm commitment a new asset or liability is created. As a result of the hedge relationship, the new asset or liability will become part of the carrying amount of the item being hedged.
E. If the utility designates the derivative instrument as a cash flow hedge against exposure to variable cash flows of a probable forecasted transaction, it shall record changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument in account 176, derivative instrument assets—hedges, or account 245, derivative instrument liabilities—hedges, as appropriate, with a corresponding amount in account 219, accumulated other comprehensive income, for the effective portion of the hedge. The ineffective portion of the hedge transaction shall be reflected in the same income or expense account that will be used when the hedged item enters into the determination of net income. Amounts recorded in other comprehensive income shall be reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods that the hedged forecasted item enters into the determination of net income.
24.
Accounting for asset retirement obligations.
A. An
asset retirement obligation
represents a liability for the legal obligation associated with the retirement of a tangible long-lived asset that a utility is required to settle as a result of an existing or enacted law, statute, ordinance, or written or oral contract or by legal construction of a contract
under the doctrine of promissory estoppel. An
asset retirement cost
represents the amount capitalized when the liability is recognized for the long-lived asset that gives rise to the legal obligation. The amount recognized for the liability and an associated asset retirement cost shall be stated at the fair value of the asset retirement obligation in the period in which the obligation is incurred.
B. The utility shall initially record a liability for an asset retirement obligation in account 230, Asset retirement obligations, and charge the associated asset retirement costs to gas utility plant and nonutility plant, as appropriate, related to the plant that gives rise to the legal obligation. The asset retirement cost shall be depreciated over the useful life of the related asset that gives rise to the obligations. For periods subsequent to the initial recording of the asset retirement obligation, a utility shall recognize the period to period changes of the asset retirement obligation that result from the passage of time due to the accretion of the liability and any subsequent measurement changes to the initial liability for the legal obligation recorded in account 230, Asset retirement obligations, as follows:
(1) The utility shall record the accretion of the liability by debiting account 411.10, Accretion expense, for gas utility plant, account 413, Expenses of gas plant leased to others, for gas plants leased to others, and account 421, Miscellaneous nonoperating income, for nonutility plant and crediting account 230, Asset retirement obligations; and
(2) The utility shall recognize any subsequent measurement changes of the liability initially recorded in account 230, Asset retirement obligations, for each specific asset retirement obligation as an adjustment of that liability in account 230 with the corresponding adjustment to gas utility plant, gas plant leased to others, and nonutility plant, as appropriate. The utility shall on a timely basis monitor any measurement changes of the asset retirement obligations.
C. Gains or losses resulting from the settlement of asset retirement obligations associated with utility plant resulting from the difference between the amount of the liability for the asset retirement obligation included in account 230, Asset retirement obligations, and the actual amount paid to settle the obligation shall be accounted for as follows:
(1) Gains shall be credited to account 411.6, Gains from disposition of utility plant, and;
(2) Losses shall be charged to account 411.7, Losses from disposition of utility plant.
D. Gains or losses on the settlement of the asset retirement obligations associated with nonutility plant resulting from the difference between the amount of the liability for the asset retirement obligation in account 230, Asset retirement obligations, and the amount paid to settle the obligation, shall be accounted for as follows:
(1) Gains shall be credited to account 421, Miscellaneous nonoperating income, and;
(2) Losses shall be charged to account 426.5, Other deductions.
E. Separate subsidiary records shall be maintained for each asset retirement obligation showing the initial liability and associated asset retirement cost, any incremental amounts of the liability incurred in subsequent reporting periods for additional layers of the original liability and related asset retirement cost, the accretion of the liability, the subsequent measurement changes to the asset retirement obligation, the depreciation and amortization of the asset retirement costs and related accumulated depreciation, and the settlement date and actual amount paid to settle the obligation. For purposes of analyses a utility shall maintain supporting documentation so as to be able to furnish accurately and expeditiously with respect to each asset retirement obligation the full details of the identity and nature of the legal obligation, the year incurred, the identity of the plant giving rise to the obligation, the full particulars relating to each component and supporting computations related to the measurement of the asset retirement obligation.

# Gas Plant Instructions
1.
Classification of gas plant at the effective date of the system of accounts.
A. The gas plant accounts provided herein are generally the same as those contained in the prior system of accounts except for some changes in classification in the general equipment accounts. Except for these changes, the balances in the various plant accounts, as determined under the prior system of accounts, should be carried forward. Any remaining balance of plant which has not yet been classified pursuant to the requirements of the prior system, shall be classified in accordance with the following instructions.
B. The cost to the utility of its unclassified plant shall be ascertained by analysis of the utility's records. Adjustments shall not be made to record in utility plant accounts amounts previously charged to operating expenses or to income deductions in accordance with the uniform system of accounts in effect at the time or in accordance with the discretion of management as exercised under a uniform system of accounts, or under accounting practices previously followed.
C. The detailed gas plant accounts (301 to 399, inclusive) shall be stated on the basis of cost to the utility of plant constructed by it and the original cost, estimated if not known, of plant acquired as an operating unit or system. The difference between the original cost as above, and the cost to the utility of gas plant after giving effect to any accumulated provision for depreciation, depletion, or amortization shall be recorded in account 114, Gas Plant Acquisition Adjustments. The original cost of gas plant shall be determined by analysis of the utility's records or those of the predecessor or vendor companies with respect to gas plant previously acquired as operating units or systems and the differences between the original cost so determined, less accumulated provisions for depreciation, depletion and amortization, and the cost to the utility, with necessary adjustments for retirements from the date of acquisition, shall be entered in account 114, Gas Plant Acquisition Adjustments. Any difference between the cost of gas plant and its book cost, when not properly includable in other accounts, shall be recorded in account 116, Other Gas Plant Adjustments.
D. Plant acquired by lease which qualifies as capital lease property under General Instruction 19.
Criteria for Classifying Leases,
shall be recorded in Account 101.1, Property under Capital Leases.
2.
Gas plant to be recorded at cost.
A. All amounts included in the accounts for gas plant acquired as an operating unit or system, except as otherwise provided in the texts of the intangible plant accounts, shall be stated at the cost incurred by the person who first devoted the property to utility service. All other gas plant shall be included in the accounts at the cost incurred by the utility, except for property acquired by lease which qualifies as capital lease property under General Instruction 19.
Criteria for Classifying Leases,
and is recorded in Account 101.1, Property under Capital Leases. Where the term “cost” is used in the detailed plant accounts, it shall have the meaning stated in this paragraph.
B. When the consideration given for property is other than cash, the value of such consideration shall be determined on a cash basis. (See, however, definition 8.) In the entry recording such transaction, the actual consideration shall be described with sufficient particularity to identify it. The utility shall be prepared to furnish the Commission the particulars of its determination of the cash value of the consideration if other than cash.
C. When property is purchased under a plan involving deferred payments, no charge shall be made to the gas plant accounts for interest, insurance, or other expenditures occasioned solely by such form of payment.
D. The gas plant accounts shall not include the cost or other value of gas plant contributed to the company. Contributions in the form of money or its equivalent toward the construction of gas plant shall be credited to the accounts charged with the cost of such construction. Plant constructed from contributions of cash or its equivalent shall be shown as a reduction to gross plant constructed when assembling cost data in work orders for posting to plant ledger of accounts. The accumulated gross costs of plant accumulated in the work order shall be recorded as a debit in the plant ledger of accounts
along with the related amount of contributions concurrently being recorded as a credit.
3.
Components of construction cost.
A. The cost of construction properly includable in the gas plant accounts shall include, where applicable, the direct and overhead costs as listed and defined hereunder:
(1) “Contract work” includes amounts paid for work performed under contract by other companies, firms, or individuals, costs incident to the award of such contracts, and the inspection of such work.
(2) “Labor” includes the pay and expenses of employees of the utility engaged on construction work, and related workmen's compensation insurance, payroll taxes and similar items of expense. It does not include the pay and expenses of employees which are distributed to construction through clearing accounts nor the pay and expenses included in other items hereunder.
(3) “Materials and supplies” includes the purchase price at the point of free delivery plus customs duties, excise taxes, the cost of inspection, loading and transportation, the related stores expenses, and the cost of fabricated materials from the utility's shop. In determining the cost of materials and supplies used for construction, proper allowance shall be made for unused materials and supplies, for materials recovered from temporary structures used in performing the work involved, and for discounts allowed and realized in the purchase of materials and supplies.

# Note:
The cost of individual items of equipment of small value (for example, $500 or less) or of short life, including small portable tools and implements, shall not be charged to utility plant accounts unless the correctness of the accounting therefor is verified by current inventories. The cost shall be charged to the appropriate operating expense or clearing accounts, according to the use of such items, or, if such items are consumed directly in construction work, the cost shall be included as part of the cost of the construction.
(4) “Transportation” includes the cost of transporting employees, materials and supplies, tools, purchased equipment, and other work equipment (when not under own power) to and from points of construction. It includes amounts paid to others as well as the cost of operating the utility's own transportation equipment. (See item 5 following.)

(17) “Allowance for funds used during construction” includes the net cost for the period of construction of borrowed funds used for construction purposes and a reasonable rate on other funds when so used, not to exceed without prior approval of the Commission allowances computed in accordance with the formula prescribed in paragraph (a) below, except when such other funds are used for exploration and development or leases acquired after October 7, 1969, no allowance on such other funds shall be included in these accounts. No allowance for funds used during construction charges shall be included in these accounts upon expenditures for construction projects which have been abandoned.
(a) The formula and elements for the computation of the allowance for funds used during construction shall be:
EC14NO91.166
A
i
= Gross allowance for borrowed funds used during construction rate.
A
e
= Allowance for other funds used during construction rate.
S
= Average short-term debt.
s
= Short-term debt interest rate.
D
= Long-term debt.
d
= Long-term debt interest rate.
P
= Preferred stock.
p
= Preferred stock cost rate.
C
= Common equity.
c
= Common equity cost rate.
W
= Average balance in construction work in progress less asset retirement costs (See General Instruction 24) related to plant under construction.
(b) The rates shall be determined annually. The balances for long-term debt, preferred stock and common equity shall be the actual book balances as of the end of the prior year. The cost rates for long-term debt and preferred stock shall be the weighted average
cost determined in the manner indicated in subpart D of part 154 of the Commission's Regulations Under the Natural Gas Act. The cost rate for common equity shall be the rate granted common equity in the last rate proceeding before the ratemaking body having primary rate jurisdiction. If such cost rate is not available, the average rate actually earned during the preceding three years shall be used. The short-term debt balances and related cost and the average balance for construction work in progress shall be estimated for the current year with appropriate adjustments as actual data becomes available.

# Note:
When a part only of a plant or project is placed in operation or is completed and ready for service but the construction work as a whole is incomplete, that part of the cost of the property placed in operation, or ready for service, shall be treated as “Gas Utility Plant” and allowance for funds used during construction thereon as a charge to construction shall cease. Allowance for funds used during construction on that part of the cost of the plant which is incomplete may be continued as a charge to construction until such time as it is placed in operation or is ready for service, except as limited in item 17, above.
(18) “Earnings and expenses during construction” includes (a) all revenues derived during the construction period from property which is included in the cost of a project under construction and (b) all expenses which are attributable to the revenues received.
(19) “Training costs”. When it is necessary that employees be trained to operate or maintain plant facilities that are being constructed and such facilities are not conventional in nature or are new to the company's operations, these costs may be capitalized as a component of construction cost. Once plant is placed in service, the capitalization of training costs shall cease, and subsequent training costs shall be expensed. (See Operating Expense Instruction 4.)
(20) “Line pack gas.” Line pack includes the first cost of that quantity of gas introduced into the utility's system necessary to bring the system up to its designed operating capacity or increases therein and which must be maintained in the system in order to sustain such design operating capacity.
(21) LNG “heel” is the first cost of that minimum quantity of liquefied natural gas necessary to be retained in holding tanks and other facilities for purposes of temperature and/or pressure maintenance.
(22) “Studies” includes the costs of studies such as operational, safety or environmental studies relative to plant under construction. Studies mandated by regulatory bodies relative to facilities in service, shall be charged to Account 183.2, Other Preliminary Survey and Investigation Charges.
(23) “Asset retirement costs.” The costs recognized as a result of asset retirement obligations incurred during the construction and testing of utility plant shall constitute a component of construction costs.
4.
Overhead construction costs.
A. All overhead construction costs, such as engineering, supervision, general office salaries and expenses, construction engineering and supervision by others than the accounting utility, law expenses, insurance, injuries and damages, relief and pensions, taxes and interest, shall be charged to particular jobs or units on the basis of the amounts of such overheads reasonably applicable thereto, to the end that each job or unit shall bear its equitable proportion of such costs and that the entire cost of the unit, both direct and overhead, shall be deducted from the plant accounts at the time the property is retired.
B. As far as practicable, the determination of pay roll charges includible in construction overheads shall be based on time card distributions thereof. Where this procedure is impractical, special studies shall be made periodically of the time of supervisory employees devoted to construction activities to the end that only such overhead costs as have a definite relation to construction shall be capitalized. The addition to direct construction costs of arbitrary percentages or amounts to cover assumed overhead costs is not permitted.
C. The record supporting the entries for overhead construction costs shall be so kept as to show the total amount of each overhead for each year, the nature and amount of each overhead expenditure charged to each construction
work order and to each utility plant account, and the bases of distribution of such costs.
5.
Gas plant purchased or sold.
A. When gas plant constituting an operating unit or system is acquired by purchase, merger, consolidation, liquidation, or otherwise, after the effective date of this system of accounts, the costs of acquisition, including expenses incidental thereto properly includible in gas plant, shall be charged to account 102, Gas Plant Purchased or Sold.
B. The accounting for the acquisition shall then be completed as follows:
(1) The original cost of plant, estimated if not known, shall be credited to account 102, Gas Plant Purchased or Sold, and concurrently charged to the appropriate gas plant in service accounts and to account 104, Gas Plant Leased to Others, account 105, Gas Plant Held for Future Use, 105.1, Production Properties Held for Future Use, and account 107, Construction Work in Progress—Gas, as appropriate.
(2) The depreciation, depletion, and amortization applicable to the original cost of the properties purchased, shall be charged to account 102, Gas Plant Purchased or Sold, and concurrently credited to the appropriate account for accumulated provision for depreciation, depletion or amortization.
(3) The cost to the utility of any property includible in account 121, Nonutility Property, shall be transferred thereto.
(4) The amount remaining in account 102, Gas Plant Purchased or Sold, shall then be closed to account 114, Gas Plant Acquisition Adjustments.
C. If property acquired in the purchase of an operating unit or system is in such physical condition when acquired that it is necessary substantially to rehabilitate it in order to bring the property up to the standards of the utility, the cost of such work, except replacements, shall be accounted for as a part of the purchase price of the property.
D. When any property acquired as an operating unit or system includes duplicate or other plant which will be retired by the accounting utility in the reconstruction of the acquired property or its consolidation with previously owned property, the proposed accounting for such property shall be presented to the Commission.
E. In connection with the acquisition of gas plant constituting an operating unit or system, the utility shall procure, if possible, all existing records relating to the property acquired, or certified copies thereof, and shall preserve such records in conformity with regulations or practices governing the preservation of records of its own construction.
F. When gas plant constituting an operating unit or system is sold, conveyed, or transferred to another by sale, merger, consolidation, or otherwise, the book cost of the property sold or transferred to another shall be credited to the appropriate utility plant accounts, including amounts carried in account 114, Gas Plant Acquisition Adjustments. The amounts (estimated if not known) carried with respect thereto in the accounts for accumulated provision for depreciation, depletion, and amortization and in account 252, Customer Advances for Construction, shall be charged to such accounts and the contra entries made to account 102, Gas Plant Purchased or Sold. Unless otherwise ordered by the Commission, the difference, if any, between (a) the net amount of debits and credits and (b) the consideration received for the property (less commissions and other expenses of making the sale) shall be included in account 421.1, Gain on Disposition of Property, or account 421.2, Loss on Disposition of Property. (See account 102, Gas Plant Purchased or Sold.)

# Note:
In cases where existing utilities merge or consolidate because of financial or operating reasons or statutory requirements rather than as a means of transferring title of purchased properties to a new owner, the accounts of the constituent utilities, with the approval of the Commission, may be combined. In the event original cost has not been determined, the resulting utility shall proceed to determine such cost as outlined herein.
6.
Expenditures on leased property.
A. The cost of substantial initial improvements (including repairs, rearrangements, additions, and betterments) made in the course of preparing for
utility service property leased for a period of more than one year, and the cost of subsequent substantial additions, replacements, or betterments to such property, shall be charged to the gas plant account appropriate for the class of property leased. If the service life of the improvements is terminable by action of the lease, the cost, less net salvage, of the improvements shall be spread over the life of the lease by charges to account 404.3, Amortization of Other Limited-Term Gas Plant. However, if the service life is not terminated by action of the lease but by depreciation proper, the cost of the improvements, less net salvage, shall be accounted for as depreciable plant. The provisions of this paragraph are applicable to property leased under either capital leases or operating leases.
B. If improvements made to property leased for a period of more than one year are of relatively minor cost, or if the lease is for a period of not more than one year, the cost of the improvements shall be charged to the account in which the rent is included, either directly or by amortization thereof.
7.
Land and land rights.
A. The accounts for land and land rights shall include the cost of land owned in fee by the utility and rights, interests, and privileges held by the utility in land owned by others, such as leaseholds, easements, rights-of-way, natural gas rights, and other like interests in land. Do not include in the accounts for land and land rights and rights-of-way costs incurred in connection with first clearing and grading of land and rights-of-way and the damage costs associated with the construction and installation of plant. Such costs shall be included in the appropriate plant accounts directly benefited.
B. Where special assessments for public improvements provide for deferred payments, the full amount of the assessments shall be charged to the appropriate land account and the unpaid balance shall be carried in an appropriate liability account. Interest on unpaid balances shall be charged to the appropriate interest account. If any part of the cost of public improvement is included in the general tax levy, the amount thereof shall be charged to the appropriate tax account.
C. The net profit from the sale of timber, cord wood, sand, gravel, other resources or other property acquired with the rights-of-way or other lands shall be credited to the appropriate plant account to which related. Where land is held for a considerable period of time and timber and other natural resources on the land at the time of purchase increases in value, the net profit (after giving effect to the cost of the natural resources) from the sales of timber or its products or other natural resources shall be credited to the appropriate utility operating income account when such land has been recorded in account 105, Gas Plant Held for Future Use, account 105.1, Production Properties Held for Future Use, or classified as plant in service otherwise to account 421, Miscellaneous Nonoperating Income.
D. Separate entries shall be made for the acquisition, transfer, or retirement of each parcel of land, and each land right, or gas right (except rights-of-way for distribution mains), having a life of more than one year. A record shall be maintained showing the nature of ownership, full legal description, area, map reference, purpose for which used, city, county, and tax district in which situated, from whom purchased or to whom sold, payment given or received, other costs, contract date and number, date of recording of deed, and book and page of record. Entries transferring or retiring land or land rights shall refer to the original entry recording its acquisition. A parcel of land acquired and carried on the books as a unit is not required to be subdivided with transfers to other land accounts merely because of the erection thereon of an incidental structure to be used in gas operations but for a purpose differing from that for which the land is chiefly employed; for example, a small storehouse on production plant land.
E. Any difference between the amount received from the sale of land or land rights, less agents' commissions and other costs incident to the sale, and the book cost of such land or rights shall be included in account 411.6, Gains from Disposition of Utility Plant or 411.7, Losses from Disposition of Utility Plant when such property has been recorded in account 105, Gas
Plant Held for Future Use, 105.1, Production Properties Held for Future Use, otherwise to account 421.1, Gain on Disposition of Property or 421.2, Loss on Disposition of Property, as appropriate, unless a reserve therefor has been authorized and provided. Appropriate adjustments of the accounts shall be made with respect to any structures or improvements located on land sold.
F. The cost of buildings and other improvements (other than public improvements) shall not be included in the land accounts. If at the time of acquisition of an interest in land such interest extends to buildings or other improvements (other than public improvements), which are then devoted to utility operations, the land and improvements shall be separately appraised and the cost allocated to land and buildings or improvements on the basis of the appraisals. If the improvements are removed or wrecked without being used in operations, the cost of removing or wrecking shall be charged and the salvage credited to the account in which the cost of the land is recorded.
G. When the purchase of land for gas operations requires the purchase of more land than needed for such purposes, the charge to the specific land account shall be based upon the cost of the land purchased, less the fair market value of that portion of the land which is not to be used in utility operations. The portion of the cost measured by the fair market value of the land not to be used shall be included in account 105, Gas Plant Held for Future Use or, account 121, Nonutility Property, as appropriate. Regarding land and land rights held for the production of natural gas, account 101, Gas Plant in Service, shall include (1) the cost of lands owned in fee upon which producing natural gas wells are located on lands owned in fee which are being drained through the operation by the utility of wells on the other land, and (2) the first cost of lands held under lease upon which the utility pays royalties for the natural gas obtained therefrom. The cost of all other land and land rights held for the production of natural gas under a plant for such use shall be included in account 105, Gas Plant Held for Future Use, or 105.1, Production Properties Held for Future Use, as appropriate.

# Note:
In addition to the accounting records prescribed herein, supplemental records of land and land rights held for future use shall be kept in such manner as to permit the segregation within a reasonable time of the land and land rights constituting (1) productive but nonproducing fields, (2) unproven or undeveloped fields, and (3) storage fields, and to show the following data with respect to each natural gas lease, regardless of the accounting treatment accorded the lease costs; (a) name of lessor, (b) location of leasehold and number or other identification assigned thereto, (c) date and period of lease agreement, (d) first cost of lease including details of the elements of such cost, (e) annual rental provisions, (f) date and cost of drilling, (g) date gas determined to exist, (h) date of completion of first well drilled by the utility in each pool of gas, (i) royalty provisions, (j) amortization and depletion provisions, and (k) date of abandonment of lease.
H. Provision shall be made for amortizing amounts carried in the accounts for limited-term interests in land, so as to apportion equitably the cost of each interest over the life thereof. For the purposes of amortization of natural gas rights, separate interests in land which comprise an interest in a production area may be grouped to form a depletion unit. (See account 111, Accumulated Provision for Amortization and Depletion of Gas Utility Plant, account 404.1, Amortization and Depletion of Producing Natural Gas Land and Land Rights, account 404.3, Amortization of Other Limited-Term Gas Plant, and account 797, Abandonment, leases.)

Where furnaces and boilers are used primarily for furnishing steam for some particular department and only incidentally for furnishing steam for heating a building and operating the equipment therein, the entire cost of such furnaces and boilers shall be charged to the appropriate plant account, and no part to the building account.
E. The cost of disposing of materials excavated in connection with construction of structures shall be considered as a part of the cost of such work, except as follows: (a) When such material is used for filling, the cost of loading, hauling, and dumping shall be equitably apportioned between the work in connection with which the removal occurs and the work in connection with which the material is used; (b) when such material is sold, the net amount realized from such sales shall be credited to the work in connection with which the removal occurs. If the amount realized from the sale of excavated materials exceeds the removal costs and the costs in connection with the sale, the excess shall be credited to the land account in which the site is carried.

9.
Equipment.
A. The cost of equipment chargeable to the gas plant accounts, unless otherwise indicated in
the text of an equipment account, includes the net purchase price thereof, sales taxes, investigation and inspection expenses necessary to such purchase, expenses of transportation when borne by the utility, labor employed, materials and supplies consumed, and expenses incurred by the utility in unloading and placing the equipment in readiness to operate. Also include those costs incurred in connection with the first clearing and grading of land and rights-of-way and the damage costs associated with construction and installation of plant.
B. Exclude from equipment accounts hand and other portable tools which are likely to be lost or stolen or which have relatively small value (for example, $500 or less) or short life, unless the correctness of the accounting therefor as gas plant is verified by current inventories. Special tools acquired and included in the purchase price of equipment shall be included in the appropriate plant account. Portable drills and similar tool equipment when used in connection with the operation and maintenance of a particular plant or department, such as production, transmission, distribution, etc., or in “stores,” shall be charged to the plant account appropriate for their use.
C. The equipment accounts shall include angle irons and similar items which are installed at the base of an item of equipment, but piers and foundations which are designed to be as permanent as the buildings which house the equipment, or which are constructed as a part of the building and which cannot be removed without cutting into the walls, ceilings or floors or without in some way impairing the building, shall be included in the building accounts.
D. The equipment accounts shall include the necessary costs of testing or running a plant or part thereof during an experimental or test period prior to becoming available for service. The utility shall furnish the Commission with full particulars of and justification for any test or experimental run extending beyond a period of thirty days.
E. The cost of efficiency or other tests made subsequent to the date equipment becomes available for service shall be charged to the appropriate expense accounts, except that tests to determine whether equipment meets the specifications and requirements as to efficiency, performance, etc., guaranteed by manufacturers, made after operations have commenced and within the period specified in the agreement or contract of purchase, may be charged to the appropriate gas plant account.
10.
Additions and retirements of gas plant.
A. For the purpose of avoiding undue refinement in accounting for additions to and retirements and replacements of gas plant, all property shall be considered as consisting of (1) retirement units and (2) minor items of property. Each utility shall maintain a written property units listing for use in accounting for additions and retirements of gas plant and apply the listing consistently.
B. The addition and retirement of retirement units shall be accounted for as follows:
(1) When a retirement unit is added to gas plant, the cost thereof shall be added to the appropriate gas plant account, except that when units are acquired in the acquisition of any gas plant constituting an operating system, they shall be accounted for as provided in gas plant instruction 5.
(2) When a retirement unit is retired from gas plant, with or without replacement, the book cost thereof shall be credited to the gas plant account in which it is included, determined in the manner set forth in paragraph D, below. If the retirement unit is of a depreciable class, the book cost of the unit retired and credited to gas plant shall be charged to the accumulated provision for depreciation applicable to such property. The cost of removal and the salvage shall be charged or credited, as appropriate, to such depreciation account.
C. The addition and retirement of minor items of property shall be accounted for as follows:
(1) When a minor item of property which did not previously exist is added to plant, the cost thereof shall be accounted for in the same manner as for the addition of a retirement unit, as set forth in paragraph B(1), above, if a
substantial addition results, otherwise the charge shall be to the appropriate maintenance expense account.
(2) When a minor item of property is retired and not replaced, the book cost thereof shall be credited to the gas plant account in which it is included; and, in the event the minor item is a part of depreciable plant, the account for accumulated provision for depreciation shall be charged with the book cost and cost of removal and credited with the salvage. If, however, the book cost of the minor item retired and not replaced has been or will be accounted for by its inclusion in the retirement unit of which it is a part when such unit is retired, no separate credit to the property account is required when such minor item is retired.
(3) When a minor item of depreciable property is replaced independently of the retirement unit of which it is a part, the cost of replacement shall be charged to the maintenance account appropriate for the item, except that if the replacement effects a substantial betterment (the primary aim of which is to make the property affected more useful, more efficient, or of greater durability, or of greater capacity), the excess cost of the replacement over the estimated cost at current prices of replacing without betterment shall be charged to the appropriate gas plant account.
D. The book cost of gas plant retired shall be the amount at which such property is included in the gas plant accounts, including all components of construction costs. The book cost shall be determined from the utility's records and if this cannot be done it shall be estimated. Utilities must furnish the particulars of such estimates to the Commission, if requested. When it is impracticable to determine the book cost of each unit, due to the relatively large number or small cost thereof, an appropriate average book cost of the units, with due allowance for any differences in size and character, shall be used as the book cost of the units retired.
E. The book cost of land retired shall be credited to the appropriate land account. If the land is sold, the difference between the book cost (less any accumulated provision for depreciation, depletion or amortization therefor which has been authorized and provided) and the sale price of the land (less commissions and other expenses of making the sale) shall be recorded in account 411.6, Gains from Disposition of Utility Plant or 411.7, Losses from Disposition of Utility Plant when the property has been recorded in account 105, Gas Plant Held for Future Use account 105.1, Production Properties Held for Future Use, otherwise to accounts 421.1, Gain on Disposition of Property or 421.2, Loss on Disposition of Property, as appropriate.

B. Each utility shall keep its work order system so as to show the nature of each addition to or retirement of gas
plant, the total cost thereof, the source or sources of costs, and the gas plant account or accounts to which charged or credited. Work orders covering jobs of short duration may be cleared monthly.
C. Each utility shall maintain records in which, for each plant account, the amounts of the annual additions and retirements are classified so as to show the number and cost of the various record units or retirement units.
12.
Transfers of property.
When property is transferred from one gas plant account to another, from one utility department to another (such as from gas to electric), from one operating division or area to another, to or from account 101, Gas Plant in Service, 104, Gas Plant Leased to Others, 105, Gas Plant Held for Future Use, 105.1, Production Properties held for Future Use, and 121, Nonutility Property, the transfer shall be recorded by transferring the original cost thereof from the one account, department, or location to the other. Any related amounts carried in the accounts for accumulated provisions for depreciation, depletion, or amortization shall be transferred in accordance with the segregation of such accounts.

# Note:
Amounts included in account 111, Accumulated Provision for Amortization and Depletion of Gas Utility Plant, shall not be related to a particular natural gas lease, and therefore, shall not be transferred under the provisions of this instruction.
13.
Common utility plant.
A. If the utility is engaged in more than one utility service such as gas, electric, and water, and any of its utility plant is used in common for several utility services or for other purposes to such an extent and in such manner that it is impracticable to segregate it by utility services currently in the accounts, such property, with the approval of the Commission, may be designated and classified as “common utility plant.”
B. The book amount of utility plant designated as common plant shall be included in account 118, Other Utility Plant, and if applicable in part to gas department, shall be segregated and accounted for in subaccounts as gas plant is accounted for in accounts 101 to 107, inclusive, and gas plant adjustments in account 116; any amounts classifiable as common plant acquisition adjustments or common plant adjustments shall be subject to disposition as provided in paragraph C and B of accounts 114 and 116, respectively, for amounts classified in those accounts. The original cost of common utility plant in service shall be classified according to detailed utility plant accounts appropriate for the property.
C. The utility shall be prepared to show at any time and to report to the Commission annually, or more frequently, if required, and by utility plant accounts (301 to 399) the following: (1) The book cost of common utility plant, (2) the allocation of such cost to the respective departments using the common utility plant, and (3) the basis of the allocation.
D. The accumulated provision for depreciation and amortization of the utility shall be segregated so as to show the amount applicable to the property classified as common utility plant.
E. The expenses of operation maintenance, rents, depreciation and amortization of common utility plant shall be recorded in the accounts prescribed herein, but designated as common expenses, and the allocation of such expenses to the departments using the common utility plant shall be supported in such manner as to reflect readily the basis of allocation used.
14.
Employee villages and living quarters.
Where employee villages or living quarters are provided for operators and attendants of a functional installation such as a compressor station or gasoline plant, the structures and improvements shall be classified in the related functional structures and improvements account. The furnishings of such residential and recreational facilities shall be classified in the equipment account of the related function.

# Special Instructions to Accounts 117.1, 117.2 and 117.3
The investment in and use of system gas included in Account 117.1, Gas Stored—Base Gas, and Account 117.2, System Balancing Gas, may be accounted for using either the “fixed asset” method or an “inventory” method as set forth below. The cost of stored gas included in Account 117.3 must be accounted for using an inventory method.
(a)
Inventory Method
—Gas stored during the year must be priced at cost according to generally accepted methods of cost determination consistently applied from year to year. Transmission expenses for facilities of the utility used in moving the gas to the storage area and expenses of storage facilities cannot be included in the inventory of gas except as may be authorized or directed by the Commission.
Withdrawals of gas must be priced using the first-in-first-out, last-in-first-out, or weighted average cost method, provided the method adopted by the utility is used consistently from year to year and appropriate inventory records are maintained. Approval of
the Commission must be obtained for any other pricing method, or change in the pricing method adopted by the utility.
Adjustments for inventory losses related to gas held in underground reservoirs due to cumulative inaccuracies of gas measurements, or from other causes, must be charged to Account 823, Gas Losses. Losses of system gas not associated with underground reservoirs must be charged to Account 813, Other Gas Supply Expenses.
(b)
Fixed Asset Method
—When replacement of the gas is made, the amount carried in Account 117.4 for such volumes must be cleared with a contra entry to Account 808.2, Gas Delivered to Storage—Credit. Any difference between the utility's cost of replacement gas volumes and the amount cleared from Account 117.4 must be recognized as a gain in Account 495, Other gas revenues, or as a loss in Account 813, Other gas supply expenses, with contra entries to Account 808.2.
Adjustments for inventory losses related to gas held in underground reservoirs due to cumulative inaccuracies of gas measurements, or from other causes, must be charged to Account 823, Gas Losses. Losses of system gas not associated with underground reservoirs must be charged to Account 813, Other Gas Supply Expenses. Gas losses must be priced at the market price of gas available to the utility in the month the loss is recognized.
Gas owned by the utility and injected into its system will be deemed to satisfy any encroachment on system gas first before any other use.

# 117.1 Gas stored-base gas.
This account is to include the cost of recoverable gas volumes that are necessary, in addition to those volumes for which cost are properly includable in Account 101, Gas plant in service, to maintain pressure and deliverability requirements for each storage facility. Nonrecoverable gas volumes used for this purpose are to be recorded in Account 352.3, Nonrecoverable natural gas. For utilities using the fixed asset method of accounting, the cost of base gas applicable to each gas storage facility shall not be changed from the amount initially recorded except to reflect changes in volumes designated as base gas. If an inventory method is used to account for gas included herein, the utility may, at its election, price withdrawals in accordance with the instructions to Account 117.4.

# 117.2 System balancing gas.
This account is to be used to record the cost of system gas designated as available for transmission load balancing (including no-notice transportation) and other uses associated with maintaining efficient transmission operations other than gas properly recordable in Account 117.1 or the plant accounts. Detailed records must be kept separately identifying volumes and unit prices of system gas held in underground storage facilities and held in pipelines.
For utilities using fixed asset accounting, the cost initially recorded herein cannot be changed except for adjustments to volumes designated as system gas. Encroachments upon system gas must be accounted for in accordance with the instructions to Account 117.4, Gas owed to system gas.

# 117.3 Gas stored in reservoirs and pipelines—noncurrent.
This account is to include the cost of stored gas owned by the utility and available for sale or other purposes. Gas included in this account must be accounted for using an inventory method in accordance with the Special Instructions to Accounts 117.1, 117.2, and 117.3 above.

# 117.4 Gas owed to system gas.
This account is to be used to record encroachments of system gas under the fixed asset method. This account may also be used to record encroachments of base gas for utilities electing to use an inventory method of accounting for system gas. Utilities may revalve cumulative net imbalances, net all transactions, and record one monthly entry with one month-end price for valuation purposes.

# 118 Other utility plant.
This account shall include the balance in accounts for utility plant, other than gas plant, such as electric, railway, etc.

# 119 Accumulated provision for depreciation and amortization of other utility plant.
This account shall include the accumulated provision for depreciation and amortization applicable to utility property other than gas plant.

# 121 Nonutility property.
A. This account shall include the book cost of land, structures, equipment or other tangible or intangible property owned by the utility, but not used in utility service and not properly includible in account 105, Gas Plant Held for Future Use. This account shall also include, where applicable, amounts recorded for asset retirement costs associated with nonutility plant.
B. This account shall also include the amount recorded under capital leases for property leased from others and used by the utility in its nonutility operations. Records shall be maintained with respect to each lease reflecting: (1) name of lessor, (2) basic details of lease, (3) terminal date, (4) original cost or fair market value of property leased, (5) future minimum lease payments, (6) executory costs, (7) present value of minimum lease payments, (8) the amount representing interest and the interest rate used, and (9) expenses paid.
C. This account shall be subdivided so as to show the amount of property used in operations which are nonutility in character but nevertheless constitute a distinct operating activity of the company (such as operation of an ice department where such activity is not classed as a utility) and the amount of miscellaneous property not used in operations. The records in support of each subaccount shall be maintained so as to show an appropriate classification of the property.

# Note:
In the event of the subsequent sale or other disposition of property included in this account which had been previously recorded in account 105, Gas Plant Held for Future Use, or account 105.1, Production Properties Held for Future Use, such property costs shall be accounted for in accordance with paragraph C of accounts 105 and 105.1, respectively.

This account shall be debited with such amounts as are credited to Account 117.2, System balancing gas, (for utilities using an inventory method of accounting for system gas) and Account 117.3, Gas Stored in Reservoirs and Pipelines-Noncurrent, to reflect classification for balance sheet purposes of such portion of the inventory of gas stored as represents a current asset according to conventional rules for classification of current assets.

# Note:
It shall not be considered conformity to conventional rules of current asset classification if the amount included in this account exceeds an amount equal to the cost of estimated withdrawals of gas from storage within the 24-month period from date of the balance sheet, or if the amount represents a volume of gas which, in fact, could not be withdrawn from storage without impairing pressure levels needed for normal operating purposes.

# 164.2 Liquefied natural gas stored.
A. This account shall include the cost of liquefied natural gas stored in above or below ground facilities.
B. Natural gas purchased in a liquefied form shall be priced at the cost of such gas to the utility. Natural gas liquefied by the utility shall be priced according to generally accepted methods of cost determination consistently applied from year to year. Transmission expenses for facilities to the utility used in moving the gas to the storage facilities shall not be included in the inventory of gas except as may be authorized by the Commission.
C. Amounts debited to this account for natural gas placed in stored shall be credited to account 808.2, Gas Delivered to Storage—Credit. Amounts credited to this account for gas withdrawn from storage shall be debited to account 808.1, Gas Withdrawn from Storage—Debit.
D. Withdrawals of gas may be priced according to the first-in-first-out, last-in-first-out, or weighted average cost method provided the method adopted by the utility is used consistently from year to year and inventory records are maintained in accordance therewith. Commission approval must be obtained for any other pricing method or for any change in the pricing method adopted by the utility. Separate records shall be maintained for each storage project of the Dth of gas delivered to storage and remaining in storage.
E. Adjustments for inventory losses shall be charged to account 842.3, Gas Losses.

# 164.3 Liquefied natural gas held for processing.

B. Natural gas purchased in a liquefied form shall be priced at the cost of such gas to the utility.
C. Amounts debited to this account for liquefied natural gas purchased for processing shall be credited to account 809.2, Deliveries of Natural Gas for Processing—Credit. Amounts credited for liquefied natural gas processed shall be debited to account 809.1, Withdrawals of Liquefied Natural Gas Held for Processing—Debit.
D. Withdrawals of gas held for vaporization may be priced according to the first-in-first-out, last-in-first-out or weighted average cost method provided the method adopted by the utility is used consistently from year to year and inventory records are maintained in accordance therewith. Commission approval must be obtained for any other pricing method or for any change from the pricing method adopted by the utility. Separate records shall be maintained for Dth of gas purchased
for processing, processed, and remaining for processing.
E. Adjustments for inventory losses shall be charged to account 846.1, Gas Losses.

# 165 Prepayments.
A. This account shall include payments for undelivered gas and other prepayments of rents, taxes, insurance, interest, and like disbursements made prior to the period to which they apply. Prepayments for gas are those amounts paid to a seller of gas under “take or pay” provisions of a gas purchase contract for a sale certificated by the Commission where future makeup of the gas not taken in the current period is provided for by the contract.
B. As the periods covered by such prepayments expire, credit this account and charge the proper operating expense or other appropriate account with the amount applicable to the period.
C. This account shall be kept or supported in such a manner as to disclose the amount of each class of prepayments.

# 166 Advances for gas exploration, development and production.
A. This account shall include all advances made for gas (whether called “advances,” “contributions” or otherwise) to independent producers, affiliated or associated companies, or others operating within the lower 48 states and Alaska; for exploration, development or production (but not to include lease acquisition) of natural gas. Under each agreement with payee, such payments must be made prior to initial gas deliveries, or if the agreement provides for advances on a well by well basis, each incremental payment must be made prior to deliveries from an incremental well, or prior to Federal and/or State authorization, as appropriate. All agreements executed after June 17, 1975, (issuance date of Order No. 529) shall specify that (1) the pipeline shall have first call on any gas produced, attributable to the advance payment, under a long-term contract which is for a minimum initial term computed as the lesser of fifteen years or the life of the reserve in the field, and (2) the selling price of the gas committed by producers whose sales are subject to price regulation shall be governed by and limited to the area rate or national rate or, under appropriate showing of special circumstance, such other rate as may be authorized by the Commission under the provisions of optional pricing and special relief. As a determination of the initial rate, the time of first delivery in interstate commerce to the purchaser shall govern. Non-current advances not to be repaid within a two-year period shall be reclassified and transferred to account 124, Other Investments, for balance sheet purposes. This transfer is for reporting purposes only and has no effect on accounting and ratemaking.
B. When a pipeline obtains a working interest as a result of funds advanced to producers, such amounts shall be included in appropriate production accounts for formal contractual agreements executed prior to the date of issuance of Order No. 499. When an associated company obtains a working interest as a result of funds advanced from a pipeline company, the pipeline shall include such amounts in Account 123, Investment in Associated Companies, or Account 146, Accounts receivable from Associated Companies, as appropriate, for formal contractual commitments made during the period on or after November 10, 1971 (effective date of Order 441) but prior to December 29, 1972, the date of issuance of Order No. 465.
C. Outstanding advances shall be fully reduced within 5 years, or as otherwise authorized by the Commission, from the date gas deliveries commence or the date it is determined that recovery will be in other than gas. This account shall be credited with advances not fully recovered within the five-year period, and the unrecovered portion charged directly to Account 426.5, Other Deductions. A sufficient portion of all gas taken should be credited to the related outstanding advance so as to eliminate the advance within the 5-year period or as otherwise authorized by the Commission upon request by the pipeline company. The reduction of the outstanding advance should not be dependent on a buyer purchasing more than 100 percent of the minimum take
or pay quantity provided in the contract. In those instances where the five-year recovery period has lapsed, but recovery of the advance continues beyond the five-year period, the unrecovered advances shall be removed from this account and transferred to Account 167, Other Advances for Gas.
D. Where recovery is by gas, the recovered advance shall be credited to this account and charged to the appropriate gas purchase account.
E. When an advance which is or has been included in this account and in rate base results in a source of proven reserves of natural gas, gas deliveries commence but no gas flows to the pipeline company making such advance, the amount of the advance shall be removed from this account (and from rate base) and recorded in account 167, Other Advances for Gas. Any revenues collected as a result of the advance being included in rate base shall be refunded by the pipeline company to its customers, together with interest, per annum, at the rate established by Order No. 513, issued October 10, 1974, or as subsequently revised by Commission Order, from the date of payment until refunded, within 12 months after the removal of the advance from this account, unless otherwise directed by the Commission. Where there is partial recovery of the advance by gas, in this situation, the amount of the advance transferred from this account to account 167 and the amount of revenues refunded, with interest, shall be appropriately apportioned.
F. However, if 5 years elapses from the time the advance has been included in this account and during such time no gas deliveries have commenced or no determination has been made that the recovery will be in economic consideration other than gas, the pipeline shall at the end of the 5-year period, transfer the advance from this account to Account 167, and cease rate base treatment thereof, unless otherwise directed by the Commission.
G. Whenever as a result of an advance included in this account, a pipeline receives any amount in excess of a full recovery of the advance, e.g. interest income, such amount must be credited to Account 813, Other Gas Supply Expenses, or as otherwise directed by the Commission. If the income or return is received in other than money, it shall be included at the market value of the assets received.
H. If the recipient of an advance is unable to repay it in full, through no fault of the pipeline or contractual provisions, in gas or other assets, the unpaid or nonrecoverable portion must be credited to this account at the time such amount is recognized as nonrecoverable. Nonrecoverable advances significant in amount must be eliminated within 5 years from the date of determination as nonrecoverable by either a charge to account 435, Extraordinary Deductions, or when authorized by the Commission, by a transfer to account 186, Miscellaneous Deferred Debits, and amortization to account 813, Other Gas Supply Expenses. Nonrecoverable advances insignificant in amount should be charged directly to account 813 in the year recognized as nonrecoverable, when authorized by the Commission.
I. No transfers shall be made to or from this account to any other accounts, unless otherwise provided herein, except as specifically authorized by the Commission upon request by the pipeline company.
J. Three copies of any agreement concerning advances will be filed with the Secretary within 30 days of the initial related entry in account 166.

A. This account shall include the amounts of regulatory-created assets, not includible in other accounts, resulting from the ratemaking actions of regulatory agencies. (
See
Definition No. 31.)
B. The amounts included in this account are to be established by those charges which would have been included in net income, or accumulated
other comprehensive income, determinations in the current period under the general requirements of the Uniform System of Accounts but for it being probable that such items will be included in a different period(s) for purposes of developing rates that the utility is authorized to charge for its utility services.

B. This account shall be credited and account 410.1, Provision for Deferred Income Taxes, Utility Operating Income, or account 410.2, Provision for Deferred Income Taxes, Other Income and Deductions, as appropriate, shall be debited with an amount equal to that by which income taxes payable for the year are lower because of prior payment of taxes as provided by paragraph A above, because of difference in timing for tax purposes of particular items of income or income deductions from that recognized by the utility for general accounting purposes. Such credit to this account and debit to account 410.1 or 410.2 shall, in general, represent the effect on taxes payable in the current year of the smaller amount of book income recognized, or the larger deduction permitted, for tax purposes as compared to the amount recognized in the utility's current accounts with respect to the item or class of items for which deferred tax concept of accounting is affected.
C. Vintage year records with respect to entries to this account, as described above, and the account balance shall be so maintained as to show the factor of calculation with respect to each annual amount of the item or class of items for which deferred tax accounting by the utility is utilized.

Any over or under applied debits or credits to this account shall be carried
forward to the succeeding period of amortization.
D. Separate subaccounts shall be maintained for the amounts relating to the period in which the increase or decrease is accumulated and for the amortization of purchase gas increases or decreases, as applicable, so as to keep each period separate.

After initiation of exploration and development on leases acquired after October 7, 1969, the utility must determine after a reasonable period of time, and annually thereafter, whether the net realizable value of such recoverable reserves will be sufficient to absorb the net book value of amounts recorded in the accounts. The recoverable reserves shall be determined and attested to by independent appraisers no less frequently than every 3 years. If the net realizable value of recoverable reserves is not sufficient to absorb the net book value of amounts in the production accounts, the utility shall reduce the net book value of the amounts in the accounts to net realizable value of recoverable reserves. The reduction shall be done by first reducing the unamortized amounts recorded in Account 338, Unsuccessful Exploration and Development Costs, by debiting Account 404.1, Amortization and Depletion of Producing Natural Gas Land and Land Rights (for Nonmajor companies, 403.1, Depreciation and Depletion Expense). Next, if the net book value related to successful costs exceeds the net realizable value of the recoverable reserves, the production plant accounts shall be written down to such net realizable value by appropriate charges and credits to the expense and valuation accounts.
