# Note:
The Labeling of Hazardous Art Materials Act (“LHAMA”), 15 U.S.C. 1277 (Pub. L. 100-695, enacted November 18, 1988) provides that, as of November 18, 1990, “the requirements for the labeling of art materials set forth in the version of the standard of the American Society for Testing and Materials [“ASTM”] designated D-4236 that is in effect on [November 18, 1988] * * * shall be deemed to be a regulation issued by the Commission under section 3(b)” of the Federal Hazardous Substances Act, 15 U.S.C. 1262(b). For the convenience of interested persons, the Commission is including the requirements of ASTM D-4236 in paragraph (b)(8)(i) of this section, along with other requirements (stated in paragraph (b)(8)(ii) of this section) made applicable to art materials by the LHAMA. The substance of the requirements specified in LHAMA became effective on November 18, 1990, as mandated by Congress.
(i)
ASTM D-4236
—(A)
Scope
—(
1
) This section describes a procedure for developing precautionary labels for art materials and provides hazard and precautionary statements based upon knowledge that exists in the scientific and medical communities. This section concerns those chronic health hazards known to be associated with a product or product component(s), when the component(s) is present in a physical form, volume, or concentration that in
the opinion of a toxicologist (see paragraph (b)(8)(i)(B)(
11
) of this section) has the potential to produce a chronic adverse health effect(s).
(
2
) This section applies exclusively to art materials packaged in sizes intended for individual users of any age or those participating in a small group.
(
3
) Labeling determinations shall consider reasonably foreseeable use or misuse.
(
4
) Manufacturers or repackagers may wish to have compliance certified by a certifying organization. Guidelines for a certifying organization are given in paragraph (b)(8)(i)(H) of this section.
(B) Descriptions of Terms Specific to This Standard. (
1
) Art material or art material product—any raw or processed material, or manufactured product, marketed or represented by the producer or repackager as intended for and suitable for users as defined herein.
(
2
) Users—artists or crafts people of any age who create, or recreate in a limited number, largely by hand, works which may or may not have a practical use, but in which aesthetic considerations are paramount.
(
3
) Chronic adverse health effect(s)—a persistent toxic effect(s) that develops over time from a single, prolonged, or repeated exposure to a substance. This effect may result from exposure(s) to a substance that can, in humans, cause sterility, birth defects, harm to a developing fetus or to a nursing infant, cancer, allergenic sensitization, damage to the nervous system, or a persistent adverse effect to any other organ system.
(
4
) chronic health hazard(s) (hereafter referred to as “chronic hazard”)—a health risk to humans, resultant from exposure to a substance that may cause a chronic adverse health effect.
(
5
) Analytical laboratory—a laboratory having personnel and apparatus capable of performing quantitative or qualitative analyses of art materials, which may yield information that is used by a toxicologist for evaluation of potentially hazardous materials.
(
6
) Label—a display of written, printed, or graphic matter upon the immediate container of any art material product. When the product is unpackaged, or is not packaged in an immediate container intended or suitable for delivery to users, the label can be a display of such matter directly upon the article involved or upon a tag or other suitable labeling device attached to the art material.
(
7
) Producer—the person or entity who manufactures, processes, or imports an art material.
(
8
) Repackager—the person or entity who obtains materials from producers and without making changes in such materials puts them in containers intended for sale as art materials to users.
(
9
) Sensitizer—a substance known to cause, through an allergic process, a chronic adverse health effect which becomes evident in a significant number of people on re-exposure to the same substance.
(
10
) Toxic—applies to any substance that is likely to produce personal injury or illness to humans through ingestion, inhalation, or skin contact.
(
11
) Toxicologist—an individual who through education, training, and experience has expertise in the field of toxicology, as it relates to human exposure, and is either a toxicologist or physician certified by a nationally recognized certification board.
(
12
) Bioavailability—the extent that a substance can be absorbed in a biologically active form.
(C) Requirements. (
1
) The producer or repackager of art materials shall submit art material product formulation(s) or reformulation(s) to a toxicologist for review, such review to be in accordance with paragraph (b)(8)(l)(D) of this section. The toxicologist shall be required to keep product formulation(s) confidential.
(
2
) Unless otherwise agreed in writing by the producer or repackager, no one other than the toxicologists shall have access to the formulation(s); except that the toxicologists shall furnish a patient's physician, on a confidential basis, the information necessary to diagnose or treat cases of exposure or accidental ingestion.
(
3
) The producer or repackager, upon advice given by a toxicologist in accordance with paragraph (b)(8)(i)(D) of this section and based upon generally accepted, well-established evidence that a component substance(s) is
known to cause chronic adverse health effects adopt precautionary labeling in accordance with paragraph (b)(8)(i)(E) of this section.
(
4
) Labeling shall conform to any labeling practices prescribed by federal and state statutes or regulations and shall not diminish the effect of required acute toxicity warnings.
(
5
) The producer or repackager shall supply a poison exposure management information source the generic formulation information required for dissemination to poison control centers or shall provide a 24-hour cost-free telephone number to poison control centers.
(
6
) The producer or repackager shall have a toxicologist review as necessary, but at least every 5 years, art material product formulation(s) and associated label(s) based upon the then-current, generally accepted, well-established scientific knowledge.
(
7
) Statement of Conformance—“Conforms to ASTM Practice D-4236,” or “Conforms to ASTM D-4236,” or “Conforms to the health requirements of ASTM D-4236.” This statement may be combined with other conformance statements. The conformance statement should appear whenever practical on the product; however, it shall also be acceptable to place the statement on one or more of the following:
(
i
) The individual product package,
(
ii
) a display or sign at the point of purchase,
(
iii
) separate explanatory literature available on requirements at the point of purchase,
(
iv
) a response to a formal request for bid or proposal.
(D) Determination of Labeling. (
1
) An art material is considered to have the potential for producing chronic adverse health effects if any customary or reasonably foreseeable use can result in a chronic hazard.
(
2
) In making the determination, a toxicologist(s) shall take into account the following:
(
i
) Current chemical composition of the art material, supplied by an analytical laboratory or by an industrial chemist on behalf of a manufacturer or repackager.
(
ii
) Current generally accepted, well-established scientific knowledge of the chronic toxic potential of each component and the total formulation.
(
iii
) Specific physical and chemical form of the art material product, bioavailability, concentration, and the amount of each potentially chronic toxic component found in the formulation.
(
iv
) Reasonably foreseeable uses of the art material product as determined by consultation with users and other individuals who are experienced in use of the material(s), such as teachers, or by market studies, unless such use information has previously been determined with respect to the specific art material(s) under review.
(
v
) Potential for known synergism and antagonism of the various components of the formulation.
(
vi
) Potentially chronic adverse health effects of decomposition or combustion products, if known, from any reasonably foreseeable use of the hazardous art material product.
(
vii
) Opinions of various regulatory agencies and scientific bodies, including the International Agency for Research on Cancer and the National Cancer Institute, on the potential for chronic adverse health effects of the various components of the formulation.
(
3
) Based upon the conclusion reached in conformance with review determinations set forth herein, the toxicologist(s) shall recommend precautionary labeling consistent with paragraph (b)(8)(i)(E) of this section.
(E) Labeling Practices—(
1
) Signal Word. (
i
) When a signal word for an acute hazard(s) is mandated and a chronic hazard(s) exists, the signal word shall be that for the acute hazard.
(
ii
) When only a chronic hazard(s) exists, the signal word WARNING shall be used.
(
iii
) The signal word shall be prominently visible and set in bold capitals in a size equal to or greater than the statement of potential chronic hazards.
(
2
) List of Potentially Chronic Hazards—Potentially chronic hazards, as determined under the procedures of paragraph (b)(8)(i)(D) of this section, shall be stated substantially in accordance with the statements listed in paragraph (b)(8)(i)(F) of this section. Potentially chronic hazards noted shall be those that are clinically significant
and that might be expected with any reasonably foreseeable use of the art material. The hazards should be grouped in the order of relative descending severity.
(
3
) Name of Chronically Hazardous Component(s)—All components and known decomposition products of the formulation with a potential for chronic hazards, as determined under the procedures of paragraph (b)(8)(i)(D) of this section, shall be listed prominently. Generically equivalent names may be used.
(
4
) Safe Handling Instructions—Appropriate precautionary statements as to work practices, personal protection, and ventilation requirements shall be used substantially conforming with those listed in paragraph (b)(8)(i)(G) of this section.
(
5
) List of Sensitizing Components—To protect users from known sensitizers found within art materials, each label shall contain a list of those sensitizers present in sufficient amounts to contribute significantly to a known skin or respiratory sensitization.
(
6
) Combined Statement—If an art material contains more than one component capable of causing a chronic adverse health effect, or if a single chemical can cause several different chronic adverse health effects, the potential effects may be combined into one statement.
(
7
) Information Sources—The precautionary label shall contain a statement identifying a source for additional health information substantially in conformance with one of the phrases listed below:
(
i
) For more health information—(24 hour cost-free U.S. telephone number),
(
ii
) Contact a physician for more health information, or
(
iii
) Call your local poison control center for more health information.
(
8
) Labeling Content, Product Size—Any art material product in a container larger in size than one fluid ounce (30 ml) (if the product is sold by volume) or one ounce net weight (28 g) (if the product is sold by weight) shall have full precautionary labeling, as described in paragraph (b)(8)(i) (E) of this section. Any art material product in a container equal to or smaller than one fluid ounce or one ounce net weight shall have a label that includes a signal word in conformance with paragraph (b)(8)(i)(E)(
1
) of this section and a list of potentially harmful or sensitizing components in conformance with paragraphs (b)(8)(i)(E) (
3
) and (
5
) of this section.
(
9
) The information described in paragraph (b)(8)(i)(E) of this section must appear on:
(
i
) The outside container or wrapper, if any, unless it is easily legible through the outside container or wrapper and
(
ii
) All accompanying literature where there are directions for use, written or otherwise. Where a product that requires warning labels under paragraphs (b)(8)(i) (D) and (E) of this section is packed within a point-of-sale package that obscures the warning statement(s), the point-of-sale package shall carry the signal word conforming to paragraph (b)(8)(i)(E)(
1
) and the following wording: “Contains: (list hazardous product(s)) that may be harmful if misused. Read cautions on individual containers carefully. Keep out of the reach of children.”
(
10
) Statements required under paragraphs (b)(8)(i) (D) and (E) of this section must be in the English language and located prominently in conspicuous and legible type in contrast by topography, layout, or color with other printed matter on the label.
(
11
) Supplemental Information—Where appropriate, more detailed information that relates to chronic hazard(s), such as physical properties, decomposition products, detailed safety instructions, or disposal recommendations, shall be included in supplemental documents, such as Material Safety Data Sheets, technical brochures, technical data sheets etc.

(ii) The following shall apply with respect to the standard for art materials set forth in § 1500.14(b)(8)(i).
(A) The term
art material or art material product
shall mean any substance marketed or represented by the producer or repackager as suitable for use in any phase of the creation of any work of visual or graphic art of any medium. The term does not include economic poisons subject to the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act or drugs, devices, or cosmetics subject to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetics Act.
(B) The standard referred to in paragraph (b)(8)(i) of this section applies to art materials intended for users of any age.
(C) Each producer or repackager of art materials shall describe in writing the criteria used to determine whether an art material has the potential for producing chronic adverse health effects. Each producer or repackager shall submit, to the Commission's Division of Regulatory Management, Consumer Product Safety Commission, Washington, DC 20207, the written description of the criteria described above and a list of art materials that require hazard warning labels under this section. Upon request of the Commission, a producer or repackager shall submit to the Commission product formulations.
(D) All art materials that require chronic hazard labeling pursuant to this section must include on the label the name and United States address of the producer or repackager of the art materials, an appropriate United States telephone number that can be contacted for more information on the hazards requiring warning labels under this section, and a statement that such art materials are inappropriate for use by children.
(E) If an art material producer or repackager becomes newly aware of any significant information regarding the hazards of an art material or ways to protect against the hazard, this new information must be incorporated into the labels of such art materials that are manufactured after 12 months from the date of discovery. If a producer or repackager reformulates an art material, the new formulation must be evaluated and labeled in accordance with the standard set forth § 1500.14(b)(8)(i).
(F) In determining whether an art material has the potential for producing chronic adverse health effects, including carcinogenicity and potential carcinogenicity, the toxicologist to whom the substance is referred under the standard described above shall take into account opinions of various regulatory agencies and scientific
bodies, including the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC).
(iii) Pursuant to the LHAMA, the Commission has issued guidelines which, where possible, specify criteria for determining when any customary or reasonably foreseeable use of an art material can result in a chronic hazard. These guidelines include criteria for determining when art materials may produce chronic adverse effects in children and adults, criteria for determining which substances contained in art materials have the potential for producing chronic adverse effects and what those effects are, criteria for determining the bioavailability of chronically hazardous substances contained in art materials when the products are used in a customary or reasonably foreseeable manner, and criteria for determining acceptable daily intake levels for chronically hazardous substances contained in art materials. Because these guidelines apply to hazardous substances in general as well as to hazardous substances in art materials, the guidelines are set forth in § 1500.135 and a definition of “chronic toxicity” is provided in § 1500.3(c)(2)(ii) as part of supplementation of the term “toxic” in section 2(q) of the FHSA.
(iv)
Policies and interpretations.
(A) For purposes of enforcement policy, the Commission will not consider as sufficient grounds for bringing an enforcement action under the Labeling of Hazardous Art Materials Act (“LHAMA”) the failure of the following types of products to meet the requirements of § 1500.14(b)(8) (i) through (iii).
(
1
) Products whose intended general use is not to create art (e.g., common wood pencils, and single colored pens, markers, and chalk), unless the particular product is specifically packaged, promoted, or marketed in a manner that would lead a reasonable person to conclude that it is intended for use as an art material. Factors the Commission would consider in making this determination are how an item is packaged (e.g., packages of multiple colored pencils, chalks, or markers unless promoted for non-art materials uses are likely to be art materials), how it is marketed and promoted (e.g., pencils and pens intended specifically for sketching and drawing are likely to be art materials), and where it is sold (e.g., products sold in an art supply store are likely to be art materials). The products described in this paragraph do not meet the statutory definition of “art material.”
(
2
) Tools, implements, and furniture used in the creation of a work of art such as brushes, chisels, easels, picture frames, drafting tables and chairs, canvas stretchers, potter's wheels, hammers, air pumps for air brushes, kilns, and molds.
(
3
) Surface materials upon which an art material is applied, such as coloring books and canvas, unless, as a result of processing or handling, the consumer is likely to be exposed to a chemical in or on the surface material in a manner which makes that chemical susceptible to being ingested, absorbed, or inhaled.
(
4
) The following materials whether used as a surface or applied to one, unless, as a result of processing or handling, the consumer is likely to be exposed to a chemical in or on the surface material in a manner which makes that chemical susceptible to being ingested, absorbed, or inhaled: paper, cloth, plastics, films, yarn, threads, rubber, sand, wood, stone, tile, masonry, and metal.
(B) For purposes of LHAMA enforcement policy, the Commission will enforce against materials including, but not limited to, paints, crayons, colored pencils, glues, adhesives, and putties, if such materials are sold as part of an art, craft, model, or hobby kit. The Commission will enforce the LHAMA requirements against paints or other materials sold separately which are intended to decorate art, craft, model, and hobby items. Adhesives, glues, and putties intended for general repair or construction uses are not subject to LHAMA. However, the Commission will enforce the LHAMA requirements against adhesives, glues, and putties sold separately (not part of a kit) if they are intended for art and craft and model construction uses. This paragraph (b)(8)(iv)(B) applies to products introduced into interstate commerce on or after August 14, 1995.
(C) Commission regulations at § 1500.14(b)(8)(i)(C)(7) require that a statement of conformance appear with art materials that have been reviewed in accordance with the Commission standard. The Commission interprets this provision to require a conformance statement regardless of the presence of any chronic hazard warnings.
(D) Nothing in this enforcement statement should be deemed to alter any of the requirements of the Federal Hazardous Substances Act (“FHSA”), such as, but not limited to, the requirement that any hazardous substance intended or packaged in a form suitable for household use must be labeled in accordance with section 2(p) of the FHSA.

# Appendix A to § 1500.14(
b

# )(8)—Guidelines for a Certifying Organization (Not Mandatory)
(a) The term “certifying organization,” as used in this paragraph, refers to an organization or an institute that, after assuring that all provisions are met, certifies that an art material does conform to the labeling requirements of this practice.
(b) The certifying body may be funded by member manufacturers, but should include users or their representatives, as well as manufacturers' chemists, on its technical and certifying committees.
(c) Representative samples of art materials, labeled as conforming to this section and bought at retail, should be analyzed at random and from time to time by an analytical laboratory to ensure they are the same as the formulation used by the toxicologist(s) for determining labeling requirements.
(d) The methods used by the toxicologist(s) in review and determination of the need and content of precautionary labeling for potentially chronic adverse health effects should be periodically reviewed by an advisory board composed of not less than three or more than five toxicologists, at least one of whom is certified in toxicology by a nationally recognized certification board.
(e) In cases where there is disagreement by participating producers or participating users, with the determination of the toxicologist(s), there should be a method whereby the toxicologist's decision can be presented to the advisory board of toxicologists for arbitration.

§ 1500.15
Labeling of fire extinguishers.
When a substance or mixture of substances labeled for use in or as a fire extinguisher produces substances that are toxic within the meaning of § 1500.3(c) (1) and (2) when used according to label directions to extinguish a fire, the containers for such substances shall bear the following labeling:
(a) When substances are produced that meet the definition of highly toxic in § 1500.3(c)(1), the signal word “Danger” and the statement of hazard “Poisonous gases formed when used to extinguish flame or on contact with heat” are required labeling.
(b) When substances are produced that meet the definition of toxic in § 1500.3(c)(2), the signal word “Caution” or “Warning” and the statement of hazard “Dangerous gas formed when used to extinguish flame or on contact with heat” are required labeling.
(c) Regardless of whether paragraph (a) or (b) of this section applies, any substance or mixture of substances labeled for use as a fire extinguisher that, if applied to an electrical fire, would subject the user to the likelihood of electrical shock shall be conspicuously labeled “Caution: Do not use on electrical wires.”
(d) The statements specified in paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section shall be in addition to any other that may be required under the act. All such substances or mixtures of substances shall also bear the additional statements “Use in an enclosed place may be fatal” and “Do not enter area until well ventilated and all odor of chemical has disappeared.”
§ 1500.17
Banned hazardous substances.
(a) Under the authority of section 2(q)(1)(B) of the act, the Commission declares as banned hazardous substances the following articles because they possess such a degree or nature of hazard that adequate cautionary labeling cannot be written and the public health and safety can be served only by keeping such articles out of interstate commerce:
(1) Mixtures that are intended primarily for application to interior masonry walls, floors, etc., as a water repellant treatment and that are “extremely flammable” within the meaning of section 2(1) of the act (repeated in § 1500.3(b)(10)).
(2) Carbon tetrachloride and mixtures containing it (including carbon tetrachloride and mixtures containing it used in fire extinguishers), excluding unavoidable manufacturing residues of carbon tetrachloride in other chemicals that under reasonably foreseeable conditions of use do not result in an atmospheric concentration of carbon tetrachloride greater than 10 parts per million.
(3) Fireworks devices intended to produce audible effects (including but not limited to cherry bombs, M-80 salutes, silver salutes, and other large firecrackers, aerial bombs, and other fireworks designed to produce audible effects, and including kits and components intended to produce such fireworks) if the audible effect is produced by a charge of more than 2 grains of pyrotechnic composition; except that this provision shall not apply to such fireworks devices if all of the following conditions are met:
(i) Such fireworks devices are distributed to farmers, ranchers, or growers through a wildlife management program administered by the U.S. Department of the Interior (or by equivalent State or local government agencies); and
(ii) Such distribution is in response to a written application describing the wildlife management problem that requires use of such devices, is of a quantity no greater than required to control the problem described, and is where other means of control are unavailable or inadequate. (See also § 1500.14(b)(7); § 1500.17(a) (8) and (9); § 1500.83(a)(27); § 1500.85(a)(2); and part 1507).
(4) Liquid drain cleaners containing 10 percent or more by weight of sodium and/or potassium hydroxide; except that this subparagraph shall not apply to such liquid drain cleaners if packaged in accordance with a standard for special packaging of such articles promulgated under the Poison Prevention Packaging Act of 1970 (Pub. L. 91-601, 84 Stat. 1670-74 (15 U.S.C. 1471-76)).
(5) Products containing soluble cyanide salts, excluding unavoidable manufacturing residues of cyanide salts in other chemicals that under reasonable and foreseeable conditions of use will not result in a concentration of cyanide greater than 25 parts per million.
(6)(i) Any paint or other similar surface-coating material intended, or packaged in a form suitable, for use in or around the household that:
(A) Is shipped in interstate commerce after December 31, 1973, and contains lead compounds of which the lead content (calculated as the metal) is in excess of 0.06 percent of the total weight of the contained solids or dried paint film; or
(B) Is shipped in interstate commerce after December 31, 1972, and contains lead compounds of which the lead content (calculated as the metal) is in excess of 0.5 percent of the total weight of the contained solids or dried paint film.
(C) [Reserved]
(D) The provisions of paragraph (a)(6)(i) of this section do not apply to artists' paints and related materials.
(ii) Any toy or other article intended for use by children that:
(A) Is shipped in interstate commerce after December 31, 1973, and bears any paint or other similar surface-coating material containing lead compounds of which the lead content (calculated as the metal) is in excess of 0.06 percent of the total weight of the contained solids or dried paint film; or
(B) Is shipped in interstate commerce after December 31, 1972, and bears any paint or other similar surface-coating material containing lead compounds of which the lead content (calculated as the metal) is in excess of 0.5 percent of the total weight of the contained solids or dried paint film.
(iii) Since the Commission has issued comprehensive regulations for lead-containing paint and certain consumer products bearing such paint at the 0.06 percent level under the Consumer Product Safety Act (see 16 CFR part 1303), paragraphs (i) and (ii) of § 1500.17(a)(6) are revoked as to the subject products manufactured after February 27, 1978.

# Note:
The effective date of paragraphs (a)(6)(i)(A) and (a)(6)(ii)(A) was stayed by an order published in the
Federal Register
of August 10, 1972 (37 FR 16078).
(7) General-use garments containing asbestos (other than garments having a bona fide application for personal protection against thermal injury and so constructed that the asbestos fibers will not become airborne under reasonably foreseeable conditions of use).
(8) Firecrackers designed to produce audible effects, if the audible effect is produced by a charge of more than 50 milligrams (.772 grains) of pyrotechnic composition (not including firecrackers included as components of a rocket), aerial bombs, and devices that may be confused with candy or other foods, such as “dragon eggs,” and “cracker balls” (also known as “ball-type caps”), and including kits and components intended to produce such fireworks except such devices which meet all of the following conditions:
(i) The fireworks devices are distributed to farmers, ranchers, or growers through a wildlife management program administered by the U.S. Department of Interior (or by equivalent State or local governmental agencies); and
(ii) Such distribution is in response to a written application describing the wildlife management problem that requires use of such devices, is of a quantity no greater than required to control the problem described, and is where other means of control is unavailable or inadequate. (See also § 1500.17(a) (3) and (9)).
(9) All fireworks devices, other than firecrackers, including kits and components intended to produce such fireworks, not otherwise banned under the act, that do not comply with the applicable requirements of part 1507 of this chapter, except fireworks devices which meet all the following conditions:
(i) The fireworks devices are distributed to farmers, ranchers, or growers through a wildlife management program administered by the U.S. Department of the Interior (or by equivalent State or local government agencies); and
(ii) Such distribution is in response to a written application describing the wildlife management problem that requires use of such devices, is of a quantity no greater than required to control the problem described, and is where other means of control is unavailable or inadequate. (See also § 1500.17(a) (3) and (8)).
(10) Self-pressurized products intended or suitable for household use that contain vinyl chloride monomer as an ingredient or in the propellant manufactured or imported on or after October 7, 1974. (See also § 1500.17(a) (3) and (8)).
(11)(i) Reloadable tube aerial shell fireworks devices that use shells larger than 1.75 inches in outer diameter and that are imported on or after October 8, 1991.
(ii)
Findings.
(A)
General.
In order to issue a rule under section 2(q)(1) of the Federal Hazardous Substances Act (“FHSA”), 15 U.S.C. 1261(q)(1), classifying a substance or article as a banned hazardous substance, the FHSA requires the Commission to make certain findings and to include these findings in the regulation. These findings are discussed below.
(B)
Voluntary standard.
Although a voluntary standard relating to the risk of injury associated with reloadable tube aerial shells has been adopted, it has not been implemented. Thus, the Commission is not required to make findings covering the likelihood that the voluntary standard would result in elimination or adequate reduction of the risk of injury or that there would be substantial compliance with the voluntary standard.
(C)
Relationship of benefits to costs.
The Commission estimates that the removal of large reloadable shells from the market is likely to virtually eliminate the number of associated injuries, with only a slight offsetting increase in the number of injuries due to the use of substitute Class C fireworks products available to consumers. The estimated net benefits range from essentially zero to close to $1 million annually. The annual costs of a ban are estimated to be very low. Included are potential costs to foreign manufacturers and U.S. importers from sales losses, production changes, and inventory retrofitting, and slightly reduced market choices
for consumers who purchase aerial display fireworks. Costs to each of these sectors are estimated to be slight, and are reduced to the extent that alternative products are perceived as adequate substitutes for large reloadable shells. Thus, the Commission finds that the benefits expected from the regulation bear a reasonable relationship to its costs.
(D)
Least burdensome requirement.
The Commission considered several alternatives to the ban. These included: Design or performance criteria; additional or alternative labeling; inclusion of some reloadable shells 1.75 inches or smaller in the ban; and no action in reliance on the voluntary standard. The Commission determined that a ban of reloadable shells larger than 1.75 inches in outer diameter is the least burdensome alternative that would prevent or adequately reduce the risk of injury.
(
1
) Regarding design or performance criteria, the Commission considered requirements similar to those stated in the voluntary standard of the American Fireworks Standards Laboratory (“AFSL”). However, such criteria may increase the cost of the product and would not address all factors involved in the incidents. Further, concerns exist about the feasibility of criteria and quality control.
(
2
) Regarding additional or alternative labeling, the users' perception and experience concerning the amount of time available to get away may lead them to disregard an inconsistent warning. There are no data to suggest that a significant number, if any, incidents would be avoided if large reloadable shells carried more detailed labels or instructions than they currently do. It cannot be concluded that potential benefits would be greater than zero.
(
3
) The Commission considered including reloadable shells that are 1.75 inches or less in outer diameter and have the “equivalent explosive power” of larger shells. A kinetic energy level of 70 joules was considered to evaluate explosive power. However, any potential benefits are uncertain since the Commission concluded that a clear relation between kinetic energy and injury potential could not be established. Also, costs could be slightly higher.
(
4
) The Commission also considered imposing no mandatory requirements on large reloadable shells and relying instead on the AFSL voluntary standard. However, it is uncertain whether any net benefits to consumers would result from this alternative, since the level of injury reduction could be near zero if, as is probable, some firms chose not to conform with some or all of the AFSL standard.
(12)(i)
Large multiple-tube devices.
Multiple-tube mine and shell fireworks devices that first enter commerce or are imported on or after March 26, 1997, that have any tube measuring 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) or more in inner diameter, and that have a minimum tip angle less than 60 degrees when tested in accordance with the procedure of § 1507.12 of this part.
(ii)
Findings
—(A)
General.
In order to issue a rule under the section 2(q)(1) of the FHSA, 15 U.S.C. 1261(q)(1), classifying a substance or article as a banned hazardous substance, the FHSA requires the Commission to make certain findings and to include these in the regulation. These findings are discussed in paragraphs (a)(12)(ii) (B) through (D) of this section.
(B)
Voluntary standard.
(
1
) One alternative to the tip-angle requirement that the Commission considered is to take no mandatory action, and to depend on a voluntary standard. The American Fireworks Safety Laboratory (AFSL) has a standard for mines and shells intended to address the potential tip-over hazard associated with multiple-tube fireworks devices. AFSL's Voluntary Standard for Mines and Shells—Single or Multiple Shot requires that large multiple-tube devices not tip over (except as the result of the last shot) when shot on a 2-inch thick medium-density foam pad. The Commission cannot conclude that AFSL's existing voluntary standard adequately reduces the risk of injury from large devices that tip over while functioning. The Commission's tests using polyurethane foam did not find sufficient agreement between performance on foam and on grass. No other data are available to show that this dynamic test is reliable.
(
2
) In addition, even if the AFSL standard is effective, the Commission does not believe that compliance with the standard will be adequate. AFSL reports that it has been testing in accordance with its standard since January 1994. However, the results of CPSC's compliance testing indicate that multiple-tube devices still tip over while functioning. In fiscal year 1994, all 24 imported devices the Commission tested, and 1 of 8 domestic devices, tipped over while functioning. In fiscal year 1995, 22 of 27 imported devices and 1 of 5 domestic devices tipped over during Commission testing. The Commission finds that there is unlikely to be substantial compliance with the voluntary standard applicable to multiple-tube devices.
(C)
Relationship of benefits to costs.
The Commission estimates that the 60-degree tip-angle standard will eliminate the unreasonable tip-over risk posed by these devices. This will provide benefits of saving one life about every 3 years, and preventing an unknown number of nonfatal injuries. The annual cost of modifying affected devices is estimated to be between $1.5 million and $2.7 million. The Commission finds that the benefits from the regulation bear a reasonable relationship to its costs.
(D)
Least burdensome requirement.
The Commission considered the following alternatives: a ban of all multiple-tube devices with inner tube diameters 1.5 inches or greater; a dynamic performance standard; additional labeling requirements; and relying on the voluntary standard. Although a ban of all large multiple-tube devices would address the risk of injury, it would be more burdensome than the tip-angle standard. The Commission was unable to develop a satisfactory dynamic standard that would reduce the risk of injury. Neither additional labeling requirements nor reliance on the voluntary standard would adequately reduce the risk of injury. Thus, the Commission finds that a standard requiring large multiple-tube devices to have a minimum tip angle greater than 60 degrees is the least burdensome requirement that would prevent or adequately reduce the risk of injury.
(13)(i)
Candles made with metal-cored wicks.
Candles manufactured or imported on or after October 15, 2003, made with metal-cored candlewicks, unless:
(A) The metal core of each candlewick has a lead content (calculated as the metal) of not more than 0.06 percent of the total weight of the metal core; and
(B) Each outer container or wrapper in which candles subject to paragraph (a)(13)(i)(A) of this section are shipped, including each outer container or wrapper in which such candles are distributed to a retail outlet, is labeled “Conforms to 16 CFR 1500.17(a)(13).” For purposes of this paragraph (B), the term “outer container or wrapper” does not include the immediate container in which candle(s) is/are intended to be displayed at retail or during use in the home, unless that container or wrapper is also the only container or wrapper in which the candle(s) is/are shipped to a retailer.
(ii)
Metal-cored candlewicks.
Metal-cored candlewicks manufactured or imported on or after October 15, 2003, unless:
(A) The metal core of each candlewick has a lead content (calculated as the metal) of not more than 0.06 percent of the total weight of the metal core; and
(B) Each outer container or wrapper in which candlewicks subject to paragraph (a)(13)(ii)(A) of this section is shipped, including each outer container or wrapper of a shipment distributed to a retail outlet, is labeled “Conforms to 16 CFR 1500.17(a)(13).” For purposes of this paragraph (B), the term “outer container or wrapper” does not include the immediate container in which candlewick(s) is/are intended to be displayed or sold at retail, unless that container or wrapper is also the only container or wrapper in which the candlewick(s) is/are shipped to a retailer.
(iii)
Findings
—(A)
General.
To issue a rule under section 2(q)(1) of the FHSA, 15 U.S.C. 1261(q)(1), classifying a substance or article as a banned hazardous substance, the Commission must make certain findings and include them in
the regulation. These findings are discussed in paragraphs (a)(13)(iii)(B) through (D) of this section.
(B)
Voluntary standard.
One alternative to the ban that the Commission considered is to take no mandatory action, and to depend on a voluntary standard. One organization has a standard for candlewicks intended to address the potential for substantial illness posed by such wicks and candles with such wicks. The Commission has found that the standard is technically unsound and that substantial compliance with it is unlikely. Furthermore, there is no evidence that the standard has been adopted and implemented by candlewick or candle manufacturers.
(C)
Relationship of benefits to costs.
The Commission estimates that the ban will reduce the potential for exposure to lead and resulting lead poisoning because there is no “safe” level of lead in the blood. The annual cost to the candle/wick industry of the ban is estimated by the Commission to be in the range of $100,000 to $300,000. On a percentage basis these costs represent only 0.005 to 0.015 percent of the overall value of candle shipments in 2000, which was approximately $2 billion. Accordingly, the Commission finds that the benefits from the regulation bear a reasonable relationship to its costs.
(D)
Least burdensome requirement.
The Commission considered the following alternatives: no action; labeling all metal-cored candles with wicks containing more than 0.06 percent lead by weight of the metal; recordkeeping for shipments of wicks containing 0.06 percent or less lead by weight of the metal and of candles with such wicks; and relying on the voluntary standard. Neither no action, nor labeling, nor reliance on the voluntary standard would adequately reduce the risk of illness. Recordkeeping for shipments of wicks and of candles was not the least burdensome requirement that would prevent or adequately reduce the risk of illness. Therefore the Commission finds that a ban on candlewicks containing more than 0.06 percent lead by weight of the metal and candles with such wicks is the least burdensome requirement that would prevent or adequately reduce the risk of illness.

§ 1500.18
Banned toys and other banned articles intended for use by children.
(a)
Toys and other articles presenting mechanical hazards.
Under the authority of sections 2(f)(1)(D) and 24 of the act and pursuant to the provisions of section 3(e) of the act, the Commission has determined that the following types of toys or other articles intended for use by children present a mechanical hazard within the meaning of section 2(s) of the act because in normal use, or when subjected to reasonably foreseeable damage or abuse, the design or manufacture presents an unreasonable risk of personal injury or illness:
(1) Any toy rattle containing, either internally or externally, rigid wires, sharp protrusions, or loose small objects that have the potential for causing lacerations, puncture wound injury, aspiration, ingestion, or other injury. (But see § 1500.86(a)(1)).
(2) Any toy having noisemaking components or attachments capable of being dislodged by the operating features of the toy or capable of being deliberately removed by a child, which toy has the potential for causing laceration, puncture wound injury, aspiration, ingestion, or other injury.
(3) Any doll, stuffed animal, or other similar toy having internal or external components that have the potential for causing laceration, puncture wound injury, or other similar injury. (But see § 1500.86(a)(2)); (See also §§ 1500.48 and 1500.49).
(4) Lawn darts and other similar sharp-pointed toys usually intended for
outdoor use and having the potential for causing puncture wound injury.
(5) [Reserved]
(6) Any article known as a “baby-bouncer” or “walker-jumper” and any other similar article (referred to in this paragraph as “article(s)”), except an infant walker subject to part 1216, which is intended to support very young children while sitting, bouncing, jumping, and/or reclining, and which because of its design has any exposed parts capable of causing amputation, crushing, lacerations, fractures, hematomas, bruises, or other injuries to fingers, toes, or other parts of the anatomy of young children. Included among, but not limited to, the design features of such articles which classify the articles as banned hazardous substances are:
(i) The areas about the point on each side of the article where the frame components are joined together to form an “X” shape capable of producing a scissoring, shearing, or pinching effect.
(ii) Other areas where two or more parts are joined in such a manner as to permit a rotational movement capable of exerting a scissoring, shearing, or pinching effect.
(iii) Exposed coil springs which may expand sufficiently to allow an infant's finger, toe, or any other part of the anatomy to be inserted, in whole or in part, and injured by being caught between the coils of the spring or between the spring and another part of the article.
(iv) Holes in plates or tubes which provide the possibility of insertion, in whole or in part, of a finger, toe, or any part of the anatomy that could then be injured by the movement of another part of the article.
(v) Design and construction that permits accidental collapse while in use. (But see § 1500.86(a)(4)).
(7) Toys usually known as clacker balls and consisting of two balls of plastic or another material connected by a length of line or cord or similar connector (referred to as “cord” in § 1500.86(a)(5)), intended to be operated in a rhythmic manner by an upward and downward motion of the hand so that the two balls will meet forcefully at the top and bottom of two semicircles thus causing a “clacking” sound, which toys present a mechanical hazard because their design or manufacture presents an unreasonable risk of personal injury from fracture, fragmentations, or disassembly of the toy and from propulsion of the toy or its part(s). (But see § 1500.86(a)(5).) This does not include products that are constructed so that the connecting members consist of plastic rods integrally molded to the balls and are mounted on a pivot so that movement of the balls is essentially limited to a single plane.
(8) Any pacifier that does not meet the requirements of 16 CFR part 1511 and that is introduced into interstate commerce after February 26, 1978.
(9) Any toy or other article intended for use by children under 3 years of age which presents a choking, aspiration, or ingestion hazard because of small parts as determined by part 1501 of this chapter and which is introduced into interstate commerce after January 1, 1980. For purposes of this regulation, introduction into interstate commerce is defined as follows: A toy or children's article manufactured outside the United States is introduced into interstate commerce when it is first brought within a U.S. port of entry. A toy or children's article manufactured in the United States is introduced into interstate commerce (1) at the time of its first interstate sale, or (2) at the time of its first intrastate sale if one or more of its components and/or raw materials were received interstate, whichever occurs earlier. Part 1501 defines the term “toy or other article intended for use by children under 3,” as used in this regulation, and exempts certain products from banning under this regulation.
(10)-(11) [Reserved]
(12) Any bicycle as defined in § 1512.2(a) of this chapter (except a bicycle that is a “track bicycle” or a “one-of-a-kind bicycle” as defined in § 1512.2 (d) and (e) of this chapter) that is introduced into interstate commerce on or after May 11, 1976, and that does not comply with the requirements of part 1512 of this chapter, except for §§ 1512.5(c)(3), 1512.9(a), 1512.18(e) and 1512.18(f) which become effective November 13, 1976.
(15) Any rattle (as defined in § 1510.2 of this chapter) that is introduced into interstate commerce on or after August 21, 1978, and that does not comply with the requirements of part 1510 of this chapter. For purposes of the regulation, introduction into interstate commerce is defined as follows: A rattle manufactured outside the United States is introduced into interstate commerce when it is first brought within a U.S. port of entry. A rattle manufactured in the United States is introduced into interstate commerce (a) at the time of its first interstate sale, or (b) at the time of its first intrastate sale if one or more of its components and/or raw materials were received interstate.
(16) (i) Any article known as an “infant cushion” or “infant pillow,” and any other similar article, which has all of the following characteristics (But see § 1500.86(a)(9)):
(A) Has a flexible fabric covering. The term
fabric
includes those materials covered by the definition of “fabric” in section 2(f) of the Flammable Fabrics Act, 15 U.S.C. 1191(f).
(B) Is loosely filled with a granular material, including but not limited to, polystyrene beads or pellets.
(C) Is easily flattened.
(D) Is capable of conforming to the body or face of an infant.
(E) Is intended or promoted for use by children under one year of age.
(ii)
Findings
—(A)
General.
In order to issue a rule under section 2(q)(1) of the Federal Hazardous Substance Act (FHSA), 15 U.S.C. 1261(q)(1), classifying a substance or article as a banned hazardous substance, the FHSA requires the Commission to make certain findings and to include these findings in the regulation. These findings are discussed in paragraphs (a)(16)(ii) (B) through (D) of this section.
(B)
Voluntary standard.
No findings concerning compliance with or adequacy of a voluntary standard are necessary since no voluntary standard addressing infant cushions has been adopted or implemented.
(C)
Relationship of benefits to costs.
The Commission estimates that the removal of infant cushions from the market will result in total annual benefits of approximately five million dollars. The potential costs to businesses are expected to be offset by production of other products, and the potential costs to consumers are likely to be offset by the availability of substitutes for a comparable price.
(D)
Least burdensome requirement.
The Commission considered labeling and a design or performance standard as alternatives to the ban. The Commission does not believe that any form of labeling would have a significant effect in preventing the hazard associated with infant cushions. The Commission also concluded that no feasible standard exists that would address the hazard. Thus, the Commission determined that a ban of infant cushions is the least burdensome alternative that would prevent or adequately reduce the risk of injury.
(17) Any ball intended for children under three years of age that, under the influence of its own weight, passes, in any orientation, entirely through a circular hole with a diameter of 1.75 inches (44.4 mm.) in a rigid template
1/4
inches (6 mm.) thick. In testing to evaluate compliance with this paragraph, the diameter of opening in the Commission's test template shall be no greater than 1.75 inches (44.4 mm.).
(i) For the purposes of this paragraph, the term “ball” includes any spherical, ovoid, or ellipsoidal object that is designed or intended to be thrown, hit, kicked, rolled, dropped, or bounced. The term “ball” includes any spherical, ovoid, or ellipsoidal object that is attached to a toy or article by means of a string, elastic cord, or similar tether. The term “ball” also includes any multi-sided object formed by connecting planes into a generally spherical, ovoid, or ellipsoidal shape that is designated or intended to be used as a ball, and any novelty item of a generally spherical, ovoid, or ellipsoidal shape that is designated or intended to be used as a ball.
(ii) The term “ball” does not include dice, or balls permanently enclosed inside pinball machines, mazes, or similar outer containers. A ball is permanently enclosed if, when tested in accordance with 16 CFR 1500.52, the ball is not removed from the outer container.
(iii) In determining whether such a ball is intended for use by children under three years of age, the criteria specified in 16 CFR 1501.2(b) and the enforcement procedure established by 16 CFR 1501.5 shall apply.
(18)(i) Any bunk bed (as defined in § 1513.2(c) of this chapter) that does not comply with the requirements of part 1513 of this chapter.
(ii)
Findings.
In order to issue a rule under Section 3(e) of the Federal Hazardous Substances Act (FHSA), 15 U.S.C. 1262(e), classifying a toy or other article intended for use by children as a hazardous substance on the basis that it presents a mechanical hazard (as defined in Section 2(s) of the FHSA), the FHSA requires the Commission to make the following findings and to include these findings in the regulation: Bunk beds present a mechanical hazard; Where a voluntary standard has been adopted and implemented by the affected industry, that compliance with such voluntary standard is not likely to result in the elimination or adequate reduction of the risk of injury, or it is unlikely that there will be substantial compliance with such voluntary standard; The benefits expected from the rule bear a reasonable relationship to its costs; and The rule imposes the least burdensome requirement that prevents or adequately reduces the risk of injury for which the rule is being promulgated. These findings are made in the appendix to Part 1513.
(19)(i) Dive sticks, and other similar articles, that are used in swimming pools or other water environments for such activities as underwater retrieval games or swimming instruction, and which, when placed in the water, submerge and rest at the bottom of the pool. This includes products that are pre-weighted to sink to the bottom and products that are designed to allow the user to adjust the weight. Dive sticks and similar articles that come to rest underwater at an angle greater than 45 degrees from vertical when measured under the test at § 1500.86(a)(7) and dive sticks and similar articles that maintain a compressive force of less than 5-lbf under the test at § 1500.86(a)(8) are exempt from this banning rule. Articles that have a continuous circular shape, such as dive rings and dive disks are also exempt.
(ii)(A)
Findings.
In order for the Commission to issue a rule under section 2(q)(1) of the FHSA classifying a substance or article as a banned hazardous substance, the Commission must make certain findings and include these findings in the regulation. 15 U.S.C. 1262(i)(2). These findings are discussed in paragraphs (a)(18)(ii)(B) through (D) of this section.
(B)
Voluntary standard.
No findings concerning compliance with and adequacy of a voluntary standard are necessary because no relevant voluntary standard addressing the risk of injury posed by dive sticks has been adopted and implemented.
(C)
Relationship of benefits to costs.
The Commission estimates the potential benefits of removing hazardous dive sticks from the market to be 2 to 4 cents per dive stick. With the availability of substitutes and the expected low cost of modifying dive sticks to conform to the rule, the Commission anticipates that necessary changes will be minimal. The Commission estimates that the costs of the rule will be no more than 2 to 4 cents per dive stick. Thus, the Commission finds that there is a reasonable relationship between the expected benefits of the rule and its costs.
(D)
Least burdensome requirement.
The Commission considered pursuing voluntary recalls, following a voluntary standard, requiring labeling or changing the scope of the rule. A banning rule would be more effective than case-by-case recalls because the impalement hazard affects all dive sticks, not a specific brand or model. Awaiting recalls would allow these hazardous items on the market until the Commission obtained recalls. No applicable voluntary standard exists, and compliance may be low if one did. Although labeling could help reduce the risk of injuries from dive sticks, it would be less effective than a banning rule. It may be difficult for a label to convey the necessary information at the time of use. Modifying the scope so that the rule would only apply to pre-weighted dive sticks would continue to permit hazardous items because the unweighted dive sticks can easily be weighted to
stand vertically at the bottom of the water. Thus, the Commission finds that a ban of dive sticks with the hazardous characteristics it has identified is the least burdensome alternative that would adequately reduce the risk of injury.
(b)
Electrically operated toys and other electrical operated children's articles presenting electrical, thermal, and/or certain mechanical hazards.
Under the authority of section 2(f)(1)(D) of the act and pursuant to provisions of section 3(e) of the act, the Commission has determined that the following types of electrically operated toys or other electrically operated articles intended for use by children present electrical, thermal, and/or certain mechanical hazards within the meaning of section 2 (r), (s), and/or (t) of the act because in normal use or when subjected to reasonably foreseeable damage or abuse, the design or manufacture may cause personal injury or illness by electric shock and/or presents an unreasonable risk of personal injury or illness because of heat as from heated parts, substances, or surfaces, or because of certain mechanical hazards.
(1) Any electrically operated toy or other electrically operated article intended for use by children (as defined in § 1505.1(a)(1)) that is introduced into interstate commerce and which does not comply with the requirements of part 1505 of this chapter.

(c)
Toys and other articles (not electrically operated) presenting electric hazards.
Under the authority of section 2(f)(1)(D) of the act and pursuant to provisions of section 3(e) of the act, the Commission has determined that the following types of toys or other articles intended for use by children (not electrically operated) present an electrical hazard within the meaning of section 2(r) of the act.
(1) Any kite 10 inches or greater in any dimension constructed of aluminized polyester film or any kite having a tail or other component consisting of a piece of aluminized polyester film 10 inches or greater in any dimension presents an electrical hazard and is a banned hazardous substance because its design (specifically its size and electrical conductivity) presents a risk of personal injury from electric shock due to its ability to conduct electricity and to become entangled in or otherwise contact high voltage electric power lines.

Misbranded toys and other articles intended for use by children.
(a)
Definitions.
For the purposes of this section, the following definitions shall apply.
(1)
Ball
means a spherical, ovoid, or ellipsoidal object that is designed or intended to be thrown, hit, kicked, rolled, dropped, or bounced. The term “ball” includes any spherical, ovoid, or ellipsoidal object that is attached to a toy or article by means of a string, elastic cord, or similar tether. The term “ball” also includes any multi-sided object formed by connecting planes into a generally, spherical, ovoid, or ellipsoidal shape that is designated or intended to be used as a ball, and any novelty item of a generally spherical, ovoid, or ellipsoidal shape that is designated or intended to be used as a ball. The term “ball” does not include dice, or balls permanently enclosed inside pinball machines, mazes, or similar outer containers. A ball is permanently enclosed if, when tested in accordance with 16 CFR 1500.53, it is not removed from the outer container.
(2)
Small ball
means a ball that, under the influence of its own weight, passes, in any orientation, entirely through a circular hole with a diameter of 1.75 inches (44.4 mm.) in a rigid template
1/4
inches (6 mm.) thick. In testing to evaluate compliance with this regulation, the diameter of opening in the Commission's test template shall be no greater than 1.75 inches (44.4 mm.).
(3)
Latex balloon
means a toy or decorative item consisting of a latex bag that is designed to be inflated by air or gas. The term does not include inflatable children's toys that are used in aquatic activities such as rafts, water wings, swim rings, or other similar items.
(4)
Marble
means a ball made of a hard material, such as glass, agate, marble or plastic, that is used in various children's games, generally as a playing piece or marker. The term “marble” does not include a marble permanently enclosed in a toy or game. A marble is permanently enclosed if, when tested in accordance with 16 CFR 1500.53, it is not removed from the toy or game.
(5)
Small part
means any object which, when tested in accordance with the procedures contained in 16 CFR 1501.4(a) and 1501.4(b)(1), fits entirely within the cylinder shown in Figure 1 appended to 16 CFR part 1501. The use and abuse testing provisions of 16 CFR 1500.51 through 1500.53 and 1501.4(b)(2) do not apply to this definition.
(6)
Package
or packaging refers to the immediate package in which a product subject to labeling under section 24 of the act is sold, as well as to any outer container or wrapping for that package.
(7)
Descriptive material
means any discrete piece of written material separate from the label of the package that contains an instruction (whether written or otherwise) for the use of a product subject to these labeling requirements, any depiction of the product, and any written material that specifically describes any function, use, warnings, user population, design or material specification, or other characteristic of the product. A catalog or other marketing material or advertisement that depicts other products in addition to the product it accompanies is not “descriptive material” unless it contains additional information, such as instructions for use of the product it accompanies or lists of accessories exclusively for use with that product, that are designed to focus the purchaser's attention on the product. Descriptive material “accompanies” a product subject to the labeling requirements when it is packaged with the product or when it is intended to be distributed with the product at the time of sale or delivery to the purchaser. “Descriptive material” does not include statements that appear on the package of a product subject to the labeling requirements. “Descriptive material” does not include material intended solely for use by children if the package it accompanies contains a separate package insert prominently identified as a warning for parents that contains the required precautionary statements.
(8)
Bin
and
container for retail display
mean containers in which multiple unpackaged and unlabeled items are held for direct selection by and sale to consumers.
(b)
Misbranded toys and children's articles.
Pursuant to sections 2(p) and 24 of the FHSA, the following articles are misbranded hazardous substances if their packaging, any descriptive material that accompanies them, and, if unpackaged and unlabeled, any bin in which they are held for sale, any container in which they are held for retail display, or any vending machine from which they are dispensed, fails to bear the labeling statements required in paragraphs (b) (1) through (4) and paragraph (f)(3) of this section, or if such labeling statements fail to comply with the prominence and conspicuousness requirements of paragraph (d) of this section.
(1) With the exception of books and other articles made of paper, writing materials such as crayons, chalk, pencils, and pens, modeling clay and similar products, fingerpaints, watercolors, and other paint sets, and any other article identified in 16 CFR 1501.3 (other than balloons), any article that is a toy or game intended for use by children who are at least three years old but less than six years of age shall bear or contain the following cautionary statement if the toy or game includes a small part:
ER27FE95.001
(2) Any latex balloon, or toy or game that contains a latex balloon, shall bear the following cautionary statement:
ER27FE95.002
(3)(i) Any small ball intended for children three years of age or older shall bear the following cautionary statement:
ER27FE95.003
(ii) Any toy or game intended for children who are at least three years old but less than eight years of age that contains a small ball shall bear the following cautionary statement:
ER27FE95.004
(4)(i) Any marble intended for children three years of age or older shall bear the following cautionary statement:
ER27FE95.005
(ii) Any toy or game intended for children who are at least three years old but less than eight years of age that contains a marble shall bear the following cautionary statement:
ER27FE95.006
(c)
Age of intended user.
In determining the ages of the children for which any toy or article subject to this section is intended, the following factors are relevant: the manufacturer's stated intent (such as the age stated on a label) if it is reasonable; the advertising, marketing, and promotion of the article; and whether the article is commonly recognized as being intended for children in this age group. In enforcing this provision, the Commission will follow the procedures set forth in 16 CFR 1501.5.
(d)
Prominence and conspicuousness of labeling statements.
The requirements of 16 CFR 1500.121 relating to the prominence and conspicuousness of precautionary labeling statements for hazardous substances shall apply to any labeling statement required under § 1500.19(b) and (f), with the following clarifications and modifications.
(1) All labeling statements required by § 1500.19(b) and (f) shall be in the English language. The statements required by paragraph (b) need not appear in the format and layout depicted in paragraph (b). The statements required by 16 CFR 1500.19(b) and (f) shall be blocked together within a square or rectangular area, with or without a border. This means that the statements must appear on at least two lines. The statements shall be separated from all other graphic material by a space no smaller than the minimum allowable height of the type size for other cautionary material (e.g., the phrase “Not for children under 3 yrs.”). If not separated by that distance, the labeling statements must be surrounded by a border line. Label design, the use of vignettes, or the proximity of other labeling or lettering shall not obscure or render inconspicuous any labeling statement required under § 1500.19(b) and (f). This means that such statements shall appear on a solid background, which need not differ from the background color or any other color on the package label.
(2) The words “WARNING” or “SAFETY WARNING” required by section 24 of the FHSA shall be regarded as signal words.
(3) The statement “CHOKING HAZARD” shall be regarded as a statement
of the principal hazard associated with the products subject to this section.
(4) All other remaining statements required by this section shall be regarded as “other cautionary material” as that term is defined in 16 CFR 1500.121(a)(2)(viii).
(5) The principal display panel for a bin, container for retail display, or vending machine shall be the side or surface designed to be most prominently displayed, shown, or presented to, or examined by, prospective purchasers. In the case of bins or containers for retail display, the cautionary material may be placed on a display card of a reasonable size in relationship to the surface area of the bin or container. The area of the display card shall constitute the area of the principal display panel. In the case of vending machines that contain a display card, the cautionary label may be placed either on the display card, on the coinage indicator decal, or on the glass or clear plastic of the machine. If there is no display card inside a vending machine, the size of the principal display panel will be calculated in accordance with 16 CFR 1500.121(c) based on the size of the front of the container from which items are dispensed, exclusive of the area of metal attachments, coin inserts, bases, etc. Any other side or surface of such a bin, container for retail sale, or vending machine that bears information, such as price or product description, for examination by purchasers shall be deemed to be a principal display panel, excluding any side or surface with information that only identifies the company that owns or operates a vending machine.
(6) All of the labeling statements required by this section, including those classified as “other cautionary material,” must appear on the principal display panel of the product, except as provided for by § 1500.19(f). Any signal word shall appear on the same line and in close proximity to the triangle required by section 24 of the act. Multiple messages should be provided with sufficient space between them, when feasible, to prevent them from visually blending together.
(7) All labeling statements required by this section shall comply with the following type size requirements. 16 CFR 1500.121(c)(1) explains how to compute the area of the principal display panel and letter height.

(8) Labeling required by this section that appears on a bin, container for retail display, or vending machine shall be in reasonable proximity to any pricing or product information contained on the principal display panel, or, if such information is not present, in close proximity to the article that is subject to the labeling requirements.
(9) Descriptive material that accompanies a product subject to the labeling requirements, including accompanying material subject to the alternative allowed by § 1500.19(f), shall comply with the requirements of 16 CFR 1500.121(c)(6) relating to literature containing instructions for use which accompanies a hazardous substance. If the descriptive material contains instructions for use, the required precautionary labeling shall be in reasonable proximity to such instructions or directions and shall be placed together within the same general area (see 16 CFR 1500.121(c)(6)).
(10) In the case of any alternative labeling statement permitted under § 1500.19(e), the requirements of 16 CFR 1500.121(b)(3) and 1500.121(c)(2)(iii) shall apply to statements or indicators on the principal display panel directing attention to the complete cautionary labeling that appears on another display panel.
(11) Any triangle required by this section shall be an equilateral triangle. The height of such a triangle shall be equal to or exceed the height of the letters of the signal word “WARNING”.
The height of the exclamation point inside the triangle shall be at least half the height of the triangle, and the exclamation point shall be centered vertically in the triangle. The triangle shall be separated from the signal word by a distance at least equal to the space occupied by the first letter of the signal word. In all other respects, triangles with exclamation points shall conform generally to the provisions of 16 CFR 1500.121 relating to signal words.
(e)
Combination of labeling statements.
The labels of products that contain more than one item subject to the requirements of this section may combine information relating to each of the respective hazards, if the resulting condensed statement contains all of the information necessary to describe the hazard presented by each article. However, in the case of a product that contains a balloon and another item subject to the labeling requirements, only the signal word and statement of hazard may be combined.
(f)
Alternative labeling statements for small packages.
Any cautionary statement required by section 1500.19(b) may be displayed on a display panel of the package of a product subject to the labeling requirement other than the principal display panel only if:
(1) The package has a principal display panel of 15 square inches or less,
(2) The full labeling statement required by paragraph (b) of this section is displayed in three or more languages on another display panel of the package of the product, and
(3)(i) In the case of a toy or game subject to § 1500.19(b)(1), a small ball subject to § 1500.19(b)(3), a marble subject to § 1500.19(b)(4), or a toy or game containing such a ball or marble, the principal display panel of the package bears the statement:
ER27FE95.007
and bears an arrow or other indicator pointing toward or directing the purchaser's attention to the display panel on the package where the full labeling statement appears, or
(ii) In the case of a balloon subject to § 1500.19(b)(2) or a toy or game containing such a balloon, the principal display panel bears the statement:
ER27FE95.008
and bears an arrow or other indicator pointing toward or directing the purchaser's attention to the display panel on the package where the full labeling statement appears.
(g)
Alternative for products manufactured outside the United States.
In the case of a product subject to the labeling requirements of § 1500.19(b) which is manufactured outside the United States and is shipped directly from the manufacturer to the consumer by United States mail or other delivery service in an immediate package that contains descriptive material, the descriptive material inside the immediate package of the product need not bear the required labeling statement only if the shipping container of the product contains other accompanying material that bears the required statements displayed in a prominent and conspicuous manner. Products shipped from abroad to a U.S. affiliate for shipment to consumers are included within the scope of this exception.
(h)
Preemption.
Section 101(e) of the Child Safety Protection Act of 1994 prohibits any state or political subdivision of a state from enacting or enforcing any requirement relating to cautionary labeling addressing small parts hazards or choking hazards associated with any toy, game, marble, small ball, or balloon intended or suitable for use by children unless the state or local requirement is identical to a requirement established by section 24 of the FHSA or by 16 CFR 1500.19. Section 101(e) allows a state or political subdivision of a state to enforce a non-identical requirement relating to cautionary labeling warning of small parts hazards or choking hazards associated with any toy subject to the provisions of section 24 of FHSA until January 1, 1995, if the non-identical requirement was in effect on October 2, 1993.
[60 FR 10752, Feb. 27, 1995, as amended at 60 FR 41802, Aug. 14, 1995]
§ 1500.20
Labeling requirement for advertising toys and games.
(a)
Scope.
This section applies to catalogue and other printed material advertisements which provide a direct means of purchase or order of products requiring cautionary labeling under sections 24(a) and (b) of the FHSA.
(b)
Effective Date.
Under the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008, Public Law 110-314, 122 Stat. 3016 (August 14, 2008), (“CPSIA”), the effective date of the CPSIA's amendment to Section 24 of the FHSA to require cautionary statements in catalogues and other printed materials is February 10, 2009. By this rule, the Commission is providing a grace period of 180 days, or until August 9, 2009, during which catalogues and other printed materials printed prior to February 10, 2009, may be distributed without such cautionary statements. Catalogues and other printed materials that are printed on or after February 10, 2009, must have the required cautionary statements. All catalogues and other printed materials distributed on or after August 9, 2009, must comply with this rule. This rule addresses only catalogues and other printed materials; however, the CPSIA extends the requirements for cautionary statements to Internet advertisements as well. Internet advertisements must comply with Section 24 of the FHSA as amended by the CPSIA no later than December 12, 2008.
(c)
Definitions.
For the purposes of this section, the following definitions shall apply.
(1)
Ball
means a spherical, ovoid, or ellipsoidal object that is designed or intended to be thrown, hit, kicked, rolled, dropped, or bounced. The term “ball” includes any spherical, ovoid, or ellipsoidal object that is attached to a toy or article by means of a string, elastic cord, or similar tether. The term “ball” also includes a multi-sided object formed by connecting planes into a generally spherical, ovoid, or ellipsoidal shape that is designated or intended to be used as a ball, and any novelty item of a generally spherical, ovoid, or ellipsoidal shape that is designated or intended to be used as a ball. The term “ball” does not include dice, or balls permanently enclosed inside pinball machines, mazes, or similar other containers. A ball is permanently enclosed if, when tested in accordance with 16 CFR 1500.53, it is not removed from the outer container.
(2)
Small ball
means a ball that, under the influence of its own weight, passes in any orientation, entirely through a circular hole with a diameter of 1.75 inches (44.4 mm) in a rigid template
1/4
inches (6 mm) thick. In testing to evaluate compliance with this regulation, the diameter of opening in the Commission's test template shall be no greater than 1.75 inches (44.4 mm).
(3)
Latex balloon
means a toy or decorative item consisting of a latex bag that is designed to be inflated by air or gas. The term does not include inflatable children's toys that are used in aquatic activities such as rafts, water wings, swim rings, or other similar items.
(4)
Marble
means a ball made of hard material, such as glass, agate, marble, or plastic, that is used in various children's games, generally as a playing piece or marker. The term “marble” does not include a marble permanently enclosed in a toy or game. A marble is permanently enclosed if, when tested in accordance with 16 CFR 1500.53, it is not removed from the toy or game.
(5)
Small part
means any object which, when tested in accordance with the procedures contained in 16 CFR 1501.4(a) and 1501.4(b)(1), fits entirely within the cylinder shown in Figure 1 appended to 16 CFR part 1501. The use and abuse testing provisions of 16 CFR 1500.51 through 1500.53 and 1501.4(b)(2) do not apply to this definition.
(6)
Direct means of purchase or order
means any method of purchase that allows the purchaser to order the product without being in the physical presence of the product. Advertising that provides a direct means of purchase or order of a product would include catalogues or other printed advertising material that contain order blanks, telephone numbers or fax numbers for placing orders, and Internet Web sites that enable consumers to purchase a product online or through the use of a telephone number or fax number provided on the Internet Web site.
(d)
Advertising requirements.
Any toy or game that requires a cautionary statement about the choking hazard associated with small parts, balloons, small balls, or marbles must bear that cautionary statement in the product's advertising if the advertising provides a direct means to purchase or order the product.
(1) The advertising for any article that is a toy or game intended for use by children who are at least three years old but less than six years of age shall bear or contain the following cautionary statement if the toy or game includes a small part:

(ii) The advertising for any toy or game intended for children who are at least three years old but less than eight years of age that contains a marble shall bear the following cautionary statement:
ER17NO08.098
(e)
Abbreviated warnings for catalogues and other printed materials.
Abbreviated versions of the required cautionary statements are permitted in each individual product advertisement, provided that the corresponding full cautionary statements appear in the catalogue and a statement referring to the precise location of the full cautionary statements—such as the page number on which the cautionary statements can be found—is located at the bottom of each catalogue page that contains one or more abbreviated cautionary statements. If abbreviated cautionary statements are used:
(1) The full cautionary statements associated with the abbreviated cautionary statements shall appear:
(i) Near the beginning of the catalogue, before any catalogue pages that contain advertisements of products available for purchase, or
(ii) Adjacent to the ordering information or order form in the catalogue.
(2) The full cautionary statements shall be in conspicuous and legible type in contrast by typography, layout or color.
(3) The full cautionary statements shall be clearly numbered according to the following scheme:

(f)
Alternatives to cautionary statements for individual product advertisements in catalogues and other printed materials.
Multiple identical full or abbreviated cautionary statements may be replaced with a single full cautionary statement under the following circumstances:
(1) If all products available for purchase within a catalogue require the same cautionary statement, that cautionary statement, in full, may appear on the front cover, or equally conspicuous location, of the catalogue in lieu of repeating the cautionary statement within the catalogue, provided that it is communicated to consumers that the cautionary statement applies to all products in the catalogue.
(2) If all products on one catalogue page or on two facing catalogue pages require the same cautionary statement, that cautionary statement, in full, may appear at the top of the page or pages in lieu of repeating the cautionary statement in each product advertisement, provided that it is communicated to consumers that the cautionary statement applies to all products on the catalogue page or pages.
(g)
Prominence and conspicuousness of labeling statements.
The type size of abbreviated cautionary statements shall be reasonably related to the type size of any other printed matter in the product advertisement, and must be in conspicuous and legible type by typography, layout, or color with other printed matter in the advertisement and separated from other graphic matter.
(h)
Business to Business Catalogue Exception.
The requirements of section 24(c)of the Federal Hazardous Substances Act, as amended by section 105 of the CPSIA, do not apply to catalogues and other printed materials distributed solely between businesses unless the recipient business is one that could be expected to be purchasing the product for the use of children (instead of for resale, e.g.). Examples of businesses that can be expected to be purchasing products for the use of children include day care centers, schools, and churches.

§ 1500.40
Method of testing toxic substances.
Guidelines for testing the toxicity of substances, including testing that does not require animals, are presented in the CPSC's animal testing policy set forth in 16 CFR 1500.232. A weight-of-evidence analysis, including any of the following: existing human and animal data, structure activity relationships, physicochemical properties; and chemical reactivity, or validated
in vitro
or
in silico
testing are recommended to evaluate existing information before
in vivo
tests are considered. If
in vivo
testing is conducted, a sequential testing strategy is recommended to reduce the number of test animals. The method of testing the toxic substances referred to in § 1500.3(c)(1) and (2) is as follows:
(a)
Acute dermal toxicity
(
single exposure
). In the acute exposures, the agent is held in contact with the skin by means of a sleeve for periods varying up to 24 hours. The sleeve, made of rubber dam or other impervious material, is so constructed that the ends are reinforced with additional strips and should fit snugly around the trunk of the animal. The ends of the sleeve are tucked, permitting the central portion to “balloon” and furnish a reservoir for the dose. The reservoir must have sufficient capacity to contain the dose without pressure. In the following table are given the dimensions of sleeves and the approximate body surface exposed to the test substance. The sleeves may vary in size to accommodate smaller or larger subjects. In the testing of unctuous materials that adhere readily to the skin, mesh wire screen may be employed instead of the sleeve. The screen is padded and raised approximately 2 centimeters from the exposed skin. In the case of dry powder preparations, the skin and substance are moistened with physiological saline prior to exposure. The sleeve or screen is then slipped over the gauze that holds the dose applied to the skin. In the case of finely divided powders, the measured dose is evenly distributed on cotton gauze which is then secured to the area of exposure.

(b)
Preparation of test animal.
The animals are prepared by clipping the skin of the trunk free of hair. Approximately one-half of the animals are further prepared by making epidermal abrasions every 2 or 3 centimeters longitudinally over the area of exposure. The abrasions are sufficiently deep to penetrate the stratum corneum (horny layer of the epidermis) but not to distrub the derma; that is, not to obtain bleeding.
(c)
Procedures for testing.
The sleeve is slipped onto the animal which is then placed in a comfortable but immobilized position in a multiple animal holder. Selected doses of liquids and solutions are introduced under the sleeve. If there is slight leakage from the sleeve, which may occur during the first few hours of exposure, it is collected and reapplied. Dosage levels are adjusted in subsequent exposures (if necessary) to enable a calculation of a
dose that would be fatal to 50 percent of the animals. This can be determined from mortality ratios obtained at various doses employed. At the end of 24 hours the sleeves or screens are removed, the volume of unabsorbed material (if any) is measured, and the skin reactions are noted. The subjects are cleaned by thorough wiping, observed for gross symptoms of poisoning, and then observed for 2 weeks.
[38 FR 27012, Sept. 27, 1973, as amended at 77 FR 73294, Dec. 10, 2012; 83 FR 8342, Feb. 27, 2018]
§ 1500.41
Method of testing primary irritant substances.
Guidelines for testing the dermal irritation and corrosivity properties of substances, including testing that does not require animals, are presented in the CPSC's animal testing policy set forth in 16 CFR 1500.232. A weight-of-evidence analysis or a validated
in vitro
test method is recommended to evaluate existing information before
in vivo
tests are considered. This analysis should include all of the following that are available: human and animal data, structure activity relationships, physicochemical properties, and dermal toxicity. If
in vivo
testing is conducted, a sequential testing strategy is recommended to reduce the number of test animals. The method of testing the dermal corrosivity and primary irritation of substances referred to in § 1500.3(c)(3) and (4), respectively, is a patch-test technique on the abraded and intact skin of the albino rabbit, clipped free of hair. Primary irritation to the skin is measured by a patch-test technique on the abraded and intact skin of the albino rabbit, clipped free of hair. A minimum of six subjects are used in abraded and intact skin tests. Introduce under a square patch, such as surgical gauze measuring 1 inch by 1 inch and two single layers thick, 0.5 milliliter (in the case of liquids) or 0.5 gram (in the case of solids and semisolids) of the test substance. Dissolve solids in an appropriate solvent and apply the solution as for liquids. The animals are immobilized with patches secured in place by adhesive tape. The entire trunk of the animal is then wrapped with an impervious material, such as rubberized cloth, for the 24-hour period of exposure. This material aids in maintaining the test patches in position and retards the evaporation of volatile substances. After 24 hours of exposure, the patches are removed and the resulting reactions are evaluated on the basis of the designated values in the following table:
Skin reaction
Value
1
Erythema and eschar formation:
No erythema
0
Very slight erythema (barely perceptible)

Well-defined erythema
2
Moderate to severe erythema
3
Severe erythema (beet redness) to slight eschar formations (injuries in depth)
4
Edema formation:
No edema
0
Very slight edema (barely perceptible)
1
Slight edema (edges of area well defined by definite raising)
2
Moderate edema (raised approximately 1 millimeter)
3
Severe edema (raised more than 1 millimeter and extending beyond the area of exposure)
4
1
The “value” recorded for each reading is the average value of the six or more animals subject to the test.
Readings are again made at the end of a total of 72 hours (48 hours after the first reading). An equal number of exposures are made on areas of skin that have been previously abraded. The abrasions are minor incisions through the stratum corneum, but not sufficiently deep to disturb the derma or to produce bleeding. Evaluate the reactions of the abraded skin at 24 hours and 72 hours, as described in this paragraph. Add the values for erythema and eschar formation at 24 hours and at 72 hours for intact skin to the values on abraded skin at 24 hours and at 72 hours (four values). Similarly, add the values for edema formation at 24 hours and at 72 hours for intact and abraded skin (four values). The total of the eight values is divided by four to give the primary irritation score; for example:
Skin reaction
Exposure time (hours)

§ 1500.42
Test for eye irritants.
Guidelines for
in vivo
and
in vitro
testing of ocular irritation of substances, including testing that does not require animals, are presented in the CPSC's animal testing policy set forth in 16 CFR 1500.232. A weight-of-evidence analysis or a validated
in vitro
test method is recommended to evaluate existing information before
in vivo
tests are considered. This analysis should include any of the following: Existing human and animal data on ocular or dermal irritation, structure activity relationships, physicochemical properties, and chemical reactivity. If
in vivo
testing is conducted, a sequential testing strategy is recommended to reduce the number of test animals. Additionally, the routine use of topical anesthetics, systemic analgesics, and humane endpoints to avoid or minimize pain and distress in ocular safety testing is recommended.
(a)(1) In the method of testing the ocular irritation of a substance referred to in § 1500.3(c)(4), six albino rabbits are used for each test substance. Animal facilities for such procedures shall be so designed and maintained as to exclude sawdust, wood chips, or other extraneous materials that might produce eye irritation. Both eyes of each animal in the test group shall be examined before testing, and only those animals without eye defects or irritation shall be used. The animal is held firmly but gently until quiet. The test material is placed in one eye of each animal by gently pulling the lower lid away from the eyeball to form a cup into which the test substance is dropped. The lids are then gently held together for one second and the animal is released. The other eye, remaining untreated, serves as a control. For testing liquids, 0.1 milliliter is used. For solids or pastes, 100 milligrams of the test substance is used, except that for substances in flake, granule, powder, or other particulate form the amount that has a volume of 0.1 milliliter (after compacting as much as possible without crushing or altering the individual particles, such as by tapping the measuring container) shall be used whenever this volume weighs less than 100 milligrams. In such a case, the weight of the 0.1 milliliter test dose should be recorded. The eyes are not washed following instillation of test material except as noted below.
(2) The eyes are examined and the grade of ocular reaction is recorded at 24, 48, and 72 hours. Reading of reactions is facilitated by use of a binocular loupe, hand slit-lamp, or other expert means. After the recording of observations at 24 hours, any or all eyes may be further examined after applying fluorescein. For this optional test, one drop of fluorescein sodium ophthalmic solution U.S.P. or equivalent is dropped directly on the cornea. After flushing out the excess fluorescein with sodium chloride solution U.S.P. or equivalent, injured areas of the cornea appear yellow; this is best visualized in a darkened room under ultraviolet illumination. Any or all eyes may be washed with sodium chloride solution U.S.P. or equivalent after the 24-hour reading.
(b)(1) An animal shall be considered as exhibiting a positive reaction if the test substance produces at any of the readings ulceration of the cornea (other than a fine stippling), or opacity of the cornea (other than a slight dulling of the normal luster), or inflammation of the iris (other than a slight deepening of the folds (or rugae) or a slight circumcorneal injection of the blood vessels), or if such substance produces in the conjunctivae (excluding the cornea and iris) an obvious swelling with partial eversion of the lids or a diffuse crimson-red with individual vessels not easily discernible.
(2) The test shall be considered positive if four or more of the animals in
the test group exhibit a positive reaction. If only one animal exhibits a positive reaction, the test shall be regarded as negative. If two or three animals a positive reaction, the test is repeated using a different group of six animals. The second test shall be considered positive if three or more of the animals exhibit a positive reaction. If only one or two animals in the second test exhibit a positive reaction, the test shall be repeated with a different group of six animals. Should a third test be needed, the substance will be regarded as an irritant if any animal exhibits a positive response.

§ 1500.43
Method of test for flashpoint of volatile flammable materials by Tagliabue open-cup apparatus.

# Scope
1. (a) This method describes a test procedure for the determination of open-cup flashpoints of volatile flammable materials having flashpoints below 175 °F.
(b) This method, when applied to paints and resin solutions which tend to skin over or which are very viscous, gives less reproducible results than when applied to solvents.

# Outline of Method
2. The sample is placed in the cup of a Tag Open Tester, and heated at a slow but constant rate. A small test flame is passed at a uniform rate across the cup at specified intervals. The flashpoint is taken as the lowest temperature at which application of the test flame causes the vapor at the surface of the liquid to flash, that is, ignite but not continue to burn.

# Apparatus
3. The Tag open-cup tester is illustrated in Fig. 1. It consists of the following parts, which must conform to the dimensions shown, and have the additional characteristics as noted:
EC03OC91.051
(a)
Copper bath,
preferably equipped with a constant level overflow so placed as to maintain the bath liquid level
1/8
-inch below the rim of the glass cup.
(b)
Thermometer holder.
Support firmly with ringstand and clamp.
(c)
Thermometer.
For flashpoints above 40 °F., use the ASTM Tag Closed Tester Thermometer, range of + 20 to + 230 °F., in 1 °F. divisions, and conforming to thermometer 9F. of ASTM Standard E 1. For flashpoints from 20 °F. to 40 °F., use ASTM Tag Closed Tester, Low Range, Thermometer 57F. For flashpoints below 20 °F., use ASTM Thermometer 33F. The original Tag Open-Cup (Paper Scale) Thermometer will be a permissible alternate until January 1, 1962. It is calibrated to −20 °F.
(d)
Glass test cup.
Glass test cup (Fig. 2), of molded clear glass, annealed, heat-resistant, and free from surface defects.
EC03OC91.052
(e)
Leveling device.
Leveling device or guide, for proper adjustment of the liquid level in the cup (Fig. 3). This shall be made of No. 18-gage polished aluminum, with a projection for adjusting the liquid level when the sample is added to exactly
1/8
-inch below the level of the edge or rim of the cup.
EC03OC91.053
(f) “Micro,” or small gas burner of suitable dimensions for heating the bath. A screw clamp may be used to help regulate the gas. A small electric heater may be used.
(g) Ignition taper, which is a small straight, blow-pipe type gas burner. The test flame torch prescribed in the method of test for flash and fire points by Cleveland Open Cup (ASTM designation: D 92) is satisfactory.
(h) Alternative methods for maintaining the ignition taper in a fixed horizontal plane above the liquid may be used, as follows:
(1) Guide wire,
3/32
-inch in diameter and 3
1/2
inches in length, with a right-angle bend
1/2
-inch from each end. This wire is placed snugly in holes drilled in the rim of the bath, so that the guide wire is
5/8
-inch from the center of the cup and resting on the rim of the cup.
(2) Swivel-type taper holder, such as is used in ASTM METHOD D 92. The height and position of the taper are fixed by adjusting the holder on a suitable ringstand support adjacent to the flash cup.
(i) Draft shield, consisting of two rectangular sheets of noncombustible material, 24 inches × 28 inches, are fastened together along the 28-inch side, preferably by hinges. A triangular sheet, 24 inches × 24 inches × 34 inches is fastened by hinges to one of the lateral sheets (to form a top when shield is open). The interior of the draft shield shall be painted a flat black.

# Procedure
4. (a) Place the tester on a solid table free of vibration, in a location free of perceptible draft, and in a dim light.
(b) Run water, brine, or water-glycol solution into the bath to a predetermined level, which will fill the bath to
1/8
-inch below the top when the cup is in place. An overflow is permissible for water-level control.
(c) Firmly support the thermometer vertically halfway between the center and edge of the cup on a diameter at right angles to the guide wire, or on a diameter passing through the center of the cup and the pivot of the taper. Place so that the bottom of the bulb is
1/4
-inch from the inner bottom surface of the cup. If the old Tagliabue thermometer is used, immerse to well cover the mercury bulb, but not the wide body of the thermometer.
(d) Fill the glass cup with the sample liquid to a depth just
1/8
-inch below the edge, as determined by the leveling device.
(e) Place the guide wire or swivel device in position, and set the draft shield around the tester so that the sides from right angles with each other and the tester is well toward the back of the shield.
(f) If a guide wire is used, the taper, when passed, should rest lightly on the wire, with the end of the jet burner just clear of the edge of the guide wire. If the swivel-type holder is used, the horizontal and vertical positions to the jet are so adjusted that the jet passes on the circumference of a circle, having a radius of at least 6 inches, across the center of the cup at right angles to the diameter passing through the thermometer, and in a plane
1/8
-inch above the upper edge of the cup. The taper should be kept in the “off” position, at one end or the other of the swing, except when the flame is applied.
(g) Light the ignition flame and adjust it to form a flame of spherical form matching in size the
5/52
-inch sphere on the apparatus.
(h) Adjust heater source under bath so that the temperature of the sample increases at a rate of 2±0.5 °F. per minute. With viscous materials this rate of heating cannot always be obtained.

# Initial Test
5. Determine an approximate flashpoint by passing the taper flame across the sample at
intervals of 2 °F. Each pass must be in one direction only. The time required to pass the ignition flame across the surface of the sample should be 1 second. Remove bubbles from the surface of the sample liquid before starting a determination. Meticulous attention to all details relating to the taper, size of taper flame, and rate of passing the taper is necessary for good results. When determining the flashpoint of viscous liquids and those liquids that tend to form a film of polymer, etc., on the surface, the surface film should be disturbed mechanically each time before the taper flame is passed.

# Recorded Tests
6. Repeat the procedure by cooling a fresh portion of the sample, the glass cup, the bath solution, and the thermometer at least 20 °F. below the approximate flashpoint. Resume heating, and pass the taper flame across the sample at two intervals of 2 °F. until the flashpoint occurs.

# Reporting Data
7. The average of not less than three recorded tests, other than the initial test, shall be used in determining the flashpoint and flammability of the substance.

# Standardization
8. (a) Make determinations in triplicate on the flashpoint of standard paraxylene and of standard isopropyl alcohol which meet the following specifications:
(i)
Specifications for p-xylene, flashpoint check grade. p-xylene shall conform to the following requirements;
Specific gravity: 15.56 °C./15.56 °C., 0.860 minimum, 0.866 maximum
Boiling range: 2 °C. maximum from start to dry point when tested in accordance with the method of test for distillation of industrial aromatic hydrocarbons (ASTM designation: D 850), or the method of test for distillation range of lacquer solvents and diluents (ASTM) designation D 1078). The range shall include the boiling point of pure
P
-xylene, which is 138.35 °C. (281.03 °F.).
Purity: 95 percent minimum, calculated in accordance with the method of test for determination of purity from freezing points of high-purity compounds (ASTM designation: D 1016), from the experimentally determined freezing point, measured by the method of test for measurement of freezing points of high-purity compounds for evaluation of purity (ASTM designation: D 1015).
(ii)
Specifications for ispropanol, flash point check grade.
Isopropanol shall conform to the following requirements:
Specific gravity: 0.8175 to 0.8185 at 20 °C./20 °C. as determined by means of a calibrated pycnometer.
Distillation range: Shall entirely distill within a 1.0 °C. range which shall include the temperature 80.4 °C. as determined by ASTM method D 1078.
Average these values for each compound. If the difference between the values for these two compounds is less than 15 °F. (8.5 °C.) or more than 27 °F. (16 °C.), repeat the determinations or obtain fresh standards.
(b) Calculate a correction factor as follows:
X
= 92 − A
Y
= 71 − B
Correction = (
X
+
Y
) / 2.
Where:
A = Observed flash of
p-
xylene, and
B = Observed flash of isopropyl alcohol.
Apply this correction of all determinations.
Half units in correction shall be discarded.

# Precision
9. (a) For hydrocarbon solvents having flashpoints between 60 °F. and 110 °F., repeatability is ±2 °F. and the reproducibility is ±5 °F.
(b) If results from two tests differ by more than 10 °F., they shall be considered uncertain and should be checked. This calibration procedure provided in this method will cancel out the effect of barometric pressure if calibration and tests are run at the same pressure. Data supporting the precision are given appendix III of the 1956 Report of Committee D-1 on Paint, Varnish, Lacquers and Related Products, Proceedings, Am. Soc. Testing Mats., Vol. 56 (1956).

# Note:
The test apparatus and procedure described in § 1500.43 may be used by manufacturers and labelers of products subject to the Federal Hazardous Substances Act to determine flashpoint temperatures of those products under the conditions set forth in § 1500.3(c)(6)(iv), as amended.
[51 FR 28537, Aug. 8, 1986]
§ 1500.43a
Method of test for flashpoint of volatile flammable materials.
(a)
Scope.
(1) This method describes the test procedure which the Commission will use for the determination of the flashpoint of volatile flammable materials, using a Setaflash
1
low-range closed tester, or an apparatus producing equivalent results. The method described in this section is essentially a Setaflash equilibrium procedure
which closely parallels the test method designated ASTM D 3828-81, “Standard Test Methods for Flash Point by Setaflash Closed Tester,” published by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM), 1916 Race Street, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19103. Manufacturers and labelers of products subject to labeling and other requirements under the Federal Hazardous Substances Act may use other apparatus and/or test methods which produce equivalent results.
1
Setaflash is a registered trademark of Stanhope-Seta Limited, Surrey, England.
(2) At the option of the user, the procedures described in this section may be used to determine the actual flashpoint temperature of a sample or to determine whether a product will or will not flash at a specified temperature (flash/no flash).
(3) If the substance to be tested has a viscosity greater than 150 Stokes at 77 °F (25 °C), see paragraph (n) of this section for modifications to the testing procedure.
(4) If the Commission has reason to believe on the basis of reliable experience or other relevant information or data that the flammability hazard of a substance is greater or less than its flammability classification based on flashpoint temperature determined in accordance with this § 1500.43a and that the substance should be reclassified, the Commission will initiate a rulemaking proceeding for reclassification of the substance. Product manufacturers and labelers may use reliable experience or other relevant information or data in addition to the flashpoint temperature of a substance as a basis for compliance with any applicable requirements of the Federal Hazardous Substances Act in the absence of a rule issued by the Commission to reclassify the substance.
(b)
Summary of test methods.
(1) Method A—Flash/No Flash Test. A specified volume of sample is introduced by a syringe into the cup of the apparatus that is set and maintained at the specified temperature. After a specific time a test flame is applied and an observation made as to whether or not a flash occurred. Test procedures are set forth in detail in § 1500.43a(i).
(2) Method B—Finite (or Actual) Flashpoint. (i) A specified voume of sample is introduced into the cup of the apparatus that is maintained at the expected flashpoint. After a specified time a test flame is applied and the observation made whether or not a flash occurred.
(ii) The specimen is removed from the cup, the cup cleaned, and the cup temperature adjusted 5 °C (9 °F), lower or higher depending on whether or not a flash occurred previously. A fresh specimen is introduced and tested. This procedure is repeated until the flashpoint is established within 5 °C (9 °F).
(iii) The procedure is then repeated at 1 °C (2 °F) intervals until the flashpoint is determined to the nearest 1 °C (2 °F).
(iv) If improved accuracy is desired the procedure is repeated at 0.5 °C (1 °F). Test procedures are set forth in detail at § 1500.43a(j).
(3) The test procedures will be modified, where necessary, to ensure that the results obtained reflect the hazard of the substance under reasonably foreseeable conditions of use. Thus, for example, the material, if a mixture, will normally be tested as it comes from the container, and/or after a period of evaporation. The period of evaporation for a material which is a mixture will normally be the time required for the mixture to evaporate in an open beaker under ambient conditions to 90 percent of its original volume, or a period of four hours, whichever occurs first. However, this period of evaporation will be changed if the results obtained do not represent the hazard of the substance under reasonably foreseeable conditions of use.
(c)
Definition of flashpoint.
The lowest temperature of the sample, corrected to a barometric pressure of 101.3 kPa (760 mm Hg), at which application of a test flame causes the vapor of the sample to ignite under specified conditions of test. The sample is deemed to have flashed when a large flame appears and instantaneously propagates itself over the surface of the sample. Occasionally, particularly near actual flashpoint, the application of the test flame will cause a halo or an enlarged flame; this is not a flash and should be ignored.
(d)
Test apparatus.
The test apparatus is an equilibrium closed-cup tester
with a range up to 100 °C (212 °F). The essential dimensions and requirements are shown in figure 1 and table 3, and are described in § 1500.43a(m). Closed-cup flashpoint testers and accessories meeting these requirements are available from commercial suppliers and distributors of laboratory equipment.
(e)
Safety precautions.
The operator must exercise and take appropriate safety precautions during the initial application of the test flame to the sample. Samples containing low-flash material may give an abnormally strong flash when the test flame is first applied.
(f)
Preparation of samples.
(1) Erroneously high flashpoints may be obtained if precautions are not taken to avoid the loss of volatile material. In preliminary tests of materials taken directly from the container, do not open containers unnecessarily and make a transfer unless the sample temperature is at least 10 °C (18 °F) below the expected flashpoint. Do not use samples in leaky containers for this test.
(2) Do not store samples in plastic (polyethylene, polypropylene, etc.) bottles since volatile material may diffuse through the walls of the bottle.
(3) A 2-ml specimen is required for each test. If possible, obtain at least a 50-ml sample from the bulk test site and store in a clean, tightly closed container.
(g)
Preparation of apparatus.
(1) Place the tester on a level, stable surface. Unless tests are made in a draft-free area, surround the tester on three sides with a shield for protection. Do not rely on tests made in a laboratory draft hood or near ventilators.
(2) Read the manufacturer's instructions on the care and servicing of the instrument and for correct operation of its controls.
(h)
Calibration and standardization.
(1) Before initial use determine and plot the relationship between the temperature control dial and the thermometer readings at each major (numbered) dial division as follows:
Turn the temperature control knob
2
fully counterclockwise (“O” reading). Advance the temperature control knob clockwise until the indicator light is illuminated.
3
Advance the knob clockwise to the next numbered line. After the thermometer mercury column ceases to advance, record the dial reading and the temperature. Advance the knob clockwise to the next numbered line. After the thermometer mercury column ceases to advance, read the dial reading and the temperature. Repeat this procedure through the full range of the instrument. Plot the dial readings versus the respective temperatures.
2
If the instrument has two temperature control knobs, set the fine control (center, small knob) at its mid-position and allow it to remain there throughout the calibration. The calibration is determined by adjusting the coarse control (large, outer knob) only.
3
When using the tester, it will be found that the indicator light may not illuminate and the temperature may not rise until a temperature control dial setting between one and two is reached.
(2) Standardize the instrument using a sample of material meeting the specifications in table 1. If the average of two determinations falls within the acceptable limits the instrument is assumed to be operating properly. If the average of the two determinations does not fall within this range, check the manufacturer's operating and maintenance instructions and determine that they are being followed. In particular, be sure that the cup lid assembly makes a vapor-tight seal with the cup, the shutter provides a light-tight seal, and that adequate heat transfer paste surrounds the thermometer bulb and the immersed portion of the barrel.
(i)
Test Method A—for determining Flash/No Flash.
(1) Determine the target flashpoint as follows:
(i) Target flashpoint, °C = S
c
—0.25 (101.3—A)
(ii) Target flashpoint, °C = S
c
—0.03 (760-B)
(iii) Target flashpoint, °F = S
f
—0.06 (760-B)
where:
S
c
= specification, or uncorrected target, flashpoint, °C,
S
f
= specification, or uncorrected target, flashpoint, °F,
B = ambient barometric pressure, mm Hg,
4
and
4
The barometric pressure used in this calculation must be the ambient pressure for the laboratory at the time of test. Many aneroid barometers, such as those used at weather stations and airports, are precorrected to give sea-level readings; these must not be used.
A = ambient barometer pressure, kPa.
4
(2) Inspect the inside of the sample cup, lid, and shutter mechanism for cleaniness and freedom from contamination. Use an absorbent paper tissue to wipe clean, if necessary. Put cover in place and lock securely. The filing orifice may be convenienty cleaned with a pipe cleaner.
(3) Set the instrument at the target temperature.
(i) For target temperature below ambient. The instrument power switch is to be in the off position. Fill the refigerant-charged cooling block with a suitable material.
5
Raise the lid and shutter assembly, and position the base of the block in the sample cup, being careful not to injure or mar the cup. When the thermometer reads approximately 6 to 10 °C (10 to 20 °F) below the target temperature, remove the cooling block and quickly dry the cup with a paper tissue to remove any moisture. Immediately close the lid and shutter assembly and secure. Prepare to introduce the sample using the syringe, both of which have been precooled to a temperature 5 to 10 °C (10 to 20 °F) below the target temperature.
5
If the target or specification temperature is not less than 5 °C (40 °F) crushed ice and water may be used as charging (cooling) fluid. If below 5 °C (40 °F), a suitable charging (cooling) fluid is solid carbon dioxide (dry ice) and acetone. If the refrigerant charged cooling module is unavailable, refer to the manufacturer's instruction manual for alternative methods of cooling.
(A) Caution: Do not cool the sample block below −38 °C, the freezing point of mercury.
(B) Caution: Acetone is extremely flammable. Keep away from heat, sparks, and flames and keep container closed when not actually pouring acetone. Use only in a well-ventilated area. Avoid inhalation and contact with the eyes or skin. Use cloth or leather gloves, goggles or safety shield, and keep dry ice in a canvas bag, especially when cracking.
(ii) For target temperature above ambient. Switch the instrument on and turn the coarse temperature control knob fully clockwise (full on) causing the indicator light to illuminate.
6
When the thermometer indicates a temperature about 3 °C (5 °F) below the target (or specification) temperature, reduce the heat input to the sample cup by turning the coarse temperature control knob counter-clockwise to the desired control point (see § 1500.43a(i)(1)). When the indicator light slowly cycles on and off read the temperature on the thermometer. If necessary, adjust the fine (center) temperature control knob to obtain the desired test (target) temperature. When the test temperature is reached and the indicator lamp slowly cycles on and off, prepare to introduce the sample.
6
The target temperature may be attained by originally turning the coarse temperature control knob to the proper setting (see § 1500.43a(h)(1) for the temperature desired rather than the maximum setting (full on). The elapsed time to reach the temperature will be greater, except for maximum temperature. However, less attention will be required during the intervening period.
(4) Charge the syringe with a 2-ml specimen of the sample
7
to be tested; transfer the syringe to the filling orifice, taking care not to lose any sample; discharge the test specimen into the cup by fully depressing the syringe plunger, remove the syringe.
7
For target or expected temperatures below ambient, both syringe and sample must be precooled to cup temperature (see § 1500.43a(i)(3)(i)) before the specimen is taken.
(5)(i) Set the timer
8
by rotating its knob clockwise to its stop. Open the gas control valve and light the pilot and test flames. Adjust the test flame with the pinch valve to conform to the size of the 4-mm (5/32-in.) gage.
8
For target temperatures below ambient, do not set the timer. Adjust the test flame and allow the temperature to rise under ambient conditions until the target temperature is reached. Immediately apply the test flame as detailed.
(ii) After the time signal indicates the specimen is at test temperature
8
, apply the test flame by slowly and uniformly opening the shutter and closing
it completely over a period of approximately 2
1/2
s.
9
Watch closely for a flash at the cup openings.
9
Never apply the test flame to the specimen more than once. Fresh portions of the sample must be used for each test.
(iii) The sample is deemed to have flashed when a large flame appears and instantaneously propagates itself over the surface of the sample (see § 1500.43a(c)).
(6) Record the test results as “flash” or “no flash” and the test temperature.
(7) Turn off the pilot and test flames using the gas control valve. Remove the sample and clean the instrument. It may be necessary to allow the cup temperature to decline to a safe level before cleaning.
(j)
Test Method B—for determining Finite or Actual Flashpoint.
(1) Inspect the inside of the sample cup, lid, and shutter mechanism for cleanliness and freedom from contamination. Use an absorbent paper tissue to wipe clean, if necessary. Put cover in place and lock securely. The filling orifice may be conveniently cleaned with a pipe cleaner.
(2) For expected flashpoints below ambient. (i) The instrument power switch is to be in off position. Fill the refrigerant-charged cooling block with a suitable material.
5
Raise the lid and shutter assembly, and position the base of the block in the sample cup, being careful not to injure or mar the cup. When the thermometer reaches a temperature 5 to 10 °C (10 to 20 °F) below the expected flashpoint, remove the cooling block and quickly dry the cup with a paper tissue to remove any moisture. Immediately close the lid and shutter assembly and secure. Prepare to introduce the sample using the syringe, both of which have been precooled to a temperature 5 to 10 °C (10 to 20 °F) below the expected temperature (See § 1500.43a(j)(5)).
(ii) Caution: Do not cool the sample block below −38 °C, the freezing point of mercury.
(3) For tests where the expected flashpoint is above ambient. Turn the coarse temperature control knob fully clockwise (full on) causing the indicator light to illuminate. When the thermometer reaches a temperature 3 °C (5 °F) below the estimated flashpoint, turn the coarse temperature knob counter-clockwise to the dial reading representing the estimated flashpoint temperature as shown on the calibration curve (See § 1500.43a(h)(1)). When the indicator light slowly cycles on and off, read the temperature on the thermometer. If necessary, adjust the fine temperature control knob to obtain the exact desired temperature.
(4)(i) Charge the syringe
7
with a 2 ml specimen of the sample
7
to be tested; transfer the syringe to the filling orifice, taking care not to lose any sample; discharge the test specimen into the cup by fully depressing the syringe plunger; remove the syringe.
(ii) Set the timer
10
by rotating its knob clockwise to its stop. Open the gas control valve and ignite the pilot and test flames. Adjust the test flame with the pinch valve to conform to the size of the 4-mm (
5/32
-in.) gage.
(iii) After the audible time signal indicates the specimen is at test temperature,
10
apply the test flame by slowly and uniformly opening the shutter and then closing it completely over a period of approximately 2
1/2
s. Watch closely for a flash at the cup opening.
10
For expected flashpoint below ambient, do not set the timing device. Adjust the test flame. Allow the temperature to rise under ambient conditions until the temperature reaches 5 °C (9 °F) below the expected flashpoint. Immediately apply the test flame.
(iv) The sample is deemed to have flashed only if a large flame appears and instantaneously propagates itself over the surface of the sample. (See § 1500.43a(c).)
(v) Turn off the pilot and test flames using the gas control valve. When the cup temperature declines to a safe level, remove the sample and clean the instrument.
(5)(i) If a flash was observed in § 1500.43a(j)(4)(iii) repeat the procedure given in § 1500.43a(j)(2) or (3), and in § 1500.43a(j)(4), testing a new specimen at a temperature 5 °C (9 °F) below that at which the flash was observed.
(ii) If necessary, repeat the procedure in § 1500.43a(j)(5)(i), lowering the temperature 5 °C (9 °F) each time, until no flash is observed.
9
(iii) Proceed to § 1500.43a(j)(7).
(6)(i) If no flash was observed in § 1500.43a(j)(4)(iii) repeat the procedure given in § 1500.43a(j)(2) or (3), and in § 1500.43a(j)(4), testing a fresh specimen at a temperature 5 °C (9 °F) above that at which the specimen was tested in § 1500.43a(j)(4)(iii).
(ii) If necessary repeat the procedure in § 1500.43a(j)(6)(i), above, raising the temperature 5 °C (9 °F) each time until a flash is observed.
9
(7) Having established a flash within two temperatures 5 °C (9 °F) apart, repeat the procedure at 1 °C (2 °F) intervals from the lower of the two temperatures until a flash is observed.
9
Record the temperature of the test when this flash occurs as the flashpoint, allowing for any known thermometer correction. Record the barometric pressure.
4
(8) The flashpoint determined in § 1500.43a(j)(7) will be to the nearest 1 °C (2 °F). If improved accuracy is desired (that is, to the nearest 0.5 °C (1 °F)), test a fresh specimen at a temperature 0.5 °C (1 °F) below that at which the flash was observed in § 1500.43a(j)(7). If no flash is observed, the temperature recorded in § 1500.43a(j)(7), is the flashpoint to the nearest 0.5 °C (1 °F). If a flash is observed at the lower temperature, record this latter temperature as the flashpoint.
(9) Turn off the pilot and test flames using the gas control valve. When the cup temperature declines to a safe level, remove the sample and clean the instrument.
(k)
Calculations.
If it is desired to correct the observed finite flashpoint for the effect of barometric pressure, proceed as follows: Observe and record the ambient barometric pressure
4
at the time of the test. If the pressure differs from 101.3 kPa (760 mm Hg), correct the flashpoint as follows:
(1) Corrected flashpoint (°C) = C + 0.25 (101.3-A)
(2) Corrected flashpoint (°F) = F + 0.06 (760-B)
(3) Corrected flashpoint (°C) = C + 0.03 (760-B)
Where: F = Observed flashpoint, °F,
C = observed flashpoint, °C,
B = ambient barometric pressure, mm Hg; and
A = ambient barometric pressure, kPa.
(l)
Precision.
The precision of the method as determined by statistical examination of interlaboratory results is as follows:
(1) Repeatability. The difference between two test results obtained by the same operator with the same apparatus under constant operating conditions on identical test material, would, in the long run, in the normal and correct operation of the test method, exceed the values shown in table 2 only in 1 case in 20.
(2) Reproducibility. The difference between two single and independent results obtained by different operators working in different laboratories on identical test material, would, in the long run, in the normal and correct operation of the test method, exceed the values shown in table 2 only in 1 case in 20.
(m)
Flash Test Apparatus.
(1)(i) Unit consisting of an aluminum alloy or nonrusting metal block of suitable conductivity with a cylindrical depression, or sample cup, over which is fitted a cover. A thermometer is embedded in the block.
(ii) The cover is fitted with an opening slide and a device capable of inserting an ignition flame (diameter 4±0.5 mm) into the well when the slide device shall intersect the plane of the underside of the cover. The cover is also provided with an orifice extending into the sample well for insertion of the test sample and also a suitable clamping device for securing the cover tightly to the metal block. The three openings in the cover shall be within the diameter of the sample well. When the slide is in the open position, the two openings in the slide shall coincide exactly with the two corresponding openings in the cover.
(iii) Electrical heaters are attached to the bottom of the cup in a manner that provides efficient transfer of heat. An electronic heat control is required to hold the equilibrium temperature, in a draft-free area, within 0.1 °C (0.2 °F) for the low-temperature tester. A visual indicator lamp shows when energy is or is not being applied. Energy may be supplied from 120 or 240 V, 50 or 60 Hz main service.
(2)(i) Test flame and pilot flame-regulatable test flame, for dipping into
the sample cup to try for flash, and a pilot flame, to maintain the test flame, are required. These flames may be fueled by piped gas service. A gage ring 4mm (5/32 in.) in diameter, engraved on the lid near the test flame, is required to ensure uniformity in the size of the test flame.
(ii) Caution: Never recharge the self-contained gas tank at elevated temperature, or with the pilot or test flames lighted, nor in the vicinity of other flames.
(iii) Audible Signal is required. The audiable signal is given after 1 min in the case of the low-temperature tester.
(iv) Syringe. 2ml capacity, equipped with a needle suitable for use with the apparatus, adjusted to deliver 2.00±0.05 ml.
(3) Essential dimensions of the test apparatus are set forth in table 3.
(n)
Testing high-viscosity liquids.
(1) High-viscosity materials may be added to the cup by the following procedure:
(i) Back load a 5 or 10-ml syringe with the sample to be tested and extrude 2 ml into the cup. Spread the specimen as evenly as possible over the bottom of the cup.
(ii) If the sample cannot be loaded into a syringe and extruded, other means of adding the sample to the cup may be used such as a spoon. Add approximately 2 ml of material to the spoon and then push the material from the spoon into the cup.
(iii) If the test specimen does not close the sampling port in the cup, seal the cup externally by suitable means.
(2) Using the appropriate procedure, either Method A in § 1500.43a(i) or Method B in § 1500.43a(j), determine the flashpoint of the specimen which has been added to the tester in accordance with § 1500.43a(n)(i), except that the time specified is increased from 1 to 5 minutes for samples at or above ambient temperature.

§ 1500.44
Method for determining extremely flammable and flammable solids.
(a)
Preparation of samples
—(1)
Granules, powders, and pastes.
Pack the sample into a flat, rectangular metal boat with inner dimensions 6 inches long × 1 inch wide × one-fourth inch deep.
(2)
Rigid and pliable solids.
Measure the dimensions of the sample and support it by means of metal ringstands, clamps, rings, or other suitable devices as needed, so that the major axis is oriented horizontally and the maximum surface is freely exposed to the atmosphere.
(b)
Procedure.
Place the prepared sample in a draft-free area that can be ventilated and cleared after each test. The temperature of the sample at the
time of testing shall be between 68 °F. and 86 °F. Hold a burning paraffin candle whose diameter is at least 1 inch, so that the flame is in contact with the surface of the sample at the end of the major axis for 5 seconds or until the sample ignites, whichever is less. Remove the candle. By means of a stopwatch, determine the time of combustion with self-sustained flame. Do not exceed 60 seconds. Extinguish flame with a CO
2
or similar nondestructive type extinguisher. Measure the dimensions of the burnt area and calculate the rate of burning along the major axis of the sample.
§ 1500.45
Method for determining extremely flammable and flammable contents of self-pressurized containers.
(a)
Equipment required.
The test equipment consists of a base 8 inches wide, 2 feet long, marked in 6-inch intervals. A rule 2 feet long and marked in inches is supported horizontally on the side of the base and about 6 inches above it. A paraffin candle 1 inch or more in diameter, and of such height that the top third of the flame is at the height of the horizontal rule, is placed at the zero point in the base.
(b)
Procedure.
The test is conducted in a draft-free area that can be ventilated and cleared after each test. Place the self-pressurized container at a distance of 6 inches from the flame source. Spray for periods of 15 seconds to 20 seconds (one observer noting the extension of the flame and the other operating the container) through the top third of the flame and at a right angle to the flame. The height of the flame should be approximately 2 inches. Take three readings for each test, and average. As a precaution do not spray large quantities in a small, confined space. Free space of previously discharged material.
§ 1500.46
Method for determining flashpoint of extremely flammable contents of self-pressurized containers.
Use the apparatus described in § 1500.43a. Use some means such as dry ice in an open container to chill the pressurized container. Chill the container, the flash cup, and the bath solution of the apparatus (brine or glycol may be used) to a temperature of about 25 °F below zero. Puncture the chilled container to exhaust the propellant. Transfer the chilled formulation to the test apparatus and test in accordance with the method described in § 1500.43a.

§ 1500.48
Technical requirements for determining a sharp point in toys and other articles intended for use by children under 8 years of age.
(a)
Objective.
The sharp point test prescribed by paragraph (d) of this section will be used by the Commission in making a preliminary determination that points on toys and other articles intended for use by children under 8 years of age, and such points exposed in normal use or as a result of reasonably foreseeable damage or abuse of such toys and articles, present a potential risk of injury by puncture or laceration under section 2(s) of the Federal Hazardous Substances Act (15 U.S.C. 1261(s)). The Commission will further evaluate points that are identified as presenting a potential risk of puncture or laceration injury to determine the need for individual product regulatory action.
(b)
Scope
—(1)
General.
The sharp point test of paragraph (d) of this section is applicable to toys or other articles that are introduced into interstate commerce on or after December 22, 1978. The sharp point test shall be applied to any accessible portion of the test sample before and after subjecting the test sample to the use and abuse tests of §§ 1500.51, 1500.52, and 1500.53 (excluding the bite test-paragraph (c) of each section).
(2)
Exemptions.
(i) Toys and other children's articles that are the subject of any of the following regulations are exempt from this § 1500.48: The regulations for bicycles, non-full-size baby cribs, and full-size baby cribs (parts 1508, 1509, and 1512, of this chapter).
(ii) Toys that by reason of their functional purpose necessarily present the hazard of sharp points and that do not have any nonfunctional sharp points are exempt from this § 1500.48:
Provided,
Each toy is identified by a conspicuous, legible, and visible label at the time of any sale, as having functional sharp
points. An example of such toys is a toy sewing machine with a needle.
(iii) Articles, besides toys, intended for use by children that by reason of their functional purpose necessarily present the hazard of sharp points and that do not have any nonfunctional sharp points are exempt from this § 1500.48. An example of such articles is a ball-point pen.
(c)
Accessibility
—(1)
General.
Any point that is accessible either before or after these tests of §§ 1500.51, 1500.52, and 1500.53 (excluding the bite test—paragraph (c) of each section) are performed shall be subject to the sharp point test of paragraph (d) of this section.
(2)
Accessible points.
(i) An accessible point for a toy or article intended for children 3 years of age or less is one that can be contacted by any portion forward of the collar of the accessibility probe designated as probe A in figure 2 of this section.
(ii) An accessible point for a toy or article intended for children over 3 years up to 8 years of age is one that can be contacted by any portion forward of the collar of the accessibility probe designated as probe B in figure 2 of this section.
(iii) An accessible point for a toy or article intended for children of ages spanning both age groups is one that can be contacted by any portion forward of the collar of either probe A or B, as shown in figure 2 of this section.
(3)
Insertion depth for accessibility.
(i) For any hole, recess, or opening having a minor dimension (The minor dimension of an opening is the diameter of the largest sphere that will pass through the opening.) smaller than the collar diameter of the appropriate probe, the total insertion depth for accessibility shall be up to the collar on the appropriate probe. Each probe joint may be rotated up to 90 degrees to simulate knuckle movement.
(ii) For any hole, recess, or opening having a minor dimension larger than the collar diameter of probe A but less than 7.36 inches (186.9 millimeters), when probe A is used, or a minor dimension larger than the collar diameter of probe B but less than 9.00 inches (228.6 millimeters), when probe B is used, the total insertion depth for accessibility shall be determined by inserting the appropriate probe with the extension shown in figure 2 in any direction up to two and one-quarter times the minor dimension of the probe, recess, or opening, measured from any point in the plane of the opening. Each probe joint may be rotated up to 90 degrees to simulate knuckle movement.
(iii) For any hole, recess, or opening having a minor dimension of 7.36 inches (186.9 millimeters) or larger when probe A is used, or a minor di-mension of 9.00 inches (228.6 millimeters), or larger when probe B is used, the total insertion depth for accessibility is unrestricted unless other holes, recesses, or openings within the original hole, recess, or opening are encountered with dimensions specified in paragraph (c)(3) (i) or (ii) of this section. In such instances, the appropriate paragraphs (c)(3) (i) or (ii) of this section shall be followed. If both probes are to be used, a minor dimen-sion that is 7.36 inches (186.9 millimeters or larger shall determine unrestricted access.
(4)
Inaccessible points.
Points shall be considered inaccessible without testing with a probe if they lie adjacent to a surface of the test sample and any gap between the point and the adjacent surface does not exceed 0.020 inch (0.50 millimeter) either before or after the tests of §§ 1500.51, 1500.52, and 1500.53 (excluding the bite test—paragraph (c) of each section) are performed.
(d)
Sharp point test method
—(1)
Principle of operation.
The principle of operation of the sharp point tester shown in figure 1 of this section is as follows (Detailed engineering drawings for a suggested sharp point tester are available from the Commission's Office of the Secretary.): A rectangular opening measuring 0.040 inch (1.02 millimeters) wide by 0.045 inch (1.15 millimeters) long in the end of the slotted cap establishes two reference dimensions. Depth of penetration of the point being tested determines sharpness. If the point being tested can contact a sensing head that is recessed a distance of 0.015 inch (0.38 millimeter) below the end cap and can move the sensing head a further 0.005 inch (0.12 millimeter) against a 0.5-pound (2.2-newton) force of a return spring, the point shall be identified as
sharp. A sharp point tester of the general configuration shown in figure 1 of this section or one yielding equivalent results shall identify a sharp point. In conducting tests to determine the presence of sharp points, the Commission will use the sharp point tester shown in figure 1 of this section and the accessibility probes designated as A or B in figure 2 of this section.
(2)
Procedure.
(i) The sample to be tested shall be held in such a manner that it does not move during the test.
(ii) Part of the test sample may need to be removed to allow the sharp point testing device to test a point that is accessible by the criteria of paragraph (c) of this section. Such dismantling of the test sample could affect the rigidity of the point in question. The sharp point test shall be performed with the point supported so that its stiffness approximates but is not greater than the point stiffness in the assembled sample.
(iii) Using the general configuration shown in figure 1 of this section, the adjustment and operation of the sharp point tester is as follows: Hold the sharp point tester and loosen the lock ring by rotating it so that it moves towards the indicator lamp assembly a sufficient distance to expose the calibration reference marks on the barrel. Rotate the gaging can clockwise until the indicator lamp lights. Rotate the cap counterclockwise until an equivalent of five divisions (the distance between the short lines on the cap) have passed the calibration reference mark. Lock the gaging cap in this position by rotating the lock ring until it fits firmly against the cap. Insert the point into the gaging slot in all directions in which it was accessible by the criteria of paragraph (c) of this section, and apply a force of 1.00 pound (4.45 newtons). A glowing light identifies the point as sharp.
(iv) The test instruments used by the Commission in its tests for compliance with this regulation shall have gaging slot opening dimensions no greater than 0.040 inch by 0.045 inch and shall have the sensing head recessed a depth of no less than 0.015 inch. The force applied by the Commission when inserting a point into the gaging slot shall be no more than 1.00 pound.
(e) For the purpose of conformance with the technical requirements prescribed by this § 1500.48, the English figures shall be used. The metric approximations are provided in parentheses for convenience and information only.
EC03OC91.056
§ 1500.49
Technical requirements for determining a sharp metal or glass edge in toys and other articles intended for use by children under 8 years of age.
(a)
Objective.
The sharp edge test method prescribed by paragraph (d) of this section will be used by the Commission in making a preliminary determination that metal or glass edges on toys and other articles intended for use by children under 8 years of age, and such edges exposed in normal use or as a result of reasonably forseeable damage or abuse of such toys and articles, present a potential risk of injury by
laceration or avulsion under section 2(s) of the Federal Hazardous Substances Act (15 U.S.C. 1261(s)). The Commission will further evaluate toys and other articles with edges that are identified as presenting a potential risk of laceration or avulsion injury to determine the need for individual product regulation.
(b)
Scope
—(1)
General.
The sharp edge test of paragraph (d) of this section is applicable to toys or other articles containing metal or glass edges that are introduced into interstate commerce after March 26, 1979. Such articles manufactured outside the United States are introduced into interstate commerce when first brought within as U.S. port of entry. Such articles manufactured in the United States are introduced into interstate commerce (a) at the time of first interstate sale, or (b) at the time of first intrastate sale if one or more components and/or raw materials were received interstate, whichever occurs earlier.
(2)
Exemptions.
(i) Toys and other children's articles that are the subject of any of the following regulations are exempt from this § 1500.49: The regulations for bicycles, non-full-size baby cribs, and full-size baby cribs (parts 1508, 1509, and 1512 of this chapter).
(ii) Toys that by reason of their functional purpose necessarily present the hazard of sharp metal or glass edges and that do not have any nonfunctional sharp metal or glass edges are exempt from this section: Provided, the toy is identified by a conspicuous, legible, and visible label at the time of any sale, as having functional sharp metal or glass edges. Examples of these are a pair of toy scissors and toy tool kits.
(iii) Articles, besides toys, intended for use by children that by reason of their functional purpose necessarily present the hazard of sharp metal or glass edges and that do not have any non-functional sharp metal or glass edges are exempt from this section. Examples of these are children's ice skates and children's cutlery.
(3)
Definitions
—(i)
Glass.
For the purpose of this regulation the Commission defines glass as a hard, brittle, amorphous substance produced by fusion, usually consisting of mutually dissolved silica and silicates that also contain soda and lime.
(ii)
Metal.
For the purpose of this regulation the Commission intends the word metal to include both elemental metals and metal alloys.
(c)
Accessibility
—(1)
General.
Any metal or glass edge that is accessible either before or after the test of §§ 1500.51, 1500.52, and 1500.53 (excluding the bite test—paragraph (c) of each section) are performed shall be subject to the sharp edge test of paragraph (d) of this section. Toys reasonably intended to be assembled by an adult and not intended to be taken apart by a child shall be tested only in the assembled state if the shelf package and the assembly instructions prominently indicate that the article is to be assembled only by an adult.
(2)
Accessible edges.
(i) An accessible metal or glass edge for a toy or article intended for children 3 years of age or less is one that can be contacted by any portion forward of the collar of the accessibility probe designated as probe A in Figure 2 of this section.
(ii) An accessible edge for a toy or article intended for children over 3 years and up to 8 years of age is one that can be contacted by any portion forward of the collar of the accessibility probe designated as Probe B in Figure 2 of this section.
(iii) An accessible edge for a toy or article intended for children of ages spanning both age groups is one that can be contacted by any portion forward of the collar of either Probe A or Probe B, as shown in Figure 2 of this section.
(3)
Insertion depth.
(i) For any hole, recess, or opening having a minor dimension (the minor dimension of an opening is the diameter of the largest sphere that will pass through the opening), smaller than the collar diameter of the appropriate probe, the total insertion depth for accessibility shall be up to the collar on the appropriate probe. Each probe joint may be rotated up to 90 degrees to simulate knuckle movement.
(ii) For any hole, recess, or opening having a minor dimension larger than the collar diameter of Probe A, but less than 7.36 inches (186.9 millimeters),
when Probe A is used, or a minor dimension larger than the collar diameter of Probe B, but less than 9.00 inches (228.6 millimeters), when Probe B is used, the total insertion depth for accessibility shall be determined by inserting the appropriate probe with the extension, shown in Figure 2, in any direction up to 2
1/4
times the minor dimension of the hole, recess, or opening, measured from any point in the plane of the opening. Each probe joint may be rotated up to 90 degrees to simulate knuckle movement.
(iii) For any hole, recess, or opening having a minor dimension of 7.36 inches (186.9 millimeters) or larger when Probe A is used, or a minor dimension of 9.00 inches (228.6 millimeters) or larger when Probe B is used, the total insertion depth for accessibility is unrestricted unless other holes, recesses, or openings within the original hole, recess, or opening are encountered with dimensions specified in paragraph (c)(3) (i) or (ii) of this section. In such instances, the appropriate paragraphs (c)(3) (i) or (ii) of this section shall be followed. If both probes are to be used, a minor dimension that is 7.36 inches (186.9 millimeters or larger shall determine unrestricted access.
(4)
Inaccessible edges.
Metal or glass edges shall be considered inaccessible without testing with a probe if they lie adjacent to a surface of the test sample, and any gap between the edge and the adjacent surface does not exceed 0.020 inch (0.50 millimeter) both before and after the tests of §§ 1500.51, 1500.52, and 1500.53 (excluding the bite test—paragraph (c) of each section) are performed. For example, in a lap joint in which a metal edge is overlapped by a parallel surface, any burr or feather-edge on the side closest to the protecting parallel surface is considered inaccessible if the gap between the edge and the parallel surface is no greater than 0.020 inch (0.50 millimeter). As an additional example, when sheet metal has a hemmed edge a portion of the sheet adjacent to the edge is folded back upon itself, approximately 180 degrees, so that it is roughly parallel to the main sheet. Any burrs or feathering on the inside edge, the side closest to the protecting parallel surface of the main sheet, will be considered inaccessible if the gap between the inside edge and the parallel surface does not exceed 0.020 inch (0.50 millimeter).
(d)
Sharp edge test method
—(1)
Principle of operation.
The test shall be performed with a sharp edge tester which contains a cylindrical mandrel capable of rotation at a constant velocity. (Engineering drawings for a suitable portable sharp edge test instrument are available from the Commission's Office of the Secretary.) The full circumference of the mandrel shall be wrapped with a single layer of polytetrafluoroethylene (TFE) tape as specified in paragraph (e)(3) of this section. The mandrel shall be applied to the edge to be tested with a normal force of 1.35 pounds (6.00 Newtons) such that the edge contacts the approximate center of the width of the tape as shown in Figure 1 of this section. The mandrel shall be rotated through one complete revolution while maintaining the force against the edge constant. Linear motion of the mandrel along the line of the edge shall be prevented. The edge shall be identified as sharp if it completely cuts through the tape for a length of not less than
1/2
inch (13 millimeters) at any force up to 1.35 pounds (6.00 Newtons).
(2)
Procedure.
(i) The edge of the sample to be tested shall be held in such a manner that it does not move during the test. If the full mandrel force of 1.35 pounds (6.00 Newtons) causes the edge to bend, a reduced mandrel force may be used.
(ii) Part of the test sample may need to be removed to allow the sharp edge testing device to test an edge that is accessible by the criteria of paragraph (c) of this section. Such dismantling of the test sample could affect the rigidity of the edge in question. The sharp edge test shall be performed with the edge supported so that its stiffness approximates but is not greater than the edge stiffness in the assembled sample.
(iii) Conduct of a sharp edge test is as follows: Wrap one layer of polytetrafluoroethylene (TFE) tape, described in paragraph (e)(3) of this section, around the full circumference of the mandrel in an unstretched state. The ends of
the tape shall be either butted or overlapped not more than 0.10 inch (2.5 millimeters). Apply the mandrel, at the approximate center of the tape, to the edge of the test sample with a force of 1.35 pounds (6.00 Newtons) measured in a direction at right angles to the mandrel axis. The mandrel shall be placed so that its axis is at 90 degrees ±5 degrees to the line of a straight test edge or 90 degrees ±5 degrees to a tangent at the point of contact with a curved test edge. The point of contact between the test edge and the mandrel shall be in the approximate center of the width of the tape. The axis of the mandrel may be positioned anywhere in a plane which is at right angles to either the line of a straight test edge or to a tangent at the point of contact with a curved test edge. The operator should seek the orientation most likely to cause the edge to cut the tape. Maintain the force against the edge and rotate the mandrel through one complete revolution while preventing any linear motion of the mandrel along the edge. Release the mandrel from the edge and remove the tape without enlarging any cut or causing any score to become a cut. A cut in the tape with a length of not less than
1/2
inch (13 millimeters) identifies an edge as sharp. (The test instruments used by the Commission in its test for compliance with the regulation will be calibrated to insure that the force with which the mandrel is applied to a test edge does not exceed 1.35 pounds.)
(e)

§ 1500.50
Test methods for simulating use and abuse of toys and other articles intended for use by children.
(a)
Objective.
The objective of §§ 1500.51, 1500.52, and 1500.53 is to describe specific test methods for simulating normal use of toys and other articles intended for use by children as well as the reasonably foreseeable damage or abuse to which the articles may be subjected. The test methods are for use in exposing potential hazards that would result from the normal use or the reasonably foreseeable damage or abuse of such articles intended for children.
(b)
Application—general.
(1)(i) The test methods described in §§ 1500.51, 1500.52 and 1500.53 are to be used in determining what is normal use and reasonably foreseeable damage or abuse when specifically referenced under § 1500.18. Other banning regulations may also reference these use and abuse toy test procedures.
(ii) The test methods described in §§ 1500.51, 1500.52, and 1500.53 have been established for articles intended for the specified age groups of children: 18 months of age or less, over 18 months but not over 36 months of age, and over 36 months but not over 96 months of
age. If an article is marked, labeled, advertised, or otherwise intended for children of ages spanning more than one of these age groups, the article will be subjected to the tests providing the most stringent requirements. If an article is not age-labeled in a clear and conspicuous manner or, based on such factors as marketing practices and the customary patterns of usage of a product by children, is inappropriately age-labeled, and is intended or appropriate for children 96 months of age or less, it will also be subjected to the most stringent test requirements.
(2) For purposes of compliance with the test methods prescribed in §§ 1500.51, 1500.52, and 1500.53, the English system shall be used. The metric approximations are provided in parentheses for convenience and information only.
(3) Each of the test methods described in §§ 1500.51, 1500.52, and 1500.53 shall be applied to a previously untested sample except the tension test which shall be conducted with the test sample used in the torque test.
(4) Prior to testing, each sample shall be subjected to a temperature of 73°±3 °F. (23°±2 °C.) as a relative humidity of 20−70 percent for a period of at least 4 hours. The toy testing shall commence within five minutes after the toy has been removed from the preconditioning atmosphere.
(5) Toys reasonably intended to be assembled by an adult and not intended to be taken apart by a child shall be tested only in the assembled state if the shelf package and the assembly instructions prominently indicate that the article is to be assembled only by an adult.
(6) Toys intended to be repeatedly assembled and taken apart shall have the individual pieces as well as the completed article subjected to these test procedures.
(7) In situations where a test procedure may be applied in more than one way to a toy test component, the point (or direction) of force (or torque) application which results in the most severe conditions shall be used.
(c)

Food, drugs, and cosmetics.
Substances subject to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act are exempted by section 2(f)(2) of the act; but where a food, drug, or cosmetic offers a substantial risk of injury or illness from any handling or use that is customary or usual it may be regarded as misbranded under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act because its label fails to reveal material facts with respect to consequences that may result from use of the article (21 U.S.C. 321(n)) when its label fails to bear information to alert the householder to this hazard.
(b)
Fuels.
A substance intended to be used as a fuel is exempt from the requirements of the act when in containers that are intended to be or are installed as part of the heating, cooling, or refrigeration system of a house. A portable container used for delivery or temporary or additional storage, and containing a substance that is a hazardous substance as defined in section 2(f) of the act, is not exempt from the labeling prescribed in section 2(p) of the act, even though it contains a fuel to be used in the heating, cooking, or refrigeration system of a house.
§ 1500.82
Exemption from full labeling and other requirements.
(a) Any person who believes a particular hazardous substance intended or packaged in a form suitable for use in the household or by children should be exempted from full label compliance otherwise applicable under the act, because of the size of the package or because of the minor hazard presented by the substance, or for other good and sufficient reason, may submit to the Commission a request for exemption under section 3(c) of the act, presenting facts in support of the view that full compliance is impracticable or is not necessary for the protection of the public health. The Commission shall determine on the basis of the facts submitted and all other available information whether the requested exemption is consistent with adequate protection of the public health and safety. If the Commission so finds, it shall detail the exemption granted and the reasons therefor by an appropriate order published in the
Federal Register.
(b) The Commission may on its own initiative determine on the basis of facts available to it that a particular hazardous substance intended or packaged in a form suitable for use in the household or by children should be exempted from full labeling compliance otherwise applicable under the act because of the size of the package or because of the minor hazard presented by the substance or for other good and sufficient reason. If the Commission so finds, it shall detail the exemption granted and the reasons therefor by an appropriate order in the
Federal Register.
(c) Any person who believes a particular article should be exempted from being classified as a “banned hazardous substance” as defined by section 2(q)(1)(A) of the act (repeated in § 1500.3(b)(15)(i)(A)), because its functional purpose requires inclusion of a hazardous substance, it bears labeling giving adequate directions and warnings for safe use, and it is intended for use by children who have attained sufficient maturity, and may reasonably
be expected, to read and heed such directions and warnings, may submit to the Commission a request for exemption under section 2(q)(1)(B)(i) of the act (repeated in proviso (
1
) under § 1500.3(b)(15(i)), presenting facts in support of his contention. The commission shall determine on the basis of the facts submitted, and all other available information, whether the requested exemption is consistent with the purposes of the act. If the Commission so finds, it shall detail the exemption granted and the reasons therefor by an appropriate order in the

(B) With a code mark on the article itself and on the package containing the article or on the shipping container, in addition to the invoice(s) or shipping document(s), which code mark will permit future identification by the manufacturer of any given model (the manufacturer shall change the model number whenever the article undergoes a significant structural or design modification); and
(vii) The manufacturer or importer of the article shall make, keep, and maintain for 3 years records of sale, distribution, and results of inspections and tests conducted in accordance with this subparagraph and shall make such records available at all reasonable hours upon request by any officer or employee of the Consumer Product Safety Commission and shall permit such officer or employee to inspect and copy such records, to make such stock inventories as he deems necessary, and to otherwise check the correctness of such records.
(5) Clacker balls described in § 1500.18(a)(7) that have been designed, manufactured, assembled, labeled, and tested in accordance with the following requirements, and when tested at the point of production or while in interstate commerce or while held for sale after shipment in interstate commerce do not exceed the failure rate requirements of the table in paragraph (a)(5)(vi) of this section:
(i) The toy shall be so designed and fabricated that:
(A) Each ball: Weighs less than 50 grams; will not shatter, crack, or chip; is free of cracks, flash (ridges due to imperfect molding), and crazing (tiny surface cracks); and is free of rough or sharp edges around any hole where the cord enters or over any surface with which the cord may make contact. Each ball is free of internal voids (holes, cavities, or air bubbles) if the balls are made of materials other than those materials (such as ABS (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene), nylon, and high-impact polystyrene) that are injection-molded and possess high-impact characteristics.
(B) The cord: Is of high tensile strength, synthetic fibers that are braided or woven, having a breaking strength in excess of 445 Newtons (100 pounds); is free of fraying or any other defect that might tend to reduce its strength in use; is not molded in balls made of casting resins which tend to wick up or run up on the outside of the cord; and is affixed to a ball at the center of the horizontal plane of the ball when it is suspended by the cord. Clacker balls where the mass of each ball is less than 12 grams (0.42 oz.) and the distance between the center of the pivot and the center of the ball cannot exceed 180 mm (7.1 inches) may have a minimum cord breaking strength of less than 445 Newtons (100 pounds), as computed by the following formula:
Adjusted Cord Breaking Strength in Newtons = 0.1382(m
b
) (R
p
), where m
b
= mass of a single ball in grams and
R
p
= pivot length in mm.
(C) When the cord is attached to the ball by means of a knot, the end beneath the knot is chemically fused or otherwise treated to prevent the knot from slipping out or untying in use.
(ii) The toy shall be tested at the time of production:
(A) By using the sampling procedure described in the table in subdivision (vi) of this subparagraph to determine the number of units to be tested.
(B) By subjecting each ball tested to 10 drops of a 2.25 kg (5-pound) steel impact rod or weight (57-mm (2
1/4
-inch) diameter with a flat head) dropped 1220 mm (48 inches) in a vented steel or aluminum tube (60-mm (2
3/8
-inch) inside diameter) when the ball is placed on a steel or cast iron mount. Clacker balls where the mass of each ball is less than 12 grams (0.42 oz.) and the distance between the center of the pivot and the center of the ball cannot exceed 180 mm (7.1 inches) may be tested by dropping the impact weight from a height of less than 1220 mm (48 in.), where the height is computed as follows:
Adjusted drop height in mm = 179 × 10
−5
(m
b
) (R
p
2), where m
b
= mass of a single ball in grams and
R
p
= pivot length in mm.
Any ball showing any chipping, cracking, or shattering shall be counted as a failure within the meaning of the third column of the table in paragraph (a)(5)(vi) of this section.
(C) By inspecting each ball tested for smoothness of finish on any surface of the ball which may come in contact with the cord during use. A cotton swab shall be rubbed vigorously over each such surface or area of the ball; if any cotton fibers are removed, the ball shall be counted as a failure within the meaning of the fourth column of the table in subdivision (vi) of this paragraph. The toy shall also be checked to ascertain that there is no visibly perceptible “wicking up” or “running up” of the casting resins on the outside of the cord in the vicinity where the ball is attached.
(D) By fully assembling the toy and testing the cord in such a manner as to test both the strength of the cord and the adequacy with which the cord is attached to the ball and any holding device such as a tab or ring included in the assembly. The fully assembled article shall be vertically suspended by one ball and a 445-Newton (100-pound) test applied to the bottom ball. Clacker balls where the mass of each ball is less than 12 grams (0.42 oz.) and the distance between the center of the pivot and the center of the ball cannot exceed 180 mm (7.1 inches) may be tested with a force of under 445 Newtons (100 pounds). The test force for these clacker balls shall be the same as the cord breaking strength calculated in § 1500.86(a)(5)(i)(B). Any breaking, fraying, or unraveling of the cord or any sign of slipping, loosening, or unfastening shall be counted as a failure within the meaning of the fourth column of the table in paragraph (a)(5)(vi) of this section.
(E) By additionally subjecting any ring or other holding device to a 222-Newton (50-pound) test load applied to both cords; the holding device is to be securely fixed horizontally in a suitable clamp in such a manner as to support 50 percent of the area of such holding device and the balls are suspended freely. Clacker balls where the mass of each ball is less than 12 grams (0.42 oz.) and the distance between the center of the pivot and the center of the ball cannot exceed 180 mm (7.1 inches) may have their holding device tested with a force of less than 222 Newtons (50 pounds). The holding device test force for these clacker balls shall be half of the cord breaking strength calculated in § 1500.86(a)(5)(i)(B). Any breaking, cracking, or crazing of the ring or other holding device shall be counted as a failure within the meaning of the fourth column of the table in paragraph (a)(5)(vi) of this section.
(F) By cutting each ball tested in half and then cutting each half perpendicularly to the first cut into three or more pieces of approximately equal thickness. Each portion is to be inspected before and after cutting, and any ball showing any flash, crack, crazing, or internal voids on such inspection is to be counted as a failure within the meaning of the fourth column of the table in paragraph (a)(5)(vi) of this section. Balls that are injection-molded and possess high-impact characteristics (such as injection-molded balls made of ABS, nylon, or high-impact polystyrene) though exempt from the requirements that there be no internal voids, must be tested to determine the presence of any flash, crack or grazing. A transparent ball shall be subjected to
the same requirements except that it may be visually inspected without cutting.
(iii) The toy shall be fully assembled for use at time of sale, including the proper attachments of balls, cords, knots, loops, or other holding devices.
(iv) The toy shall be labeled:
(A) With a conspicuous statement of the name and address of the manufacturer, packer, distributor, or seller.
(B) To bear on the toy itself and/or the package containing the toy and/or the shipping container, in addition to the invoice(s) and shipping document(s), a code or mark in a form and manner that will permit future identification of any given batch, lot, or shipment by the manufacturer.
(C) To bear a conspicuous warning statement on the main panel of the retail container and display carton and on any accompanying literature: That if cracks develop in a ball or if the cord becomes frayed or loose or unfastened, use of the toy should be discontinued; and if a ring or loop or other holding device is present, the statement “In use, the ring or loop must be placed around the middle finger and the two cords positioned over the forefinger and held securely between the thumb and forefinger,” or words to that effect which will provide adequate instructions and warnings to prevent the holding device from accidentally slipping out of the hand. Such statements shall be printed in sharply contrasting color within a borderline and in letters at least 6 mm (
1/4
inch) high on the main panel of the container and at least 3 mm (
1/8
) high on all accompanying literature.
(v) The manufacturer of the toy shall make, keep, and maintain for 3 years records of sale, distribution, and results of inspections and tests conducted in accordance with this subparagraph and shall make such records available upon request at all reasonable hours by any officer or employee of the Consumer Product Safety Commission, and shall permit such officer or employee to inspect and copy such records and to make such inventories of stock as he deems necessary and otherwise to check the correctness of such records.
(vi) The lot size, sample size, and failure rate for testing clacker balls are as follows:
Number of units in batch, shipment, delivery, lot, or retail stock
Number of units in random sample
Failure rate constituting rejection when testing per § 1500.86(a)(5)(ii)(B)
Failure rate constituting rejection when testing per § 1500.86(a)(5)(ii) (C), (D), (E), and (F)

§ 1500.87
Children's products containing lead: inaccessible component parts.
(a) The Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act (CPSIA) provides for specific lead limits in children's products. Section 101(a) of the CPSIA provides that by February 10, 2009, products designed or intended primarily for children 12 and younger may not contain more than 600 ppm of lead. After August 14, 2009, products designed or
intended primarily for children 12 and younger cannot contain more than 300 ppm of lead. On August 14, 2011, the limit may be further reduced to 100 ppm after three years, unless the Commission determines that it is not technologically feasible to have this lower limit.
(b) Section 101 (b)(2) of the CPSIA provides that the lead limits do not apply to component parts of a product that are not accessible to a child. This section specifies that a component part is not accessible if it is not physically exposed by reason of a sealed covering or casing and does not become physically exposed through reasonably foreseeable use and abuse of the product including swallowing, mouthing, breaking, or other children's activities, and the aging of the product, as determined by the Commission. Paint, coatings, or electroplating may not be considered to be a barrier that would render lead in the substrate to be inaccessible to a child.
(c) Section 101(b)(2)(B) of the CPSIA directs the Commission to promulgate by August 14, 2009, this interpretative rule to provide guidance with respect to what product components or classes of components will be considered to be inaccessible.
(d) The accessibility probes specified for sharp points or edges under the Commissions' regulations at 16 CFR 1500.48-1500.49 will be used to assess the accessibility of lead-component parts of a children's product. A lead-containing component part would be considered accessible if it can be contacted by any portion of the specified segment of the accessibility probe. A lead-containing component part would be considered inaccessible if it cannot be contacted by any portion of the specified segment of the accessibility probe.
(e) For products intended for children that are 18 months of age or less, the use and abuse tests set forth under the Commission's regulations at 16 CFR 1500.50 and 16 CFR 1500.51 (excluding the bite test of § 1500.51(c)), will be used to evaluate accessibility of lead-containing component parts of a children's product as a result of normal and reasonably foreseeable use and abuse of the product.
(f) For products intended for children that are over 18 months but not over 36 months of age, the use and abuse tests set forth under the Commission's regulations at 16 CFR 1500.50 and 16 CFR 1500.52 (excluding the bite test of § 1500.52(c)), will be used to evaluate accessibility of lead-containing component parts of a children's product as a result of normal and reasonably foreseeable use and abuse of the product.
(g) For products intended for children that are over 36 months but not over 96 months of age, the use and abuse tests set forth under the Commission's regulations at 16 CFR 1500.50 and 16 CFR 1500.53 (excluding the bite test of § 1500.53(c)), will be used to evaluate accessibility of lead-containing component parts of a children's product as a result of normal and reasonably foreseeable use and abuse of the product.
(h) For products intended for children over 96 months through 12 years of age, the use and abuse tests set forth under the Commission's regulations at 16 CFR 1500.50 and 16 CFR 1500.53 (excluding the bite test of § 1500.53(c)) intended for children aged 37-96 months will be used to evaluate accessibility of lead-containing component parts of a children's product as a result of normal and reasonably foreseeable use and abuse of the product.
(i) A children's product that is or contains a lead-containing part which is enclosed, encased, or covered by fabric and passes the appropriate use and abuse tests on such covers, is inaccessible to a child unless the product or part of the product in one dimension is smaller than 5 centimeters.
(j) The intentional disassembly or destruction of products by children older than age 8 years by means or knowledge not generally available to younger children, including use of tools, will not be considered in evaluating products for accessibility of lead-containing components.

§ 1500.88
Exemptions from lead limits under section 101 of the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act for certain electronic devices.
(a) The Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act (CPSIA) provides for
specific lead limits in children's products. Section 101(a) of the CPSIA provides that by February 10, 2009, products designed or intended primarily for children 12 and younger may not contain more than 600 ppm of lead. After August 14, 2009, products designed or intended primarily for children 12 and younger cannot contain more than 300 ppm of lead. On August 14, 2011, the limit will be further reduced to 100 ppm, unless the Commission determines that it is not technologically feasible to meet this lower limit. Section 101(b)(2) of the CPSIA further provides that the lead limits do not apply to component parts of a product that are not accessible to a child. This section specifies that a component part is not accessible if it is not physically exposed by reason of a sealed covering or casing and does not become physically exposed through reasonably foreseeable use and abuse of the product including swallowing, mouthing, breaking, or other children's activities, and the aging of the product, as determined by the Commission. Paint, coatings, or electroplating may not be considered to be a barrier that would render lead in the substrate to be inaccessible to a child.
(b) Section 101(b)(4) of the CPSIA provides that if the Commission determines that it is not technologically feasible for certain electronic devices to comply with the lead limits, the Commission must issue requirements by regulation to eliminate or minimize the potential for exposure to and accessibility of lead in such electronic devices and establish a compliance schedule unless the Commission determines that full compliance is not technologically feasible within a schedule set by the Commission.
(c) Certain accessible lead-containing component parts in children's electronic devices unable to meet the lead limits set forth in paragraph (a) of this section due to technological infeasibility are granted the exemptions that follow in paragraph (d) of this section below, provided that use of lead is necessary for the proper electronic functioning of the component part and it is not technologically feasible for the component part to meet the lead content limits set forth in paragraph (a) of this section.
(d) Exemptions for lead as used in certain electronic components parts in children's electronic devices include:
(1) Lead blended into the glass of cathode ray tubes, electronic components, and fluorescent tubes.
(2) Lead used as an alloying element in steel. The maximum amount of lead shall be less than 0.35% by weight (3,500 ppm).
(3) Lead used in the manufacture of aluminum. The maximum amount of lead shall be less than 0.4% by weight (4,000 ppm).
(4) Lead used in copper-based alloys. The maximum amount of lead shall be less than 4% by weight (40,000 ppm).
(5) Lead used in lead-bronze bearing shells and bushings.
(6) Lead used in compliant pin connector systems.
(7) Lead used in optical and filter glass.
(8) Lead oxide in plasma display panels (PDP) and surface conduction electron emitter displays (SED) used in structural elements; notably in the front and rear glass dielectric layer, the bus electrode, the black stripe, the address electrode, the barrier ribs, the seal frit and frit ring, as well as in print pastes.
(9) Lead oxide in the glass envelope of Black Light Blue (BLB) lamps.
(e) Components of electronic devices that are removable or replaceable, such as battery packs and light bulbs that are inaccessible when the product is assembled in functional form or are otherwise granted an exemption, are not subject to the lead limits in paragraph (a) of this section.
(f) Commission staff is directed to reevaluate and report to the Commission on the technological feasibility of compliance with the lead limits in paragraph (a) of this section for children's electronic devices, including the technological feasibility of making accessible component parts inaccessible, and the status of the exemptions, no less than every five years after publication of a final rule in the
Federal Register
on children's electronic devices.

§ 1500.89
Procedures and requirements for determinations regarding lead content of materials or products under section 101(a) of the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act.
(a) The Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act provides for specific lead limits in children's products. Section 101(a) of the CPSIA provides that by February 10, 2009, products designed or intended primarily for children 12 years of age or younger may not contain more than 600 ppm of lead. After August 14, 2009, products designed or intended primarily for children 12 years of age or younger cannot contain more than 300 ppm of lead. On August 14, 2011, the limit will be further reduced to 100 ppm, unless the Commission determines that this lower limit is not technologically feasible. Paint, coatings or electroplating may not be considered a barrier that would make the lead content of a product inaccessible to a child or prevent the absorption of any lead in the human body through normal and reasonably foreseeable use and abuse of the product.
(b) The Commission may, either on its own initiative or upon the request of any interested person, make a determination that a material or product does not contain leads levels that exceed 600 ppm, 300 ppm, or 100 ppm, as applicable.
(c) A determination by the Commission under paragraph (b) of this section that a material or product does not contain lead levels that exceed 600 ppm, 300 ppm, or 100 ppm, as applicable does not relieve the material or product from complying with the applicable lead limit as provided under paragraph (a) of this section.
(d) To request a determination under paragraph (b) of this section, the request must:
(1) Be e-mailed to
cpsc-os@cpsc.gov.
and titled “Section 101 Request for Lead Content Determination.” Requests may also be mailed, preferably in five copies, to the Office of the Secretary, Consumer Product Safety Commission, Room 502, 4330 East West Highway, Bethesda, Maryland 20814, or delivered to the same address.
(2) Be written in the English language.
(3) Contain the name and address, and e-mail address or telephone number, of the requestor.
(4) Provide documentation including:
(i) A detailed description of the product or material and how it is used by a child;
(ii) Representative data on the lead content of parts of the product or materials used in the production of a product;
(iii) All relevant data or information on manufacturing processes through which lead may be introduced into the material or product;
(iv) An assessment of the likelihood or lack thereof that the manufacturing processes will result in lead contamination of a material or product that ordinarily does not contain lead;
(v) All relevant data or information on the facilities used to manufacture the material or product, and any other materials used in the product;
(vi) An assessment of the likelihood or lack thereof that the use of leaded materials in a facility will result in lead contamination of a material or product that ordinarily does not contain lead;
(vii) Any other information relevant to the potential for lead content of the product or material to exceed the statutory lead limit specified in the request, that is 600 ppm, 300 ppm, or 100 ppm, as applicable;
(viii) Detailed information on the relied upon test methods for measuring lead content of products or materials including the type of equipment used or any other techniques employed and a statement as to why the data is representative of the lead content of such products or materials generally; and
(ix) Any data or information that is unfavorable to the request that is reasonably available to the requestor.
(e) Where a submission fails to meet all of the requirements of paragraph (d) of this section, the Office of the Secretary shall notify the person submitting it, describe the deficiency, and explain that the request may be resubmitted when the deficiency is corrected.
(f) Upon receipt of a complete request for a determination, the Office of Hazard Identification and Reduction
(EXHR) will assess the request to determine whether the product or material is one that does not contain lead in excess of the limits as provided under paragraph (a) of this section. EXHR will make an initial recommendation within thirty (30) calendar days, to the extent practicable. EXHR may request an extension from the Executive Director of the CPSC, if necessary, to make its initial determination. A complete request is one that does not require additional information from the requestor for EXHR to make an initial recommendation to the Commission.
(g) Where the Office of Hazard Identification and Reduction's (EXHR) initial recommendation is to deny the request for a lead content determination, it will provide, in a staff memorandum to the Commission, submitted to the Commission for ballot vote, the basis for the denial with sufficient detail for the Commission to make an informed decision that reasonable grounds for a determination are not presented. The Commission, by ballot vote, will render a decision on the staff's recommendation. The ballot vote and the staff memorandum will be posted on the CPSC Web site. Any determination by the Commission to grant a request will be published in the
Federal Register
for comment. If the Commission concludes that the request shall be denied, the requestor shall be notified in writing of the denial from the Office of the Secretary along with the official ballot results and the EXHR staff's memorandum of recommendation.
(h) Where the Office of Hazard Identification and Reduction's (EXHR) initial recommendation is to grant the request for a lead content determination, it will submit the basis for that recommendation to the Commission in a memorandum to be voted on by ballot, with sufficient detail for the Commission to make an informed decision that reasonable grounds for a determination are presented. If the notice of proposed rulemaking (NPR) is published, it will invite public comment in the
Federal Register.
EXHR will review and evaluate any comments and supporting documentation before making its final recommendation to the Commission for final agency action, by staff memorandum submitted to the Commission. If the Commission, after review of the staff's final recommendation, determines that a material or product does not and would not exceed the lead content limits, it will decide by ballot vote, on whether to publish a final rule in the
Federal Register.
(i) The filing of a request for a determination does not have the effect of staying the effect of any provision or limit under the statutes and regulations enforced by the Commission. Even though a request for a determination has been filed, unless a Commission determination is issued in final form after notice and comment, materials or products subject to the lead limits under section 101 of the CPSIA must be tested in accordance with section 102 of the CPSIA, unless the testing requirement is otherwise stayed by the Commission.

§ 1500.90
Procedures and requirements for exclusions from lead limits under section 101(b) of the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act.
(a) The Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act provides for specific lead limits in children's products. Section 101(a) of the CPSIA provides that by February 10, 2009, products designed or intended primarily for children 12 years of age or younger may not contain more than 600 ppm of lead. After August 14, 2009, products designed or intended primarily for children 12 years of age or younger cannot contain more than 300 ppm of lead. On August 14, 2011, the limit will be further reduced to 100 ppm, unless the Commission determines that this lower limit is not technologically feasible. Paint, coatings or electroplating may not be considered a barrier that would make the lead content of a product inaccessible to a child or prevent the absorption of any lead in the human body through normal and reasonably foreseeable use and abuse of the product.
(b)
Exclusion of certain materials or products and inaccessible component parts.
The CPSIA provides the following functional purpose exception from the lead limits stated in section 101(a) of the CPSIA.
(1)
Functional purpose exception
—(i)
In general.
The Commission, on its own initiative or upon petition by an interested party, shall grant an exception to the limit under paragraph (a) of this section for a specific product, class of product, material, or component part if the Commission, after notice and a hearing, determines that:
(A) The product, class of product, material, or component part requires the inclusion of lead because it is not practicable or not technologically feasible to manufacture such product, class of product, material, or component part, as the case may be, in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section by removing the excessive lead or by making the lead inaccessible;
(B) The product, class of product, material, or component part is not likely to be placed in the mouth or ingested, taking into account normal and reasonably foreseeable use and abuse of such product, class of product, material, or component part by a child; and
(C) An exception for the product, class of product, material, or component part will have no measurable adverse effect on public health or safety, taking into account normal and reasonably foreseeable use and abuse.
(ii)
Measurement.
For purposes of paragraph (b)(1)(i)(C) of this section, there is no measurable adverse effect on public health or safety if the exception described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section will result in no measurable increase in blood lead levels of a child. The Commission may adopt an alternative method of measurement other than blood lead levels if it determines, after notice and a hearing, that such alternative method is a better scientific method for measuring adverse effect on public health and safety.
(iii)
Procedures for granting exception
—(A)
Burden of proof.
A party seeking an exception under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section has the burden of demonstrating that it meets the requirements of such paragraph.
(B)
Grounds for decision.
In the case where a party has petitioned for an exception, in determining whether to grant the exception, the Commission may base its decision solely on the materials presented by the party seeking the exception and any materials received through notice and a hearing.
(C)
Admissible evidence.
In demonstrating that it meets the requirements of paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, a party seeking an exception under such paragraph may rely on any nonproprietary information submitted by any other party seeking such an exception and such information shall be considered part of the record presented by the party that relies on that information.
(D)
Scope of exception.
If an exception is sought for an entire product, the burden is on the petitioning party to demonstrate that the criteria in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section are met with respect to every accessible component or accessible material of the product.
(iv)
Limitation on exception.
If the Commission grants an exception for a product, class of product, material, or component part under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, the Commission may, as necessary to protect public health or safety:
(A) Establish a lead limit that such product, class of product, material, or component part may not exceed; or
(B) Place a manufacturing expiration date on such exception or establish a schedule after which the manufacturer of such product, class of product, material, or component part shall be in full compliance with the limit established under paragraph (b)(1)(iv)(A) of this section or the limit set forth under paragraph (a) of this section.
(v)
Application of exception.
An exception under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section for a product, class of product, material, or component part shall apply regardless of the date of manufacture unless the Commission expressly provides otherwise.
(vi)
Previously submitted petitions.
A party seeking an exception under this paragraph may rely on materials previously submitted in connection with a petition for exclusion under this section. In such cases, petitioners must notify the Commission of their intent to rely on materials previously submitted. Such reliance does not affect petitioners' obligation to demonstrate that they meet all requirements of this
paragraph as required by paragraph (b)(1)(iii)(A) of this section.

§ 1500.121
Labeling requirements; prominence, placement, and conspicuousness.
(a)(1)
Background and scope.
Section 2(p)(1) of the Federal Hazardous Substances Act (FHSA) or “the Act”), 15 U.S.C. 1261(p)(1), requires that hazardous substances bear certain cautionary statements on their labels. These statements include: signal words; affirmative statements of the principal hazard(s) associated with a hazardous substance; the common or usual name, or chemical name, of the hazardous substance; the name and place of business of the manufacturer, packer, distributor, or seller; statements of precautionary measures to follow; instructions, when appropriate, for special handling and storage; the statement “Keep Out of the Reach of Children” or its practical equivalent; and, when appropriate, first-aid instructions. Section 2(p)(2) of the Act specifies that all such statements shall be located prominently on the label of such a substance and shall appear in conspicuous and legible type in contrast by typography, layout, or color with other printed matter on the label. This regulation contains the Commission's interpretations and policies for the type size and placement of cautionary material on the labels of hazardous substances and contains other criteria for such cautionary statements that are acceptable to the Commission as satisfying section 2(p)(2) of the Act. Labels that do not comply with this regulation may be considered misbranded.
(2)
Definitions.
For the purposes of this section:
(i)
Container
means the immediate package from which a hazardous substance may be dispensed and also any article, package or wrapping, such as a tube or cone used for a firework or a wet cell battery casing containing sulfuric acid, which is necessary for the substance to function during actual use.
(ii)
Cautionary material, cautionary labeling,
and
cautionary labeling required by the Act
mean all items of labeling information required by sections 2(p)(1) of the FHSA (repeated in 16 CFR 1500.3(b)(14)(i) or by the regulations which require additional labeling under section 3(b) of the Act.
(iii)
Display panel
means any surface of the immediate container, and of any outer container or wrapping, which bears labeling.
(iv)
Principal display panel
means the portion(s) of the surface of the immediate container, and of any outer container or wrapping, which bear(s) the labeling designed to be most prominently displayed, shown, presented, or examined under conditions of retail sale. (See paragraph (c)(1) of this section.)
(v)
Type size
means the actual height of the printed image of each upper case or capital letter as it appears on the label of a hazardous substance. (See paragraph (c)(2) of this section.)
(vi)
Signal word
means the appropriate word “DANGER,” “WARNING,” or “CAUTION,” as required by sections 2(p)(1) (C) or (D) of the Act.
(vii)
Statement of principal hazard(s)
means that wording descriptive of the principal or primary hazard(s) associated with a hazardous substance required by section 2(p)(1)(E) of the Act. Some examples of such statements are “HARMFUL OR FATAL IF SWALLOWED,” “VAPOR HARMFUL,” “FLAMMABLE,” and “SKIN AND EYE IRRITANT.”
(viii)
Other cautionary material
means all labeling statements, other than “signal words” or “statement(s) of principal hazard(s),” required by the Act or by regulations issued under the Act.
(b)
Prominent label placement.
To satisfy the requirement of the Act that cautionary labeling statements shall appear “prominently” on the label of a hazardous substance, all such statements shall be placed on the label as follows:
(1)
Horizontal placement of labeling statements.
Except for the name and place of business of the manufacturer, packer, distributor, or seller, all cautionary material required by the Act shall appear in lines that are generally parallel to any base on which the package rests as it is designed to be displayed for sale or, on display panels other than the principal display panel, in lines generally parallel to all other labeling on that panel. This requirement does not apply to labeling on collapsible tubes, cylindrical containers with a narrow diameter, or F-type containers where both the “front” and “back” of the container are principal display panels. (See paragraph (e) of this section.)
(2)
Principal display panel labeling.
(i) All items of cautionary labeling required by the Act may appear on the principal display panel on the immediate container and, if appropriate, on any other container or wrapper. See paragraph (b)(4) of this section for requirements and exceptions for labeling outer containers and wrappings.
(ii) The signal word, the statement of principal hazard(s), and, if appropriate, instructions to read carefully any cautionary material that may be placed elsewhere on the label shall be blocked together within a square or rectangular area, with or without a border, on the principal display panel on the immediate container and, where required by paragraph (b)(4) of this section, on any outer container or wrapping. All cautionary statements placed on the principal display panel shall be separated on all sides from other printed or graphic matter, with the exception of the declaration of net contents required under the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act, 15 U.S.C. 1453(a) (2) and (3), by a border line or by a space no smaller than the minimum allowable height of the type size for cautionary material required by the Act (exclusive of signal words and statements of hazard) on the principal display panel.
(iii) Depending on the design of the package or the configuration of the label, or both, a package may have more than one principal display panel. If so, each principal display panel must bear, at a minimum, the signal word, statement of principal hazard or hazards, and, if appropriate, instructions to read carefully any cautionary material that may be placed elsewhere on the label.
(A) Where the principal display panel of the immediate container consists of a lid, cap, or other item which may be separated from the immediate container and discarded, the container shall be deemed to have a second principal display panel elsewhere on the immediate container which must bear, at a minimum, the signal word, statement of principal hazard(s), and instructions, if appropriate, to read any cautionary material which may be placed elsewhere on the label.
(3)
Prominent label placement—other display panel labeling.
All items of cautionary labeling required by the Act which do not appear on the principal display panel shall be placed together on a display panel elsewhere on the container. The name and place of business of the manufacturer, packer, distributor, or seller may appear separately on any display panel. Where cautionary material appears on a display panel other than the principal display panel, the principal display panel shall bear the statement “Read carefully other cautions on the ___ panel,” or its practical equivalent. [A description of the location of the other panel is to be inserted in the blank space.]
(4)
Outer container or wrappings.
All cautionary labeling appearing on the immediate container of a hazardous substance shall also appear on any outer container or wrapping used in the retail display of the substance, in the same manner as required for the immediate container. Those cautionary labeling statements appearing on the immediate container which are
clearly legible through any outer container or wrapper used in retail display need not appear on the outer container or wrapping itself. (See section 2(n)(1) of the Act.)
(5)
Placement of the word “Poison” and the skull and crossbones symbol.
The word “poison” and, when appropriate, the skull and crossbones symbol shall appear on the label of a hazardous substance as follows:
(i) If a hazardous substance is “highly toxic,” as defined in § 1500.3(c)(i) and section 2(h)(1) of the FHSA, the label must bear the word “poison” in accordance with section 2(p)(1)(H) of the Act, in addition to the signal word “DANGER,” and must also bear the skull and crossbones symbol. Some products, under § 1500.14(b) of the regulations, may, in addition to any required signal word, be required to bear the word “poison” and the skull and crossbones symbol because of the special hazard associated with their ingredients. In both instances, the word “poison” and the skull and crossbones symbol need not appear on the principal display panel on the container, unless all other cautionary labeling required by the Act appears on the principal display panel. The word “poison” and the skull and crossbones symbol, when required, must appear either together with other cautionary labeling on a display panel other than the principal display panel or together with the signal word and statement(s) of principal hazard on the principal display panel.
(ii) Where, pursuant to a regulation issued under section 3(b) of the Act, the label of a hazardous substance requires the word “poison” instead of a signal word, the word, “POISON” shall appear in capital letters on the principal display panel, together with the statement(s) of the principal hazard. Certain substances for which the word “poison” is required instead of any signal word are listed in § 1500.129.
(c)
Conspicuousness—type size and style.
To satisfy the requirement that cautionary labeling statements under the Act be conspicuous and legible, such statements shall conform to the following requirements:
(1)
Area of principal display panel.
The area of the principal display panel is the area of the side or surface of the immediate container, or of the side or surface of any outer container or wrapping, that bears the labeling designed to be most prominently displayed, shown, presented, or examined under conditions of retail sale. This area is not limited to the portion of the surface covered with labeling; rather, it includes the entire surface. Flanges at the tops and bottoms of cans, conical shoulders of cans, handles, and shoulders and necks of bottles and jars are excluded in measuring the area. For the purposes of determining the proper type size for cautionary labeling, the area of the principal display panel (or other panel bearing cautionary labeling, under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section) is to be computed as follows:
(i) In the case of a rectangular package, where one entire side is the principal display panel, the product of the height times the width of that side shall be the area of the principal display panel.
(ii) In the case of a cylindrical or nearly cylindrical container or tube on which the principal display panel appears on the side, the area of the principal display panel shall be 40 percent of the product of the height of the container times its circumference.
(iii) In the case of any other shape of container, the area of the principal display panel shall be 40 percent of the total surface of the container, excluding those areas, such as flanges at tops and bottoms, specified in paragraph (c)(1) above. However, if such a container presents an obvious principal display panel (such as an oval or hour-glass shaped area on the side of a container for dishwashing detergent), the area to be measured shall be the entire area of the obvious principal display panel.
(2)
Type-size requirements.
(i) The term
type size
refers to the height of the actual printed image of each upper case or capital letter as it appears on the label. The size of cautionary labeling shall be reasonably related to the type size of any other printing appearing on the same panel, but in any case must meet the minimum size requirements in table 1.
(ii) When an item of labeling is required to be in a specified type size, all upper case, or capital, letters must be
at least equal in height to the required type size, and all other letters must be the same style as the upper case or capital letters. Unless otherwise specified in the regulations (examples appear at §§ 1500.14(b)(6), 1512.19, 1508.9, and part 1505), the type size of all cautionary statements appearing on any display panel shall comply with the specifications in table 1 when the area of the display panel is measured by the method in paragraph (c)(1) above:

*** size of lettering for other cautionary material is based on the area of the display panel on which such cautionary material appears.
(iii) If all of the required cautionary labeling does not appear on the principal display panel, the statement to “Read carefully other cautions on the ___ panel,” or its practical equivalent, must appear in, as a minimum, the same type size as that required in table 1 for the other cautionary material which appears elsewhere on the label of a hazardous substance. The size of the cautionary labeling that does not appear on the principal display panel is determined by the area of the panel on which it does appear.
(3)
Type style—proportion.
The ratio of the height of a capital or uppercase letter to its width shall be such that the height of the letter is no more than 3 times its width.
(4)
Signal word and statements of hazard—capital letters.
The signal word, the word “poison” if required instead of a signal word (see § 1500.129), and the statement of principal hazard or hazards shall be in capital letters.
(5)
Multiple statement of hazard—type size and style.
All statements of principal hazard or hazards on a label shall appear in the same size and style of type, and shall appear in the same color or have the same degree of boldness.
(6)
Accompanying literature containing directions for use.
Where literature accompanying the package of a hazardous substance has directions for use, written or otherwise, section 2(n) of the Act requires the literature to bear cautionary labeling.
(i) All such cautionary labeling shall be in reasonable proximity to any direction for use and shall be placed together within the same general area.
(ii) The type size of such cautionary labeling shall be reasonably related to the type size of any other printed matter in the accompanying literature and must be in conspicuous and legible type by typography, layout, or color with other printed matter on the label. The signal word and statement of principal hazard or hazards shall appear in capital letters.
(d)
Conspicuousness—contrast.
To satisfy the requirement that cautionary labeling statements appear in conspicuous and legible type which is in contrast by typography, layout, or color with the other printed matter on the label, such statements shall conform to the following requirements:
(1)
Color.
Where color is the primary method used to achieve appropriate contrast, the color of any cautionary labeling statement shall be in sharp contrast with the color of the background upon which such a statement appears. Examples of combinations of colors which may not satisfy the requirement for sharp contrast are: black letters on a dark blue or dark green background, dark red letters on a light red background, light red letters on a reflective silver background, and white letters on a light gray or tan background.
(2)
Interference with conspicuousness—labeling design, vignettes, or other printed material.
For cautionary information appearing on panels other than the
principal display panel, the label design, the use of vignettes, or the proximity of other labeling or lettering shall not be such that any cautionary labeling statement is obscured or rendered inconspicuous.
(e)
Collapsible metal tubes.
Collapsible metal tubes containing hazardous substances shall be labeled so that all cautionary labeling required by the Act appears as close to the dispensing end of the container as possible. The placement and conspicuousness of these statements shall conform to the provisions of paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section.
(f)
Unpackaged hazardous substances.
Where practicable, unpackaged hazardous substances intended, or distributed in a form suitable, for use in or around a household or by children shall be labeled so that all items of information required by the Act appear upon the article itself. In instances where this is impracticable (for example, because of the size or nature of the article), the required cautionary labeling must be displayed by means of a tag or other suitable material that is no less than five square inches in area and is securely affixed to the article so that the labeling will remain attached throughout conditions of merchandising and distribution to the ultimate consumer. The placement and conspicuousness of all cautionary labeling appearing on such a tag or material, or on an unpackaged article, shall conform to the provisions of paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section. For the purposes of determining the proper type size to use on a tag or other material, the area of one side of the tag or other material shall be the area of the principal display panel.
(g)
Exemptions.
All requirements of the Act are satisfied by compliance with this § 1500.121. However, exemptions can be granted under section 3(c) of the Act and § 1500.83, or under the provisions of another statute should this section be incorporated in regulations under another statute. Section 1500.82 contains the requirements for exemption requests under the Federal Hazardous Substances Act.
(h)
Effective date.
The provisions of this rule apply to hazardous substances bearing labels printed after December 30, 1985. Labels printed prior to the effective date of this rule may be applied until not later than December 28, 1987. This rule applies to all hazardous substances to which labels are applied after December 28, 1987.
[49 FR 50383, Dec. 28, 1984]
§ 1500.122
Deceptive use of disclaimers.
A hazardous substance shall not be deemed to have met the requirements of section 2(p) (1) and (2) of the act (repeated in § 1500.3(b)(14) (i) and (ii)) if there appears in or on the label (or in any accompanying literature; words, statements, designs, or other graphic material that in any manner negates or disclaims any of the label statements required by the act; for example, the statement “Harmless” or “Safe around pets” on a toxic or irritant substance.
§ 1500.123
Condensation of label information.
Whenever the statement of the principal hazard or hazards itself provides the precautionary measures to be followed or avoided, a clear statement of the principal hazard will satisfy the requirements of section 2(p)(1) (E) and (F) of the act (repeated in § 1500.3(b)(14)(i) (E) and (F)). When the statement of precautionary measures in effect provides instruction for first-aid treatment, the statement of the precautionary measures will satisfy the requirements of section 2(p)(1) (F) and (G) of the act (repeated in § 1500.3(b)(14)(i) (F) and (G)).
§ 1500.125
Labeling requirements for accompanying literature.
When any accompanying literature includes or bears any directions for use (by printed word, picture, design, or combination thereof), such placard, pamphlet, booklet, book, sign, or other graphic or visual device shall bear all the information required by section 2(p) of the act (repeated in § 1500.3(b)(14)).
§ 1500.126
Substances determined to be “special hazards.”
Whenever the Commission determines that for a particular hazardous substance intended or packaged in a
form suitable for use in the household or by children, the requirements of section 2(p) of the act (repeated in § 1500.3(b)(14)) are not adequate for the protection of the public health and safety because of some special hazard, the Commission, by an appropriate order in the
Federal Register,
shall specify such reasonable variations or additional label requirements that it finds are necessary for the protection of the public health and safety. Such order shall specify a date that is not less than 90 days after the order is published (unless emergency conditions stated in the order specify an earlier date) after which any such hazardous substance intended, or packaged in a form suitable, for use in the household or by children that fails to bear a label in accordance with such order shall be deemed to be a misbranded hazardous substance.
§ 1500.127
Substances with multiple hazards.
(a) Any article that presents more than one type of hazard (for example, if the article is both toxic and flammable) must be labeled with: An affirmative statement of each such hazard; the precautionary measures describing the action to be followed or avoided for each such hazard; instructions, when necessary or appropriate, for first-aid treatment of persons suffering from the ill effects that may result from each such hazard; instructions for handling and storage of articles that require special care in handling and storage because of more than one type of hazard presented by the article; and the common or usual name (or the chemical name if there is no common or usual name) for each hazardous component present in the article.
(b) Label information referring to the possibility of one hazard may be combined with parallel information concerning any additional hazards presented by the article if the resulting condensed statement contains all of the information needed for dealing with each type of hazard presented by the article.
[38 FR 27012, Sept. 27, 1973; 38 FR 30105, Nov. 1, 1973]
§ 1500.128
Label comment.
The Commission will offer informal comment on any proposed label and accompanying literature involving a hazardous substance if furnished with:
(a) Complete labeling or proposed labeling, which may be in draft form.
(b) Complete quantitative formula.
(c) Adequate clinical pharmacological, toxicological, physical, and chemical data applicable to the possible hazard of the substance.
(d) Any other information available that would facilitate preparation of a suitable label, such as complaints of injuries resulting from the product's use or other evidence that would furnish human-experience data.
§ 1500.129
Substances named in the Federal Caustic Poison Act.
The Commission finds that for those substances covered by the Federal Caustic Poison Act (44 Stat. 1406), the requirements of section 2(p)(1) of the Federal Hazardous Substances Act (repeated in § 1500.3(b)(14)(i)) are not adequate for the protection of the public health. Labeling for those substances, in the concentrations listed in the Federal Caustic Poison Act, were required to bear the signal word “poison.” The Commission concludes that the lack of the designation “poison” would indicate to the consumer a lesser hazard and that such would not be in the interest of the public health. Under the authority granted in section 3(b) of the act, the Commission therefore finds that for the following substances, and at the following concentrations, the word “poison” is necessary instead of any signal word:
(a) Hydrochloric acid and any preparation containing free or chemically unneutralized hydrochloric acid (HCl) in a concentration of 10 percent or more.
(b) Sulfuric acid and any preparation containing free or chemically unneutralized sulfuric acid (H
2
SO
4
) in a concentration of 10 percent or more.
(c) Nitric acid or any preparation containing free or chemically unneutralized nitric acid (HNO
3
) in a concentration of 5 percent or more.
(d) Carbolic acid (C
6
H
5
OH), also known as phenol, and any preparation
containing carbolic acid in a concentration of 5 percent or more.
(e) Oxalic acid and any preparation containing free or chemically unneutralized oxalic acid (H
2
C
2
O
4
) in a concentration of 10 percent or more.
(f) Any salt of oxalic acid and any preparation containing any such salt in a concentration of 10 percent or more.
(g) Acetic acid or any preparation containing free or chemically unneutralized acetic acid (HC
2
H
2
O
2
) in a concentration of 20 percent or more.
(h) Hypochlorous acid, either free or combined, and any preparation containing the same in a concentration that will yield 10 percent or more by weight of available chlorine.
(i) Potassium hydroxide and any preparation containing free or chemically unneutralized potassium hydroxide (KOH), including caustic potash and vienna paste (vienna caustic), in a concentration of 10 percent or more.
(j) Sodium hydroxide and any preparation containing free or chemically unneutralized sodium hydroxide (NaOH), including caustic soda and lye in a concentration of 10 percent or more.
(k) Silver nitrate, sometimes known as lunar caustic, and any preparation containing silver nitrate (AgNO
3
) in a concentration of 5 percent or more.
(l) Ammonia water and any preparation containing free or chemically uncombined ammonia (NH
3
), including ammonium hydroxide and “hartshorn,” in a concentration of 5 percent or more.
§ 1500.130
Self-pressurized containers: labeling.
(a) Self-pressurized containers that fail to bear a warning statement adequate for the protection of the public health and safety may be misbranded under the act, except as otherwise provided pursuant to section 3 of the act.
(b) The following warning statement will be considered as meeting the requirements of section 2(p)(1) of the act (repeated in § 1500.3(b)(14)(i)) if the only hazard associated with an article is that the contents are under pressure:

# warning—contents under pressure
Do not puncture or incinerate container. Do not expose to heat or store at temperatures above 120 °F. Keep out of the reach of children.
The word “CAUTION” may be substituted for the word “WARNING”. A practical equivalent may be substituted for the statement “Keep out of the reach of children.”
(c) That portion of the warning statement set forth in paragraph (b) of this section in capital letters should be printed on the main (front) panel of the container in capital letters of the type size specified in § 1500.121(c). The balance of the cautionary statements may appear together on another panel if the front panel also bears a statement such as “Read carefully other cautions on _____ panel.”
(d) If an article has additional hazards, such as skin or eye irritancy, toxicity, or flammability, appropriate additional front and rear panel precautionary labeling is required.
§ 1500.133
Extremely flammable contact adhesives; labeling.
(a) Extremely flammable contact adhesives, also known as contact bonding cements, when distributed in containers intended or suitable for household use may be misbranded under the act if the containers fail to bear a warning statement adequate for the protection of the public health and safety.
(b) The following warning statement is considered as the minimum cautionary labeling adequate to meet the requirements of section 2(p)(1) of the act (repeated in § 1500.3(b)(14)(i)) with respect to containers of more than one-half pint of contact adhesive and similar liquid or semiliquid articles having a flashpoint at or below 20 °F. as determined by the method in § 1500.43, when the only hazard foreseeable is that caused by the extreme flammability of the mixture:

# Danger

# Extremely Flammable

# Vapors May Cause Flash Fire
Vapors may ignite explosively.
Prevent buildup of vapors—open all windows and doors—use only with cross-ventilation.
Keep away from heat, sparks, and open flame.
Do not smoke, extinguish all flames and pilot lights, and turn off stoves, heaters, electric motors, and other sources of ignition during use and until all vapors are gone.
Close container after use.
Keep out of the reach of children.
(c) The words that are in capital letters in the warning statement set forth in paragraph (b) of this section should be printed on the main (front) panel or panels of the container in capital letters of the type size specified in § 1500.121(c). The balance of the cautionary information may appear together on another panel provided the front panel bears a statement such as “Read carefully other cautions on ___ panel,” the blank being filled in with the identification of the specific label panel bearing the balance of the cautionary labeling. It is recommended that a borderline be used in conjunction with the cautionary labeling.
(d) If an article has additional hazards, or contains ingredients listed in § 1500.14 as requiring special labeling, appropriate additional front and rear panel precautionary labeling is required.
(e) Since the Commission has issued a regulation banning under the Consumer Product Safety Act extremely flammable contact adhesives covered by this labeling regulation (sec. 16 CFR part 1302), paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and (d) of this section are revoked as to the subject products after June 13, 1978.

§ 1500.134
Policy on first aid labeling for saline emesis.
(a) This section states the Consumer Product Safety Commission's policy concerning first aid instructions for the use of a salt solution to induce vomiting (saline emesis) in the event of ingestion of hazardous substances.
(b) In many cases where hazardous substances are ingested, the recommended first aid instructions for inducing vomiting have contained a statement that this should be accomplished by drinking a solution of salt (sodium chloride) in warm water. At one time, this direction was considered medically acceptable. However, the Commission has obtained information showing that the instruction to perform saline emesis is no longer appropriate. This is because the use of salt to induce vomiting can cause severe hypernatremia (salt poisoning) with potentially toxic effects, particularly in children 5 years old or younger, the age group most often involved in accidental poisonings. In view of the availability of safer and more effective emetics such as ipecac syrup, the Commission no longer recommends a direction to perform saline emesis as a first aid direction for inducing vomiting.
(c) The Commission believes that, for products for which directions for saline emesis have been given in the past, ipecac syrup, U.S.P., is the most appropriate emetic, unless a particular contraindication exists in connection with any particular hazardous substance.
(d) The Commission wishes to emphasize that this policy does not require that any specific first aid instruction or wording be used. Where appropriate, the label may include directions (1) that the victim immediately contact a doctor or poison control center and/or (2) that vomiting be induced using methods other than salt. It is, of course, the manufacturer's responsibility to insure that the label provides enough information in addition to first aid instructions to fulfill all other labeling required by statute or regulation.

[43 FR 33704, Aug. 1, 1978]
§ 1500.135
Summary of guidelines for determining chronic toxicity.
A substance may be toxic due to a risk of a chronic hazard. (A regulatory definition of “toxic” that pertains to chronic toxicity may be found at 16 CFR 1500.3(c)(2).) The following discussions are intended to help clarify the complex issues involved in assessing risk from substances that may potentially cause chronic hazards and, where possible, to describe conditions under which substances should be considered toxic due to a risk of the specified chronic hazards. The guidelines are not intended to be a static classification system, but should be considered along with available data and with expert judgment. They are not mandatory. Rather, the guidelines are intended as
an aid to manufacturers in determining whether a product subject to the FHSA presents a chronic hazard. All default assumptions contained in the guidelines on hazard and risk determination are subject to replacement when alternatives which are supported by appropriate data become available. The following are brief summaries of more extensive discussions contained in the guidelines. Thus, the guidelines should be consulted in conjunction with these summaries. Copies of the guidelines may be obtained from the Office of Compliance and Enforcement, Consumer Product Safety Commission, Washington, DC 20207. (In addition to the chronic hazards discussed below, issues relating to the chronic hazard of sensitization are discussed in 16 CFR 1500.3(c)(5).)
(a)
Carcinogenicity.
Substances are toxic by reason of their potential carcinogenicity in humans when they are known or probable human carcinogenic substances as defined below. Substances that are possible human carcinogenic substances or for which there is no evidence of carcinogenic effect under the following categories lack sufficient evidence to be considered toxic by virtue of their potential carcinogenicity.
(1)
Known Human carcinogenic Substances (“sufficient evidence” in humans).
Substances are toxic by reason of their carcinogenicity when they meet the “sufficient evidence” criteria of carcinogenicity from studies in humans, which require that a causal relationship between exposure to an agent and cancer be established. This category is similar to the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Group A, the International Agency for Research on Cancer's (IARC) Group 1, or the American National Standards Institute's (ANSI) Category 1. A causal relationship is established if one or more epidemiological investigations that meet the following criteria show an association between cancer and exposure to the agent.
(i) No identified bias that can account for the observed association has been found on evaluation of the evidence.
(ii) All possible confounding factors which could account for the observed association can be ruled out with reasonable confidence.
(iii) Based on statistical analysis, the association has been shown unlikely to be due to chance.
(2)
Probable Human Carcinogenic Substances.
Substances are also toxic by reason of their probable carcinogenicity when they meet the “limited evidence” criteria of carcinogenicity in humans or the “sufficient evidence” criteria of carcinogenicity in animals described below. This category is similar to EPA's Group B, IARC's Group 2, or ANSI's Categories 2 and 3. Evidence derived from animal studies that has been shown not to be relevant to humans is not included. For example, such evidence would result when there was an identified mechanism of action for a chemical that causes cancer in animals that has been shown not to apply to the human situation. It is reasonable, for practical purposes, to regard an agent for which there is “sufficient” evidence of carcinogenicity in animals as if it presented a carcinogenic risk to humans.
(i)
“Limited evidence” of carcinogenicity in humans.
The evidence is considered limited for establishing a causal relationship between exposure to the agent and cancer when a causal interpretation is credible, but chance, bias, or other confounding factors could not be ruled out with reasonable confidence.
(ii)
“Sufficient evidence” of carcinogenicity in animals.
Sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity requires that the substance has been tested in well-designed and -conducted studies (e.g., as conducted by National Toxicology Program (NTP), or consistent with the Office of Science Technology Assessment and Policy (OSTP) guidelines) and has been found to elicit a statistically significant (p
0.05) exposure-related increase in the incidence of malignant tumors, combined malignant and benign tumors, or benign tumors if there is an indication of the ability of such benign tumors to progress to malignancy:
(A) In one or both sexes of multiple species, strains, or sites of independent origin; or experiments using different routes of administration or dose levels; or
(B) To an unusual degree in a single experiment (one species/strain/sex) with regard to unusual tumor type, unusual tumor site, or early age at onset of the tumor.
The presence of positive effects in short-term tests, dose-response effects data, or structure-activity relationship are considered additional evidence.
(3)
Possible Human Carcinogenic Substance (“limited evidence” animal carcinogen).
In the absence of “sufficient” or “limited” human data, agents with “limited” evidence of carcinogenicity from animal studies fall into this category. Such substances, and those that do not fall into any other group, are not considered “toxic.” This does not imply that the substances are or are not carcinogens, only that the evidence is too uncertain to provide for a determination. This category is similar to EPA's Group C, IARC's Group 3, or ANSI's category 4.
(b)
Neurotoxicity.
Substances are toxic by reason of their potential neurotoxicity in humans when they meet the “sufficient evidence” or “limited evidence” criteria of neurotoxicity in humans, or when they meet the “sufficient evidence” criteria of neurotoxicity in animals.
(1)
Known Neurotoxic Substances (“sufficient evidence in humans”).
Substances are toxic by reason of their neurotoxicity and are considered “known neurotoxic substances” when they meet the “sufficient evidence” criteria of neurotoxicity derived from studies in humans which require that a causal association between exposure to an agent and neurotoxicity be established with a reasonable degree of certainty. Substances in this category meet the definition of “neurotoxic” as stated above. “Sufficient evidence,” derived from human studies, for a causal association between exposure to a chemical and neurotoxicity is considered to exist if the studies meet the following criteria.
(i) A consistent pattern of neurological dysfunction is observed.
(ii) The adverse effects/lesions account for the neurobehavioral dysfunction with reasonable certainty.
(iii) All identifiable bias and confounding factors are reasonably discounted after consideration.
(iv) The association has been shown unlikely to be due to chance, based on statistical analysis.
(2)
Probable Neurotoxic Substances.
Substances are also toxic by reason of their probable neurotoxicity when they meet the “limited evidence” criteria of neurotoxicity in humans, or the “sufficient evidence” criteria derived from animal studies. Evidence derived from animal studies that has been shown not to be relevant to humans is not included. Such evidence would result, for example, when there was an identified mechanism of action for a chemical that causes neurotoxicity in animals that has been shown not to apply to the human situation.
(i)
“Limited evidence” of neurotoxicity in humans.
The evidence derived from human studies is considered limited for neurotoxicity when the evidence is less than convincing, i.e., one of the criteria of “sufficient evidence” of neurotoxicity for establishing a causal association between exposure to the agent and neurotoxicity is not met, leaving some uncertainties in establishing a causal association.
(ii)
“Sufficient evidence” of neurotoxicity in animals.
Sufficient evidence of neurotoxicity derived from animal studies for a causal association between exposure to a chemical and neurotoxicity requires that:
(A) The substance has been tested in well-designed and -conducted studies (e.g., NTP's neurobehavioral battery, or conforming to EPA's neurotoxicity test guidelines); and
(B) The substance has been found to elicit a statistically significant (p
0.05) increase in any neurotoxic effect in one or both sexes of multiple species, strains, or experiments using different routes of administration and dose-levels.
(3)
Possible Neurotoxic Substances.
“Possible neurotoxic substances” are the substances which meet the “limited evidence” criteria of neurotoxicity evidence derived from animal studies in the absence of human data, or in the presence of inadequate human data, or data which do not fall into any other group. Substances in this category are not considered “toxic.”
(c)
Developmental and Reproductive Toxicity
—(1)
Definitions of “Sufficient”
and “Limited” Evidence.
The following definitions apply to all categories stated below.
(i) “Sufficient evidence” from human studies for a causal association between human exposure and the subsequent occurrence of developmental or reproductive toxicity is considered to exist if the studies meet the following criteria:
(A) No identified bias that can account for the observed association has been found on evaluation of the evidence.
(B) All possible confounding factors which could account for the observed association can be ruled out with reasonable confidence.
(C) Based on statistical analysis, the association has been shown unlikely to be due to chance.
(ii) “Limited evidence” from human studies exists when the human epidemiology meets all but one of the criteria for “sufficient evidence”; i.e., the statistical evidence is borderline as opposed to clear-cut, there is a source of bias, or there are confounding factors that have not been and cannot be accounted for.
(iii) “Sufficient evidence” from animal studies exists when
(A) Obtained from a good quality animal study; and
(B) The substance has been found to elicit a statistically significant (p
0.05) treatment-related increase in multiple endpoints in a single species/strain, or in the incidence of a single endpoint at multiple dose levels or with multiple routes of administration in a single species/strain, or increase in the incidence of a single endpoint in multiple species/strains/ experiments.
(iv) “Limited evidence” from animal studies exists when:
(A) Obtained from a good quality study and there is a statistically significant (p
0.05) treatment-related increase in the incidence of a single endpoint in a single species/strain/experiment at a single dose level administered through only one route and such evidence otherwise does not meet the criteria for “sufficient evidence”; or
(B) The evidence is derived from studies which can be interpreted to show positive effects but have some qualitative or quantitative limitations with respect to experimental procedures (e.g., doses, exposure, follow-up, number of animals/group, reporting of the data, etc.) which would prevent classification of the evidence in the group of “sufficient evidence.”
(2)
Developmental Toxicants.
Substances are toxic by reason of their potential developmental or reproductive toxicity when they meet the “sufficient evidence” or “limited evidence” criteria of developmental or reproductive toxicity in humans, or when they meet the “sufficient evidence” criteria of developmental or reproductive toxicity in animals. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Economic Community (EEC) have developed categories for teratogens but not other developmental toxicants. The teratogen guidelines limit the information only to structural birth defects and do not include other hazards of developmental toxicity such as embryonal death, fetal death, or functional deficiencies which are also important in assessing the overall toxicity of a substance when administered during pregnancy. Recently, EPA has proposed a system for classifying developmental toxicity. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has not yet developed any classification for developmental toxicity. The commission has established the following categories for determination of developmental toxicity according to the available evidence.
(i)
Known Human Developmental Toxicant (“sufficient evidence in humans”).
A substance is considered a “known human developmental toxicant” if there is “sufficient” human evidence to establish a causal association between human exposure and the subsequent occurrence of developmental toxicity manifested by death of the conceptus (embryo or fetus), or structural or functional birth defects. This category (Human Developmental Toxicant) is comparable to category 1 of the EEC and categories D and X of FDA, except that these guidelines are limited to teratogens. This category is also comparable to the category “definitive evidence for human developmental toxicity” proposed by EPA.
(ii)
Probable Human Developmental Toxicant.
A substance is considered a
“probable human developmental toxicant” if there is “limited” human evidence or “sufficient” animal evidence to establish a causal association between human exposure and subsequent occurrence of developmental toxicity. This group (Probable Human Developmental Toxicant) is comparable to the category “adequate evidence for human developmental toxicity” proposed by EPA. This category is also comparable to category 2 of the EEC and category A1 of FDA, except that these guidelines are limited to teratogens.
(iii)
Possible Human Developmental Toxicant.
A substance is considered a “possible human developmental toxicant” if there is “limited” animal evidence, in the absence of human data, or in the presence of inadequate human data, or which does not fall into any other group, to establish a causal association between human exposure and subsequent occurrence of developmental toxicity. EEC, FDA, and EPA have not developed a category comparable to this group. The Commission believes that data from well planned animal studies are important to consider even though they may provide only limited evidence of developmental toxicity.
(3)
Male Reproductive Toxicants.
Male reproductive toxicants can be grouped into the following different categories based on evidence obtained from human or animal studies.
(i)
Known Human Male Reproductive Toxicant.
A substance is considered a “known human male reproductive toxicant” if there is “sufficient” human evidence to establish a causal association between human exposure and the adverse effects on male reproductive main endpoints which are mating ability, fertility, and prenatal and postnatal development of the conceptus. This category is comparable to the one termed “Known Positive” in the EPA guidelines on male reproductive risk assessment.
(ii)
Probable Human Male Reproductive Toxicant.
A substance is considered a “probable human male reproductive toxicant” if there is “limited” human evidence or “sufficient” animal evidence to establish a causal association between human exposure and the adverse effects on male reproductive main endpoints. This category is comparable to the one termed “Probable Positive” in the EPA guidelines on male reproductive risk assessment. However, the EPA category is based only on sufficient animal evidence. CPSC believes that limited human evidence is also sufficient for a chemical to be placed in this category.
(iii)
Possible Human Male Reproductive Toxicant.
A substance is considered a “possible human male reproductive toxicant” if there is limited animal evidence, in the absence of human data, or in the presence of inadequate human data, or which does not fall into any other group, to establish a causal association between human exposure and adverse effects on male reproductive main endpoints. This category is comparable to the one termed “Possible Positive A” in the EPA guidelines on male reproductive risk assessment. EPA proposes to use either limited human or limited animal evidence data to classify a toxicant as a “Possible Positive A” toxicant. As described above, CPSC would elevate limited human evidence to the category “Probable Human Male Reproductive Toxicant.”
(4)
Female Reproductive Toxicants.
Female reproductive toxicants can be grouped into the following different categories based on evidence obtained from human or animal studies. EPA has proposed guidelines for assessing female reproductive risk but has not yet proposed a specific system for categorization of female reproductive toxicants.
(i)
Known Human Female Reproductive Toxicant.
A substance is considered a “known human female reproductive toxicant” if there is “sufficient” human evidence to establish a causal association between human exposure and adverse effects on female reproductive function such as mating ability, fertility, and prenatal and postnatal development of the conceptus.
(ii)
Probable Human Female Reproductive Toxicant.
A substance is considered a “probable human female reproductive toxicant” if there is “limited” human evidence or “sufficient” animal
evidence to establish a causal association between human exposure and adverse effects on female reproductive function.
(iii)
Possible Human Female Reproductive Toxicant.
A substance is considered a “possible human female reproductive toxicant” if there is “limited” animal evidence, in the absence of human data, or in the presence of inadequate human data, or which does not fall into any other group, to establish a causal association between human exposure and adverse effects on female reproductive function.
(d)
Other Subjects Related to the Determination that a Substance is Toxic.
Under the FHSA, for a toxic substance to be considered hazardous, it must not only have the potential to be hazardous but there must also be the potential that persons are exposed to the substance, that the substance can enter the body, and that there is a significant risk of an adverse health effect associated with the customary handling and use of the substance. Under these guidelines, existence of an adverse health effect means that such exposure is above the “acceptable daily intake” (“ADI”). The ADI is based on the risks posed by the substance, and whether they are acceptable under the FHSA. This section addresses those issues by providing guidelines concerning assessment of exposure, assessment of bioavailability, determination of acceptable risks and the ADI to children and adults, and assessment of risk.
(1)
Assessment of Exposure.
An exposure assessment may comprise a single exposure scenario or a distribution of exposures. Reasonably foreseeable use, as well as accidental exposure, should be taken into consideration when designing exposure studies. The following guidelines should be used in the assessment of exposure.
(i)
Inhalation.
Inhalation studies to assess exposure should be reliable studies using direct monitoring of populations, predictions of exposure through modeling, or surrogate data.
(A)
Direct Monitoring.
Populations to be monitored should be selected randomly to be representative of the general population, unless the exposure of a particular subset population is the desired goal of the assessment. The monitoring technique should be appropriate for the health effect of interest.
(B)
Modeling.
Predictions of exposure to a chemical using mathematical models can be based on physical and chemical principles, such as mass balance principles. Mass balance models should consider the source strength of the product of interest, housing characteristics, and ambient conditions likely to be encountered by the studied population.
(C)
Surrogate Data.
Surrogate data should only be used when data concerning the chemical of interest are sparse or unavailable and when there is a reasonable assurance that the surrogate data will accurately represent the chemical of interest.
(ii)
Oral Ingestion.
Oral ingestion studies may involve direct monitoring of sources of chemicals as well as laboratory simulations. The estimation of exposure from ingestion of chemicals present in consumer products is predicted based upon estimates of use of the product and absorption of the chemical from the gastrointestinal tract. The following criteria should be established for laboratory simulations to estimate exposure:
(A) A simulant or range of simulants should be carefully selected to mimic the possible range of conditions which occur in humans, such as full and empty stomachs, or various saliva compositions at different times of the day.
(B) The mechanical action to which a product is submitted must be chosen to represent some range of realistic conditions to which a human may subject the product.
(iii)
Dermal Exposure.
(A) Dermal exposure involves estimating the amount of substance contacting the skin. This may involve experiments measuring the amount of material leached from a product contacting a liquid layer which interfaces with the skin, or the amount of substance which migrates from a product (in solid or liquid form) which is in contact with the skin.
(B) Parameters to be considered include: Surface area of the skin contacted, duration of contact, frequency of contact, and thickness of a liquid interfacial layer.
(2)
Assessment of Bioavailability.
(i) The need to consider bioavailability in estimating the risk from use of a product containing a toxic substance only arises when it is anticipated that the absorption characteristics of a substance to which there is human exposure will differ from those characteristics for the substance tested in the studies used to define the dose-response relationship.
(ii) In determining the need to assess bioavailability, the factors to be examined include:
(A) The physical or chemical form of the substance,
(B) The route of exposure (inhalation, ingestion, or through the skin),
(C) The presence of other constituents in the product which interfere with or alter absorption of the toxic substance, and
(D) Dose.
(3)
Assessment of Risk.
This section on quantitative risk assessment applies to estimates of risk for substances that are toxic by reason of their carcinogenicity.
(i) Generally, the study leading to the highest risk should be used in the risk assessment; however, other factors may influence the choice of study.
(ii) Risk should be based on the maximum likelihood estimate from a multistage model (such as Global83 or later version) unless the maximum likelihood estimate is not linear at low dose, in which case the 95% upper confidence limit on risk should be used.
(iii) For systemic carcinogens, if estimates of human risk are made based on animal data, a factor derived from dividing the assumed human weight (70 kg) by the average animal weight during the study and taking that to the
1/3
power should be used. There is the possibility that this factor may be changed, using the
1/4
power instead of the
1/3
power, as part of a unified Federal regulatory approach. If such an approach is adopted, it will apply here.
(iv) When dose is expressed as parts per million, and the carcinogen acts at the site of contact, humans and animals exposed to the same amount for the same proportion of lifetime should be assumed to be equally sensitive.
(v) If no experimental study having the same route of exposure as that anticipated for human use of a substance is available, a study by another route of exposure may be used. Pharmacokinetic methods may be used if sufficient data are available.
(vi) When exposure scenarios are different from those used in the underlying study upon which estimates of risk are based, proportionality should be applied. If pharmacokinetic methods are used to adjust for risks at high versus low exposure levels, level-time measures should not be combined without taking the non-linearity into account.
(4)
Acceptable Risks
—(i)
ADI for Carcinogens.
The maximum acceptable daily intake (“ADI”) is that exposure of a toxic (by virtue of its carcinogenicity) substance that is estimated to lead to a lifetime excess risk of one in a million. Exposure refers to the anticipated exposure from normal lifetime use of the product, including use as a child as well as use as an adult.
(ii)
ADI for Neurotoxicological and Developmental/Reproductive Agents.
Due to the difficulties in using a numerical risk assessment method to determine risk for neurotoxicological or developmental/reproductive toxicants, the Commission is using a safety factor approach, as explained below.
(A)
Human Data.
If the hazard is ascertained from human data, a safety factor of ten will be applied to the lowest No Observed Effect Level (“NOEL”) seen among the relevant studies. If no NOEL can be determined, a safety factor of 100 will be applied to the Lowest Observed Effect Level (“LOEL”). Both the NOEL and LOEL are defined in terms of daily dose level.
(B)
Animal Data.
If the hazard is ascertained from animal data, a safety factor of one hundred will be applied to the lowest NOEL. If no NOEL can be determined, a safety factor of one thousand will be applied to the lowest LOEL. Both the NOEL and LOEL are defined in terms of daily dose level.

§ 1500.230
Guidance for lead (Pb) in consumer products.
(a)
Summary.
(1) The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission issues this guidance to manufacturers, importers, distributors, and retailers to protect children from hazardous exposure to lead in consumer products.
1
The Commission identifies the major factors that it considers when evaluating products that contain lead, and informs the public of its experience with products that have exposed children to potentially hazardous amounts of lead.
1
This guidance is not a rule. It is intended to highlight certain obligations under the Federal Hazardous Substances Act. Companies should read that Act and the accompanying regulations in this part for more detailed information.
(2) To reduce the risk of hazardous exposure to lead, the Commission requests manufacturers to eliminate the use of lead that may be accessible to children from products used in or around households, schools, or in recreation. The Commission also recommends that, before purchasing products for resale, importers, distributors, and retailers obtain assurances from manufacturers that those products do not contain lead that may be accessible to children.
(b)
Hazard.
Young children are most commonly exposed to lead in consumer products from the direct mouthing of objects, or from handling such objects and subsequent hand-to-mouth activity. The specific type and frequency of behavior that a child exposed to a product will exhibit depends on the age of the child and the characteristics and pattern of use of the product. The adverse health effects of lead poisoning in children are well-documented and may have long-lasting or permanent consequences. These effects include neurological damage, delayed mental and physical development, attention and learning deficiencies, and hearing problems. Because lead accumulates in the body, even exposures to small amounts of lead can contribute to the overall level of lead in the blood and to the subsequent risk of adverse health effects. Therefore, any unnecessary exposure of children to lead should be avoided. The scientific community generally recognizes a level of 10 micrograms of lead per deciliter of blood as a threshold level of concern with respect to lead poisoning. To avoid exceeding that level, young children should not chronically ingest more than 15 micrograms of lead per day from consumer products.
(c)
Guidance.
(1) Under the Federal Hazardous Substances Act (FHSA), 15 U.S.C. 1261(f)(1), household products that expose children to hazardous quantities of lead under reasonably foreseeable conditions of handling or use are “hazardous substances.” A household product that is not intended for children but which creates such a risk of injury because it contains lead requires precautionary labeling under the Act. 15 U.S.C. 1261(p). A toy or other article intended for use by children which contains a hazardous amount of lead that is accessible for children to ingest is a banned hazardous substance. 15 U.S.C. 1261(q)(1)(B). In evaluating the potential hazard associated with products that contain lead, the Commission staff considers these major factors on a case-by-case basis: the total amount of lead contained in a product, the bioavailability of the lead, the accessibility of the lead to children, the age and foreseeable behavior of the children exposed to the product, the foreseeable duration of the exposure, and the marketing, patterns of use, and life cycle of the product.
(2) Paint and similar surface coatings containing lead have historically been the most commonly-recognized sources of lead poisoning among the products within the Commission's jurisdiction. The Commission has, by regulation, banned paint and other similar surface coatings that contain more than 0.06% lead (“lead-containing paint”), toys and other articles intended for use by children that bear lead-containing paint, and furniture articles for consumer use that bear lead-containing paint. 16 CFR Part 1303. In recent
years, however, the Commission staff has identified a number of disparate products—some intended for use by children and others simply used in or around the household or in recreation—that presented a risk of lead poisoning from sources other than paint. These products included vinyl miniblinds, crayons, figurines used as game pieces, and children's jewelry.
(3) In several of these cases, the staff's determination that the products presented a risk of lead poisoning resulted in recalls or in the replacement of those products with substitutes, in addition to an agreement to discontinue the use of lead in future production. The Commission believes that, had the manufacturers of these lead-containing products acted with prudence and foresight before introducing the products into commerce, they would not have used lead at all. This in turn would have eliminated both the risk to young children and the costs and other consequences associated with the corrective actions.
(4) The Commission urges manufacturers to eliminate lead in consumer products to avoid similar occurrences in the future. However, to avoid the possibility of a Commission enforcement action, a manufacturer who believes it necessary to use lead in a consumer product should perform the requisite analysis before distribution to determine whether the exposure to lead causes the product to be a “hazardous substance.” If the product is a hazardous substance and is also a children's product, it is banned. If it is a hazardous household substance but is not intended for use by children, it requires precautionary labeling. This same type of analysis also should be performed on materials substituted for lead.
(5) The Commission also notes that, under the FHSA, any firm that purchases a product for resale is responsible for determining whether that product contains lead and, if so, whether it is a “hazardous substance.” The Commission, therefore, recommends that, prior to the acquisition or distribution of such products, importers, distributors, and retailers obtain information and data, such as analyses of chemical composition or accessibility, relevant to this determination from manufacturers, or have such evaluations conducted themselves.
[63 FR 70649, Dec. 22, 1998]
§ 1500.231
Guidance for hazardous liquid chemicals in children's products.
(a)
Summary.
The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission issues this guidance to manufacturers, importers, distributors, and retailers to protect children from exposure to hazardous chemicals found in liquid-filled children's products, such as rolling balls, bubble watches, necklaces, pens, paperweights, keychains, liquid timers, and mazes.
1
The Commission identifies the major factors that it considers when evaluating liquid-filled children's products that contain hazardous chemicals, and informs the public of its experience with exposure to these hazardous chemicals to children. To reduce the risk of exposure to hazardous chemicals, such as mercury, ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, methanol, methylene chloride, petroleum distillates, toluene, xylene, and related chemicals, the Commission requests manufacturers to eliminate the use of such chemicals in children's products. The Commission also recommends that, before purchasing products for resale, importers, distributors, and retailers obtain assurances from manufacturers that liquid-filled children's products do not contain hazardous liquid chemicals.
1
This guidance is not a rule. It is intended to highlight certain obligations under the Federal Hazardous Substances Act. Companies should read that Act and the accompanying regulations in this part for more detailed information.
(b)
Hazard.
During reasonably foreseeable handling or use of liquid-filled children's products, hazardous chemicals may become accessible to young children in a manner that places children at risk. Young children are exposed to the chemicals from directly mouthing them or from handling such objects and subsequent hand-to-mouth or hand-to-eye activity. The specific type and frequency of behavior that a child exposed to a product will exhibit depends on the age of the child and the characteristics and pattern of use of
the product. The adverse health effects of these chemicals to children include chemical poisoning from ingestion of the chemicals, pneumonia from aspiration of the chemicals into the lungs, and skin and eye irritation from exposure to the chemicals. The chemicals may also be combustible.
(c)
Guidance.
(1) Under the Federal Hazardous Substances Act (FHSA), products that are toxic or irritants and that may cause substantial injury or illness under reasonably foreseeable conditions of handling or use, including reasonably foreseeable ingestion by children, are “hazardous substances.” 15 U.S.C. 1261(f)(1). A product that is not intended for children, but that creates a risk of substantial injury or illness because it contains hazardous chemicals, requires precautionary labeling under the Act. 15 U.S.C. 1261(p). A toy or other article intended for use by children that contains an accessible and harmful amount of a hazardous chemical is banned. 15 U.S.C. 1261(q)(1)(A). In evaluating the potential hazard associated with children's products that contain hazardous chemicals, the Commission's staff considers certain factors on a case-by-case basis, including: the total amount of the hazardous chemical in a product, the accessibility of the hazardous chemicals to children, the risk presented by that accessibility, the age and foreseeable behavior of the children exposed to the product, and the marketing, patterns of use, and life cycle of the product.
(2) The Commission's staff has identified a number of liquid-filled children's products, such as rolling balls, bubble watches, necklaces, pens, paperweights, maze toys, liquid timers, and keychains, that contain hazardous chemicals. In several of these cases, the staff determined that these products violated the FHSA because they presented a risk of chemical poisoning and/or chemical pneumonia from aspiration. This determination resulted in recalls or in the replacement of those products with substitutes, as well as in agreements with the manufacturers to discontinue the use of hazardous chemicals in liquid-filled children's products in future production. The Commission believes that these hazardous substances pose a risk to young children and, consequently, manufacturers should not have included them in the product design or manufacturing process.
(3) Therefore, the Commission considers the use of hazardous chemicals in children's products such as those described above to be ill-advised and encourages manufacturers to avoid using them in such products. Further, the Commission recommends that, before purchasing such products for resale, importers, distributors, and retailers obtain assurances from the manufacturers that liquid-filled children's products do not contain hazardous liquid chemicals.
[63 FR 70648, Dec. 22, 1998]
§ 1500.232
Statement on animal testing policy.
(a)
Summary.
(1) The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission issues this statement of policy on animal testing and alternatives to animal testing of hazardous substances regulated under the Federal Hazardous Substances Act (FHSA). The FHSA requires appropriate cautionary labeling on certain hazardous household products to alert consumers to the potential hazard(s) that the products may present. Among the hazards addressed by the FHSA are toxicity, corrosivity, sensitization, and irritation.
(2) In order to determine the appropriate cautionary labeling, it is necessary to have objective criteria by which the existence of each hazard can be determined. Hazards such as toxicity, tissue corrosiveness, eye irritancy, and skin irritancy result from the biological response of living tissue and organs to the presence of the hazardous substance. One means of characterizing these hazards is to use animal testing as a proxy for the human reaction. In fact, the FHSA defines the hazard category of “highly toxic” in terms of animal toxicity when groups of 10 or more rats are exposed to specified amounts of the substance. The Commission's regulations under the FHSA concerning toxicity and irritancy allow the use of animal tests to determine the presence of the hazard when human data or existing animal data are not available.
(3) Neither the FHSA nor the Commission's regulations requires animal testing. The FHSA and its implementing regulations only require that a product be labeled to reflect the hazards associated with that product. If animal testing is conducted, Commission policy supports limiting such tests to a minimum number of animals and advocates measures that eliminate or reduce the pain or discomfort to animals that can be associated with such tests. The Commission has prepared this statement of policy with respect to animal testing to encourage the manufacturers subject to the FHSA to follow a similar policy.
(4) In making the appropriate hazard determinations, manufacturers of products subject to the FHSA should use existing alternatives to animal testing whenever possible. These include: prior human experience (
e.g.,
published case studies),
in vitro
or
in silico
test methods that have been approved by the Commission, literature sources containing the results of prior animal testing or limited human tests (
e.g.,
clinical trials, dermal patch testing), and expert opinion (
e.g.,
hazard assessment, structure-activity analysis). If a manufacturer or other entity performs a hazard test for FHSA labeling purposes that has not been previously approved by the Commission, CPSC staff will consider the data on a case-by-case basis and, upon review, determine whether to post the test method on the animal testing Web site. The Commission recommends resorting to animal testing only when the other information sources have been exhausted. At this time, the Commission recommends use of the most humane procedures with the fewest animals possible to achieve reliable results. Recommended procedures are summarized in the following statement and can be accessed on the Commission's Web page at:
http://www.cpsc.gov/library/animaltesting.html.
If a manufacturer or other entity performs a hazard test for FHSA labeling purposes that has not been previously approved by the Commission (
e.g.,
an ICCVAM-recommended test method or one of the tests described in the current version of the FHSA), CPSC staff will consider the data on a case-by-case basis and, upon review, determine whether to post the test method on the animal testing Web site.
(b)
Statement of policy on animal testing.
(1) Neither the FHSA nor the Commission's regulations requires animal testing. Reliable human experience always takes precedence over results from animal data. In the cases where animal tests are conducted, the Commission prefers test methods that reduce stress and suffering in test animals and that use fewer animals while maintaining scientific integrity. To this end, the Commission reviews recommendations on alternative test methods developed by the scientific and regulatory communities. Current descriptions of test method recommendations approved by or known to the Commission can be accessed via the Internet at:
http://www.cpsc.gov/library/animaltesting.html.
The Commission strongly supports the use of scientifically sound alternatives to animal testing. The following parts of this section outline some of these alternatives. Testing laboratories and other interested persons requiring assistance interpreting the results obtained when a substance is tested in accordance with the methods described here, or in following the testing strategies outlined in the section, should refer to the Commission's animal testing Web page at:
http://www.cpsc.gov/library/animaltesting.html.
(i)
Acute toxicity.
The traditional FHSA animal test for acute toxicity determines the median lethal dose (LD50) or lethal concentration (LC50), the dose or concentration that is expected to kill half the test animals. Procedures for determining the median LD50/LC50 are described in section 2(h)(1) of the Act and supplemented in § 1500.3(c)(1) and (2) and the test method outlined in § 1500.40. The Commission recommends
in vitro
alternatives over
in vivo
LD50/LC50 tests, or using modifications of the traditional LD50/LC50 test during toxicity testing that reduce the number of animals tested whenever possible. Data from
in vitro
or
in silico
test methods that have not been approved by the Commission may be submitted to the Commission for consideration of their acceptability. Commission-approved testing alternatives are
identified on the Web site at:
http://www.cpsc.gov/library/animaltesting.html
and include:
(A)
In vitro
and
in vivo
test methods that have been scientifically validated and approved for use in toxicity testing by the Commission;
(B) Valid
in vitro
methods to estimate a starting dose for an acute
in vivo
test;
(C) A sequential version of the traditional LD50/LC50 tests described in § 1500.3(c)(1) and (2) and the test method described in § 1500.40, in which dose groups are run successively rather than simultaneously;
(D) A limit-dose test where the LD50/LC50 is determined as a point estimate, which can still be used to categorize a hazard, although it gives no information on hazard dose-response. In the limit test, animals (10 rats) each receive a single dose of product at 5g per kilogram of body weight. If not more than one animal dies in 14 days, the product is considered to have an LD50 of greater than 5g/kg, and thus, deemed to be nontoxic. Only if two or more animals die is a second group of 10 rats tested (at a lower dose). This procedure reduces the number of animals tested from the 80 to 100 animals involved in a full LD50 test to, typically, 10 to 20 rats per product. This reduction in the number of animals tested is justified because an exact LD50 is not required by either the FHSA or the regulations. The FHSA requires only a categorical determination that the toxicity is greater than 5g/kg, between 50 mg/kg and 5g/kg, or less than 50 mg/kg.
(ii)
Dermal irritation/corrosivity.
An acceptable
in vitro
test method or weight-of-evidence analysis is recommended before
in vivo
dermal irritation testing is considered to determine appropriate cautionary labeling. The weight-of-evidence analysis should incorporate any existing data on humans and animals, validated
in vitro
or
in silico
test results (valid tests are identified on the Commission's animal testing Web site at:
http://www.cpsc.gov/library/animaltesting.html
), the substance's dermal toxicity, evidence of corrosivity/irritation of one or more structurally related substances or mixtures of such substances, data demonstrating low or high pH (≤2 or ≥11.5) of the substance, and any other relevant physicochemical properties that indicate the substance might be a dermal corrosive or irritant. If there is any indication from this analysis that the substance is either corrosive or irritating to the skin, the substance should be labeled appropriately. If the substance is not corrosive
in vitro,
but no data exist regarding its irritation potential, human patch testing should be considered. If
in vitro
data are unavailable, human patch testing is not an option, and there are insufficient data to determine the weight-of-evidence, a tiered
in vivo
animal test is recommended.
(A) In a tiered
in vivo
dermal study, a single rabbit is tested initially. If the outcome is positive for corrosivity, testing is stopped, and the substance is labeled appropriately. If the substance is not corrosive, two more rabbits should be patch-tested to complete the assessment of skin irritation potential.
(B) If a tiered test is not feasible, the Commission recommends the test method described in § 1500.41. Note that in any
in vivo
dermal irritation test method, the Commission recommends using a semiocclusive patch to cover the animal's test site and eliminating the use of stocks for restraint during the exposure period, thereby allowing the animal free mobility and access to food and water.
(iii)
Ocular irritation.
A weight-of-evidence analysis is recommended to evaluate existing information before any
in vivo
ocular irritation testing is considered. This analysis should incorporate any existing data on humans and animals, validated
in vitro
or
in silico
test data (identified on the Commission's animal testing Web site at:
http://www.cpsc.gov/library/animaltesting.html
), the substance's dermal corrosivity/irritation (primary skin irritants and corrosives are also usually eye irritants and therefore do not need to be tested in the eye), evidence of ocular irritation of one or more structurally related substances or mixtures of such substances, data demonstrating high acidity or alkalinity of the substance, and any other relevant physicochemical properties that indicate the substance might be a dermal corrosive or irritant or ocular irritant.
(A) When the weight-of-evidence is insufficient to determine a substance's ocular irritation, a Commission-approved
in vitro
or
in silico
assay for ocular irritancy should be run to assess eye irritation potential and determine labeling. Examples of Commission-validated
in vitro
assays are identified on the Commission's animal testing Web site at:
http://www.cpsc.gov/library/animaltesting.html
). If no valid
in vitro
test exists, the test strategy for determining dermal corrosion/irritation outlined in paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(B) of this section can be followed to determine ocular irritation.
(B) If the dermal test strategy outlined in section paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(B) of this section leads to a conclusion of not corrosive, a tiered
in vivo
ocular irritation test should be performed, in which a single rabbit is exposed to the substance initially. If the outcome of this initial test is positive, testing is stopped, and the substance is labeled an eye irritant. If the outcome of this initial test is negative, one to two more rabbits are tested for ocular irritation, and the outcome of this test will determine the label. If a tiered test is not feasible, the Commission recommends the test method described in § 1500.42.
(C) When any ocular irritancy testing on animals is conducted, including the method described in § 1500.42, the Commission recommends a threefold plan to reduce animal suffering: The use of preemptive pain management, including topical anesthetics and systemic analgesics that eliminate or reduce suffering that may occur as a result of the application process or from the test substance itself (an example of a typical preemptive pain treatment is two applications of tetracaine ophthalmic anesthetic, 10-15 minutes apart, prior to instilling the test material to the eye); post-treatment with systemic analgesics for pain relief; and implementation of humane endpoints, including scheduled observations, monitoring, and recording of clinical signs of distress and pain, and recording the nature, severity, and progression of eye injuries. The specific techniques that have been approved by the Commission can be found at:
http://www.cpsc.gov/library/animaltesting.html.
(iv)
Dermal sensitization.
An acceptable
in vitro
test method (examples of valid
in vitro
tests are identified on the Commission's animal testing Web site at:
http://www.cpsc.gov/library/animaltesting.html
), or weight-of-evidence analysis is recommended before
in vivo
animal sensitization testing is considered to determine appropriate cautionary labeling. The weight-of-evidence analysis should incorporate any existing data on humans and animals, validated
in vitro
or
in silico
test results, and any relevant physicochemical properties that indicate the substance might be a dermal sensitizer. If there is any indication from this analysis that the substance is sensitizing to the skin, the substance should be labeled appropriately.

means the director of the area office of the Consumer Product Safety Commission having jurisdiction over the port of entry through which a hazardous substance is imported or offered for import, or such officer of the area office as he may designate to act in his behalf in administering and enforcing the provisions of section 14 of the act.
§ 1500.266
Notice of sampling.
When a sample of a hazardous substance offered for import has been requested by the director of the area office, the collector of customs having jurisdiction over the hazardous substance shall give to the owner or consignee prompt notice of delivery of, or intention to deliver, such sample. Upon
receipt of the notice, the owner or consignee shall hold such hazardous substance and not distribute it until further notice from the area office director or the collector of customs of the results of examination of the sample.
§ 1500.267
Payment for samples.
The Consumer Product Safety Commission will pay for all import samples that are found to be in compliance with the requirements of the act. Billing for reimbursement should be made by the owner or consignee to the Commission area office headquarters in the territory of which the shipment was offered for import. Payment for samples will not be made if the hazardous substance is found to be in violation of the act, even though subsequently brought into compliance under the terms of an authorization to bring the article into compliance.
§ 1500.268
Hearing.
(a) If it appears that the hazardous substance may be subject to refusal of admission, the area office director shall give the owner or consignee a written notice to that effect, stating the reasons therefor. The notice shall specify a place and a period of time during which the owner or consignee shall have an opportunity to introduce testimony. Upon timely request, giving reasonable grounds therefor, such time and place may be changed. Such testimony shall be confined to matters relevant to the admissibility of the hazardous substance, and may be introduced orally or in writing.
(b) If such owner or consignee submits or indicates his intention to submit an application for authorization to relabel or perform other action to bring the hazardous substance into compliance with the act, such testimony shall include evidence in support of such application. If such application is not submitted at or prior to the hearing, the area office director shall specify a time limit, reasonable in the light of the circumstances, for filing such application.
§ 1500.269

(a) Contain detailed proposals for bringing the article into compliance with the act.
(b) Specify the time and place where such operations will be carried out and the approximate time for their completion.
§ 1500.270
Granting of authorization.
(a) When authorization contemplated by § 1500.269 is granted, the area office director shall notify the applicant in writing, specifying:
(1) The procedure to be followed:
(2) That the operations are to be carried out under the supervision of an officer of the Consumer Product Safety Commission or the Bureau of Customs, as the case may be;
(3) A time limit, reasonable in the light of the circumstances, for completion of the operations; and
(4) Such other conditions as are necessary to maintain adequate supervision and control over the article.
(b) Upon receipt of a written request for extension of time to complete such operations, containing reasonable grounds therefor, the area office director may grant such additional time as he deems necessary.

(d) If ownership of a hazardous substance covered by an authorization changes before the operations specified in the authorization have been completed, the original owner will be held responsible, unless the new owner has executed a bond and obtained a new authorization. Any authorization granted under this section shall supersede and nullify any previously granted authorization with respect to the article.
§ 1500.271
Bonds.
(a) The bonds required under section 14(b) of the act may be executed by the owner or consignee on the appropriate form of a customs single-entry or term bond, containing a condition for the redelivery of the merchandise or any part
thereof upon demand of the collector of customs and containing a provision for the performance of conditions as may legally be imposed for the relabeling or other action necessary to bring the hazardous substance into compliance with the act in such manner as is prescribed for such bond in the customs regulations in force on the date of request for authorization. The bond shall be filed with the collector of customs.
(b) The collector of customs may cancel the liability for liquidated damages incurred under the above-mentioned provisions of such a bond, if he receives an application for relief therefrom, upon the payment of a lesser amount or upon such other terms and conditions as shall be deemed appropriate under the law and in view of the circumstances, but the collector shall not act under this regulation in any case unless the area office director is in full agreement with the action.
§ 1500.272
Costs chargeable in connection with relabeling and reconditioning inadmissible imports.
The cost of supervising the relabeling or other action necessary in connection with an import of a hazardous substance that fails to comply with the act shall be paid by the owner or consignee who files an application requesting such action and executes a bond, pursuant to section 14(b) of the act. The cost of such supervision shall include, but not be restricted to, the following:
(a) Travel expenses of the supervising officer.
(b) Per diem in lieu of subsistence of the supervising officer when away from his home station as provided by law.
(c) Services of the supervising officer, to be calculated at the rate of a GS 11, step 1 employee, except that such services performed by a customs officer and subject to the provisions of the Act of February 13, 1911, as amended (sec. 5, 36 Stat. 901 as amended; 19 U.S.C. 267), shall be calculated as provided in that Act.
(d) Services of the analyst, to be calculated at the rate of a GS 12, step 1 employee (which shall include the use of the chemical laboratories and equipment of the Consumer Product Safety Commission).

# Source:
44 FR 34903, June 15, 1979, unless otherwise noted.
§ 1501.1
Purpose.
Section 1500.18(a)(9) of this chapter classifies as a banned hazardous substance any toy or other article intended for use by children under 3 years of age that presents a choking, aspiration, or ingestion hazard because of small parts. This part 1501 describes certain articles that are subject to § 1500.18(a)(9); lists certain articles that are specifically exempted; and provides a test method for determining whether an article is hazardous to children under 3 because it, or one of its components that can be detached or broken off during normal or reasonable foreseeable use, is too small.
§ 1501.2
Scope.
(a) This regulation (§ 1500.18(a)(9) and the criteria described in § 1501.4 below) applies to all toys and other articles intended for use by children under 3 years (36 months) of age that are introduced into interstate commerce after
the effective date. Such articles include, but are not to limited to: squeeze toys; teethers; crib exercisers; crib gyms; crib mobiles; other toys or articles intended to be affixed to a crib, stroller, playpen, or baby carriage; pull and push toys; pounding toys; blocks and stacking sets; bathtub, wading pool and sand toys; rocking, spring, and stick horses and other figures; chime and musical balls and carousels; jacks-in-the-box; stuffed, plush, and flocked animals and other figures; preschool toys, games and puzzles intended for use by children under 3; riding toys intended for use by children under 3; infant and juvenile furniture articles which are intended for use by children under 3 such as cribs, playpens, baby bouncers and walkers, strollers and carriages; dolls which are intended for use by children under 3 such as baby dolls, rag dolls, and bean bag dolls; toy cars, trucks, and other vehicles intended for use by children under 3. In addition, such articles include any other toys or articles which are intended, marketed or labeled to be entrusted to or used by children under 3 years of age.
(b) In determining which toys and other articles are intended for use by children under 3 years (36 months) of age, for purposes of this regulation, the following factors are relevant: the manufacturer's stated intent (such as on a label) if it is a reasonable one; the advertising, promotion, and marketing of the article; and whether the article is commonly recognized as being intended for children under 3.
(c) This regulation does not apply to toys or articles which are solely intended for use by children 3 years of age or older. In addition, it does not apply to all articles to which children under 3 years of age might have access simply because of presence in a household. Certain articles which are specifically exempted from this regulation are listed in § 1501.3 below.
§ 1501.3
Exemptions.
The following articles are exempt from this regulation (§§ 1500.18(a)(9) and 1501.4 below):
(a) Balloons;
(b) Books and other articles made of paper;
(c) Writing materials such as crayons, chalk, pencils, and pens;
(d) Children's clothing and accessories, such as shoe lace holders and buttons;
(e) Grooming, feeding, and hygiene products, such as diaper pins and clips, barrettes, toothbrushes, drinking glasses, dishes and eating utensils;
(f) Phonograph records;
(g) Modeling clay and similar products;
(h) Fingerpaints, watercolors, and other paint sets;
(i) Rattles (as defined at 16 CFR 1510.2); and
(j) Pacifiers (as defined at 16 CFR 1511.2(a)).
§ 1501.4
Size requirements and test procedure.
(a) No toy or other children's article subject to § 1500.18(a)(9) and to this part 1501 shall be small enough to fit entirely within a cylinder with the dimensions shown in Figure 1, when tested in accordance with the procedure in paragraph (b) of this section. In testing to ensure compliance with this regulation, the dimensions of the Commission's test cylinder will be no greater than those shown in Figure 1. (In addition, for compliance purposes, the English dimensions shall be used. The metric approximations are included only for convenience.)
(b)(1) Place the article, without compressing it, into the cylinder. If the article fits entirely within the cylinder, in any orientation, it fails to comply with the test procedure. (Test any detached components of the article the same way.)
(2) If the article does not fit entirely within the cylinder, subject it to the appropriate “use and abuse” tests of 16 CFR 1500.51 and 1500.52 (excluding the bite tests of §§ 1500.51(c) and 1500.52(c)). Any components or pieces (excluding paper, fabric, yarn, fuzz, elastic, and string) which have become detached from the article as a result of the use and abuse testing shall be placed into the cylinder, one at a time. If any such components or pieces fit entirely within the cylinder, in any orientation and without being compressed, the article fails to comply with the test procedure.
EC03OC91.060
§ 1501.5
Enforcement procedure.
The Commission will enforce this regulation, unless it determines that an emergency situation exists, only in accordance with Chapter 2, Guide 2.05—Letter of Advice/Notices of Noncompliance of the CPSC Enforcement Policy
and Procedural Guides, issued in January 1990 and available from the Office of the Secretary, Consumer Product Safety Commission, Washington, DC 20207. Under the procedure described in this chapter, firms must be informed by letter that they or their products may be the subject of enforcement action and must be provided ten days within which to submit evidence and arguments that the products are not violative or are not covered by the regulation, prior to the initiation of enforcement action by the Commission or by its delegated staff member. The function of approving such enforcement actions is currently delegated by the Commission to the Assistant Executive Director for Compliance and Enforcement (copies of the existing delegation documents are also available from the CPSC's Office of the Secretary).

The procedures in this part apply when—
(a) A person has a right to an opportunity for a hearing under sections 2(q)(1)(B) or 3(a) of the Federal Hazardous Substances Act (“FHSA”) and 701(e) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”) (15 U.S.C. 1261(q)(1)(B) and 1262(a), and 21 U.S.C. 371(e));
(b) The Commission elects to hold a hearing under section 3(e)(1) of the FHSA or section 5 of the Poison Prevention Packaging Act (“PPPA”) and section 701(e) of the FDCA (15 U.S.C. 1262(e)(1) and 1474(a), and 21 U.S.C. 371(e)); or
(c) The Commission concludes that it is in the public interest to hold a formal evidentiary public hearing on any matter before it in such a proceeding.
§ 1502.2
Computation of time periods.
Whenever a time period for taking action is specified by these procedures, by the presiding officer, or by the Commission, Saturdays, Sundays, and Federal holidays are included in computing time. However, if the last day for taking such action falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal holiday, the action shall be timely if taken on or before the next Federal Government business day.

[56 FR 9278, Mar. 6, 1991, as amended at 62 FR 46667, Sept. 4, 1997]

# Subpart B—Initiation of Proceedings
§ 1502.5
Initiation of a hearing involving the issuance, amendment, or revocation of a regulation.
(a) The
Federal Register
notice promulgating the final regulation will describe how to submit objections and requests for hearing.
(b) On or before the 30th day after the date of publication of a final regulation in the
Federal Register,
a person may file written objections, with or without a request for a hearing, with the Commission. The 30-day period may not be extended, except that additional information supporting an objection may be received after 30 days upon a showing of inadvertent omission or for other good cause shown, if consideration of the additional information will not delay review of the objection and request for hearing.
§ 1502.6
Filing objections and requests for a hearing on a regulation.
(a) Objections and requests for a hearing under § 1502.5(a) must be filed with the Office of the Secretary and will be accepted for filing if they meet the following conditions:
(1) They are submitted within the time specified in § 1502.5(b).
(2) Each objection is separately numbered.
(3) Each objection specifies with particularity the provision(s) of the regulation to which that objection is directed.
(4) Each objection on which a hearing is requested specifically requests a hearing. Failure to request a hearing on an objection constitutes a waiver of the right to a hearing on that objection.
(5) Each objection for which a hearing is requested includes a detailed description of the basis for the objection and the factual information or analysis in support thereof. Failure to include a
description and analysis for an objection constitutes a waiver of the right to a hearing on that objection. The description and analysis may be used only for the purpose of determining whether a hearing has been justified under § 1502.8, and do not limit the evidence that may be presented if a hearing is granted.
(i) A copy of any report, article, survey, or other written document relied upon must be submitted, unless the document is—
(A) A CPSC document that is routinely publicly available; or
(B) A recognized medical or scientific textbook or journal in the public domain.
(ii) A summary of the non-documentary testimony to be presented by any witnesses relied upon must be submitted.
(b) If an objection or request for a public hearing fails to meet the requirements of this section the Office of the General Counsel shall notify the Office of the Secretary of the deficiency. The Office of the Secretary shall return it with a copy of the applicable regulations, indicating those provisions not complied with. A deficient objection or request for a hearing may be supplemented and subsequently filed if submitted within the 30-day time period specified in § 1502.5(b).
(c) If another person objects to a regulation issued in response to a petition, the petitioner may submit a written reply to the Office of the Secretary on or before the 15th day after the last day for filing objections.
§ 1502.7
Notice of filing of objections.
As soon as practicable after the expiration of the time for filing objections to and requests for hearing on agency action involving the issuance, amendment, or revocation of a regulation under the FHSA or the PPPA and section 701(e) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the Commission shall publish a notice in the
Federal Register
specifying those parts of the regulation that have been stayed by the filing of proper objections and, if no objections have been filed, stating that fact. The notice does not constitute a determination that a hearing is justified on any objections or requests for hearing that have been filed. When to do so will cause no undue delay, the notice required by this section may be combined with the notices described in §§ 1502.10 and 1502.13.
§ 1502.8
Ruling on objections and requests for hearing.
(a) As soon as practicable, the Commission will review all objections and requests for hearing filed under § 1502.6 and determine—
(1) Whether the regulation should be modified or revoked under § 1502.9; and
(2) Whether a hearing has been justified.
(b) A request for a hearing will be granted if the material submitted shows the following:
(1) There is a genuine and substantial issue of fact for resolution at a hearing. A hearing will not be granted on issues of policy or law.
(2) The factual issue can be resolved by available and specifically identified reliable evidence. A hearing will not be granted on the basis of mere allegations or denials or general descriptions of positions and contentions.
(3) The data and information submitted, if established at a hearing, would be adequate to justify resolution of the factual issue in the way sought by the person. A hearing will be denied if the Commission concludes that the data and information submitted, even though accurate, are insufficient to justify the factual determination urged.
(4) Resolution of the factual issue in the way sought by the person is adequate to justify the action requested. A hearing will not be granted on factual issues that are not determinative with respect to the action requested, e.g., if the Commission concludes that the Commission's action would be the same even if the factual issue were resolved in the way sought, or if a request is made that a final regulation include a provision not reasonably encompassed by the proposal.
(5) The action requested is not inconsistent with any provision in the FHSA or any regulation in 16 CFR subchapter C explaining or particularizing the requirements of the FHSA.
(6) The requirements in other applicable regulations, and in the notice
promulgating the final regulation or the notice of opportunity for hearing are met.
(c) In making the determinations specified in paragraph (a) of this section, the Commission may issue an appropriate order on the determinations without further notice or opportunity for comment from interested parties. However, the Commission, at its option, may use the procedure specified in 16 CFR part 1052 or any other applicable public procedure available to it.
(d) If it is uncertain whether a hearing has been justified under the principles in paragraph (b) of this section, and the Commission concludes that summary decision against the person requesting a hearing should be considered, the Commission may serve upon the person by registered mail a proposed order denying a hearing. The person has 30 days after receipt of the proposed order to demonstrate that the submission justifies a hearing.
§ 1502.9
Modification or revocation of regulation or order.
If, upon review of an objection or request for hearing, the Commission determines that the regulation should be modified or revoked, the Commission will promptly take such action by notice in the
Federal Register.
Further objections to or requests for hearing on the modification or revocation may be submitted under §§ 1502.5 and 1502.6, but no further issue may be taken with other provisions in the regulation. Objections and requests for hearing that are not affected by the modification or revocation will remain on file and be acted upon in due course.
§ 1502.10
Denial of hearing in whole or in part.
(a) If the Commission determines upon review of the objections or requests for hearing that a hearing is not justified, in whole or in part, a notice of the determination will be published in the
Federal Register.
(b) The notice will state whether the hearing is denied in whole or in part. If the hearing is denied in part, the notice will be combined with the notice of hearing required by § 1502.13, and will specify the objections and requests for hearing that have been granted and denied.
(c) Any denial will be explained. A denial based on an analysis of the information submitted to justify a hearing will explain the inadequacy of the information.
(d) The notice will confirm, modify, or stay the effective date of the regulation involved.
(e) The record of the administrative proceeding relating to denial in whole or in part of a public hearing on an objection or request for hearing consists of the following:
(1) The entire rulemaking record;
(2) The objections and requests for hearing filed by the Office of the Secretary; and
(3) The notice denying a formal evidentiary public hearing.
(f) The record specified in paragraph (e) of this section is the exclusive record for the Commission's decision on the complete or partial denial of a hearing. The record of the proceeding will be closed as of the date of the Commission's decision denying a hearing, unless another date is specified. A person who requested and was denied a hearing may submit a petition for reconsideration or a petition for stay of the Commission's action. A person who wishes to rely upon information or views not included in the administrative record shall submit them to the Commission with a petition to modify the final regulation.
(g) Denial of a request for a hearing in whole or in part is final agency action reviewable in the courts, under the statutory provisions governing the matter involved, as of the date of publication of the denial in the
Federal Register.
(1) Before requesting a court for a stay of the Commission's action pending judicial review, a person shall first submit a petition to the Commission for a stay of action.
(2) The time for filing a petition for judicial review of a denial of a hearing on an objection or issue begins on the date the denial is published in the
Federal Register.
The failure to file a petition for judicial review within the period established in the statutory provision governing the matter involved
constitutes a waiver of the right to judicial review of the objection or issue, regardless whether a hearing has been granted on other objections and issues.
§ 1502.11

(a) A person with a right to submit objections and a request for hearing under § 1502.5(a) may submit objections and waive the right to a hearing. The waiver may be either an explicit statement, or a failure to request a hearing, as provided in § 1502.6(a)(4).
(b) If a person waives the right to a hearing, the Commission will rule upon the person's objections under §§ 1502.8 through 1502.10. As a matter of discretion, the Commission may also order a hearing on the matter.

[56 FR 9278, Mar. 6, 1991, as amended at 62 FR 46667, Sept. 4, 1997]
§ 1502.17
Advice on public participation in hearings.
(a) All inquiries from the public about scheduling, location, and general procedures should be addressed to the Office of the Secretary, Consumer Product Safety Commission, Washington, DC 20207, or telephone (301) 504-0800.
(b) Requests by hearing participants for changes in the schedule of a hearing or for filing documents, briefs, or other pleadings should be made in writing directly to the presiding officer.
(c) Under no circumstances will the Office of the General Counsel of CPSC directly provide advice about a hearing to any person who is participating or may participate in the hearing. In every hearing, certain attorneys in the office are designated to represent the staff. Other members of the office, ordinarily including the General Counsel, are designated to advise the Commission on a final decision in the matter. It is not compatible with these functions, nor would it be professionally responsible, for the attorneys in the Office of the General Counsel also to advise other participants in a hearing, or for any attorney who may be called on to advise the Commission to respond to inquiries from other participants in the hearing; such participants may be urging views contrary to those of the staff involved or to what may ultimately be the final conclusions of the Commission. Accordingly, members of the Office of the General Counsel, other than the attorneys responsible for representing the staff, will not answer questions about the hearing from any participant or potential participant.
(d) Participants in a hearing may communicate with the attorneys responsible for representing the staff, in the same way that they may communicate with counsel for any other party in interest about the presentation of matters at the hearing. It would be inappropriate to bar discussion of such matters as stipulations of fact, joint presentation of witnesses, or possible settlement of hearing issues. Members of the public, including participants at hearings, are advised, however, that all such communications, including those by telephone, will be recorded in memoranda that can be filed with the Office of the Secretary.
(e) Separation of functions and
ex parte
communications will be handled as follows.
(1) An interested person may meet or correspond with any CPSC representative concerning a matter prior to publication of a notice announcing a formal evidentiary public hearing on the matter. The provisions of 16 CFR part 1012 apply to such meetings.
(2) Upon publication of a notice announcing a formal evidentiary public hearing, the following rules concerning separation of functions apply:
(i) The CPSC staff members responsible for preparing evidence and participating in the hearing in the matter are, as a party to the hearing, responsible for all investigative functions and for presentation of the position of the staff at the hearing and in any pleading or oral argument before the Commission. These representatives of the staff may not participate or advise in any decision except as witnesses or counsel in public proceedings. Except as provided herein, there shall be no other communication between representatives of the staff and representatives of the various Commissioners' offices concerning the matter prior to the decision of the Commission. The Commission may, however, designate other representatives of the staff to advise the Commission. The designation will be in writing and filed with the Office
of the Secretary no later than the time specified in paragraph (f)(2) of this section for the application of separation of functions. All employees of the CPSC other than representatives of the involved staff (except for those specifically designated otherwise) may be called upon to advise and participate with the offices of the Commissioners in their functions relating to the hearing and the final decision.
(ii) The General Counsel of CPSC shall designate members of the Office of the General Counsel to advise and participate with the staff in its functions in the hearing and shall designate other members of the Office of the General Counsel to advise the offices of the Commissioners in their functions related to the hearing and the final decision. The members of the Office of the General Counsel designated to advise the staff may not participate or advise in any decision of the Commission except as counsel in public proceedings. The designation shall be in the form of a memorandum filed with the Office of the Secretary and made a part of the administrative record in the proceeding. There may be no other communication between those members of the Office of the General Counsel designated to advise the offices of the Commissioners and any other person in the Office of the General Counsel or in the involved staff with respect to the matter prior to the decision of the Commission. The General Counsel may assign different attorneys to advise either the staff or the offices of the Commissioners at any stage of the proceedings. The General Counsel will ordinarily advise and participate with the offices of the Commissioners in their functions relating to the hearing and the final decision.
(iii) The Commissioners are responsible for the agency review and final decision of the matter, with the advice and participation of anyone in CPSC other than representatives of the responsible staff and those members of the Office of the General Counsel designated to assist in the staff functions in the hearing.
(iv) Between the date that separation of functions applies and the date of the Commission's decision on the matter, communication concerning the matter involved in the hearing will be restricted as follows:
(A) No person outside CPSC may have an
ex parte
communication with the presiding officer or any person representing the offices of the Commissioners concerning the matter in the hearing. Neither the presiding officer nor any person representing the offices of the Commissioners may have any
ex parte
communications with a person outside CPSC concerning the matter in the hearing. All communications are to be public communications, as witness or counsel under the applicable procedures.
(B) A participant in the hearing may submit a written communication concerning a proposal for settlement to the presiding officer with a request that it be transmitted to the Commission. These communications are to be in the form of pleadings, served on all other participants, and filed with the Office of the Secretary like any other pleading.
(C) A written communication contrary to this section must be immediately served on all other participants and filed with the Office of the Secretary by the presiding officer at the hearing, or by the Commissioner, depending on who received the communication. An oral communication contrary to this section must be immediately recorded in a written memorandum and similarly served on all other participants and filed with the Office of the Secretary. A person, including a representative of a participant in the hearing, who is involved in an oral communication contrary to this section, must, if possible, be made available for cross-examination during the hearing with respect to the substance of that conversation. Rebuttal testimony pertinent to a written or oral communication contrary to this section will be permitted. Cross-examination and rebuttal testimony will be transcribed and filed with the Office of the Secretary.
(D) The making of a communication contrary to this section may, consistent with the interests of justice and the policy of the underlying statute,
result in a decision adverse to the person knowingly making or causing the making of such a communication.

(c) Submissions required by paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section may be supplemented later in the proceeding, with the approval of the presiding officer, upon a showing that the material in the supplement was not reasonably known or available when the submission was made, that the relevance of the material contained in the supplement could not reasonably have been foreseen, or that admission of the material in the supplement is necessary for a fair determination of the issues involved in the hearing.
(d) A participant's failure to comply substantially and in good faith with this section constitutes a waiver of the right to participate further in the hearing; failure of a party to comply constitutes a waiver of the right to a hearing.
(e) Participants may reference each other's submissions. To reduce duplicative submissions, participants are encouraged to exchange and consolidate lists of documentary evidence. If a particular document is bulky or in limited supply and cannot reasonably be reproduced, and it constitutes relevant evidence, the presiding officer may authorize submission of a reduced number of copies.
(f) The presiding officer will rule on questions relating to this section.
§ 1502.26
Purpose; oral and written testimony; burden of proof.
(a) The objective of a formal evidentiary hearing is the fair determination of relevant facts consistent with the right of all interested persons to participate and the public interest in promptly settling controversial matters affecting the public health and welfare.
(b) Accordingly, the evidence at a hearing is to be developed to the maximum extent through written submissions, including written direct testimony, which may be in narrative or in question-and-answer form.
(1) Direct testimony will be submitted in writing, except on a showing that written direct testimony is insufficient for a full and true disclosure of relevant facts and that the participant will be prejudiced if unable to present oral direct testimony. If the proceeding involves particular issues, each party may determine whether, and the extent to which, each wishes to present direct testimony orally or in writing.
(2) Oral cross-examination of witnesses will be permitted if it appears that alternative means of developing the evidence are insufficient for a full and true disclosure of the facts and that the party requesting oral cross-examination will be prejudiced by denial of the request or that oral cross-examination is the most effective and efficient means to clarify the matters at issue.
(3) Witnesses shall give testimony under oath.
(c) A participant who proposes to substitute a new provision for a provision objected to has the burden of proof in relation to the new provision.

§ 1502.28
Conduct at oral hearings or conferences.
All participants in a hearing will conduct themselves with dignity and observe judicial standards of practice and ethics. They may not indulge in personal attacks, unseemly wrangling, or intemperate accusations or characterizations. Representatives of parties shall, to the extent possible, restrain clients from improprieties in connection with any proceeding. Disrespectful, disorderly, or contumacious language or conduct, refusal to comply with directions, use of dilatory tactics, or refusal to adhere to reasonable standards of orderly and ethical conduct during any hearing shall constitute grounds for immediate exclusion from the proceeding by the presiding officer.
§ 1502.29
Time and place of prehearing conference.
A prehearing conference will commence at the date, time, and place announced in the notice of hearing, or in a later notice, or as specified by the presiding officer in a notice modifying a prior notice. At the prehearing conference, insofar as practicable at that time, the presiding officer will establish the methods and procedures to be used in developing the evidence, determine reasonable time periods for the conduct of the hearing, and designate the times and places for the production of witnesses for direct and cross-examination, if leave to conduct oral examination is granted on any issue.
§ 1502.30
Prehearing conference procedure.
(a) Participants in a hearing are to appear at the prehearing conference
prepared to discuss and resolve all matters specified in paragraph (b) of this section.
(1) To expedite the hearing, participants are encouraged to prepare in advance for the prehearing conference. Participants should cooperate with each other, and should request information and begin preparation of testimony at the earliest possible time. Failure of a participant to appear at the prehearing conference or to raise matters that reasonably could be anticipated and resolved at that time will not delay the progress of the hearing and constitutes a waiver of the rights of the participant regarding such matters as objections to the agreements reached, actions taken, or rulings issued by the presiding officer at or as a result of the prehearing conference and may be grounds for striking the participation under § 1502.16.
(2) Participants shall bring to the prehearing conference the following specific information, which will be filed with the Office of the Secretary under § 1502.23:
(i) Any additional information desired to supplement the submission filed under § 1502.25; the supplement may be filed if approved under § 1502.25.
(ii) A list of all witnesses whose testimony will be offered, orally or in writing, at the hearing, with a full curriculum vitae for each. Additional witnesses may be identified later, with the approval of the presiding officer, on a showing that the witness was not reasonably available at the time of the prehearing conference, that the relevance of the witness's views could not reasonably have been foreseen at that time, or for other good cause shown, as where a previously identified witness is unforeseeably unable to testify.
(iii) All prior written statements, including articles and any written statement signed or adopted, or a recording or transcription of an oral statement made, by persons identified as witnesses if—
(A) The statement is available without making a request to the witness;
(B) The statement relates to the subject matter of the witness's testimony; and
(C) The statement either was made before the time the person agreed to become a witness or has been made publicly available by the person.
(b) The presiding officer will conduct a prehearing conference for the following purposes:
(1) To determine the areas of factual disagreement to be considered at the hearing. The presiding officer may hold conferences off the record in an effort to reach agreement on disputed factual questions, subject to the
ex parte
limitations in § 1502.17(f).
(2) To identify the most appropriate techniques for developing evidence on issues in controversy and the manner and sequence in which they will be used, including, where oral examination is to be conducted, the sequence in which witnesses will be produced for, and the time and place of, oral examination. The presiding officer may consider, but is not limited to, the following techniques.
(i) Submission of narrative statements of position on factual issues in controversy.
(ii) Submission of evidence or identification of previously submitted evidence to support such statements, such as affidavits, verified statements of fact, data, studies, and reports.
(iii) Exchange of written interrogatories directed to particular witnesses.
(iv) Written requests for the production of additional documentation, data, or other relevant information.
(v) Submission of written questions to be asked by the presiding officer of a specific witness.
(vi) Identification of facts for which oral examination and/or cross-examination is appropriate.
(3) To group participants with substantially like interests for presenting evidence, making motions and objections, including motions for summary decision, filing briefs, and presenting oral argument.
(4) To hear and rule on objections to admitting information submitted under § 1502.25 into evidence.
(5) To obtain stipulations and admissions of facts.
(6) To take other action that may expedite the hearing.
(c) The presiding officer shall issue, orally or in writing, a prehearing order
reciting the actions taken at the prehearing conference and setting forth the schedule for the hearing. The order will control the subsequent course of the hearing unless modified by the presiding officer for good cause.
§ 1502.31
Summary decisions.
(a) After the hearing commences, a participant may move, with or without supporting affidavits, for a summary decision on any issue in the hearing. Any other participant may, within 10 days after service of the motion, which time may be extended for an additional 10 days for good cause, serve opposing affidavits or countermove for summary decision. The presiding officer may set the matter for argument and call for the submission of briefs.
(b) The presiding officer will grant the motion if the objections, requests for hearing, other pleadings, affidavits, and other material filed in connection with the hearing, or matters officially noticed, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that a participant is entitled to summary decision.
(c) Affidavits should set forth facts that would be admissible in evidence and show affirmatively that the affiant is competent to testify to the matters stated. When a properly supported motion for summary decision is made, a participant opposing the motion may not rest upon mere allegations or denials or general descriptions of positions and contentions; affidavits or other responses must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue of fact for the hearing.
(d) Should it appear from the affidavits of a participant opposing the motion that for sound reasons stated, facts essential to justify the opposition cannot be presented by affidavit, the presiding officer may deny the motion for summary decision, allow additional time to permit affidavits or additional evidence to be obtained, or issue other just order.
(e) If on motion under this section a summary decision is not rendered upon the whole case or for all the relief asked, and evidentiary facts need to be developed, the presiding officer will issue an order specifying the facts that appear without substantial controversy and directing further evidentiary proceedings. The facts so specified will be deemed established.
(f) A participant submitting or opposing a motion for summary decision may obtain interlocutory review by the Commission of a summary decision of the presiding officer.
§ 1502.32
Receipt of evidence.
(a) A hearing consists of the development of evidence and the resolution of factual issues as set forth in this subpart and in the prehearing order.
(b) All orders, transcripts, written statements of position, written direct testimony, written interrogatories and responses, and any other written material submitted in the proceeding comprise the administrative record of the hearing, and will be promptly placed on public display in the Office of the Secretary, except as ordered by the presiding officer.
(c) Written evidence, identified as such, is admissible unless a participant objects and the presiding officer excludes it on objection of a participant or on the presiding officer's own initiative.
(1) The presiding officer may exclude written evidence as inadmissible only if—
(i) The evidence is irrelevant, immaterial, unreliable, or repetitive;
(ii) Exclusion of part or all of the written evidence of a participant is necessary to enforce the requirements of this subpart; or
(iii) The evidence was not submitted as required by § 1502.25.
(2) Items of written evidence are to be submitted as separate documents, sequentially numbered, except that a voluminous document may be submitted in the form of a cross-reference to the documents filed under § 1502.25.
(3) Written evidence excluded by the presiding officer as inadmissible remains a part of the administrative record, as an offer of proof, for judicial review.
(d) Testimony, whether on direct or on cross-examination, is admissible as evidence unless a participant objects and the presiding officer excludes it.
(1) The presiding officer may exclude oral evidence as inadmissible only if—
(i) The evidence is irrelevant, immaterial, unreliable, or repetitive; or
(ii) Exclusion of part or all of the evidence is necessary to enforce the requirements of these procedures.
(2) If oral evidence is excluded as inadmissible, the participant may take written exception to the ruling in a brief to the Commission, without taking oral exception at the hearing. Upon review, the Commission may reopen the hearing to permit the evidence to be admitted if the Commission determines that its exclusion was erroneous and prejudicial.
(e) The presiding officer may schedule conferences as needed to monitor the progress of the hearing, narrow and simplify the issues, and consider and rule on motions, requests, and other matters concerning the development of the evidence.
(f) The presiding officer will conduct such proceedings as are necessary for the taking of oral testimony, for the oral examination of witnesses by the presiding officer on the basis of written questions previously submitted by the parties, and for the conduct of cross-examination of witnesses by the parties. The presiding officer shall exclude irrelevant or repetitious written questions and limit oral cross-examination to prevent irrelevant or repetitious examination.
(g) The presiding officer shall order the proceedings closed for the taking of oral testimony relating only to trade secrets and privileged or confidential commercial or financial information. Participation in closed proceedings will be limited to the witness, the witness's counsel, and Federal Government employees.
§ 1502.33

Type 2: More than 0.0005 but not more than 0.0045 (e.g., glass).
Type 3: More than 0.0001 but not more than 0.0005 (e.g., most plastics).
Type 4: 0.0001 or less (e.g., future polymeric materials).
The thermal inertia of a material can be obtained by multiplying the thermal conductivity (cal./em./sec./degrees C.) by the density (gm./cm.
3
) by the specific heat (cal./gm./degrees C.)
(3)
Lamp hazards
—(i)
Replaceable incandescent lamps.
A toy with one or more replaceable incandescent lamps, having a potential difference of more than 30 volts r.m.s. (42.4 volts peak) between any of its electrodes or lampholder contacts and any other part or ground, shall be marked inside the lamp compartment where readily noticeable during lamp replacement with the statement: “WARNING—Do
not use light bulbs larger than __ watts”, the blank being filled in by the manufacturer with a number specifying the wattage rating of the lamp. Such toys shall bear the statement: “WARNING—Shock Hazard. Pull plug before changing light bulb” on the outside of the lamp compartment where it will be readily noticed before gaining access to the lamp compartment.
(ii)
Nonreplacement incandescent lamps.
A toy which utilizes one or more nonreplaceable incandescent lamps (other than pilot or indicator lamps) shall be marked where clearly visible with the statement: “SEALED UNIT—Do not attempt to change light bulb” or equivalent.
(4)
Water.
If not suitable for immersion in water, a toy cooking appliance (such as a corn popper, skillet, or candy-maker) or other article which may conceivably be immersed in water shall be marked with the statement: “DANGER—To prevent electric shock, do not immerse in water; wipe clean with damp cloth” or equivalent.
[38 FR 27032, Sept. 27, 1973, as amended at 42 FR 34280, July 5, 1977; 42 FR 43392, Aug. 29, 1977]
§ 1505.4
Manufacturing requirements.
(a)
General.
(1) Only materials safe and suitable for the particular use for which the electrically operated toy is intended shall be employed.
(2) Toys shall be produced in accordance with detailed material specifications, production specifications, and quality assurance programs. Quality assurance programs shall be established and maintained by each manufacturer to assure compliance with all requirements of this part.
(3) The manufacturer or importer shall keep and maintain for 3 years after production or importation of each lot of toys (i) the material and production specifications and the description of the quality assurance program required by paragraph (a)(2) of this section, (ii) the results of all inspections and tests conducted, and (iii) records of sale and distribution. These records shall be made available upon request at reasonable times to any officer or employee of the Consumer Product Safety Commission. The manufacturer or importer shall permit such officer or employee to inspect and copy such records, to make such inventories of stock as he deems necessary, and to otherwise verify the accuracy of such records.
(4) Toys shall be constructed and finished with a high degree of uniformity and as fine a grade of workmanship as is practicable in a well-equipped manufacturing establishment. Each component of a toy shall comply with the requirements set forth in this part.
(b) [Reserved]
(c)
Protective coatings.
Iron and steel parts shall be suitably protected against corrosion if the lack of a protective coating would likely produce a hazardous condition in normal use or when the toy is subjected to reasonably foreseeable damage or abuse.
(d)
Mechanical assembly
—(1)
General.
A toy shall be designed and constructed to have the strength and rigidity necessary to withstand reasonably foreseeable damage and abuse without producing or increasing a shock, fire, or other accident hazard. An increase in hazards may be due to total or partial structural collapse of the toy resulting in a reduction of critical spacings, loosening or displacement of one or more components, or other serious defects.
(2)
Mounting.
Each switch, lampholder, motor, automatic control, transformer, and similar component shall be securely mounted and shall be prevented from turning, unless the turning of such component is part of the design of the toy and produces no additional hazard such as reduced spacings below acceptable levels or stress on the connection. Friction between tight-fitting surfaces shall not be considered sufficient for preventing the turning of components. The proper use of a suitable lockwasher or a keyed and notched insert plus a suitable lockwasher for single-hole mountings shall be acceptable. Each toy shall be designed and constructed so that vibrations occurring during normal operation and after reasonably foreseeable damage or abuse will not affect it adversely. Brush caps shall be tightly threaded or otherwise designed to prevent loosening.
(3)
Structural integrity.
Heating elements shall be supported in a substantial and reliable manner and shall be structurally prevented from making contacts inside or outside of the toy which may produce shock hazards. The current-carrying component(s) of the heating element shall be enclosed, and the enclosure shall be designed or insulated to prevent the development of a shock or fire hazard that may result from element failure. A toy operating with a gas or liquid under pressure, such as an electrically operated steam engine, shall be tested with respect to its explosion hazard and shall be provided with a pressure relief device that will discharge in the safest possible direction; that is, avoiding direct human contact and avoiding the wetting of electrical contacts.
(e)
Insulating material.
(1) Material to be used for mounting uninsulated live electrical elements shall be generally accepted as suitable for the specific application, particularly with regard to electrical insulation (voltage breakdown) and good aging characteristics (no significant change in insulating characteristics over the expected lifetime of the toy).
(2) Material used to insulate a heating element from neighboring parts shall be suitable for the purpose. If plain asbestos in a glass braid is used to so insulate the heating element, it shall be tightly packed and totally enclosed by the braid, and the overall thickness, including the braid, shall not be less than one-sixteenth inch. Hard fiber may be used for electrically insulating bushings, washers, separators, and barriers, but is not sufficient as the sole support of uninsulated live metal parts.
(f)
Enclosures
—(1)
General.
Each toy shall have an enclosure constructed of protective material suitable for the particular application, for the express purpose of housing all electrical parts that may present a fire, shock, or other accident hazard under any conditions of normal use or reasonably foreseeable damage or abuse. Enclosures shall meet the performance requirements prescribed by § 1505.6(b).
(2)
Accessibility.
An enclosure containing a wire, splice, brush cap, connection, electrical component, or uninsulated live part or parts at a potential of more than 30 volts r.m.s. (42.4 volts peak) to any other part or to ground:
(i) Shall be sealed by welding, riveting, adhesive bonding, and/or by special screws or other fasteners not removable with a common household tool (screwdriver, pliers, or other similar household tool) used as intended; and
(ii) Shall have no opening permitting entry of a 0.010-inch-diameter music wire that could contact a live part. Cross-notch-head screws, spring clips, bent tabs, and similar fasteners shall not be considered suitable sealing devices for enclosures since they are easy to remove with common household tools. Bent tabs shall be acceptable if, due to metal thickness or other factors, they successfully resist forceful attempts to dislodge them with ordinary tools.
(3)
Nonapplication.
The requirements of this paragraph are not applicable to an insulating husk enclosure or equivalent that covers the electrodes of a replaceable incandescent lamp and its lampholder contacts. The primary function of an enclosure containing a lamp shall be to protect it from breakage during normal use or reasonably foreseeable damage or abuse.
(g)
Spacings.
The distance, through air or across the surface of an insulator, between uninsulated live metal parts and a metallic enclosure and between uninsulated live metal parts and all other metal parts shall be suitable for the specific application as determined by the dielectric strength requirements prescribed by § 1505.6(e)(2). Electrical insulating linings on barriers shall be held securely in place.
(h)
Special safety features
—(1)
Moving parts.
If the normal use of a toy involves accident hazards, suitable protection shall be provided for the reduction of such hazards to an acceptable minimum. For example, rotors, pulleys, belting, gearing, and other moving parts shall be enclosed or guarded to prevent accidental contact during normal use or when subjected to reasonably foreseeable damage or abuse. Such enclosure or guard shall not contain openings that permit entrance of a
1/4
-inch-diameter rod and present a hazardous condition.
(2)
Switch marking.
Any toy having one or more moving parts which perform an inherent function of the toy and which may cause personal injury shall have a switch that can deenergize the toy by a simple movement to a plainly marked “OFF” position. Momentary contact switches which are normally in the “OFF” position need not be so marked.
(3)
Electrically operated sewing machines.
Electrically operated toy sewing machines shall be designed and constructed to eliminate the possibility of a child's finger(s) being pierced by a needle. For the purpose of this paragraph, a clearance of not more than five thirty-seconds of an inch below the point of the needle when in its uppermost position or below the presser foot, if provided, shall be considered satisfactory.
(4)
Pressure relief valves.
A pressurized enclosure shall have an automatic pressure relief device and shall be capable of withstanding hydrostatic pressure equal to at least five times the relief pressure.
(5)
Containers for heated materials.
Containers intended for holding molten compounds and hot liquids shall be designed and constructed to minimize accidental spillage. A pot or pan having a lip and one or more properly located pouring spouts and an adequately thermally insulated handle may provide satisfactory protection. Containers intended solely for baking need not be designed and constructed to minimize accidental spillage. Containers shall be of such material and construction t + at they will not deform or melt when subjected to the maximum operating temperature occurring during normal use or after reasonably foreseeable damage or abuse.
(6)
Water.
Electrically operated toys (such as toy irons) shall not be designed or manufactured to be used with water except for toy steam engines or other devices in which the electrical components are separate from the water reservoir and are completely contained in a sealed chamber. Toys requiring occasional or repeated cleaning with a wet cloth shall be constructed to prevent seepage of water into any electrically active area that may produce a hazardous condition.
§ 1505.5
Electrical design and construction.
(a)
Switches.
(1) Switches and other control devices of electrically operated toys shall be suitable for the application and shall have a rating not less than that of the load they control (see § 1505.6(e)(5)(ii) regarding electrical switch overload). A switch that controls a replaceable incandescent lamp, electrode, or lampholder contact which is at a potential of more than 30 volts r.m.s. (42.4 volts peak) to any other part or to ground shall open both sides of the circuit and shall have a marked “OFF” position. A switch that may reasonably be expected to be subjected to temperatures higher than 50 °C. (122 °F.) shall be constructed of materials which are suitable for use at such temperatures.
(2) Switches shall be located and protected so that they are not subject to mechanical damage that would produce a hazard in normal use or from reasonably foreseeable damage or abuse (see § 1505.6(b)).
(b)
Lamps.
(1) A replaceable incandescent lamp having a voltage of more than 30 volts r.m.s. (42.4 volts peak) between any of its electrodes or lampholder contacts and any other part or ground shall be in an enclosure that has at least one door or cover permitting access to the lamp. Such door(s) or cover(s) of the enclosure shall be so designed and constructed that they cannot be opened manually or with a flat bladed screwdriver or pliers.
(2) With all access doors and covers closed, the lamp enclosure shall have no opening that will permit entry of a straight rod 6 inches long and one-fourth inch in diameter if such entry would present an electrical hazard. The lamp shall be located no less than one-half inch from any
1/4

§ 1505.6
Performance.
(a)
General.
Electrically operated toys and components thereof shall be tested by the appropriate methods described in this section and shall pass the tests in such a manner as to provide the necessary assurance that normal use and reasonably foreseeable damage or abuse will not produce a hazard or a potentially hazardous condition. The toy shall be capable of passing all applicable tests with any door, cover, handle, operable part, or accessory placed in any normal position. A toy shall not present a fire, casualty, or shock hazard when operated continuously for 6 hours under conditions of normal use and reasonably foreseeable damage or abuse, including the most hazardous position in which the toy can be left.
(b)
Enclosures.
For the purposes of this section, the term
enclosure
means any surface or surrounding structure which prevents access to a real or potential hazard. An enclosure shall withstand impact, compression, and pressure tests (see paragraphs (b)(1),
(2), and (3) of this section) without developing any openings above those specified, reduction of electrical spacings below those specified, or other fire, casualty, or shock hazards, including the loosening or displacement of components but excluding breakage of a lamp. After completion of each test, the toy shall comply with the requirements of the dielectric strength test described in paragraph (e)(2) of this section and, upon visual examination, shall not evidence the development of any hazards. Rupture of a fuse shall be considered a test failure.
(1)
Impact test.
A toy weighing 10 pounds or less shall be dropped four times from a height of 3 feet onto a 2
1/2
inch thick concrete slab covered with 0.125 inch nominal thickness vinyl title. The impact area shall be at least 3 square feet. The test shall be conducted while the toy is energized and operating and with all dead metal of the toy that may be energized connected together electrically and grounded through a 3-ampere plug fuse. The toy shall be dropped in random orientation. After each drop the test sample shall be allowed to come to rest and examined and evaluated before continuing.
(2)
Compression test.
Any area on the surface of the enclosure that is accessible to a child and inaccessible to flat-surface contact during the impact test shall be subjected to a direct force of 20 pounds for 1 minute. The force shall be applied over a period of 5 seconds through the axis of a
1/2
-inch-diameter metal rod having a flat end with the edge rounded to a radius of one thirty-seconds of an inch to eliminate sharp edges. The axis of the rod shall be perpendicular to the surface being tested. During the test the toy shall rest on a flat, hard surface in any test-convenient position.
(3)
Pressure test.
If any portion of the top of a toy has a flat surface measuring 24 square inches or more and a minor dimension of at least 3 inches, that surface shall be subjected to a direct vertical pressure increasing to 50 pounds over a period of 5 seconds and maintained for 1 minute. The force shall be applied through a steel ball 2 inches in diameter. During the test the toy shall be in an upright position on a flat, horizontal solid surface.
(c)
Handles and knobs
—(1)
General.
For the purposes of tests in this paragraph, the parts of a lifting handle on a toy that are within seven-sixteenths of an inch of the surface to which the handle is attached, or the parts of a lifting knob that are within one-fourth inch of the surface to which the knob is attached, are considered to be for support purposes, and the remainder of the handle or knob is considered to be generally functional in nature. A handle or knob shall withstand crushing and lifting tests (see paragraphs (c)(2) and (3) of this section) without fracture of the handle or knob, development of an opening that may pinch the hand, or breakage of the means used to fasten the handle or knob in place.
(2)
Crushing test.
The functional portion of a handle or knob shall be subjected to a crushign force increasing to 20 pounds over a period of 5 seconds and maintained for 1 minute. The force shall be applied through two flat and parallel hardwood blocks, each at least 2
1/2
inches thick and each having dimensions slightly exceeding those of the handle or knob being tested. The crushing force between the blocks shall be exerted in any direction perpendicular to the major axis of the handle or knob.
(3)
Lifting test.
The support portion of a handle or knob shall be subjected to a force equal to four times the weight of the object it is intended to support. The direction of the lifting force shall be as intended by the design of the toy and shall be applied through a
1/2
-inch-wide strap through or around a handle or by fingers or the equivalent on a knob. The force shall be applied over a period of 5 seconds through the center of gravity of the toy and maintained for 1 minute.
(d)
Stability.
A toy shall not overturn while resting in an upright position on a flat surface inclined 15° from horizontal. No spillage of molten material or hot liquids from containers shall occur while the toy is operating in this position under normal conditions of use. During this test, casters, if any, shall be in the position most likely to
result in tipping, but shall not be artificially held in one position to prevent a natural rotation to another position.
(e)
Electrical
—(1)
Power input.
The actual current flow in a toy without a heating element shall not exceed 110 percent of the rated value, and shall not exceed 5.5 amperes, at rated voltage. The power input to a toy with a heating element shall not exceed 105 percent of the rated value at rated voltage. The power input rating of a toy employing one or more incandescent lamps as the only power-consuming components shall be considered to be the total rated wattage of such lamps. The rated voltage shall be considered to be the mean value of a marked voltage range.
(2)
Dielectric strength.
(i) A toy shall be capable of withstanding without breakdown for 1 minute a 60-cycle-per-second (60 Hertz) essentially sinusoidal potential of 1,000 volts applied between live parts and any dead metal parts.
(ii) If a toy employs a low-voltage secondary winding (either in the form of a conventional transformer or as an insulated coil of a motor), the toy shall also be capable of withstanding without breakdown for 1 minute a sinusoidal test potential applied between the high-voltage and low-voltage windings. The test potential shall be applied at the rated frequency of the toy and shall have a value of 1,000 volts plus twice the rated voltage of the high-voltage winding. The test potential shall be supplied from a suitable capacity-testing transformer, the output voltage of which can be regulated. The waveform of the test voltage shall approximate a sine wave as closely as possible.
(iii) The applied test potential shall be increased rapidly and uniformly from zero until the required test value is reached and shall be held at that value for 1 minute. Unless otherwise specified, the toy shall be at the maximum operating temperature reached in normal use prior to conducting the tests.
(iv) The dielectric strength requirements of this subparagraph may also be determined by subjecting the toy to a 60-cycle-per-second (60 Hertz) essentially sinusoidal potential of 1,200 volts for 1 second. If the dielectric strength is determined by this method, the toy need not be in a heated condition.
(3)
Leakage current and repeated dielectric withstand tests.
(i) Both before and after being conditioned, a toy intended to operate from a source exceeding 42.4 volts peak shall:
(A) Not have a leakage current exceeding 0.5 milliampere, except that during the interval beginning 5 seconds and terminating 10 minutes after the toy is first energized, the leakage current of toys with heating elements other than lamps shall not exceed 2.5 milliamperes; and
(B) Comply with the requirements of a repeated dielectric withstand test both with and without preheating.
(ii) All accessible parts of a toy shall be tested for leakage current. If an insulating material is used for the enclosure or part of the enclosure, the leakage current shall be measured using a metal foil with an area not exceeding 10 by 20 centimeters in contact with accessible surfaces of such insulating material. Where the accessible surface of insulating material is less than 10 by 20 centimeters, the metal foil shall be the same size as the surface. The metal foil shall be so applied that it will not affect the temperature of the toy. The accessible parts shall be tested individually, collectively, and from one part to another.
(iii) Following the initial leakage current test, the toy shall be cooled down or heated up to 32 °C. (90 °F.). The toy shall then be conditioned for 48 hours in air at a temperature of 32° ±2 °C. (89.6° ±3.6 °F.) and with a relative humidity of 90-95 percent. The specified relative humidity shall be maintained inside a closed compartment in which a saturated solution of potassium sulphate is kept in a suitable container. Leakage current measurements shall be made, as specified in paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section and before the toy is energized, while the toy is in the humidity compartment.
(iv) With the connections intended for the source of supply connected thereto and then connected to the ungrounded side of a power supply circuit having a voltage equal to 110 percent of the rated voltage of the toy, the
leakage current through a noninductive 1,500-ohm resistor connected between the gounded side of the supply circuit and each dead metal part (accessible and inaccessible) shall, when stable, be measured in accordance with the test provisions established in ANSI Standard C 101.1-1971, “American National Standard for Leakage Current for Appliances,” approved November 17, 1970, which is incorporated by reference. Copies of this document are available from American National Standards Institute, 1430 Broadway, New York, New York 10018.

This incorporation by reference was approved by the Director of the Federal Register. These materials are incorporated as they exist in the edition which has been approved by the Director of the Federal Register and which has been filed with the Office of the Federal Register.
(v) For a toy whose outer enclosure consists wholly or partly of insulating material, the term
dead metal part
means metal foil tightly wrapped around the exterior of the enclosure in a manner that covers, but does not enter into, any enclosure openings.
(4)
Motor operation.
(i) A motor provided as part of a toy shall be capable of driving its maximum normal load in the toy without introducing any potentially hazardous condition. The performance of the toy shall be considered unacceptable if, during the test, temperatures in excess of those specified in § 1505.7 for Type D surfaces are attained on any accessible surface. The performance of the toy shall also be considered unacceptable if the rise in temperature during the test causes melting, scorching, embrittlement, or other evidence of thermal damage to the insulating material used to prevent exposure of live metal parts.
(ii) A motor-operated toy shall be tested with the motor stalled if the construction of the toy is such that any person can touch moving parts associated with the motor from outside the toy. The performance of the toy shall be considered unacceptable if, during the test, temperatures higher than those specified in § 1505.8 are attained or if temperatures higher than those specified for Type C surfaces in § 1505.7 are attained on any accessible surface of the motor. (See also § 1505.50.)
(5)
Overload
—(i)
Motor.
A motor-control switch that is a part of a toy shall be horsepower-rated to cover the load or shall be capable of performing acceptably when subjected to an overload test consisting of 50 cycles of operation by making and breaking the stalled-rotor current of the toy at maximum rated voltage. There shall be no electrical or mechanical failure nor any visible burning or pitting of the switch contacts as a result of this test.
(ii)
Switch.
To determine if a motor-control switch is capable of performing acceptably when subjected to overload conditions, the toy shall be connected to a grounded supply circuit of rated frequency and maximum rated voltage with the rotor of the motor locked into position. During the test, exposed dead metal parts of the toy shall be connected to ground through a 3-ampere plug fuse such that any single pole, current-rupturing device will be located in the ungrounded conductor of the supply circuit. If the toy is intended for use on direct current, or on direct current as well as alternating current, the exposed dead metal parts of the toy shall be so connected as to be positive with respect to a single pole, current-rupturing device. The switch shall be operated at a rate of not more than 10 cycles per minute. The performance of the toy shall be considered unacceptable if the fuse in the grounding connection is blown during the test.
(f)
Hydrokinetic
—(1)
General.
Electrically operated toy steam engines shall be capable of performing acceptably when subjected to the tests described in this paragraph.
(2)
Preliminary test.
The ultimate strength of the boiler assembly shall first be determined by applying a hydrostatic pressure to the boiler with all openings blocked (the pressure-relief valve, steam exhausts, and any whistle or other accessory shall be removed
and the resulting openings sealed); however, a water or other type of gage shall be left in place. The hydrostatic pressure shall be applied slowly and the ultimate value which is attained shall be recorded.
(3)
Pressure-relief test.
A pressure gage shall be connected to the boiler assembly which shall then be operated normally. The pressure at which the pressure-relief valve functions shall be noted while the engine is shut off (if a shutoff valve is provided) and with the whistle, if any, turned off. The test shall be discontinued and shall be considered a failure if the observed pressure exceeds one-fifth the value attained in the preliminary test described in paragraph (f)(2) of this section.
(4)
Operating pressure test.
If the boiler is still intact and no failure has occurred, the pressure-relief valve shall then be rendered inoperable and all other valves (such as a whistle and exhaust from the assembly) shall be tightly closed. Operations shall be continued until the pressure becomes constant. This test shall be discontinued and shall be considered a failure if the observed pressure exceeds one-third the value attained in the preliminary test described in paragraph (f)(2) of this section. During this test, all valves, gaskets, joints, and similar components shall be sufficiently tightened to prevent leakage. Rupture of the boiler or of any other fittings supplied with the engine shall be considered a failure.
(5)
Hydrostatic test.
If there has been no failure, two previous untested toys shall withstand for 1 minute a hydrostatic pressure of 5 times the pressure at which the safety valve operated or 3 times the constant pressure observed with the pressure-relief valve inoperable, whichever is greater. During this test, all openings shall be blocked (the pressure-relief valve, steam exhaust from the assembly, and any whistle or other outlet); however, a water or other type of gage shall remain in place. Rupture of the boiler or of a gage shall be considered a failure.
(g)
Thermal
—(1)
General.
The normal operation of a toy includes performance in normal use and after being subjected to reasonably foreseeable damage or abuse likely to produce the highest temperatures or, in the case of motor-operated toys, the load that most closely approximates the severest conditions of normal use or reasonably foreseeable damage or abuse.
(2)
Classification.

Such interlocks shall prohibit the operation of a heating device whenever such surfaces are accessible and shall not allow accessibility to such surfaces until the temperatures of those surfaces have been reduced to levels below those established for Type D surfaces (paragraph (g)(2)(v) of this section).
(3)
Requirements.
When tested under the conditions described in paragraph (g)(4) of this section, a toy shall not attain a temperature at any point sufficiently high to constitute a fire hazard or to adversely affect any materials employed and shall not show a maximum temperature higher than those established by §§ 1505.7 and 1505.8. These maximum surface temperature requirements are not applicable to educational-or hobby-type products such as lead-casting sets and wood-burning tools which are appropriately labeled on the shelf pack or package as being intended only for children over 12 years of age provided that the maximum surface temperature of any such toy does not exceed that reasonably required to accomplish the intended technical effect. Such toys shall be provided with specific instructions and the warning statements required by and in accordance with § 1505.3 (d) and (e), and shall be appropriately identified as educational or hobby-type products.
(4)
Test conditions
—(i)
General.
Tests shall be conducted while the toy is connected to a circuit of 60-cycle-per-second (60 Hertz) current using the materials supplied with the toy or using materials otherwise intended to be used with the toy. Following such tests, the toy shall be energized for a 6-hour period to determine that no hazardous conditions would result from unattended use of the toy.
(ii)
Temperature.
Normally, tests shall be performed at an ambient (room) temperature of 25 °C. (77 °F.); however, a test may be conducted at any ambient temperature within the range of 21° to 30 °C. (69.8° to 86 °F.).

This incorporation by reference was approved by the Director of the Office of the Federal Register. These materials are incorporated as they exist in the edition which has been approved by the Director of the Federal Register and which has been filed with the Office of the Federal Register.
(ii)
Test procedures.
The thermocouple junction and adjacent thermocouple lead wire shall be securely held in good thermal contact with the surface of the material whose temperature is being measured. In most cases, good thermal contact will result from securely taping or cementing the thermocouple in
place. If a metal surface is involved, brazing or soldering the thermocouple to the metal may be necessary. The surface temperatures of a toy shall be measured with the toy operating in any unattended condition (e.g., with and without opening and closing doors or covers) for a sufficient period of time to allow temperatures to become constant, or, in the case of a toy with a thermostatically controlled heating element, for a sufficient period of time to determine the maximum surface temperature attained. A temperature shall be considered to be constant when three successive readings taken at 15-minute intervals indicate no change.
(iii)
Heating devices.
Toy ovens, casting toys, popcorn and candy makers, and other toys requiring the insertion of any materials or substances shall be additionally tested by feeding crumpled strips of newspaper and tissue paper into or onto the toy in place of the intended materials or substances. The test strips shall be conditioned for at least 48 hours in air at a temperature of 25° ±4 °C. (77° ±7 °F.) and a relative humidity of 50 percent ±5 percent. The test strips shall be 2 inches wide by 8 inches long before crumpling. The crumpled paper shall occupy not more than 25 percent of the accessible volume. The performance of the toy shall be considered unacceptable if flaming occurs within a 60-minute period following the attainment of normal operating temperatures. If a light bulb is used for heating purposes, the test shall be conducted using the largest wattage bulb that can be easily inserted into the socket.
(h)
Strain-relief test.
(1) The strain-relief means provided on the flexible power cord of a toy shall be capable of withstanding a direct pull of 35 pounds applied to the cord for 2 minutes without displacement of the strain-relief unit or a deformation of the anchoring surface that would produce a stress which would result in a potentially hazardous condition. A 35-pound weight shall be attached to the cord and supported by the toy in such a manner that the strain-relief means is stressed from any angle that the construction of the toy permits. The test shall be conducted with the electrical connection within the toy disconnected.
(2) The initial 2-minute test shall be conducted with the force vector parallel to the longitudinal axis of the cord and perpendicular to the anchoring surface of the strain-relief unit. Each test at other angles of stress shall be conducted for periods of 1 minute. The strain-relief means is not acceptable if, at the point of disconnection of the cord, there is any movement of the cord to indicate that stress would have resulted on the conections.
(3) Except for toys weighing more than 10 pounds, the strain-relief unit and its support base shall be designed and constructed in such a manner that no indication of stress would result which would produce a hazard when the cord is held firmly in place 3 feet from the strain-relief unit and the toy is dropped the 3 feet at any angle.

§ 1510.1
Scope and purpose of part 1510.
This part 1510 sets forth the requirement whereby rattles (as defined in § 1510.2) are not banned articles under § 1500.18(a)(15) of this chapter. The purpose of these requirements is to ensure that certain infant rattles which may cause choking and/or suffocation because their design or construction permits them to enter into an infant's mouth and become lodged in the throat are eliminated from interstate commerce.
§ 1510.2
Definition.
For the purposes of this part 1510, a rattle is an infant's toy, intended to be hand held, usually containing pellets or other small objects and which produces sounds when shaken. Examples of products which may have similar noisemaking characteristics but which are excluded from the scope of this definition are: dolls, stuffed animals, crib exercisers, crib mobiles, pull toys, shoe lace holders, bells which are not part of the noisemaking component of a rattle, plastic keys or other figures on loops or chains which produce sound by striking together, games, puzzles and musical instruments such as tambourines, castanets, and maracas.
§ 1510.3
Requirements.
No portion of a rattle, when tested in accordance with the procedure of § 1510.4 below, shall be capable of entering and penetrating to the full depth of a cavity in a test fixture with dimensions shown in figure 1. (In determining these dimensions for compliance purposes, the English measurements shall be used. Metric equivalents are included for convenience.) Rattles shall meet this requirement both before and after performing the use and abuse tests of § 1500.51 of this chapter (excluding the bite and flexure tests of paragraphs (c) and (d)).
§ 1510.4
Test procedure.
Place the test fixture shown in figure 1 on a horizontal plane surface. Under its own weight and in a non-compressed state apply any portion of the test sample in the most adverse orientation to the opening in the test fixture. Repeat this procedure after performing the use and abuse tests of § 1500.51 (excluding the bite and flexure tests of paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section). In testing to ensure compliance with this regulation, the measurements of the opening of the Commission's test fixture will be no greater than those shown in Figure 1 and the depth of the fixture used will be no less than that shown in figure 1.

§ 1511.1
Scope of part 1511.
This part 1511 sets forth the requirements whereby pacifiers (as defined in § 1511.2(a)) are not banned articles under § 1500.18(a)(8) of this chapter.
§ 1511.2
Definitions.
(a) A
pacifier
is an article consisting of a nipple that is intended for a young child to suck upon, but is not designed to facilitate a baby's obtaining fluid, and usually includes a guard or shield and a handle or ring.
(b)
Guard or shield
means the structure located at the base of the nipple used to prevent the pacifier from being completely drawn into the child's mouth.
(c)
Handle or ring
means the structure usually located adjacent to the guard or shield used for holding or grasping the pacifier. A hinged handle or ring is one that is free to pivot about an axis parallel to the plane of the guard or shield.
§ 1511.3
Guard or shield requirements.
(a)
Performance requirements.
Place the pacifier in the opening of the fixture illustrated in Figure 1(a) of this part so that the nipple of the pacifier is centered in the opening and protrudes through the back of the fixture as shown in Figure 1(b). For pacifiers with
non-circular guards or shields, align the major axis of the guard or shield with the major axis of the opening in the fixture. Apply a tensile force to the pacifier nipple in the direction shown. The force shall be applied gradually attaining but not exceeding 2.0 pounds (8.9 newtons) within a period of 5 seconds and maintained at 2.0 pounds for an additional 10 seconds. Any pacifier which can be completely drawn through an opening with dimensions no greater than those of Figure 1(a) by such a force shall fail the test in this part.
(b)
Ventilation holes.
The pacifier guard or shield shall contain at least two holes symmetrically located and each being at least 0.20 inches (5 millimeters) in minor dimension. The edge of any hole shall be no closer than 0.20 inches (5 millimeters) to the perimeter of the pacifier guard or shield.
§ 1511.4
Protrusions.
(a)
Protrusions limitation.
No protrusion from the face of the guard or shield opposite from the nipple shall exceed 0.63 inches (16mm) when measured in accordance with the procedure specified in paragraph (b) of this section.
(b)
Protrusion test.
Secure the pacifier by clamping the nipple with its axis horizontal. For pacifiers with hinged handles or rings the orientation of the hinge axis shall be horizontal. A plane surface shall be applied to any protrusion from the guard or shield with a force gradually attaining but not exceeding 2.0 pounds (8.9 newtons) applied in a direction along the axis of the nipple. The normal of the plane surface shall be maintained parallel to the axis of the nipple. Any protrusion shall be allowed to flex or rotate about its hinge as the plane surfact is applied to it. Measure the distance from the plane surface to the guard or shield at the base of the nipple.
§ 1511.5
Structural integrity tests.
(a)
Nipple.
Hold the pacifier by the shield or guard, grasp the nipple end of the pacifier and gradually apply a tensile force to the pacifier nipple in any possible direction. The force shall be applied gradually, attaining but not exceeding 10.0 pounds (44.5 newtons) within a period of 5 seconds and maintained at 10.0 pounds for an additional 10 seconds.
(b)
Handle or ring.
Hold the pacifier by the shield or guard or base of the nipple, and push or pull on the handle or ring in any possible direction. The force shall be applied gradually attaining but not exceeding 10.0 pounds (44.5 newtons) within a period of 5 seconds and maintained at 10.0 pounds for an additional 10 seconds.
(c)
Heat cycle deterioration.
After the testing prescribed in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, all pacifiers shall be subject to the following: submerge the pacifier in boiling water for 5 minutes and then remove the pacifier and allow it to cool for 5 minutes in room temperature air, 60° to 80 °F. (16° to 27 °C). After the cooling period, resubmerge the pacifier in the boiling water for 5 minutes. The process shall be repeated for a total of 6 boiling/cooling cycles. After the sixth cycle, the pacifier shall again be subjected to the structural tests in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section and section 1511.3.
(d)
Small parts.
Any components or fragments which are released as a result of the tests specified in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this section shall be placed in the truncated cylinder shown in Figure 2, such that the component or fragment is in the lowest position in the cylinder. If the uppermost edge of the component or fragment is below the plane of the top of the cylinder, the pacifier shall fail the test in this section.
§ 1511.6
Ribbons, strings, cords, or other attachments.
A pacifier shall not be sold or distributed with any ribbon, string, cord, chain, twine, leather, yarn or similar attachments.
§ 1511.7
Labeling.
(a) As required by paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, pacifiers shall be labeled with the statement: “Warning—Do Not Tie Pacifier Around Child's Neck as it Presents a Strangulation Danger.”
(b) The labeling statement required by paragraph (a) of this section shall appear legibly and conspicuously on
any retail display carton containing two or more pacifiers.
(c) Each individually packaged pacifier shall bear the labeling statement required in paragraph (a) of this section on the package legibly and conspicuously.
§ 1511.8
Metric references.
For purposes of compliance with the test procedure prescribed by this § 500.46, the English figures shall be used. The metric approximations are provided in parentheses for convenience and information only.

Reflector test.
(Ref. § 1512.16(g)):
(1)
Conditioning.
The following conditioning in the order given shall be performed prior to testing for performance.
(i)
Warpage conditioning.
The reflector shall be held in a preheated oven for at least one hour at 50° ±5 °C (122±5.4 °F). A pedal reflector may be conditioned integrally with its pedal.
(ii)
Mechanical impact conditioning.
The reflector shall be mounted faceup in a manner similar to the way in which it is mounted on the bicycle. A 13 mm (
1/2
in.) diameter polished steel ball shall be dropped normal to the center of the face of the reflector from a height of 0.76 m (30 in.). The ball may be guided by a tube with holes, but not restricted in free fall. Pedal reflectors are exempt from this impact conditioning.
(iii)
Moisture conditioning.
The reflector shall be submerged in tap water in a suitable container. The container shall be pressurized in 17.2 kN/m
2
(2.5 psi) (equivalent to 1.7 m (5
3/4
ft.)) of water for 15 minutes and then released.
(2)
Reflector performance test.
(i) Arrangements for the reflector performance test shall be as shown in figure 3 and the distance
D
between the light source and the reflector shall be 30.5 m (100 ft.). The source of illumination shall be a lamp with a 51 mm (2.0 in.) effective diameter and a filament operating at 2,856±10 percent color temperature. The observation point shall be colocated (as close as practicable) with the source of illumination. The reflector shall be mounted with the center of the reflector at the center of rotation and at the same horizontal level as the source of illumination. Photometric measurements shall be made at the observation angles and entrance angles given in tables 1 and 2.
(ii) The observation angle is the angle formed by a line from the point of observation to the center of the reflector with a second line from the center of the reflector to the source of illumination. The entrance angle is the angle between the optical axis of the reflector and a line from the center of
the reflector to the source of illumination. The entrance angle shall be designated left, right, up, and down in accordance with the position of the source of illumination with respect to the axis of the reflector as viewed from behind the reflector when the plane of the observation angle is vertical and the receiver is above the source.
(iii) Photometric measurements shall be made either visually or photoelectrically. With either method, the light reflected to the observation point shall be determined. Also, the illumination on the reflector from the source shall be measured.
(iv) For visual measurements a comparison lamp, emitting light similar in spectral quality to the reflector, shall be located adjacent to the reflector (at an angle not to exceed
1/2
°) and arranged so that the candlepower can be varied from 0.01 to 0.25 to make the intensity duplicate that of the reflector under test. The candlepower of the source of the illumination of the reflector under test shall be known or determined for this test. Means shall be provided to change the intensity of the source of illumination without changing the filament color temperature. The comparison lamp shall be designed to avoid reflection from the source of illumination back in the direction of the observer. It shall be of such size and so diffused that when viewed by the observer (through a 2
1/2
× reducing monocular), the candlepower can be readily compared and adjusted to that of the reflector. The observer shall have at least 10 minutes of dark adaption before making observations. For photoelectric measurements, the opening to the photocell shall not be more than
1/2
inch vertical by 1 inch horizontal.
(v) Reflectors that mount on the bicycle in a fixed rotational position with respect to the bicycle, or the bicycle component on which they are mounted (such as pedals or spokes), shall be tested with a single orientation. Reflectors that do not mount on the bicycle in a fixed rotational position with respect to the bicycle shall be rotated about their axis through 360° to find the minimum candlepower per footcandle for each test point. If the measurement falls below the minimum requirement at any test point, the reflector shall be rotated ±5° about its axis from the angle where the minimum occurs, and the maximum candlepower per footcandle within this angle shall be the measured value.
(vi) Should uncolored reflections from the front surface interfere with photometric readings at any test point the lowest reading and location within 1° above, below, right, and left of the test point shall meet the minimum requirement for the test point.
(vii) A recommended coordinate system for definition of color is the “Internationale de l'Eclairage (CIE 1931)” system. In the coordinate system and when illuminated by the source defined in table 4 of this part 1512, a reflector will be considered to be red if its color falls within the region bounded by the red spectrum locus and the lines y = 0.980−x and y = 0.335; a reflector will be considered to be amber if its color falls within the region bounded by the yellow spectrum locus and the lines y = 0.382, y = 0.790−0.667x, and y = x−0.120.
(o) Reflective tire and rim test (Ref. § 1512.16(h) and (i)):
(1)
Apparatus.
Arrangements for the reflective intensity measurement shall be as shown in figure 3 of this part 1512. A light projector (having a maximum effective lens diameter of
D
/500, where
D
is the distance from the source to the retroreflective surface being measured) capable of projecting light of uniform intensity shall be used to illuminate the sample. The light falling on the sample shall have a color temperature of 2856°K +
10
% (equivalent to a tungsten filament lamp operated at a color temperature of 2856°K +
10
% having approximately the relative energy distribution given in table 4 of this part 1512). The light reflected from the test surface shall be measured with a photoelectric receiver, the response of which has been corrected for the spectral sensitivity of the average photopic human eye. The dimensions of the active area of the receiver shall be such that no point on the perimeter of the receiver is more than
D
/100 from its center (where
d
is the distance from the receiver to the retroreflective surface). Wheels used for the measurement of retroreflective tires or rims shall
have all exposed metallic surfaces, including spokes, masked in flat black so that when measured these surfaces indicate no appreciable reflectance. The tire shall be mounted and fully inflated. Distances shall be measured from the plane of the wheel and the center of the hub. For the tests, the distance
D
between the projector and the center of the wheel and distance
d
between the center of the wheel and the receiver shall each be at least 15 m (50 ft.).
(2)
Procedure
—(i)
Masking.
The reflecting strip to be tested shall be within two concentric circles, the larger of which is no more than 0.02 m (0.79 in.) greater in radius than the smaller. While additional reflecting material is permitted outside such boundaries, such additional material shall not be counted in determining the average width of the reflecting strip and shall be masked off with opaque, matte black tape in testing the reflecting material.
(ii)
Orientation.
Every position of the reflecting strip on the rim or the mounted and fully inflated tire to be tested shall be oriented so that the normal to this portion is within 40° of parallel to the axis of rotation of the wheel.
(iii)
Measurement.
Measure the distance
d
from the receiver to the center of the wheel and the minimum distance
r
from the axis of rotation of the wheel to the unmasked portion of the reflective strip. Measure the illumination incident on the reflective strip at uniform intervals of no more than 45° around the wheel, with the receiver oriented in the direction of the incident radiation. The average of such readings will be the mean illumination of the sample
E.
If any one of such readings differs by more than 10 percent from the mean illumination, then a more uniform source must be obtained. Measure the illumination of the receiver due to reflection from the retroreflective surface for each entrance angle and each observation angle given in table 3 of this part 1512. The entrance angle and the observation angle shall be in the same plane. A negative entrance angle (figure 3 of this part 1512) is specified when the entrance angle is small because the location of the receiver with respect to the direction of illumination becomes important for distinguishing between ordinary mirror-like reflection and retroreflection. The illumination incident on the test surface and the receiver shall be measured in the same units on a linear scale. Compute the ratio
A
for each combination of entrance angle and observation angle listed in table 3 as follows:
A = [(E
r
/ E
s
)(d
2
/ r)]
Where:
A = Ratio in meters,
E
r
= Illumination incident upon the receiver,
E
s
= Illumination incident upon a plane perpendicular to the incident ray at the specimen position (see instructions above in this paragraph (o)(2)(iii) for averaging), measured in the same units as E
r
,
d = The distance in meters from the receiver to the center of the wheel,
r = The minimum radius in meters of the boundary circles of the retroreflective strip.
The minimum value of
A
shall be that listed in table 3 of this part 1512 for each combination of entrance angle and observation angle. The plane containing the entrance angle and the plane containing the observation angle shall coincide. In table 3, a positive entrance angle corresponds to the case in which the line of sight to the receiver lies between the line of incidence and the optic axis of the reflector, and a negative entrance angle corresponds to the case in which the line of incidence lies between the line of sight of the receiver and optic axis of the reflector.
(iv)
Criteria.
The ratio A as defined in § 1512.18(o)(2)(iii) shall not be less than:
A = 4Cos
2
θ/[1 + (Φ/0.225)
3/2
]
where A is ratio in meters, θ is the entrance angle in degrees, and Φ is the observation angle in degrees. The criterion applies only for entrance angles from 0° to 40° and observation angles from 0.2° to 1.5°, and performance is not specified beyond this range. The values of
A
in table 3 are obtained from the above formula by rounding up to two significant figures. Except in cases in which the performance of the reflector is seriously questionable, a reflector with
A
at least the value given in table
3 at each of the six combinations of entrance and observation angles will be considered to satisfy this criteria.
(p)
Road test.
(Ref. §§ 1512.15(c) and 1512.17(a)):

(r)
Abrasion test for retroreflective rims.
(Ref. § 1512.16(i)):
(1) This test consists of a steel wire cup brush rotating at a constant velocity of 60 rpm that is applied at a force of 2 N (0.45 lbf) to the retroreflective material on one side of a bicycle wheel rim. The rim is rotated about the axle at a linear velocity of 0.23 m/sec (9 in./sec). The test is complete when the wheel has completed 1000 revolutions.
(2)
Apparatus.
Figure 8 of this part 1512 illustrates the following test fixture arrangement that is suitable to perform this abrasion test:
(i)
Test fixture.
The test fixture contains a clamp to hold the axle of a bicycle wheel so that the wheel can rotate freely about the axle. The axis of rotation is capable of being inclined from the vertical to bring that portion of the side of the wheel rim containing the retroreflective material into a horizontal plane as it passes beneath the abrading brush. A drive mechanism to rotate the bicycle wheel contains a means to adjust the rotational velocity to obtain the specified linear velocity measured at a point on the wheel rim on the axis of the abrading brush.
(ii)
Abrader.
The abrader is a cup brush meeting the specification in paragraph (r)(3)(v) of this section. It is mounted in a chuck attached to a motor that rotates about a vertical axis at the specified rotational velocity. A means is provided to apply the rotating cup brush at the specified force against the retroreflective material on the bicycle wheel rim. The axis of the abrading brush is positioned on the mid point in the width of the retroreflective material. The force is produced by deadweights applied to a pan on the axis of the counterbalanced motor/brush assembly.
(3)
Specifications.
(i) The linear velocity of the reflective band on wheel rim shall be 0.23 m/sec (9 in./sec) measured at a point on the axis of the abrading brush.
(ii) The rotational velocity of the abrading brush shall be 60 rpm.
(iii) The force normal to the plane of the retroreflective material at which the abrading brush is to be applied shall be 2 N (0.45 lbf).
(iv) The bicycle wheel shall make 1000 complete revolutions per test.
(v) The abrader shall be a cup brush having bristles that are 0.005 in. (approx. 0.13mm) diameter low carbon steel wire; an outside diameter of 0.5 inch (aprox. .13mm); a wire bristle length of 0.25 inch (approx. 6.4mm); and
a cup diameter of 0.405 inch (approx. 10.29mm).

For compliance testing the Commission will use a brush meeting this description distributed by Dremel Manufacturing Company, Racine, Wisconsin as Dremel Part No. 442. This brush is manufactured by Weiler Brush Company as No. 26074, MC-10 Wire.
(vi) The abrasion test shall be conducted at an ambient temperature of between 16 °C (60 °F) and 27 °C (80 °F).
(4)
Procedure.
(i) The retroreflective bicycle rim to be tested shall be an unused sample free from grit, grime and grease. Prior to beginning the test, remove, according to instructions supplied with the bicycle, any protective coating or material used to prevent damage in shipping.
(ii) Test the wheel in a suitable test fixture, according to the specifications in paragraph (r)(3) of this section.
(iii) Clamp the wheel by its axle in the test fixture and align the axis of rotation so that the portion of the reflective material below the axis of the abrading brush is horizontal.
(iv) Shape the cup brush by hand to the specified 0.5 (approx. 13mm) diameter. Any stray wire bristles projecting more than
1/32
in. (approx. 1 mm) beyond the tip of the bulk of the bristles should be clipped off. Adjust the position of the brush so that its axis is centered over the mid-point in the width of the retroreflective material.
(v) Adjust the rotational velocity of the bicycle wheel to obtain a linear velocity of 0.23 m/sec (9 in./sec) measured at the mid-point in the width of the retroreflective material. Adjust the force to obtain a force normal to the surface under the brush of 2 N (0.45 lbf).
(vi) Apply the abrading brush to the retroreflective material on the wheel rim, and continue the test for 1000 complete revolutions of the bicycle wheel.

§ 1513.1
Scope, application, and effective date.
(a)
Scope, basis, and purpose.
This part 1513 prescribes requirements for bunk beds to reduce or eliminate the risk that children will die or be injured from being trapped between the upper
bunk and the wall or in openings below guardrails or in other structures in the bed. Bunk beds meeting these requirements are exempted from 16 CFR 1500.18(a)(18).
(b)
Application and effective date.
This part applies to all bunk beds, except those manufactured only for institutional use, that are manufactured in the United States, or imported, on or after June 19, 2000. (Facilities intended for use by children under age 6 are not considered to be institutions.) Bunk beds, as described in this section, that are not intended for use by children are subject to the requirements in 16 CFR part 1213, and not to 16 CFR 1500.18(a)(18). However, the provisions of 16 CFR 1213 are substantively identical to the requirements in this part 1513.
§ 1513.2
Definitions.
As used in this part 1513:
Bed. See Bunk bed.
Bed end structure
means an upright unit at the head and foot of the bed to which the side rails attach.
Bunk bed
means a bed in which the underside of any foundation is over 30 inches (760 mm) from the floor.
Foundation
means the base or support on which a mattress rests.
Guardrail
means a rail or guard on a side of the upper bunk to prevent a sleeping occupant from falling or rolling out.
§ 1513.3
Requirements.
(a)
Guardrails.
(1) Any bunk bed shall provide at least two guardrails, at least one on each side of the bed, for each bed having the underside of its foundation more than 30 inches (760 mm) from the floor.
(2) One guardrail shall be continuous between each of the bed's end structures. “Continuous” means that any gap between the guardrail and end structure shall not exceed 0.22 inches (5.6 mm) (so as to not cause a finger entrapment hazard for a child).
(3) The other guardrail may terminate before reaching the bed's end structures, providing there is no more than 15 inches (380 mm) between either end of the guardrail and the nearest bed end structure.
(4) For bunk beds designed to have a ladder attached to one side of the bed, the continuous guardrail shall be on the other side of the bed.
(5) Guardrails shall be attached so that they cannot be removed without either intentionally releasing a fastening device or applying forces sequentially in different directions.
(6) The upper edge of the guardrails shall be no less than 5 inches (130 mm) above the top surface of the mattress when a mattress of the maximum thickness specified by the manufacturer's instructions is on the bed. This requirement does not prohibit a wall-side guardrail that terminates in a quarter-circle bend and attaches to the side rail of the upper bunk foundation.
(7) With no mattress on the bed, there shall be no openings in the structure between the lower edge of the uppermost member of the guardrail and the underside of the upper bunk's foundation that would permit passage of the wedge block shown in Figure 1 of this part when tested in accordance with the procedure at § 1513.4(a).
(b)
Bed end structures.
(1) The upper edge of the upper bunk end structures shall be at least 5 inches (130 mm) above the top surface of the mattress for at least 50 percent of the distance between the two posts at the head and foot of the upper bunk when a mattress and foundation of the maximum thickness specified by the manufacturer's instructions is on the bed.
(2) With no mattress on the bed, there shall be no openings in the rigid end structures above the foundation of the upper bunk that will permit the free passage of the wedge block shown in Figure 1 when tested in accordance with the procedure at § 1513.4(b).
(3) When tested in accordance with § 1513.4(c), there shall be no openings in the end structures between the underside of the foundation of the upper bunk and upper side of the foundation of the lower bunk that will permit the free passage of the wedge block shown in Figure 1, unless the openings are also large enough to permit the free passage of a 9-inch (230-mm) diameter rigid sphere.
(4) All portions of the boundary of any opening required by §§ 1513.4(c)(1) and (2) to be probed by the wedge block
of Figure 1, and that permits free passage of a 9-inch diameter sphere, must conform to the neck entrapment requirements of § 1513.4(c)(3).
§ 1513.4
Test methods.
(a)
Guardrails
(see § 1513.3(a)(6)). With no mattress on the bed, place the wedge block shown in Figure 1, tapered side first, into each opening in the rigid bed structure below the lower edge of the uppermost member of the guardrail and above the underside of the upper bunk's foundation. Orient the block so that it is most likely to pass through the opening (
e.g.,
the major axis of the block parallel to the major axis of the opening) (“most adverse orientation”). Then, gradually apply a 33-lbf (147-N) force in a direction perpendicular to the plane of the large end of the block. Sustain the force for 1 minute.
(b)
Upper bunk end structure
(see § 1513.3(b)(2)). Without a mattress or foundation on the upper bunk, place the wedge block shown in Figure 1 into any opening, tapered side first, and in the most adverse orientation. Determine if the wedge block can pass freely through the opening.
(c)
Lower bunk end structure
(see § 1513.3(b)(3)). (1) Without a mattress or foundation on the lower bunk, place the wedge block shown in Figure 1, tapered side first, into each opening in the lower bunk end structure in the most adverse orientation. Determine whether the wedge block can pass freely through the opening. If the wedge block passes freely through the opening, determine whether a 9-inch (230-mm) diameter rigid sphere can pass freely through the opening.
(2) With the manufacturer's recommended maximum thickness mattress and foundation in place, repeat the test in paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
(3) All portions of the boundary of any opening that is required to be probed by the wedge block of Figure 1 by paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section, and that permits free passage of a 9-inch diameter sphere, must satisfy the requirements of paragraphs (c)(3)(i) and (c)(3)(ii) of this section addressing neck entrapment:
(i) Insert the “A” section of the test template shown in Figure 2 of this part into the portion of the boundary to be tested, with the plane of the template in the plane of the opening and with the centerline of the top of the template (as shown in Figure 2) aligned parallel to the centerline of the opening, until motion is stopped by contact between the test template and the boundaries of the opening (see Figure 3 of this part). By visual inspection, determine if there is simultaneous contact between the boundary of the opening and both sides of the “A” section of the template. If simultaneous contact occurs, mark the contact points on the boundary of the opening and conduct the additional test described in paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section.
(ii) To check the potential for neck entrapment, place the neck portion of the “B” section of the template into the opening, with its plane perpendicular to both the plane of the opening and the centerline of the opening (see Figure 4 of this part). If the neck portion of the “B” section of the template can completely enter the opening (passes 0.75 inch or more beyond the points previously contacted by the “A” section of the template), the opening is considered to present a neck entrapment hazard and fails the test, unless its lower boundary slopes downward at 45” or more for the whole distance from the narrowest part of the opening the neck can reach to the part of the opening that will freely pass a 9-inch diameter sphere.
§ 1513.5
Marking and labeling.
(a) There shall be a permanent label or marking on each bed stating the name and address (city, state, and zip code) of the manufacturer, distributor, or retailer; the model number; and the month and year of manufacture.
(b) The following warning label shall be permanently attached to the inside of an upper bunk bed end structure in a location that cannot be covered by the bedding but that may be covered by the placement of a pillow.
ER22DE99.006
§ 1513.6
Instructions.
Instructions shall accompany each bunk bed set, and shall include the following information.
(a)
Size of mattress and foundation.
The length and width of the intended mattress and foundation shall be clearly stated, either numerically or in conventional terms such as twin size, twin extra-long, etc. In addition, the maximum thickness of the mattress and foundation required for compliance with § 1513.3 (a)(5) and (b)(1) of this part shall be stated.
(b)
Safety warnings.
The instructions shall provide the following safety warnings:
(1) Do not allow children under 6 years of age to use the upper bunk.
(2) Use guardrails on both sides of the upper bunk.
(3) Prohibit horseplay on or under beds.
(4) Prohibit more than one person on upper bunk.
(5) Use ladder for entering or leaving upper bunk.
(6) If the bunk bed will be placed next to a wall, the guardrail that runs the full length of the bed should be placed against the wall to prevent entrapment between the bed and the wall. (This applies only to bunk beds without two full-length guardrails.)

# Appendix to Part 1513—Findings Under the Federal Hazardous Substances Act
The Federal Hazardous Substances Act (FHSA) requires that the Commission, in order to issue part 1513, make the following findings and include them in the rule. 15 U.S.C. 1261(s), 1262(i). Because of this, the facts and determinations in these findings apply as of the date the rule was issued, December 22, 1999.
A.
Bunk beds present a mechanical hazard.
Section 2(s) of the FHSA states that an “article may be determined to present a mechanical hazard if, in normal use or when subjected to reasonably foreseeable damage or abuse, its design or manufacture presents an unreasonable risk of personal injury or illness * * * (3 from * * * surfaces, edges, openings, or closures * * * , or (9) because of any other aspect of the articles design or manufacture.” 15 U.S.C. 1261(s).
2. For a recent 9.6-year period, the CPSC received reports of 57 deaths of children under age 15 who died when they were trapped between the upper bunk of a bunk bed and the wall or when they were trapped in openings in the bed's structure. Over 96% of those who died in entrapment incidents were age 3 or younger. On average, averting these deaths is expected to produce a benefit to society with a present value of about $175 to $350 for each bed that otherwise would not have complied with one or more of the rule's requirements.
3. This increased safety will be achieved in three main ways. First, all bunk beds will be required to have a guardrail on both sides of the bed. If the bed is placed against a wall, the guardrail on that side is expected to prevent a child from being entrapped between the bed and the wall. The guardrail on the
wall side of the bed must extend continuously from one end to the other. Second, the end structures of the bed must be constructed so that, if an opening in the end structure is large enough so a child can slip his or her body through it, it must be large enough that the child's head also can pass through. Third, this area must also be constructed so that a child cannot insert his or her head into an opening and move to another part of the opening where the head cannot be pulled out and the neck can become entrapped.
4. For the reasons discussed in paragraph C of this appendix, the benefits of the changes to bunk beds caused by this rule will have a reasonable relationship to the changes' costs. The rule addresses a risk of death, and applies primarily to a vulnerable population, children under age 3. The life-saving features required by the rule are cost-effective and can be implemented without adversely affecting the performance and availability of the product. The effective date provides enough time so that production of bunk beds that do not already comply with the standard can easily be changed so that the beds comply. Accordingly, the Commission finds that there is an unreasonable risk of entrapment injury associated with bunk beds that do not comply with part 1513.
B.
Where a voluntary standard has been adopted and implemented by the affected industry, that compliance with such voluntary standard is not likely to result in the elimination or adequate reduction of the risk of injury, or it is unlikely that there will be substantial compliance with such voluntary standard.
1.
Adequacy of the voluntary standard.
In this instance, there is a voluntary standard addressing the risk of entrapment in bunk beds. However, the rule goes beyond the provisions of the voluntary standard. First, it eliminates the voluntary standard's option to have an opening of up to 15 inches at each end of the wall-side guardrail. Second, it requires more of the lower bunk end structures to have entrapment protection. The voluntary standard protects against entrapment only within the 9-inch space immediately above the upper surface of the lower bunk's mattress. The mandatory standard extends this area of protection upward to the level of the underside of the upper bunk foundation. Both of these provisions, which are in the rule but not in the voluntary standard, address fatalities and, as noted in this paragraph (a)(18), have benefits that bear a reasonable relationship to their costs.
Therefore, the Commission finds that compliance with the voluntary standard is not likely to result in the elimination or adequate reduction of the risk of entrapment injury or death.
2.
Substantial compliance.
i. The FHSA does not define “substantial compliance.” The March 3, 1999 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking summarized an interpretation of “substantial compliance” that the Office of General Counsel provided to the Commission. 64 FR 10245, 10248-49 (March 3, 1999). The Commission specifically invited public comment on that interpretation from “all persons who would be affected by such an interpretation.” Id. at 10249. The Commission received more than 20 comments on the interpretation.
ii. Having now considered all the evidence that the staff has presented, the comments from the public, and the legal advice from the Office of General Counsel, the Commission concludes that there is not “substantial compliance” with the ASTM voluntary standard for bunk beds within the meaning of the Consumer Product Safety Act and the Federal Hazardous Substances Act. See, e.g., 15 U.S.C. 2058(f)(3)(D)(ii); 15 U.S.C. 1262(i)(2)(A)(ii). However, the Commission does not adopt a general interpretation of “substantial compliance” focusing on whether the level of compliance with a voluntary standard could be improved under a mandatory standard. Rather, the grounds for the Commission's decision focus on the specific facts of this rulemaking and are stated below.
iii. The legislative history regarding the meaning of “substantial compliance” indicates that the Commission should consider whether compliance is sufficient to eliminate or adequately reduce the risk of injury in a timely fashion and that, generally, compliance should be measured in terms of the number of complying products, rather than the number of manufacturers who are in compliance. E.g., Senate Report No. 97-102, p. 14 (May 15, 1981); House Report No. 97-158, p. 11 (June 19, 1981); H. Conf. Rep. No. 97-208, 97th Cong., 1st Sess. 871, reprinted in 1981 U.S. Code Cong.
Admin. News 1010, 1233.
iv. Given this Congressional guidance, the Commission believes it appropriate to examine the number of conforming products as the starting point for analysis. However, the Commission does not believe that there is any single percentage of conforming products that can be used in all cases to define “substantial compliance.” Instead, the percentage must be viewed in the context of the hazard the product presents. Thus, the Commission must examine what constitutes substantial compliance with a voluntary standard in light of its obligation to safeguard the American consumer.
v. There are certain factors the agency considers before it initiates regulatory action, such as the severity of the potential injury, whether there is a vulnerable population at risk, and the risk of injury. See 16 CFR 1009.8. These and other factors also appropriately inform the Commission's decision regarding whether a certain level of conformance with a voluntary standard is
substantial. In the light of these factors, industry's compliance rate with the voluntary standard for bunk beds is not substantial.
vi. In this case, the Commission deals with the most severe risk—death—to one of the most vulnerable segments of our population—infants and young children. While the risk of death is not high, it exists whenever a young child is in a residence with a nonconforming bunk bed.
vii. Additionally, some products, such as hairdryers without shock protection devices, require some intervening action (dropping the hair dryer into water) to create the hazard. By contrast, deaths in bunk beds occur during the intended use of the product—a child rolling over in bed or climbing in or out of it—without any intervening action.
viii. The Commission must also consider that bunk beds have a very long product life, frequently being passed on to several families before being discarded. Thus, a number of children may be exposed to a bed during its useful life. Every noncomplying bed that poses an entrapment hazard presents the potential risk of death to any young child in the house. It is a risk that is hard for a parent to protect against, as children find their way onto these beds even if they are not put to sleep in them.
ix. Bunk beds are products that can be made relatively easily by very small companies, or even by a single individual. The Office of Compliance believes smaller entities will always present a compliance problem, because new manufacturers can enter the marketplace relatively easily and need little expertise to make a wooden bunk bed. The evidence seems to support the view that there will always be an irreducible number of new, smaller bunk bed manufacturers who will not follow the voluntary standard.
x. What constitutes substantial compliance is also a function of what point in time the issue is examined. In 1989, the Commission denied a petition for a mandatory bunk bed rule. At that time, industry was predicting that by April of 1989, 90% of all beds being manufactured would comply with the voluntary guidelines. But that was in the context of years of steadily increasing conformance and the hope that conformance would continue to grow and that deaths and near-misses would begin to decline. But the conformance level never grew beyond the projection for 1989 and deaths and near-misses have not dropped.
xi. Even with the existing compliance rate, the Commission is contemplating the prospect of perhaps 50,000 nonconforming beds a year (or more) entering the marketplace, with many beds remaining in use for perhaps 20 years or longer. Under these circumstances, a 10% rate of noncompliance is too high.
xii. It is now clear that the bunk bed voluntary standard has not achieved an adequate reduction of the unreasonable risk of death to infants and children in a timely fashion, and it is unlikely to do so. Accordingly, the Commission finds that substantial compliance with the voluntary standard for bunk beds is unlikely.
xiii. Products that present some or all of the following factors might not be held to as strict a substantial compliance analysis. Those which:
—Rarely or never cause death;
—Cause only less severe injuries;
—Do not cause deaths or injuries principally to a vulnerable segment of the population;
—Are not intended for children and which have no special attraction for children;
—Have a relatively short life span;
—Are made by a few stable manufacturers or which can only be made by specialized manufacturers needing a significant manufacturing investment to produce the product;
—Are covered by a voluntary standard which continues to capture an increasing amount of noncomplying products; or
—Require some additional intervening action to be hazardous.
xiv. And, in analyzing some other product, there could be other factors that would have to be taken into consideration in determining what level of compliance is adequate to protect the public. The tolerance for nonconformance levels has to bear some relationship to the magnitude and manageability of the hazard addressed.
xv. The Commission emphasizes that its decision is not based on the argument that a mandatory rule provides more powerful enforcement tools. If this were sufficient rationale, mandatory rules could always displace voluntary standards, and this clearly was not Congress's intent. But, with a mandatory standard, the necessity of complying with a mandatory federal regulation will be understandable to small manufacturers. State and local governments will have no doubt about their ability to help us in our efforts to locate these manufacturers.
C.
The benefits expected from the rule bear a reasonable relationship to its costs.
1.
Bunk beds that do not comply with ASTM's requirements for guardrails.
The cost of providing a second guardrail for bunk beds that do not have one is expected to be from $15-40 per otherwise noncomplying bed. If, as expected, the standard prevents virtually all of the deaths it addresses, the present value of the benefits of this modification are estimated to be from $175-350 per otherwise noncomplying bed. Thus, the benefit of this provision is about 4-23 times its cost.
2.
Bunk beds that comply with ASTM's requirements for guardrails.
The voluntary standard allows up to a 15-inch gap in the coverage of the guardrail on the wall side of the upper bunk. Additional entrapment deaths are addressed by requiring that the
wall-side guardrail be continuous from one end of the bed to the other. The estimated present value of the benefits of this requirement will be $2.40 to $3.50 per otherwise noncomplying bed. The Commission estimates that the materials cost to extend one guardrail an additional 30 inches (760 mm) will be less than the present value of the benefits of making the change. Further, the costs of any design changes can be amortized over the number of bunk beds produced after the design change is made. Thus, any design costs are nominal.
3.
Lower bunk end structures.
The Commission is aware of a death, involving entrapment in the end structures of the lower bunk, occurring in a scenario not currently addressed by the voluntary standard. This death is addressed by extending the upper limit of the voluntary standard's lower bunk end structures entrapment provisions from 9 inches above the lower bunk's sleeping surface to the bottom of the upper bunk and by also including a test for neck entrapment in this area. The Commission expects the costs of this requirement to be design-related only, and small. Indeed, for some bunk beds, material costs may decrease since less material may be required to comply with these requirements than are currently being used. Again, the design costs for these modifications to the end structures can be amortized over the subsequent production run of the bed.
4.
Effect on market.
The small additional costs from any wall-side guardrail and end-structure modifications are not expected to affect the market for bunk beds, either alone or added to the costs of compliance to ASTM's provisions.
5.
Conclusion.
The Commission has no reason to conclude that any of the standard's requirements have costs that exceed the requirement's expected benefits. Further, the total effect of the rule is that the benefits of the rule will exceed its costs by about 4-23 times. Accordingly, the Commission concludes that the benefits expected from the rule will bear a reasonable relationship to its costs.
D.
The rule imposes the least burdensome requirement that prevents or adequately reduces the risk of injury for which the rule is being promulgated.
1. The Commission considered relying on the voluntary standard, either alone or combined with a third-party certification program. However, the Commission concludes that a mandatory program will be more effective in reducing these deaths, each of which is caused by an unreasonable risk of entrapment. Accordingly, these alternatives would not prevent or adequately reduce the risk of injury for which the rule is being promulgated.
2. The Commission also considered a suggestion that bunk beds that conformed to the voluntary standard be so labeled. Consumers could then compare conforming and nonconforming beds at the point of purchase and make their purchase decisions with this safety information in mind. This, however, would not necessarily reduce injuries, because consumers likely would not know there is a voluntary standard and thus would not see any risk in purchasing a bed that was not labeled as conforming to the standard.

§ 1602.1
Enforcement policy.
(a) On May 14, 1973, the responsibilities of the Federal Trade Commission for enforcement of the Flammable Fabrics Act, as amended (15 U.S.C. 1191-1204), were transferred to the Consumer Product Safety Commission pursuant to section 30(b) of the Consumer Product Safety Act (Pub.

# Subpart A—Procedures for Investigations, Inspections and Inquiries
§ 1605.1
Purposes, delegation, finding and how initiated.
(a) An investigation under these rules is an undertaking by the Commission to obtain information for the purposes of enforcing or determining compliance with the Flammable Fabrics Act (15 U.S.C. 1191
et seq.
) (“FFA”); the regulations, rules, standards, and orders promulgated thereunder; and those sections of the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 41
et seq.
) (“FTCA”) which are relevant to the enforcement and administration of the Flammable Fabrics Act. The term investigation includes, but is not limited to inspections (§ 1605.2); investigational hearings (§ 1605.6); and inquiries, employing orders of access (§ 1605.4), subpoenas (§ 1605.5), depositions (§ 1605.7), written interrogatories (§ 1605.9), and general or special orders (§ 1605.10).
(b) An inspection as described in § 1605.2 is initiated when the Commission or its delegee authorizes the issuance of a written notice of inspection (hereinafter notice), described in § 1605.2(c). Investigations and inquiries will be initiated by the Commission in such manner as it deems proper.
(c) The Commission hereby delegates to the Associate Executive Director for Compliance and Enforcement, the Director of the Enforcement Division, the Solicitor, and the Directors of Area Offices, the power to initiate inspections in the same manner as the Commission.
(d) Finding. The Commission found on November 3, 1977 pursuant to section 30(d) of the Consumer Product Safety Act, as amended (“CPSA”) (15 U.S.C. 2079(d)) that the risk of injury associated with products regulated under the Flammable Fabrics Act cannot be eliminated or reduced to a sufficient extent by the issuance of procedures for investigations, inspections and inquiries under the Flammable Fabrics Act and the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 41
et seq.
). This finding is made to eliminate any confusion and uncertainty that may exist concerning the scope of the Commission's statutory authority under the Flammable Fabrics Act and Federal Trade Commission Act to conduct inspections and collect samples. The Commission is supplementing the authority granted to it under the FFA and FTCA with its powers under the CPSA while retaining the procedural safeguards and requirements of all of these acts. Accordingly, the Commission issues these rules pursuant to sections 16 and 27 of the CPSA (15 U.S.C. 2065 and 2076) and makes them applicable to products regulating under the FFA.
§ 1605.2
Conduct and scope of inspections.
(a) After an inspection is initiated as set forth in § 1605.1, an officer or employee duly designated by the Commission shall issue the notice. Upon presenting such notice, along with appropriate credentials, to the person, or agent-in-charge of the sole proprietorship, partnership, or corporation to be inspected, the Commission officer or employee may seek, for the purposes set forth in § 1605.1 (a):
(1) To enter, at reasonable times, any factory, warehouse, or establishment in which a product, fabric, or related material is manufactured, processed, packaged, tested or to which it is delivered or in which it is held in connection with its importation, introduction, distribution, transportation, receipt, and/or sale in commerce;
(2) To enter any conveyance being used to transport, deliver, or hold any such product, fabric, or related material in connection with its importation, introduction, distribution, transportation, receipt, and/or sale in commerce;
(3) To inspect at all reasonable times, in a reasonable manner, and within reasonable limits, any factory, warehouse, establishment, or conveyance described in paragraph (a) (1) and (2) of this section and all appropriate records, reports, books, documents and papers including, but not limited to, those relating to production, inventory, testing, distribution, sale, transportation, importation, or receipt of any product, fabric, or related material and all pertinent equipment, materials, substances, products, fabrics, related materials, containers, packages and
packaging, and labels, and labeling therein:
(4) To have access to and copy at all reasonable times: (i) All records, reports, books, documents, papers, or labeling required by the Commission to be established, made, or maintained; (ii) all documents showing or relating to the production inventory, testing, distribution, sale, transportation, importation, or receipt of any product, fabric, or related material; and (iii) all other appropriate records, reports, books, documents, papers, packages and packaging, and labels and labeling;
(5) To obtain: (i) Information, both oral and written, concerning the production, inventory, testing, distribution, sale, transportation, importation or receipt of any product, fabric or related material and the organization, business, conduct, practices, and management of any person, sole proprietorship, partnership, or corporation being inspected and its relation to any other person, sole proprietorship, partnership, or corporation; (ii) samples of items, materials, substances, products, fabrics, related materials, containers, packages and packaging, labels and labeling, and have the same analyzed, tested, or examined; and (iii) information, both oral and written, concerning any matter referred to in these rules.
(b) A separate notice shall be given for each inspection, but a notice shall not be required for each entry made during the course of the same inspection. Each such inspection shall be commenced at a reasonable time and be completed within a reasonable time.
(c) The notice of inspection shall include: the name and address of the person, sole proprietorship, partnership, or corporation being inspected; the name and title of the inspector; the date and time of the anticipated entry; pertinent extracts from the statutory provisions upon which the right to access is based; pertinent extracts from the statutory provisions upon which the penalties for refusal of access are based; pertinent extracts from § 1605.2 of these rules setting forth the authority of inspectors and the types of information and items they are authorized to obtain; a statement which sets forth the purposes of the inspection and the nature of the information and items to be obtained and/or copied; and a statement that those from whom information is requested should state whether any of the information submitted is believed to contain or relate to a trade secret or other matter which should be considered by the Commission to be confidential in accordance with section 4(c) of the Flammable Fabrics Act (15 U.S.C. 1193(c)) and whether any of the information is believed to be entitled to exemption from disclosure by the Commission under the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) or section 6(f) of the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 46(f)). Any statement asserting this claim of confidentiality must be in writing, and any request for exemption of the information from disclosure must be made in accordance with the Commission's Freedom of Information Act regulations, 16 CFR part 1015, 42 FR 10490, February 22, 1977 or as amended.
(d) If upon being presented with a notice, the person, or agent-in-charge of the sole proprietorship, partnership, or corporation being inspected fails to allow access to documentary evidence for the purpose of inspecting and making copies of such evidence, the inspector shall notify that individual that he or she may be in violation of the law and subject to the penalties therein and immediately thereafter refer such individual to the appropriate provisions of the notice which set forth such penalties. If the individual still refuses to comply, in whole or in part, with the authorized request for access, the inspector shall leave the premises; and the Commission shall take such action as it deems appropriate. If the person in charge refuses to accept the notice upon its presentation, the inspector shall affix the notice to a public entrance way on the premises.
§ 1605.3
Compulsory processes and the service thereof.
(a) In addition to or in lieu of authorizing the issuance of a notice, the Commission may elect to use any of the following means to initiate investigations, inspections, or inquiries to obtain information for the purposes set forth in § 1605.1(a):
(1) Orders for Access;
(2) Subpoenas;
(3) Investigational Hearings;
(4) Depositions;
(5) Written Interrogatories; and
(6) General or special Orders.
(b) Service of notice in connection with any of the compulsory processes enumerated in § 1605.3(a) shall be effected as follows:
(1) By personal service upon the person, or agent-in-charge of the sole proprietorship, partnership, or corporation being investigated, inspected, or inquired of; or
(2) By mail (registered or certified) or delivery to the last known residence or business address of anyone being investigated, inspected, or inquired of.
(c) The date of service of any form of compulsory process shall be the date on which the document is mailed, or delivered in person, whichever is applicable. Whenever a party is required or permitted to do an act within a prescribed period after service of a document and the document is served by mail, three (3) days shall be added to the prescribed period.
(d) These rules shall be referred to in any form of compulsory process served upon a person, sole proprietorship, partnership, or corporation.
(e) Anyone submitting information in response to any of the compulsory processes referred to in § 1605.4(a) hereof should state whether any of the information submitted is believed to contain or relate to a trade secret or other matter which should be considered by the Commission to be confidential in accordance with section 4(c) of the Flammable Fabrics Act (15 U.S.C. 1193(c)) and whether any of the information is believed to be entitled to exemption from disclosure by the Commission under the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act (15 U.S.C. 552) or section 6(f) of the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 46(f)). Any statement asserting this claim of confidentiality must be in writing, and any request for exemption of the information from disclosure must be made in accordance with the Commission's Freedom of Information Act regulations, 16 CFR part 1015, 42 FR 10490, February 22, 1977 or as amended.
§ 1605.4
Orders for access.
(a) In the event an inspection pursuant to § 1605.2 herein is refused, in whole or in part, or prior to any such inspection, the Commission may issue an order requiring any person, sole proprietorship, partnership, or corporation to allow access to a duly-designated officer or employee of the Commission for the purpose of conducting an inspection. Such order will be issued by the Commission upon the demonstration by the staff of a justifiable need to gain access. Inspections conducted after service of an order for access shall be conducted in accordance with the procedures provided in § 1605.2.
(b) After issuance of an order for access, the staff may, upon request of the recipient of the order, agree to modify the order to limit its scope, impose conditions or extend the time for compliance. If an agreement cannot be voluntarily reached, the recipient of the order may file a motion to limit or quash the order. Any such motion shall set forth the reasons why the order should be limited or quashed; and may be accompanied by memoranda, affidavits, or other documents submitted in support of the motion. Unless a different period of time for filing a motion is specified in the order, the motion must be received in the Office of the Secretary of the Commission within ten calendar days after the order is mailed or delivered in person to such person, sole proprietorship, partnership, or corporation unless the Commission, upon a showing of good cause, grants an extension of time within which to file a motion to limit or quash an order of access.
(c) Upon receipt of a motion to limit or quash the order for access, the Office of the Secretary shall immediately notify and trasmit a copy of the motion to Associate Executive Director for Compliance and Enforcement or the General Counsel, as appropriate. Unless a different period of time is specified in the order, the Associate Executive Director for Compliance and Enforcement or General Counsel shall file an answer with the Office of the Secretary within ten calendar days after receipt of a copy of the motion. A copy of the answer shall be served upon the moving party or the counsel of the moving
party. No reply to the answer will be permitted.
(d) All motions to limit or quash shall be ruled upon by the Commission. The Office of the Secretary shall serve the decision on the motion to limit or quash the order of access upon the moving party or the counsel of the moving party and shall furnish a copy of the decision to the Associate Executive Director for Compliance and Enforcement or the General Counsel, as appropriate. The decision on the motion to limit or quash shall be the final decision on the matter. Motions for reconsideration will not be received.
§ 1605.5
Subpoenas.
(a) The Commission may issue to any person, sole proprietorship, partnership, or corporation a subpoena requiring the production of documentary evidence (subpoena duces tecum) and/or the attendance and testimony of witnesses (subpoena ad testificandum) relating to any matter under investigation. The Commission hereby delegates to the Associate Executive Director for Compliance and Enforcement, the Director of the Enforcement Division, the Solicitor, or the General Counsel, depending upon which officer is involved with the subpoena, the power to negotiate and approve the terms of satisfactory compliance with such subpoena.
(b) The person, sole proprietorship, partnership, or corporation upon whom a subpoena is served may file a motion to limit or quash the subpoena. Any such motion shall set forth the reasons why the subpoena should be quashed or limited and may be accompanied by memoranda, affidavits, or other documents submitted in support of the motion. Unless a different period of time for filing a motion is specified in the subpoena, the motion must be received in the Office of the Secretary of the Commission within ten calendar days after the subpoena is mailed or delivered to such person, sole proprietorship, partnership, or corporation unless the Commission, upon a showing of good cause, grants an extension of time within which to file a motion to limit or quash a subpoena.
(c) Upon receipt of any such motion, the Office of the Secretary shall immediately notify and transmit a copy of the motion to the Associate Executive Director for Compliance and Enforcement or the General Counsel, as appropriate. Unless a different period of time is specified in the subpoena, the Associate Executive Director for Compliance and Enforcement or the General Counsel shall file an answer with the Office of the Secretary within ten calendar days after receipt of a copy of the motion. A copy of the answer shall be served upon the moving party or the counsel of the moving party. No reply to the answer will be permitted.
(d) All motions to limit or quash a subpoena shall be ruled upon by the Commission. The Office of the Secretary shall serve the decision on the motion to limit or quash the subpoena upon the moving party or the counsel of the moving party and shall furnish a copy of the decision to the Associate Executive Director for Compliance and Enforcement or the General Counsel, as appropriate. The decision on the motion to limit or quash shall be the final decision on the matter. Motions for reconsideration will not be received.
§ 1605.6
Investigational hearings.
(a) The Commission may order, and by subpoena, may compel any person, sole proprietorship, partnership, or corporation to provide information at an investigational hearing. Such hearings shall be for the purpose of taking the testimony, under oath, of witnesses and receiving documents and other data relating to any subject under investigation. Such hearings shall be presided over by the commission, by one or more of its members, an Administrative Law Judge, hearing examiner, attorney-examiner or by a duly designated officer or employee. The hearings shall be stenographically reported, and a transcript thereof shall be made a part of the record.
(b) A Commissioner who participates in such a hearing or other investigation, inspection, or inquiry shall not be disqualified by reason of such participation from subsequently sharing in a Commission decision in the matter.
(c) All investigational hearings shall be closed to the public, unless otherwise ordered by the Commission.
(d) The release of the record of such hearing shall be governed by the Commission's regulations under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, and/or other applicable laws or regulations.
§ 1605.7
Depositions.
(a) The Commission may order and, by subpoena, may compel testimony to be taken by deposition at any stage of any investigation. Such depositions may be taken before any person designated by the Commission who has the power to administer oaths. The testimony given shall be reduced to writing by the person taking the deposition or under such person's direction and shall then be submitted to the deponent for signature unless the deponent waives the right to sign the deposition. All depositions shall be closed to the public, unless otherwise ordered by the Commission. The release of the record of such depositions shall be governed by the Commission's regulations under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, and/or other applicable laws or regulations.
(b) Any changes in form or substance which the deponent desires to make shall state the reasons for such changes. The deposition shall then be signed by the deponent, unless the deponent waives the right to sign, cannot be found, or is unable or refuses to sign. If the deposition is not signed by the deponent within 30 days of its submission to the deponent, or such shorter time as the Commission may designate, the Commission designee shall sign it and state on the record the fact of the waiver of the right to sign or of the illness or absence of the deponent, or the fact of the deponent's inability or refusal to sign together with the reason, if any, given therefor. The deposition referred to herein may be used in any investigation or any administrative or judical adjudicative proceeding.
§ 1605.8
Rights of witnesses at investigational hearings and of deponents at depositions.
(a) Any person, or agent or officer of a sole proprietorship, partnership, or corporation who is required to produce documentary evidence or give testimony as a witness at an investigational hearing conducted under provisions of § 1605.6 or as a deponent at a deposition taken in accordance with provisions of § 1605.7 may be accompanied by an attorney or an official or employee of the person, sole proprietorship, parnership, or corporation, who may act as counsel for the witness or the deponent. However, a person who is subpoenaed to produce documentary evidence or give testimony at an investigational hearing or deposition cannot act as counsel for another witness or deponent at the same proceeding. The term attorney refers to members of the bar of a Federal Court or the courts of any State or Territory of the United States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, or the District of Columbia. The witness or deponent and his or her counsel may act as follows during the course of an investigational hearing or deposition:
(1) A witness or deponent may confer, in confidence, with his or her counsel concerning any questions asked of the witness or deponent. If the witness or deponent or counsel objects to a question, the objection and basis thereof shall be stated on the record. In the case of an objection based upon the privilege against self incrimination, the privilege must be asserted by the witness or deponent. If a witness at an investigationl hearing refuses to answer a question or provide other information, the presiding officer shall have the authority to immediately order the witness or deponent to answer the question or provide the information requested, except in circumstances where an immediate ruling would be unwarranted and except where such refusal is based upon the privilege against self incrimination, which shall be handled in accordance with the procedure set forth in 18 U.S.C. 6002 and 6004. Otherwise, all objections shall be ruled upon by the presiding officer at the time the objection is made.
(2) Objections timely made under the provisions of § 1605.8(a) shall be noted on the record, shall be treated as continuing, and shall be preserved throughout the course of the proceeding without the necessity of repetition during similar lines of inquiry.
(3) Except as provided by this § 1605.8(a), counsel for a witness or a deponent may not interrupt the examination of the witness or the deponent by making objections or statements on the record.
(4) Upon completion of the examination of a witness or a deponent, the witness or deponent may clarify on the record any of his or her answers.
(b) Any such person, agent, or officer who is required to appear in person at an investigational hearing or at a deposition shall testify as to matters and information known and/or reasonably available to the person, sole proprietorship, parnership, or corporation involved.
(c) Any such person, agent, or officer who is compelled by subpoena to appear in person at an investigational hearing or at a deposition shall receive the same fees and mileage allowances as are paid witnesses in the courts of the United States.
(d) Any such person, agent, or officer who is required to appear in person at an investigational hearing or at a deposition shall be entitled to retain a copy of any document submitted by him or her and, upon payment of lawfully prescribed costs, shall be entitled to procure a copy of his or her own testimony as recorded.
(e) The Commission designee who presides at an investigational hearing or before whom a deposition is taken shall take all necessary action to regulate the course of the hearing or the deposition, to avoid delay and to assure that reasonable standards of orderly and ethical conduct are maintained. Such designee shall, for reasons stated on the record, immediately report to the Commission any instance in which counsel for a witness or a deponent has refused to comply with the designee's directions, or to adhere to reasonable standards of orderly and ethical conduct in the course of the hearing or the deposition. The Commission shall thereupon take such action as the circumstances warrant.
§ 1605.9
Written interrogatories.
(a) The Commission may order any person, sole proprietorship, partnership, or corporation being investigated to answer written interrogatories. Such interrogatories shall be answered by the individual or by any agent or officer of the sole proprietorship, partnership, or corporation who shall furnish information on behalf of the sole proprietorship, partnership, or corporation. The information provided shall be that which is known or reasonably available to the person or organization involved and shall be submitted after reasonable inquiry to obtain the information requested.
(b) Each interrogatory shall be answered separately and fully in writing, under oath, unless it is objected to, in which event the reason for the objection shall be stated in lieu of an answer. The answers shall be signed by the individual or the officer or agent making them. The person, sole proprietorship, parnership, or corporation upon whom the interrogatories have been served shall furnish the Commission a copy of the answers and objections, if any, within 30 days after service of the interrogatories or within such shorter time as the commission may designate. Interrogatories submitted hereunder are continuing in character so as to require the person, sole proprietorship, partnership, or corporation answering to file supplementary answers upon obtaining further or different information.
§ 1605.10
General or special orders seeking information.
The Commission may require by the issuance of general or special orders, any person, sole proprietorship, partnership, or corporation to file with the Commission in such form as the Commission may prescribe annual and/or special reports or answers in writing to specific questions which furnish to the Commission such information as it may require as to its organization, business, conduct, practices, management, and relation to any person, sole proprietorship, partnership, or corporation. Such reports and answers shall be made under oath, or otherwise, as the Commission may prescribe and shall be filed with the Commission within such time as the Commission may prescribe, unless additional time may be granted in any case by the Commission.
§ 1605.11
Remedies for failure to permit authorized investigations.
In the event of failure to comply with any investigative process authorized by these rules, the Commission may seek appropriate action pursuant to the authority conferred by the Federal Trade Commission Act, including actions for enforcement, forfeitures, penalities, or criminal sanctions.
§ 1605.12
Nonexclusive delegation of power.
No provision contained herein delegating any of the Commission's powers shall be construed as limiting the actual authority of the Commission to exercise the same powers.

# Subpart B—Consent Order Agreements
§ 1605.13
Procedures for Consent Order Agreements.
(a) The Consent Order Agreement is a document executed by a person, sole proprietorship, partnership, or corporation (Consenting Party) and a Commission staff representative which incorporates both a proposed complaint setting forth the staff's charges and a proposed order by which such charges are resolved. A consent order agreement shall contain the following provisions, as appropriate:
(1) An admission of all jurisdictional facts by the consenting parties;
(2) A waiver of any rights to an administrative or judicial hearing and of any other procedural steps including any rights to seek judicial review or otherwise challenge or contest the validity of the Commission's order;
(3) A statement that the agreement is in settlement of the staff's charges and does not constitute an admission by the Consenting Party that the law has been violated;
(4) A statement that the Commission's order is issued under the provisions of the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 41
et seq.
), the Flammable Fabrics Act (15 U.S.C. 1191
et seq.
), and the Consumer Product Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 2051
et seq.
) and that a violation of such an order subjects the Consenting Party to civil penalties under the provisions of the Federal Trade Commission Act;
(5) An acknowledgement that the consent order agreement only becomes effective upon its final acceptance by the Commission and its service upon the Consenting Party;
(6) An acknowledgement that the Commission may disclose terms of the consent order agreement to the public;
(7) A statement that the Consulting Party shall cease and desist from certain acts and practices;
(8) A statement that the Consenting Party shall perform certain acts and practices pursuant to the consent order agreement;
(9) An acknowledgement that the requirements of the order are in addition to, and not to the exclusion of, other remedies such as criminal penalties which may be pursued under section 7 of the Flammable Fabrics Act.
(b) At any time in the course of an investigation, the staff, with the approval of the Commission may propose to the person, sole proprietorship, partnership, or corporation being investigated, that any alleged violation be resolved by an agreement containing a consent order. Additionally, such a proposal may be made to the Commission staff by such person, sole proprietorship, partnership, or corporation.
(c) Upon receiving an executed agreement, the Commission may: (1) Provisionally accept it; (2) reject it and issue its complaint (in which case the matter will be scheduled for hearing in accordance with the Commission's Rules of Practice for Adjudicative Proceedings (16 CFR part 1025, June 21, 1977, or as later revised)); or (3) take such other action as it may deem appropriate.
(d) If the agreement is provisionally accepted, the Commission shall place the agreement on the public record and shall announce provisional acceptance of the agreement in the
Federal Register.
Any interested person may ask the Commission not to accept the agreement by filing a request in the office of the Secretary. Such request must be received in the Office of the Secretary no later than the close of business of the fifteenth calendar day following the date the announcement is published in the
Federal Register.
(e) Unless the Commission orders otherwise, the agreement shall be
deemed finally accepted by the Commission on the 20th calendar day after the date of announcement in the
Federal Register.
The Commission shall then issue its complaint and order in such form as the circumstances, may require. The order is a final order in disposition of the proceeding and is effective immediately upon its service upon the Consenting Party pursuant to these rules. The Consenting Party shall thereafter be bound by and take immediate action in accordance with such final order.
(f) If the Commission does not accept the agreement on a final basis, it shall so notify the Consenting Party. Such notification constitutes withdrawal of the Commission's provisional acceptance unless the Commission orders otherwise. The Commission may then issue its complaint, may order further investigation, or may take such other action it considers appropriate.

Sec. 6.
(a) Whenever the Commission has reason to believe that any person is violating or is about to violate section 3 of this Act,
and that it would be in the public interest to enjoin such violation until complaint under the Federal Trade Commission Act is issued and dismissed by the Commission or until order to cease and desist made thereon by the Commission has become final within the meaning of the Federal Trade Commission Act or is set aside by the court on review, the Commission may bring suit in the district court of the United States or in the United States court of any Territory for the district or Territory in which such person resides or transacts business, to enjoin such violation and upon proper showing a temporary injunction or restraining order shall be granted without bond.
(b) Whenever the Commission has reason to believe that any article of wearing apparel has been manufactured or introduced into commerce or any fabric has been introduced in commerce in violation of section 3 of this Act, it may institute proceedings by process of libel for the seizure and confiscation of such article of wearing apparel or fabric in any district court of the United States within the jurisdiction of which such article of wearing apparel or fabric is found.

If such products are disposed of by sale the proceeds, less costs and charges, shall be paid into the Treasury of the United States.

# Penalties
Sec. 7.
Any person who willfully violates section 3 or 8(b) of this Act shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction thereof shall be fined not more than $5,000 or be imprisoned not more than one year or both in the discretion of the court: Provided, That nothing herein shall limit other provisions of this Act.

# Guaranty
Sec. 8.
(a) No person shall be subject to prosecution under section 7 of this Act for a violation of section 3 of this Act if such person (1) establishes a guaranty received in good faith signed by and containing the name and address of the person by whom the wearing apparel or fabric guaranteed was manufactured or from whom it was received, to the effect that reasonable and representative tests made under the procedures provided in section 4 of this Act show that the fabric covered by the guaranty, or used in the wearing apparel covered by the guaranty, is not, under the provisions of section 4 of this Act, so highly flammable as to be dangerous when worn by individuals, and (2) has not, by further processing, affected the flammability of the fabric or wearing apparel covered by the guaranty which he received. Such guaranty shall be either (1) a separate guaranty specifically designating the wearing apparel or fabric guaranteed, in which case it may be on the invoice or other paper relating to such wearing apparel or fabric; or (2) a continuing guaranty filed with the Commission applicable to any wearing apparel or fabric handled by a guarantor, in such form as the Commission by rules or regulations may prescribe.
(b) It shall be unlawful for any person to furnish, with respect to any wearing apparel or fabric, a false guaranty (except a person relying upon a guaranty to the same effect received in good faith signed by and containing the name and address of the person by whom the wearing apparel or fabric guaranteed was manufactured or from whom it was received) with reason to believe the wearing apparel or fabric falsely guaranteed may be introduced, sold, or transported in commerce, and any person who violates the provisions of this subsection is guilty of an unfair method of competition, and an unfair or deceptive act or practice, in commerce within the meaning of the Federal Trade Commission Act.

# Shipments From Foreign Countries
Sec. 9.
Any person who has exported or who has attempted to export from any foreign country into the United States any wearing apparel or fabric which, under the provisions of section 4, is so highly flammable as to be dangerous when worn by individuals may thenceforth be prohibited by the Commission from participating in the exportation from any foreign country into the United States of any wearing apparel or fabric except upon filing bond with the Secretary of the Treasury in a sum double the value of said products and any duty thereon, conditioned upon compliance with the provisions of this Act.

# Interpretation and Separability
Sec. 10.
The provisions of this Act shall be held to be in addition to, and not in substitution for or limitation of, the provisions of any other law. If any provision of this Act or the application thereof to any person or circumstances is held invalid the remainder of the Act and the application of such provisions to any other person or circumstances shall not be affected thereby.

# Exclusions
Sec. 11.
The provisions of this Act shall not apply (a) to any common carrier, contract carrier, or freight forwarder with respect to an article of wearing apparel or fabric shipped or delivered for shipment into commerce in the ordinary course of its business; or (b) to any converter, processor, or finisher in performing a contract or commission service for the account of a person subject to the provisions of this Act: Provided, That said converter, processor, or finisher does not cause any article of wearing apparel or fabric to become subject to this Act contrary to the terms of the contract or commission service; or (c) to any article of wearing apparel or fabric shipped or delivered for shipment into commerce for the purpose of finishing or processing to render such article or fabric not so highly flammable, under the provisions of section 4 of this Act, as to be dangerous when worn by individuals.

# Subpart A—The Standard
§ 1610.1
Purpose, scope and applicability.
(a)
Purpose.
The purpose of this standard is to reduce danger of injury and loss of life by providing, on a national basis, standard methods of testing and rating the flammability of textiles and textile products for clothing use, thereby prohibiting the use of any dangerously flammable clothing textiles.
(b)
Scope.
The Standard provides methods of testing the flammability of clothing and textiles intended to be used for clothing, establishes three classes of flammability, sets forth the requirements which textiles shall meet to be classified, and warns against the use of those textiles which have burning characteristics unsuitable for clothing. Hereafter, “clothing and textiles intended to be used for clothing” shall be referred to as “textiles.”
(c)
Specific exceptions.
This standard shall not apply to: (1) Hats, provided they do not constitute or form part of a covering for the neck, face, or shoulders when worn by individuals;
(2) Gloves, provided they are not more than 14 inches in length and are not affixed to or do not form an integral part of another garment;
(3) Footwear, provided it does not consist of hosiery in whole or part and is not affixed to or does not form an integral part of another garment;
(4) Interlining fabrics, when intended or sold for use as a layer between an outer shell and an inner lining in wearing apparel.
(d)
Specific exemptions.
Experience gained from years of testing in accordance with the Standard demonstrates that certain fabrics consistently yield acceptable results when tested in accordance with the Standard. Therefore, persons and firms issuing an initial guaranty of any of the following types of fabrics, or of products made entirely from one or more of these fabrics, are exempt from any requirement for testing to support guaranties of those fabrics:
(1) Plain surface fabrics, regardless of fiber content, weighing 2.6 ounces per square yard or more; and
(2) All fabrics, both plain surface and raised-fiber surface textiles, regardless of weight, made entirely from any of the following fibers or entirely from combination of the following fibers: acrylic, modacrylic, nylon, olefin, polyester, wool.
(e)
Applicability.
The requirements of this part 1610 shall apply to textile fabric or related material in a form or state ready for use in an article of wearing apparel, including garments and costumes finished for consumer use.
§ 1610.2
Definitions.
In addition to the definitions given in Section 2 of the Flammable Fabrics Act as amended (15 U.S.C. 1191), the following definitions apply for this part 1610.
(a)
Base burn
(also known as base fabric ignition or fusing) means the point at which the flame burns the ground (base) fabric of a raised surface textile fabric and provides a self-sustaining flame. Base burns, used to establish a Class 2 or 3 fabric, are those burns resulting from surface flash that occur on specimens in places other than the point of impingement (test result code SFBB) when the warp and fill yarns of a raised surface textile fabric undergo combustion. Base burns can be identified by an opacity change, scorching on the reverse side of the fabric, or when a physical hole is evident.
(b)
Burn time
means the time elapsed from ignition until the stop thread is severed as measured by the timing mechanism of the test apparatus.
(c)
Dry cleaning
means the cleaning of samples in a commercial dry cleaning machine under the conditions described in § 1610.6.
(d)
Film
means any non-rigid, unsupported plastic, rubber or other synthetic or natural film or sheeting, subject to the Act, or any combination thereof, including transparent, translucent, and opaque material, whether plain, embossed, molded, or otherwise surface treated, which is in a form or state ready for use in wearing apparel, and shall include film or sheeting of any thickness.
(e)
Flammability
means those characteristics of a material that pertain to
its relative ease of ignition and relative ability to sustain combustion.
(f)
Flame application
time means the 1 second during which the ignition flame is applied to the test specimen.
(g)
Ignition
means that there is a self-sustaining flame on the specimen after the test flame is removed.
(h)
Interlining
means any textile which is intended for incorporation into an article of wearing apparel as a layer between an outer shell and an inner lining.
(i)
Laundering
means washing with an aqueous detergent solution and includes rinsing, extraction and tumble drying as described in § 1610.6.
(j)
Long dimension
means the 150 mm (6 in) length of test specimen.

§ 1610.3
Summary of test method.
The Standard provides methods of testing the flammability of textiles from or intended to be used for apparel; establishes three classes of flammability; sets forth the requirements for classifying textiles; and prohibits the use of single or multi-layer textile fabrics that have burning characteristics that make them unsuitable for apparel. All textiles shall be tested before and after refurbishing according to § 1610.6. Each specimen cut from the textile shall be inserted in a frame, brushed if it has a raised-fiber surface, and held in a special apparatus at an angle of 45°. A standardized flame shall be applied to the surface near the lower end of the specimen for 1 second, and the time required for the flame to proceed up the fabric a distance of 127 mm (5 in) shall be recorded. A notation shall be made as to whether the base of a raised-surface textile fabric ignites or fuses.
§ 1610.4
Requirements for classifying textiles.

§ 1610.5
Test apparatus and materials.
(a)
Flammability apparatus.
The flammability test apparatus consists of a draft-proof ventilated chamber enclosing a standardized ignition mechanism, sample rack, and automatic timing mechanism. The flammability apparatus shall meet the minimum requirements for testing as follows.
(1)
Test chamber
—(i)
Test chamber structure.
The test chamber shall be a metal, draft-proof ventilated chamber. The test chamber shall have inside dimensions of 35.3 cm high by 36.8 cm wide by 21.6 cm deep (14 in by 14.5 in by 8.5 in). There shall be eleven or twelve 12.7 mm diameter (0.5 in) holes equidistant along the rear of the top closure. The front of the chamber shall be a close fitting door with an insert made of clear material (i.e., glass, plexiglass) to permit observation of the entire test. A ventilating strip is provided at the base of the door in the front of the apparatus. The test chamber to be used in this test method is illustrated in Figures 1 and 2 of this part.
(ii)
Specimen rack.
The specimen rack provides support for the specimen holder (described in paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section) in which the specimen is
mounted for testing. The angle of inclination shall be 45°. Two guide pins projecting downward from the center of the base of the rack travel in slots provided in the floor of the chamber so that adjustment can be made for the thickness of the specimen in relation to the test flame. A stop shall be provided in the base of the chamber to assist in adjusting the position of the rack. The specimen rack shall be constructed so that: It supports the specimen holder in a way that does not obstruct air flow around the bottom edge of the fabric specimen; and the fabric specimen is properly aligned with the igniter tip during flame impingement. The specimen rack to be used in this test method is illustrated in Figures 1 through 3 of this part. Movable rack: Refer to the manufacturers' instruction in relation to the adjustment procedure to move the rack into the appropriate position for the indicator finger alignment.
(iii)
Specimen holder.
The specimen holder supports and holds the fabric specimen. The specimen holder shall consist of two 2 mm (0.06 in) thick U-shaped matched metal plates. The plates are slotted and loosely pinned for alignment. The specimen shall be firmly sandwiched in between the metal plates with clamps mounted along the sides. The two plates of the holder shall cover all but 3.8 cm (1.5 in) of the width of the specimen for its full length. See Figures 1 and 3 of this part. The specimen holder shall be supported in the draft-proof chamber on the rack at an angle of 45°.
(iv)
Indicator finger.
The position of the specimen rack (described in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section) shall be adjusted, so the tip of the indicator finger just touches the surface of the specimen. An indicator finger is necessary to ensure that the tip of the test flame will impinge on the specimen during testing. The indicator finger to be used in this test method is illustrated in Figures 1, 2 and 4 of this part.
(v)
Ignition mechanism.
The ignition mechanism shall consist of a motor driven butane gas jet formed around a 26-gauge hypodermic needle and creates the test flame. The test flame shall be protected by a shield. See Figure 5. The test flame is adjusted to 16 mm (0.625 in) and applied to the specimen for 1 second. A trigger device is located in the front of the apparatus, the pulling or pushing of which activates the test flame impingement and timing device. Electro-mechanical devices (
i.e.
, servo-motors, solenoids, micro-switches, and electronic circuits, in addition to miscellaneous custom made cams and rods, shock absorbing linkages, and various other mechanical components) can be used to control and apply the flame impingement. See Figure 6 of this part.
(vi)
Draft ventilator strip.
A draft ventilator strip shall be placed across the front opening, sealing the space between the sliding door when in lowered position and the base on which the grid rack is attached. (See Figure 1 of this part.)
(vii)
Stop weight.
The weight, attached by means of a clip to the stop thread, in dropping actuates the stop motion for the timing mechanism. The weight shall be 30g ±5g (1.16 oz. ±0.18 oz).
(viii)
Door.
The door shall be a clear (
i.e.
glass or plexiglass) door, close fitting and allows for viewing of the entire test.
(ix)
Hood.
The hood or other suitable enclosure shall provide a draft-proof environment surrounding the test chamber. The hood or other suitable enclosure shall have a fan or other means for exhausting smoke and/or fumes produced by testing.
(2)
Stop thread and thread guides
—(i)
Stop thread.
The stop thread shall be stretched from the spool through suitable thread guides provided on the specimen holder and chamber walls.
(ii)
Stop thread supply.
This supply, consisting of a spool of 3-ply, white, mercerized, 100% cotton sewing thread, with a Tex size of 40 ±5 Tex, shall be fastened to the side of the chamber and can be withdrawn by releasing the thumbscrew holding it in position.
(iii)
Thread Guides.
The thread guides permit the lacing of the stop thread in the proper position exactly 127 mm (5 in) from the point where the center of the ignition flame impinges on the test specimen. The stop thread shall be 9.5 mm (0.37 in) above and parallel to the lower surface of the top plate of the specimen holder. This condition can be
achieved easily and reproducibly with the use of a thread guide popularly referred to as a “sky hook” suspended down from the top panel along with two L-shaped thread guides attached to the upper end of the top plate of the specimen holder. Two other thread guides can be installed on the rear panel to draw the thread away from directly over the test flame. The essential condition, however, is the uniform height of 9.5 mm (0.37 in) for the stop thread and not the number, placement or design of the thread guides.
(iv)
Stop weight thread guide.
This thread guide shall be used to guide the stop thread when attaching the stop weight.
(3)
Supply for test flame.
(i) The fuel supply shall be a cylinder of chemically pure (c. p.) butane.
(ii) The fuel-tank control valve shall consist of a sensitive control device for regulating the fuel supply at the tank.
(iii) The flow control device, such as a manometer or flow meter, shall be sufficient to maintain a consistent flame length of 16 mm (
5/8
in).
(4)
Timing Device.
The timing device consists of a timer, driving mechanism and weight. The timer, by means of special attachments, is actuated to start by connection with the gas jet. A trigger device (described in paragraph (a)(1)(v) of this section) activates the flame impingement, causing the driving mechanism to move the gas jet to its most forward position and automatically starts the timer at the moment of flame impact with the specimen. The falling weight, when caused to move by severance of the stop thread, stops the timer. Time shall be read directly and recorded as a burn time. Read burn time to 0.1 second. An electronic or mechanical timer can be used to record the burn time, and electro-mechanical devices (
i.e.,
servo-motors, solenoids, micro-switches, and electronic circuits, in addition to miscellaneous custom made cams and rods, shock absorbing linkages, and various other mechanical components) can be used to control and apply the flame impingement.
(b)
Specimen preparation equipment and materials
—(1)
Laboratory drying oven.
This shall be a forced circulation drying oven capable of maintaining 105° ±3 °C (221° ±5 °F) for 30 ±2 minutes to dry the specimens while mounted in the specimen holders.
(2)
Desiccator.
This shall be an airtight and moisture tight chamber capable of holding the specimens horizontally without contacting each other during the cooling period following drying, and shall contain silica gel desiccant.
(3)
Desiccant.
Anhydrous silica gel shall be used as the desiccant.
(4)
Automatic washing machine.
The automatic washing machine shall be as described in § 1610.6(b)(1)(ii).

(8)
Dry cleaning detergent.
The dry cleaning detergent shall be cationic class.
(9)
Laundering detergent.
The laundering detergent shall be as specified in § 1610.6(b)(1)(ii).
(10)
Brushing device.
The brushing device shall consist of a base board over which a small carriage is drawn. See Figure 7 of this part. This carriage runs on parallel tracks attached to the edges of the upper surface of the base board. The brush is hinged with pin hinges at the rear edge of the base board and rests on the carriage vertically with a pressure of 150 gf (0.33 lbf). The brush shall consist of two rows of stiff nylon bristles mounted with the tufts in a staggered position. The bristles are 0.41 mm (0.016 in) in diameter and 19 mm (0.75 in) in length. There are 20 bristles per tuft and 4 tufts per inch. See Figure 8 of this part. A clamp is attached to the forward edge of the movable carriage to permit holding the specimen on the carriage during the brushing operation.

[73 FR 15640, Mar. 25, 2008, as amended at 73 FR 62187, Oct. 20, 2008; 88 FR 73230, Oct. 25, 2023]
§ 1610.6
Test procedure.
The test procedure is divided into two steps. Step 1 is testing in the original state; Step 2 is testing after the fabric has been refurbished according to paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
(a)
Step 1—Testing in the original state.
(1) Tests shall be conducted on the fabric in a form or state ready for use in wearing apparel. Determine whether the fabric to be tested is a plain surface textile fabric or a raised surface textile fabric as defined in § 1610.2 (k) and (l). There are some fabrics that require extra attention when preparing test specimens because of their particular construction characteristics. Examples of these fabrics are provided in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) through (vi) of this section along with guidelines for preparing specimens from these fabrics. This information is not intended to be all-inclusive.
(i)
Flocked fabrics.
Fabrics that are flocked overall are treated as raised surface textile fabrics as defined in § 1610.2(l). Flock printed fabrics (usually in a pattern and not covering the entire surface) shall be treated as plain surface textile fabrics as defined in § 1610.2(k).
(ii)
Cut velvet fabrics.
Cut velvet fabrics with a patterned construction shall be considered a raised surface textile fabric as defined in § 1610.2(l).
(iii)
Metallic thread fabrics.
Metallic thread fabrics shall be considered plain surface textile fabrics provided the base fabric is smooth. The specimens shall be cut so that the metallic thread is parallel to the long dimension of the specimen and arranged so the test flame impinges on a metallic thread.
(iv)
Embroidery.
Embroidery on netting material shall be tested with two sets of preliminary specimens to determine the most flammable area (which offers the greatest amount of netting or embroidery in the 150 mm (6 in.) direction). One set of netting only shall be tested and the other set shall consist mainly of embroidery with the specimens cut so that the test flame impinges on the embroidered area. Test the most flammable area according to the plain surface textile fabric requirements. The full test shall be completed on a sample cut from the area that has the fastest burn rate.
(v)
Burn-out patterns.
Flat woven constructions with burn-out patterns shall be considered plain surface textile fabrics as defined in § 1610.2(k).
(vi)
Narrow fabrics and loose fibrous materials.
Narrow fabrics and loose fibrous materials manufactured less than 50 mm (2 in) in width in either direction shall not be tested. If a 50 mm by 150 mm (2 in by 6 in) specimen cannot be cut due to the nature of the item,
i.e.
hula skirts, leis, fringe, loose feathers, wigs, hairpieces, etc., do not conduct a test.
(2)
Plain surface textile fabrics:
(i)
Preliminary trials.
Conduct preliminary trials to determine the quickest burning direction. The specimen size shall be 50 mm by 150 mm (2 in by 6 in). Cut one specimen from each direction of the fabric. Identify the fabric direction being careful not to make any identifying marks in the exposed area to be tested. Preliminary specimens shall be mounted and conditioned as described in paragraphs (a)(2)(ii) through (iv) of this section and then tested following the procedure in paragraph (c) of this section to determine if there is a difference in the burning characteristics with respect to the direction of the fabric.
(ii)
Identify and cut test specimens.
Cut the required number of test specimens to be tested (refer to § 1610.7(b)(1)). Each specimen shall be 50 mm by 150 mm (2 in by 6 in), with the long dimension in the direction in which burning is most rapid as established in the preliminary trials. Be careful not to make any identifying marks in the exposed area to be tested.
(iii)
Mount specimens.
Specimens shall be placed in the holders, with the side to be burned face up. Even though plain surface textile fabrics are not brushed, all specimens shall be mounted in a specimen holder placed on the carriage that rides on the brushing device to ensure proper position in the
holder. A specimen shall be placed between the two metal plates of a specimen holder and clamped. Each specimen shall be mounted and clamped prior to conditioning and testing.
(iv)
Condition specimens.
All specimens mounted in the holders shall then be placed in a horizontal position on an open metal shelf in the oven to permit free circulation of air around them. The specimens shall be dried in the oven for 30 ±2 minutes at 105° ±3 °C (221° ±5 °F), removed from the oven and placed over a bed of anhydrous silica gel desiccant in a desiccator until cool, but not less than 15 minutes.
(v)
Flammability test.
Follow the test procedure in paragraph (c) of this section and also follow the test sequence in § 1610.7(b)(1).
(3)
Raised surface textile fabrics
—(i)
Preliminary trials.
The most flammable surface of the fabric shall be tested. Conduct preliminary trials and/or visual examination to determine the quickest burning area. The specimen size shall be 50 mm by 150 mm (2 in by 6 in). For raised surface textile fabrics, the direction of the lay of the surface fibers shall be parallel with the long dimension of the specimen. Specimens shall be taken from that part of the raised-fiber surface that appears to have the fastest burn time. For those fabrics where it may be difficult to visually determine the correct direction of the lay of the raised surface fibers, preliminary tests can be done to determine the direction of the fastest burn time. For textiles with varying depths of pile, tufting, etc., the preliminary test specimens are taken from each depth of pile area to determine which exhibits the quickest rate of burning. A sufficient number of preliminary specimens shall be tested to provide adequate assurance that the raised surface textile fabric will be tested in the quickest burning area. Preliminary specimens shall be mounted and conditioned as described below and tested following the procedure in paragraph (c) of this section.
(ii)
Identify and cut test specimens.
Cut the required number of specimens (refer to § 1610.7(b)(3)) to be tested. Each specimen shall be 50 mm by 150 mm (2 in by 6 in), with the specimen taken from the direction in which burning is most rapid as established in the preliminary trials and/or visual examination. Be careful not to make any identifying marks in the exposed area to be tested.
(iii)
Mount specimens.
Prior to mounting the specimen, run a fingernail along the 150 mm (6 in) edge of the fabric not more than 6.4 mm (0.25 in) in from the side to determine the lay of the surface fibers. All specimens shall be mounted in a specimen holder placed on the carriage that rides on the brushing device. The specimens shall be mounted with the side to be burned face up and positioned so the lay of the surface fibers is going away from the closed end of the specimen holder. The specimen must be positioned in this manner so that the brushing procedure described in paragraph (a)(3)(iv) of this section will raise the surface fibers,
i.e.
, the specimen is brushed against the direction of the lay of the surface fibers. The specimen shall be placed between the two metal plates of the specimen holder and clamped.
(iv)
Brush specimens.
After mounting in the specimen holder (and with the holder still on the carriage that rides on the brushing device) each specimen shall be brushed one time. The carriage is pushed to the rear of the brushing device, see Figure 7, and the brush, see Figure 8, lowered to the face of the specimen. The carriage shall be drawn forward by hand once against the lay of the surface fibers at a uniform rate. Brushing of a specimen shall be performed with the specimen mounted in a specimen holder. The purpose of the metal plate or “template” on the carriage of the brushing device is to support the specimen during the brushing operation. See Figure 9.
(v)
Condition specimens.
All specimens (mounted and brushed) in the holders shall be then placed in a horizontal position on an open metal shelf in the oven to permit free circulation of air around them. The specimens shall be dried in the oven for 30 ±2 minutes at 105° ±3 °C (221° ±5 °F) removed from the oven and placed over a bed of anhydrous silica gel desiccant in a desiccator until cool, but not less than 15 minutes.
(vi)
Conduct flammability test.
Follow the procedure in paragraph (c) of this
section and follow the test sequence in § 1610.7(b)(3).
(b)
Step 2—Refurbishing and testing after refurbishing.
(1) The refurbishing procedures are the same for both plain surface textile fabrics and raised fiber surface textile fabrics. Those samples that result in a Class 3, Rapid and Intense Burning after Step 1 testing in the original state shall not be refurbished and shall not undergo Step 2.
(i)
Dry cleaning procedure.

Testing plain surface textile fabrics after refurbishing.
The test procedure is the same as for Step 1—Testing in the original state described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section; also follow the test sequence § 1610.7(b)(2).
(3)
Testing raised fiber surface textile fabrics after refurbishing.
The test procedure is the same as for Step 1—Testing in the original state as described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section; also follow the test sequence in § 1610.7(b)(4).
(c)
Procedure for testing flammability.
(1) The test chamber shall be located under the hood (or other suitable enclosure) with the fan turned off. Open
the control valve in the fuel supply. Allow approximately 5 minutes for the air to be drawn from the fuel line, ignite the gas and adjust the test flame to a length of 16 mm (
5/8
in), measured from its tip to the opening in the gas nozzle.
(2) Remove one mounted specimen from the desiccator at a time and place it in position on the specimen rack in the chamber of the apparatus. Thick fabrics may require adjustment of the specimen rack so that the tip of the indicator finger just touches the surface of the specimen.
(3) Adjust the position of the specimen rack of the flammability test chamber so that the tip of the indicator finger just touches the face of the mounted specimen.
(4) String the stop thread through the guides in the upper plate of the specimen holder across the top of the specimen, and through any other thread guide(s) of the chamber. Hook the stop weight in place close to and just below the stop weight thread guide. Set the timing mechanism to zero. Close the door of the flammability test chamber.
(5) Begin the test within 45 seconds of the time the specimen was removed from the desiccator. Activate the trigger device to impinge the test flame. The trigger device controls the impingement of the test flame onto the specimen and starts the timing device. The timing is automatic and stops when the weight is released by the severing of the stop thread.
(6) At the end of each test, turn on the hood fan to exhaust any fumes or smoke produced during the test.
(7) Record the burn time (reading of the timer) for each specimen, along with visual observation using the test result codes given in § 1610.8. If there is no burn time, record the visual observation using the test result codes. Please note for raised-fiber surface textile fabrics, specimens should be allowed to continue burning, even though a burn rate is measured, to determine if the base fabric will fuse.
(8) After exhausting all fumes and smoke produced during the test, turn off the fan before testing the next specimen.

§ 1610.7
Test sequence and classification criteria.
(a)
Preliminary and final classifications.
Preliminary classifications are assigned based on the test results both before and after refurbishing. The final classification shall be the preliminary classification before or after refurbishing, whichever is the more severe flammability classification.
(b)
Test sequence and classification criteria.
(1) Step 1, Plain Surface Textile Fabrics in the original state.
(i) Conduct preliminary tests in accordance with § 1610.6(a)(2)(i) to determine the fastest burning direction of the fabric.
(ii) Prepare and test five specimens from the fastest burning direction. The burn times determine whether to assign the preliminary classification and proceed to § 1610.6(b) or to test five additional specimens.
(iii) Assign the preliminary classification of Class 1, Normal Flammability, and proceed to § 1610.6(b) when:
(A) There are no burn times; or
(B) There is only one burn time, and it is equal to or greater than 3.5 seconds; or
(C) The average burn time of two or more specimens is equal to or greater than 3.5 seconds.
(iv) Test five additional specimens when there is either only one burn time, and it is less than 3.5 seconds; or there is an average burn time of less than 3.5 seconds. Test these five additional specimens from the fastest burning direction as previously determined by the preliminary specimens. The burn times for the 10 specimens determine whether to:
(A) Stop testing and assign the final classification as Class 3, Rapid and Intense Burning, only when there are two or more burn times with an average burn time of less than 3.5 seconds; or
(B) Assign the preliminary classification of Class 1, Normal Flammability, and proceed to § 1610.6(b) when there
are two or more burn times with an average burn time of 3.5 seconds or greater.
(v) If there is only one burn time out of the 10 test specimens, the test is inconclusive. The fabric cannot be classified.
(2) Step 2, Plain Surface Textile Fabrics after refurbishing in accordance with § 1610.6(b)(1).
(i) Conduct preliminary tests in accordance with § 1610.6(a)(2)(i) to determine the fastest burning direction of the fabric.
(ii) Prepare and test five specimens from the fastest burning direction. The burn times determine whether to stop testing and assign the preliminary classification or to test five additional specimens.
(iii) Stop testing and assign the preliminary classification of Class 1, Normal Flammability, when:
(A) There are no burn times; or
(B) There is only one burn time, and it is equal to or greater than 3.5 seconds; or
(C) The average burn time of two or more specimens is equal to or greater than 3.5 seconds.
(iv) Test five additional specimens when there is only one burn time, and it is less than 3.5 seconds; or there is an average burn time less than 3.5 seconds. Test five additional specimens from the fastest burning direction as previously determined by the preliminary specimens. The burn times for the 10 specimens determine the preliminary classification when:
(A) There are two or more burn times with an average burn time of 3.5 seconds or greater. The preliminary classification is Class 1, Normal Flammability; or
(B) There are two or more burn times with an average burn time of less than 3.5 seconds. The preliminary and final classification is Class 3, Rapid and Intense Burning; or
(v) If there is only one burn time out of the 10 specimens, the test results are inconclusive. The fabric cannot be classified.
(3) Step 1, Raised Surface Textile Fabric in the original state.
(i) Determine the area to be most flammable per § 1610.6(a)(3)(i).
(ii) Prepare and test five specimens from the most flammable area. The burn times and visual observations determine whether to assign a preliminary classification and proceed to § 1610.6(b) or to test five additional specimens.
(iii) Assign the preliminary classification and proceed to § 1610.6(b) when:
(A) There are no burn times. The preliminary classification is Class 1, Normal Flammability; or
(B) There is only one burn time and it is less than 4.0 seconds without an SFBB test result code, or it is 4.0 seconds or greater with or without am SFBB test result code. The preliminary classification is Class 1, Normal Flammability; or
(C) There are no base burns (SFBB) regardless of the burn time(s). The preliminary classification is Class 1, Normal Flammability; or
(D) There are two or more burn times with an average burn time of 0.0 to 7.0 seconds with a surface flash only. The preliminary classification is Class 1, Normal Flammability; or

§ 1610.37
Reasonable and representative tests to support guaranties.
(a)
Purpose.
The purpose of this § 1610.37 is to establish requirements for reasonable and representative tests to support initial guaranties of products, fabrics, and related materials which are subject to the Standard for the Flammability of Clothing Textiles (the Standard, 16 CFR part 1610).
(b)
Statutory provisions.
(1) Section 8(a) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 1197(a)) provides that no person shall be subject to criminal prosecution under section 7 of the Act (15 U.S.C. 1196) for a violation of section 3 of the Act (15 U.S.C. 1192) if such person establishes a guaranty received in good faith to the effect that the product, fabric, or related material complies with the applicable flammability standard. A guaranty does not provide the holder any defense to an administrative action for an order to cease and desist from violation of the
applicable standard, the Act, and the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 45), nor to any civil action for injunction or seizure brought under section 6 of the Act (15 U.S.C. 1195).
(2) Section 8 of the Act provides for two types of guaranties:
(i) An initial guaranty based on “reasonable and representative tests” made in accordance with the applicable standard issued under the Act; and
(ii) A guaranty based on a previous guaranty, received in good faith, to the effect that reasonable and representative tests show conformance with the applicable standard.
(c)
Requirements.
(1) Each person or firm issuing an initial guaranty of a product, fabric, or related material subject to the Standard shall devise and implement a program of reasonable and representative tests to support such a guaranty.
(2) The term program of reasonable and representative tests as used in this § 1610.37 means at least one test with results demonstrating conformance with the Standard for the product, fabric or related material which is the subject of an initial guaranty. The program of reasonable and representative tests required by this § 1610.37 may include tests performed before the effective date of this section, and may include tests performed by persons or firms outside of the territories of the United States or other than the one issuing the initial guaranty. The number of tests and the frequency of testing shall be left to the discretion of the person or firm issuing the initial guaranty.
(3) In the case of an initial guaranty of a fabric or related material, a program of reasonable and representative tests may consist of one or more tests of the particular fabric or related material which is the subject of the guaranty, or of a fabric or related material of the same “class” of fabrics or related materials as the one which is the subject of the guaranty. For purposes of this § 1610.37, the term class means a category of fabrics or related materials having general constructional or finished characteristics, sometimes in association with a particular fiber, and covered by a class or type description generally recognized in the trade.
§ 1610.38
Maintenance of records by those furnishing guaranties.
(a) Any person or firm issuing an initial guaranty of a product, fabric, or related material which is subject to the Standard for the Flammability of Clothing Textiles (the Standard, 16 CFR part 1610) shall keep and maintain a record of the test or tests relied upon to support that guaranty. The records to be maintained shall show:
(1) The style or range number, fiber composition, construction and finish type of each textile fabric or related material covered by an initial guaranty; or the identification, fiber composition, construction and finish type of each textile fabric (including those with a nitrocellulose fiber, finish or coating), and of each related material, used or contained in a product of wearing apparel covered by an initial guaranty.
(2) The results of the actual test or tests made of the textile fabric or related material covered by an initial guaranty; or of any fabric or related material used in the product of wearing apparel covered by an initial guaranty.
(3) When the person or firm issuing an initial guaranty has conducted the test or tests relied upon to support that guaranty, that person or firm shall also include with the information required by paragraphs (a) (1) and (2) of this section, a sample of each fabric or related material which has been tested.
(b) Persons furnishing guaranties based upon class tests shall maintain records showing:
(1) Identification of the class test.
(2) Fiber composition, construction and finish type of the fabrics, or the fabrics used or contained in articles of wearing apparel so guaranteed.
(3) A swatch of each class of fabrics guaranteed.
(c) Persons furnishing guaranties based upon guaranties received by them shall maintain records showing the guaranty received and identification of the fabrics or fabrics contained in articles of wearing apparel guaranteed in turn by them.
(d) The records referred to in this section shall be preserved for a period of 3 years from the date the tests were performed, or in the case of paragraph
(c) of this section from the date the guaranties were furnished.
(e) Any person furnishing a guaranty under section 8(a) of the Act who neglects or refuses to maintain and preserve the records prescribed in this section shall be deemed to have furnished a false guaranty under the provisions of section 8(b) of the Act.
§ 1610.39
Shipments under section 11(c) of the Act.

(b) An article of wearing apparel or textile fabric shall not be deemed to fall within the provisions of section 11(c) of the Act as being shipped or delivered for shipment in commerce for the purpose of finishing or processing to render such article of wearing apparel or textile fabric not so highly flammable under section 4 of the Act, as to be dangerous when worn by individuals, unless the shipment or delivery for shipment in commerce of such article of wearing apparel or textile fabric is made directly to the person engaged in the business of processing or finishing textile products for the prearranged purpose of having such article of apparel or textile fabric processed or finished to render it not so highly flammable under section 4 of the Act, as to be dangerous when worn by individuals, and any person shipping or delivering for shipment the article of wearing apparel or fabric in commerce for such purpose maintains records which establish that the textile fabric or article of wearing apparel has been shipped for appropriate flammability treatment, and that such treatment has been completed, as well as records to show the disposition of such textile fabric or article of wearing apparel subsequent to the completion of such treatment.
(c) The importation of textile fabrics or articles of wearing apparel may be considered as incidental to a transaction involving shipment or delivery for shipment for the purpose of rendering such textile fabrics or articles of wearing apparel not so highly flammable under the provisions of section 4 of the Act, as to be dangerous when worn by individuals, if:
(1) The importer maintains records which establish that: (i) The imported textile fabrics or articles of wearing apparel have been shipped for appropriate flammability treatment, and
(ii) Such treatment has been completed, as well as records to show the disposition of such textile fabrics or articles of wearing apparel subsequent to the completion of such treatment.
(2) The importer, at the time of importation, executes and furnishes to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection an affidavit stating: These fabrics (or articles of wearing apparel) are dangerously flammable under the provisions of section 4 of the Act, and will not be sold or used in their present condition but will be processed or finished by the undersigned or by a duly authorized agent so as to render them not so highly flammable under the provisions of section 4 of the Flammable Fabrics Act, as to be dangerously flammable when worn by individuals. The importer agrees to maintain the records required by 16 CFR 1610.39(c)(1).
(3) The importer, if requested to do so by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, furnishes an adequate specific-performance bond conditioned upon the complete discharge of the obligations assumed in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section.
(d) The purpose of section 11(c) of the Act is only to permit articles of wearing apparel or textile fabrics which are dangerously flammable to be shipped or delivered for shipment in commerce for the purpose of treatment or processing to render them not dangerously flammable. Section 11(c)of the Act does not in any other respect limit the force and effect of sections 3, 6, 7, and 9 of the Act. In particular, section 11(c) of the Act does not authorize the sale or offering for sale of any article of wearing apparel or textile fabric which is in fact dangerously flammable at the time of sale or offering for sale, even though the seller intends to ship the article for treatment prior to delivery to the purchaser or has already done
so. Moreover, under section 3 of the Act a person is liable for a subsequent sale or offering for sale if, despite the purported completion of treatment to render it not dangerously flammable, the article in fact remains dangerously flammable.
§ 1610.40
Use of alternate apparatus, procedures, or criteria for tests for guaranty purposes.
(a) Section 8(a) of the Act provides that no person shall be subject to criminal prosecution under section 7 of the Act (15 U.S.C. 1196) for a violation of section 3 of the Act (15 U.S.C. 1192) if that person establishes a guaranty received in good faith which meets all requirements set forth in section 8 the Act. One of those requirements is that the guaranty must be based upon “reasonable and representative tests” in accordance with the applicable standard.
(b) Subpart A of this part 1610 prescribes apparatus and procedures for testing fabrics and garments subject to its provisions. See §§ 1610.5
1610.6. Subpart A prescribes criteria for classifying the flammability of fabrics and garments subject to its provisions as “Normal flammability, Class 1,” “Intermediate flammability, Class 2,” and “Rapid and Intense Burning, Class 3.” See § 1610.4. Sections 3 and 4 of the Act prohibit the manufacture for sale, importation into the United States, or introduction in commerce of any fabric or article of wearing apparel subject to the Standard which exhibits “rapid and intense burning” when tested in accordance with the Standard. See 16 CFR part 1609.
(c) The Commission recognizes that for purposes of supporting guaranties, “reasonable and representative tests” could be either the test in subpart A of this part, or alternate tests which utilize apparatus or procedures other than those in subpart A of this part. This § 1610.40 sets forth conditions under which the Commission will allow use of alternate tests with apparatus or procedures other than those in subpart A of this part to serve as the basis for guaranties.
(d)(1) Persons and firms issuing guaranties that fabrics or garments subject to the Standard meet its requirements may base those guaranties on any alternate test utilizing apparatus or procedures other than those in subpart A of this part, if such alternate test is as stringent as, or more stringent than, the test in subpart A of this part. The Commission considers an alternate test to be “as stringent as, or more stringent than” the test in subpart A of this part if, when testing identical specimens, the alternate test yields failing results as often as, or more often than, the test in subpart A of this part. Any person using such an alternate test must have data or information to demonstrate that the alternate test is as stringent as, or more stringent than, the test in subpart A of this part.
(2) The data or information required by this paragraph (d) of this section to demonstrate equivalent or greater stringency of any alternate test using apparatus or procedures other than those in subpart A of this part must be in the possession of the person or firm desiring to use such alternate test before the alternate test may be used to support guaranties of items subject to the Standard.
(3) The data or information required by paragraph (d) of this section to demonstrate equivalent or greater stringency of any alternate test using apparatus or procedures other than those in subpart A of this part must be retained for as long as that alternate test is used to support guaranties of items subject to the Standard, and for one year thereafter.
(e) Specific approval from the Commission in advance of the use of any alternate test using apparatus or procedures other than those in Subpart A is not required. The Commission will not approve or disapprove any specific alternate test utilizing apparatus or procedures other than those in subpart A of this part.
(f) Use of any alternate test to support guaranties of items subject to the Standard without the information required by this section may result in violation of section 8(b), of the Act (15 U.S.C. 1197(b)), which prohibits the furnishing of a false guaranty.
(g) The Commission will test fabrics and garments subject to the Standard for compliance with the Standard using the apparatus and procedures set forth
in subpart A of this part. The Commission will consider any failing results from compliance testing as evidence that:
(1) The manufacture for sale, importation into the United States, or introduction in commerce of the fabric or garment which yielded failing results was in violation of the Standard and of section 3 of the Act; and
(2) The person or firm using the alternate test as the basis for a guaranty has furnished a false guaranty, in violation of section 8(b) of the Act.
(Reporting requirements contained in paragraph (d) were approved by Office of Management and Budget under control number 3041-0024.)

# Subpart C—Interpretations and Policies
§ 1610.61
Reasonable and representative testing to assure compliance with the standard for the clothing textiles.
(a)
Background.
(1) The CPSC administers the Flammable Fabrics Act (“the Act”), 15 U.S.C. 1191-1204. Under the Act, among other things, the Commission enforces the Standard for the Flammability of Clothing Textiles (“the Standard”), 16 CFR part 1610. That Standard establishes requirements for the flammability of clothing and textiles intended to be used for clothing (hereinafter “textiles”).
(2) The Standard applies both to fabrics and finished garments. The Standard provides methods of testing the flammability of textiles, and sets forth the requirements that textiles must meet to be classified into one of three classes of flammability (classes 1, 2 and 3). § 1610.4. Class 1 textiles, those that exhibit normal flammability, are acceptable for use in clothing. § 1610.4(a)(1)
(2). Class 2 textiles, applicable only to raised-fiber surfaces, are considered to be of intermediate flammability, but may be used in clothing. § 1610.4(b)(1)
(2). Finally, Class 3 textiles, those that exhibit rapid and intense burning, are dangerously flammable and may not be used in clothing. § 1610.4(c)(1)
(2). The manufacture for sale, offering for sale, importation into the U.S., and introduction or delivery for introduction of Class 3 articles of wearing apparel are among the acts prohibited by section 3(a) of the Act, 15 U.S.C. 1192(a).
(3) CPSC currently uses retail surveillance, attends appropriate trade shows, follows up on reports of noncompliance and previous violations, and works with U.S. Customs and Border Protection in an effort to find textiles that violate CPSC's standards. The Commission has a number of enforcement options to address prohibited acts. These include bringing seizure actions in federal district court against violative textiles, seeking an order through an administrative proceeding that a firm cease and desist from selling violative garments, pursuing criminal penalties, or seeking the imposition of civil penalties for “knowing” violations of the Act. Of particular relevance to the latter two remedies is whether reasonable and representative tests were performed demonstrating that a textile or garment meets the flammability standards for general wearing apparel. Persons who willfully violate flammability standards are subject to criminal penalties.
(4) Section 8(a) of the Act, 15 U.S.C. 1197(a), exempts a firm from the imposition of criminal penalties if the firm establishes that a guaranty was received in good faith signed by and containing the name and address of the person who manufactured the guarantied wearing apparel or textiles or from whom the apparel or textiles were received. A guaranty issued by a person who is not a resident of the United States may not be relied upon as a bar to prosecution. 16 CFR 1608.4. The guaranty must be based on the exempted types of fabrics or on reasonable and representative tests showing that the fabric covered by the guaranty or used in the wearing apparel covered by the guaranty is not so highly flammable as to be dangerous when worn by individuals, i.e., is not a Class 3 material. (The person proffering a guaranty to the Commission must also not, by further processing, have affected the flammability of the fabric, related material or product covered by the guaranty that was received.) Under § 1610.37, a person, to issue a guaranty, should
first evaluate the type of fabric to determine if it meets testing exemptions in accordance with § 1610.1(d). (Some textiles never exhibit unusual burning characteristics and need not be tested.)
§ 1610.1(d). Such textiles include plain surface fabrics, regardless of fiber content, weighing 2.6 oz. or more per sq. yd., and plain and raised surface fabrics made of acrylic, modacrylic, nylon, olefin, polyester, wool, or any combination of these fibers, regardless of weight.) If no exemptions apply, the person issuing the guaranty must devise and implement a program of reasonable and representative tests to support the guaranty. The number of tests and frequency of testing is left to the discretion of that person, but at least one test is required.
(5) In determining whether a firm has committed a “knowing” violation of a flammability standard that warrants imposition of a civil penalty, the CPSC considers whether the firm had actual knowledge that its products violated the flammability requirements. The CPSC also considers whether the firm should be presumed to have the knowledge that would be possessed by a reasonable person acting in the circumstances, including knowledge that would have been obtainable upon the exercise of due care to ascertain the truth of representations. 15 U.S.C. 1194(e). The existence of results of flammability testing based on a reasonable and representative program and, in the case of tests performed by another entity (such as a guarantor), the steps, if any, that the firm took to verify the existence and reliability of such tests, bear directly on whether the firm acted reasonably in the circumstances.
(b)
Applicability.
(1) When tested for flammability, a small number of textile products exhibit variability in the test results; that is, even though they may exhibit Class 1 or Class 2 burning characteristics in one test, a third test may result in a Class 3 failure. Violative products that the Commission has discovered between 1994 and 1998 include sheer 100% rayon skirts and scarves; sheer 100% silk scarves; 100% rayon chenille sweaters; rayon/nylon chenille and long hair sweaters; polyester/cotton and 100% cotton fleece/sherpa garments, and 100% cotton terry cloth robes. Between August 1994 and August 1998, there have been 21 recalls of such dangerously flammable clothing, and six retailers have paid civil penalties to settle Commission staff allegations that they knowingly sold garments that violated the general wearing apparel standard.
(2) The violations and resulting recalls and civil penalties demonstrate the critical necessity for manufacturers, distributors, importers, and retailers to evaluate, prior to sale, the flammability of garments made from the materials described above, or to seek appropriate guaranties that assure that the garments comply. Because of the likelihood of variable flammability in the small group of textiles identified above, one test is insufficient to assure reasonably that these products comply with the flammability standards. Rather, a person seeking to evaluate garments made of such materials should assure that the program tests a sufficient number of samples to provide adequate assurance that such textile products comply with the general wearing apparel standard. The number of samples to be tested, and the corresponding degree of confidence that products tested will comply, are to be specified by the individual designing the test program. However, in assessing the reasonableness of a test program, the Commission staff will specifically consider the degree of confidence that the program provides.
(c)
Suggestions.
The following are some suggestions to assist in complying with the Standard:
(1) Purchase fabrics or garments that meet testing exemptions listed in § 1610.1(d). (If buyers or other personnel do not have skills to determine if the fabric is exempted, hire a textile consultant or a test lab for an evaluation.)
(2) For fabrics that are not exempt, conduct reasonable and representative testing before cutting and sewing, using standard operating characteristic curves for acceptance sampling to determine a sufficient number of tests.
(3) Purchase fabrics or garments that have been guarantied and/or tested by the supplier using a reasonable and representative test program that uses standard operating characteristic
curves for acceptance sampling to determine a sufficient number of tests. Firms should also receive and maintain a copy of the guaranty.
(4) Periodically verify that your suppliers are actually conducting appropriate testing.

# Codification Note:
Part 1611 is a codification of the previously unpublished flammability standard for vinyl plastic film which was derived from part of the requirements of Commercial Standard 192-53, issued by the Department of Commerce, effective on May 22, 1953. This flammability standard became mandatory through section 4(a) of the Flammable Fabrics Act, as amended in 1954, and remains in effect due to the savings clause (section 11) of Public Law 90-189. Paragraph 3.11 of the Commercial Standard, referred to in the 1954 act, has been codified as § 1611.3 16 CFR part 1609 containes the text of the Flammable Fabrics Act of 1953, as amended in 1954.

# Subpart A—The Standard

# Authority:
Sec. 4, Pub. L. 83-88, 67 Stat. 112, as amended, 68 Stat. 770 (15 U.S.C. 1193); sec. 11, Pub. L. 90-189, 81 Stat. 568.
§ 1611.1
Purpose and scope.
The purpose of this standard is to promulgate a minimum standard for flammability of vinyl plastic film which are subject to the requirements of the Flammable Fabrics Act.
§ 1611.2
General description of products covered.
The material covered is nonrigid, unsupported, vinyl plastic film, including transparent, translucent, and opaque material, whether plain, embossed, molded or otherwise surface treated.
a
a
Refer to sections 2 and 4 of the Flammable Fabrics Act of 1953, as amended in 1954, set out at 16 CFR part 1609 for the scope of this standard. The vinyl plastic film covered by Commercial Standard 192-53, as promulgated by the Secretary of Commerce was vinyl plastic film 10 mils and less in thickness (see § 1.3 of the voluntary standard). After CS 191-53 and CS 192-53 were made mandatory by section 4 of the act, the Federal Trade Commission clarified the scope of the standards in rules and regulations now found at §§ 1611.31(i) and 1611.33(b) (formerly 16 CFR 302.1(a)(9) and 302.3(b)).
§ 1611.3
Flammability—general requirement.
The rate of burning shall not exceed 1.2 in./sec as judged by the average of five determinations lengthwise and five determinations transverse to the direction of processing, when the material is tested with the SPI flammability tester in accordance with the method described in § 1611.4.
§ 1611.4
Flammability test.
(a)
Apparatus and materials.
The apparatus shall be constructed essentially as shown in figure 1 and shall consist of the following:
(1)
Specimen holder.
(i) A removable, flat, specimen-holding rack, the upper and lower sections of which are separate, shall have the shape and dimensions shown in figure 2 (sketch of sample-holding rack). The specimen is supported by tight closure of the upper and lower sections around the sides of the specimen. The center section of the rack contains an open U-shaped area in which burning of the specimen takes place. At the open end of the rack the forked sides are at an angle of 45° for the last inch. Thus, when the rack is slid into the cabinet on runners mounted at a 45° angle, the bent portion of the specimen adjacent to the igniter flame is vertical and the remainder is at 45°.
(ii) The switch actuators consist of suitable springs mounted on the side of
the rack, one just beyond the curved portion at the open end, and the other at the closed end of the U-shaped holder. The springs are depressed and held in position prior to ignition by means of cotton thread suitably wound across the specimen and securely attached to the rack. As flame reaches these threads, the springs are released, thus activating the microswitches of the stop clocks.
(2)
Igniter flame.
The igniter flame shall be produced at the tip of a No. 22 hypodermic needle jet. The igniter shall be so located in the cabinet that the tip of the needle is
9/16
in. from the surface of the specimen when the specimen rack is in place.
(3)
Cabinet.
The cabinet shall protect the igniter flame and specimen from air currents during tests, yet contain a suitable door or window for visual operation, provision for inserting the specimen holder, and adjustable vents to supply sufficient air for combustion of the specimen. It should also be capable of rapid ventilation following a test so that all combustion products can be removed between tests. A hood may be used if its exhaust fan is turned off during the test.
(4)
Timing mechanism.
The burning rate shall be determined by a stop clock through microswitches mounted on the specimenholder rack. The clock is started when the specimen flame burns the first thread, and is stopped when the thread at the upper end of the holder, 6 in. from the first thread, burns apart. The timing mechanism shall be capable of indicating time interval to 0.1 second.
(5)
Butane.
Unless otherwise specified, butane gas shall be used for the igniter flame.
(6)
Thread.
J.
P. Coats heavy-duty white cotton thread.
(7)
Microburner.
(b)
Test specimens.
(1) Test specimens shall be 3 in. in width and 9 in. in length. They shall be free from folds or wrinkles. Five specimens from each direction (machine and transverse) of a given material shall be tested.
(2)
Conditioning.
The conditioning procedure shall conform to the requirements of procedure B of ASTM D618, Tentative Methods of Conditioning Plastics and Electrical Insulating Materials for Testing.
(c)
Procedure.
(1) After preparing the specimens, the holder shall be threaded so as to depress the switch actuators (springs) at least
1/4
in. from the edge of the holder. Each actuator shall be separately threaded, the thread passing down through the J-slots and under the upper jaws so that the thread is adjacent to the specimen when the holder is closed.
(2) The specimen shall be inserted into the holder so that it extends down into the lock springs and is held firmly between the two wires at the open end of the burning channel. These wires insure that the end of the specimen is always the correct distance from the igniter flame. The sample shall be free from wrinkles or distortion when the holder is closed. The specimen should not extend beyond the outer edge of the lower plate, otherwise the rack may not slide freely on the slide channel on introducing it into the cabinet.
(3) Prior to introducing the specimen and holder into the cabinet, both electrical switches shall be set for automatic timing. The needle valve regulating the butane flow shall be adjusted to provide a
1/2
-in. flame. (When the specimen is in place its surface is
9/16
in. from the tip of the needle and the flame is just barely flattened against the specimen. This can be checked by using a specimen made of asbestos in place of a plastic specimen.)
(4) With the hood fan off, clocks zeroed, and the flame adjusted as mentioned, the door is closed and the specimen holder is then inserted at a constant rate. The holder should be allowed to slide down the rails by gravity, taking about one-half second to travel the length of the slide. Any hesitation in bringing the specimen holder fully into burning position may cause erroneous ignition results.
(5) The burning time shall be read from the stop clock and the rate of burning calculated. Results that deviate from the mean value of all tests should be rejected if the deviation of the doubtful value is more than five times the average deviation from the mean obtained by excluding the doubtful value. Such doubtful values shall be discarded and retests made.

# Note:
An interpretation, with respect to Ornamental Veils or Veilings, issued by the Federal Trade Commission at 32 FR 11850, Aug. 17, 1967, provides as follows:
Ornamental millinery veils or veilings when used as a part of, in conjunction with, or as a hat, are not to be considered such a “covering for the neck, face, or shoulders” as would, under the first proviso of section 2(d) of the Flammable Fabrics Act, cause the hat to be included within the definition of the term “article of wearing apparel” where such ornamental millinery veils or veilings do not extend more than nine (9) inches from the tip of the crown of the hat to which they are attached and do not extend more than two (2) inches beyond the edge of the brim of the hat.
Where hats are composed entirely of ornamental millinery veils or veilings such hats will not be considered as subject to the Flammable Fabrics Act if the veils or veilings from which they are manufactured were not more than nine (9) inches in width and do not extend more than nine (9) inches from the tip of the crown of the completed hat.
§ 1611.31
Terms defined.
As used in this part, unless the context otherwise specifically requires:
(a) The term
act
means the “Flammable Fabrics Act” (approved June 30, 1953, Pub. Law 88, 83d Congress, 1st sess., 15 U.S.C. 1191; 67 Stat. 111), as amended, 68 Stat. 770, August 23, 1954.

marketing or handling
means the transactions referred to in section 3 of the Flammable Fabrics Act, as amended in 1967.
(e) The terms
uncovered or exposed part
of an article of wearing apparel as used in section 4(a) of the act, means that part of such article of apparel which might during normal wear be open to flame or other means of ignition.

# Note:
The outer surface of an undergarment is considered to be an uncovered or exposed part of an article of wearing apparel, and thus subject to the act.
(f) The term
textile fabric
means any coated or uncoated material subject to the act, except film and fabrics having a nitro-cellulose fiber, finish, or coating, which is woven, knitted, felted or otherwise produced from any natural or man-made fiber, or substitute therefore, or combination thereof, of two inches or more in width, and which is in a form or condition ready for use in wearing apparel.
(g) The term
plain surface textile fabric
means any textile fabric which does not have an intentionally raised fiber or yarn surface such as a pile, nap, or tuft, but shall include those fabrics having fancy woven, knitted or flock printed surfaces.
(h) The term
raised surface textile fabric
means any textile fabric which has an intentionally raised fiber or yarn surface such as a pile, nap, or tufting.
(i) The term
film
means any nonrigid, unsupported plastic, rubber or other synthetic or natural film or sheeting, subject to the act, or any combination thereof, including transparent, translucent, and opaque material, whether plain, embossed, molded, or otherwise surface treated, which is in a form or condition ready for use in wearing apparel, and shall include film or sheeting exceeding 10 mils in thickness.
(j) The term
test
means the application of the relevant test method prescribed in the procedures provided under section 4(a) of the act.
(k) The term
initial test
means tests made under the procedures prescribed in section 4(a) of the act of specimens taken from two separate pieces of a textile fabric, or textile fabric with a nitro-cellulose fiber, finish or coating, having the same weight, construction and finish type, or from two separate runs of film having the same formula, finish, color, and thickness.
(l) The term
finish type
means a particular finish, but does not include
such variables as changes in color, pattern, print, or design, or minor variations in the amount or type of ingredients in the finish formulation. Examples of finish types would be starch finishes, resin finishes or parchmentized finishes.
(m) The definition of terms contained in section 2 of the act shall be applicable also to such terms when used in rules promulgated under the act.
§ 1611.32
General requirements.
(a) No article of wearing apparel or fabric subject to the act and regulations shall be marketed or handled if such article or fabric, when tested according to the procedures prescribed in section 4(a) of the act, is so highly flammable to be dangerous when worn by individuals.
(b)(1) In the application of the requirements of § 1611.3 of the Standard to any item of film, coated fabric, or wearing apparel, compute the average burn rate from five specimens burned transverse to the direction of processing and the average burn rate from an additional five specimens burned lengthwise to the direction of processing. If either the average burn rate from the five specimens burned transverse or the average burn rate from the five specimen burned lengthwise exceeds 1.2 inches per second, the test results shall be interpreted as a failure.
(2) To compute the average burn rate for each set of five specimens, at least two of the specimens must ignite and burn the stop cord for the specimen. However, if fewer than two specimens of any given set of five specimens ignite and burn the stop cord for the specimen, the test results shall be interpreted according to provisions of paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section:
(i) If no specimen ignites and burns the stop cord, the test results of that set of specimens shall be regarded as passing.
(ii) If only one specimen of the set of five specimens ignites and burns the stop cord with passing results, the results of that set of specimens will be regarded as passing.
(iii) If only one specimen of the set of five specimens ignites and burns the stop cord with failing results, test another set of five specimens from the same direction of processing. Compute the average burn rate for all ten specimens in the same direction of processing. If two or more of the 10 specimens ignite and burn the stop cord, average the results from all 10 specimens which ignited and burned the stop cord. If only one of the 10 specimens ignites and burns the stop cord, the test is inconclusive. The Commission will take no enforcement action on the basis of that test. The Commission may conduct additional testing of the article of film, coated fabric, or wearing apparel, but the results of any inconclusive test shall not be averaged with results obtained from any other test.

§ 1611.33
Test procedures for textile fabrics and film.
(a)(1) All textile fabrics (except those with a nitro-cellulose fiber, finish or coating) intended or sold for use in wearing apparel, and all such fabrics contained in articles of wearing apparel, shall be subject to the requirements of the act, and shall be deemed to be so highly flammable as to be dangerous when worn by individuals if such fabrics or any uncovered or exposed part of such articles of wearing apparel exhibits rapid and intense burning when tested under the conditions and in the manner prescribed in subpart A of this part, and identified as “Flammability of Clothing Textiles, Commercial Standard 191-53”.
(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, coated fabrics, except those with a nitro-cellulose coating, may be tested under the procedures outlined in part 1611, the flammability standard incorporated in the Commercial Standard promulgated by the Secretary of Commerce effective May 22, 1953, and identified as “General Purpose Vinyl Plastic Film, Commercial Standard 192-53”, and if such coated fabrics do not exhibit a rate of burning in excess of that specified in § 1611.3 they shall not be deemed to be so highly flammable as to be dangerous when worn by individuals.
(b) All film, and textile fabrics with a nitro-cellulose fiber, finish or coating
intended or sold for use in wearing apparel, and all film and such textile fabrics referred to in this rule which are contained in articles of wearing apparel, shall be subject to the requirements of the act, and shall be deemed to be so highly flammable as to be dangerous when worn by individuals if such film or such textile fabrics or any uncovered or exposed part of such articles of wearing apparel exhibit a rate of burning in excess of that specified in part 1611, the flammability standard incorporated in the Commercial Standard promulgated by the Secretary of Commerce effective May 22, 1953, and identified as “General Purpose Vinyl Plastic Film, Commercial Standard 192-53.”
§ 1611.34
Only uncovered or exposed parts of wearing apparel to be tested.
In determining whether an article of wearing apparel is so highly flammable as to be dangerous when worn by individuals, only the uncovered or exposed part of such article of wearing apparel shall be tested according to the applicable procedures set forth in section 4(a) of the act.

# Note:
If the outer layer of plastic film or plastic-coated fabric of a multilayer fabric separates readily from the other layers, the outer layer shall be tested under part 1611—Standard for the Flammability of Vinyl Plastic Film. If the outer layer adheres to all or a portion of one or more layers of the underlying fabric, the multilayered fabric may be tested under either part 1611 or Part 1610—Standard for the Flammability of Clothing Textiles. However, if the conditioning procedures required by § 1610.4(f) of the Standard for the Flammability of Cloth Textiles would damage or alter the physical characteristics of the film or coating, the uncovered or exposed layer shall be tested in accordance with part 1611.
Plastic film or plastic-coated fabric used, or intended for use, as the outer layer of disposable diapers is exempt from the requirements of the standard, provided that a sample taken from a full thickness of the assembled article passes the test in the standard (part 1610 or part 1611) otherwise applicable to the outer fabric or film when the flame is applied to the exposed or uncovered surface. See §§ 1610.36(f) and 1611.36(f).

§ 1611.35
Testing certain classes of fabric and film.
(a)
Fabric not customarily washed or dry cleaned.
(1) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, any textile fabric or article of wearing apparel, which, in its normal and customary use as wearing apparel would not be dry cleaned or washed, need not be dry cleaned or washed as prescribed in §§ 1610.4 (d) and (e) when tested under the Standard for the Flammability of Clothing Textiles if such fabric or article of wearing apparel, when marketed or handled, is marked in a clear and legible manner with the statement: “Fabric may be dangerously flammable if dry cleaned or washed.” An example of the type of fabric referred to in this paragraph is bridal illusion.
(2) Section 1610.4(a)(4) of the Standard for the Flammability of Clothing Textiles, which requires that certain samples shall be dry cleaned or washed before testing, shall not apply to disposable fabrics and garments. Additionally, such disposable fabrics and garments shall not be subject to the labeling requirements set forth in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
(b) A coated fabric need not, upon test under the procedures outlined in subpart A of part 1610, be dry cleaned as set forth in § 1610.4(d).
(c) In determining whether a textile fabric having a raised-fiber surface, which surface is to be used in the covered or unexposed parts of articles of wearing apparel, is so highly flammable as to be dangerous when worn by individuals, only the opposite surface or surface intended to be exposed need be tested under the applicable procedures set forth in section 4(a) of the act, providing an invoice or other paper covering the marketing or handling of such fabric is given which clearly designates that the raised-fiber surface is to be used only in the covered or unexposed parts of articles of wearing apparel.
(d)(1) Items which are subject to the Standard for the Flammability of Vinyl Plastic Film from which a test specimen 3 inches by 9 inches cannot be taken lengthwise to the direction of processing shall not be tested in the lengthwise direction.
(2) Items which are subject to the Standard for the Flammability of Vinyl Plastic Film from which a test specimen 3 inches by 9 inches cannot be taken transverse to the direction of processing shall not be tested in the transverse direction.

§ 1611.36
Application of act to particular types of products.
(a) Fabrics intended or sold for processing into interlinings or other covered or unexposed parts of articles of wearing apparel shall not be subject to the provisions of section 3 of the act:
Provided,
That an invoice or other paper covering the marketing or handling of such fabrics is given which specifically designates their intended end use:
And provided further,
That with respect to fabrics which under the provisions of section 4 of the act, as amended, are so highly flammable as to be dangerous when worn by individuals, any person marketing or handling such fabrics maintains records which show the acquisition, disposition and intended end use of such fabrics, and any person manufacturing articles of wearing apparel containing such fabrics maintains records which show the acquisition, and use and disposition of such fabrics. Any person who fails to maintain such records or to furnish such invoice or other paper shall be deemed to have engaged in the marketing or handling of such products for purposes subject to the requirements of the act and such person and the products shall be subject to the provisions of sections 3, 6, 7, and 9 of the act.
(b) Fabrics intended or sold for use in those hats, gloves, and footwear which are excluded under the definition of articles of wearing apparel in section 2(d) of the act shall not be subject to the provisions of section 3 of the act:
Provided,
That an invoice or other paper covering the marketing or handling of such fabrics is given which specifically designates their intended use in such products:
And provided further,
That with respect to fabrics which under the provisions of section 4 of the act, as amended, are so highly flammable as to be dangerous when worn by individuals, any person marketing or handling such fabrics maintains records which show the acquisition, disposition, and intended end use of such fabrics, and any person manufacturing hats, gloves, or footwear containing such fabrics maintains records which show the acquisition, end use and disposition of such fabrics. Any person who fails to maintain such records or to furnish such invoice or other paper shall be deemed to have engaged in the marketing or handling of such products for purposes subject to the requirements of the act and such person and the products shall be subject to the provisions of sections 3, 6, 7, and 9 of the act.
(c) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, handkerchiefs not exceeding a finished size of twenty-four (24) inches on any side or not exceeding five hundred seventy-six (576) square inches in area are not deemed “articles of wearing apparel” as that term is used in the act.
(d) Handkerchiefs or other articles affixed to, incorporated in, or sold as a part of articles of wearing apparel as decoration, trimming, or for any other purpose, are considered an integral part of such articles of wearing apparel, and the articles of wearing apparel and all parts thereof are subject to the provisions of the act. Handkerchiefs or other articles intended or sold to be affixed to, incorporated in or sold as a part of articles of wearing apparel as aforesaid constitute “fabric” as that term is defined in section 2(e) of the act and are subject to the provisions of the act which such handkerchiefs or other articles constitute textile fabrics as the term “textile fabric” is defined in § 1611.31(f).
(e) Where an article of wearing apparel has a raised-fiber surface which is intended for use as a covered or unexposed part of the article of wearing apparel but the article of wearing apparel is, because of its design and construction, capable of being worn with the raised-fiber surface exposed, such raised-fiber surface shall be considered to be an uncovered or exposed part of the article of wearing apparel. Examples of the type of products referred to in this paragraph are athletic shirts or so-called “sweat shirts” with a raised fiber inner side.
(f)
Multilayer fabric and wearing apparel with a film or coating on the uncovered or exposed surface.
Plastic film or plastic-coated fabric used, or intended for use, as the outer layer of disposable diapers is exempt from the requirements of the standard, provided that a full thickness of the assembled article passes the test in the standard otherwise applicable to the outer fabric or film when the flame is applied to the exposed or uncovered surface.

# Note:
An interpretation to § 302.6(c) issued by the Federal Trade Commission, 30 FR 16106, Dec. 28, 1965, provides as follows:
“§ 1611.36(c) does not exclude products from the act on the sole basis of the size, description or designation of such product.
“If, because of construction, design, color, type of fabric, or any other factor, a piece of cloth of a finished type or any other product of a finished type appears to be likely to be used as a covering for the head, neck, face, shoulders, or any part thereof, or otherwise appears likely to be used as an article of clothing, garment, or costume, such product is not a handkerchief and constitutes an article of wearing apparel as defined in and subject to the provisions of the Flammable Fabrics Act, irrespective of its size, or its description or designation as a handkerchief or any other term.”

[40 FR 59898, Dec. 30, 1975, as amended at 50 FR 7763, Feb. 26, 1985]
§ 1611.37
Reasonable and representative tests under section 8 of the Act.
Explanation:
Section 8 of the Act, among other things, provides that no person shall be subject to prosecution under section 7 of the Act for a violation of section 3 of the Act if such person establishes a guaranty received in good faith signed by and containing the name and address of the person by whom the wearing apparel or fabric guaranteed was manufactured or from whom it was received, to the effect that reasonable and representative tests made under the procedures provided in section 4(a) of the Act show that the fabric covered by the guaranty, or used, or contained in the wearing apparel, is not, under the provisions of section 4(a) of the Act, so highly flammable as to be dangerous when worn by individuals.
While one establishing a guaranty received in good faith would not be subject to criminal prosecution under section 7 of the Act, he, or the merchandise involved, would nevertheless, remain subject to the administrative processes of the Consumer Product Safety Commission under section 5 of the Act, as well as the injunction and condemnation procedures under section 6 of the Act.
The furnishing of guaranties is not mandatory under the Act. The purpose of this rule is to establish minimum requirements for the reasonable and representative tests on which guaranties may be based.
(a) The following shall constitute reasonable and representative tests, as that term is used in section 8 of the Act, for those textile fabrics which by reason of their composition, construction, finish type or weight may be tested upon a class basis. The word “class” as used in this section means a category of textile fabrics having certain general constructional or finished characteristics, sometimes in association with a particular fiber, and covered by a class or type description generally recognized by the trade. In certain instances the use of class tests is restricted by this section to a particular textile fabric of the same fiber composition, construction and finish type. The results of such class tests may be used by any person as a basis for furnishing guaranties under section 8 of the Act on all textile fabrics of the same class.
(1)
Plain surface textile fabrics weighing two ounces or more per square yard.
(i) One test of any plain surface textile fabric weighing two ounces or more per square yard, exclusive of metallic ornamentation, or one test of any fabric in a particular class of such fabrics, shall suffice for any such fabric or class of fabrics.
(2)
Plain surface textile fabrics weighing less than two ounces per square yard.
(i) When, on the initial test of any plain surface textile fabric weighing less than two ounces per square yard, such fabric exhibits a burning time of 3.5 seconds or more, such test may suffice for any fabric of the same fiber composition, construction and finish type. This class of fabric shall be tested at least once at intervals of not more than three months thereafter while in production. If, after four consecutive interval production tests have been made, none of such test results show the flame spread to have been less than 4.5 seconds, no further tests of such class of fabric need be made.
(ii) When, on the initial test of any plain surface textile fabric weighing less than two ounces per square yard, none of the specimens ignite, such initial test may suffice for any fabric of the same fiber composition, construction and finish type.
(iii) When, on the initial test of any plain surface textile fabric weighing less than two ounces per square yard, such fabric ignites but the flame is extinguished before the stop cord is burned, such test may suffice for any fabric of the same fiber composition, construction and finish type. This class of fabric shall be tested at least once at intervals of not more than one year thereafter while in production.
(3)
Certain raised fiber surface textile fabrics.
(i) When a test of any raised fiber surface textile fabric which has a dense cut pile of uniform short length or looped yarns, does not exhibit a surface flash and does not ignite, such test shall suffice for any such fabric having a dense cut pile of the same length or the same looped yarns and of the same fiber composition, construction and finish type. Examples of the types of fabrics referred to are velvet, velveteens, velours, and corduroys.
(ii) One test of any raised fiber surface textile fabric, the raised fiber surface of which consists of not less than ninety percentum (90%) protein fiber, or one test of any fabric in a particular class of such fabrics, shall suffice for any such fabric or class of fabrics.
(iii) When, on the initial test of any raised surface textile fabric which has a surface composed of looped yarns, such fabric exhibits a burning time in excess of 12 seconds, such test may suffice for any such fabric having the same looped yarns and of the same fiber composition, construction and finish type. An example of the type of fabric referred to is “terry cloth”.
(b) Raised fiber surface textile fabrics: When, on the initial test of a raised fiber surface textile fabric, such fabric:
(1)(i) Falls within Class 2 as provided in § 1610.3(a)(2)(i), the fabric shall be tested at least once at intervals of not more than one month while in production, or if the production exceeds 50,000 yards per month, the fabric shall be tested thereafter every 50,000 yards or fraction thereof.
(ii) If, after two such intervals, production tests have been made, the test results do not show the flame spread to have been less than 4 seconds, with the base fabric ignited or fused, the fabric shall be tested at least once at intervals of not more than three months while in production, or if the production exceeds 100,000 yards per three months, the fabric shall be tested thereafter every 100,000 yards or fraction thereof.
(2) Has a flame spread in excess of 7 seconds with the base fabric ignited or fused, the fabric shall be tested at least once at intervals of not more than six months thereafter while in production.
(3) Has a surface flash, but the base fabric does not ignite nor fuse, the fabric shall be tested at least once at intervals of not more than six months thereafter while in production.
(4) Does not have a surface flash and does not ignite, the initial test shall suffice.
(c) When, on initial test a film or a textile fabric with a nitro-cellulose fiber, finish or coating, does not exhibit a burning rate in excess of 1.2 inches per second, one test each year thereafter while in production shall be deemed reasonable and representative tests for such film or textile fabric.
(d) Reasonable and representative tests of fabrics and fabrics contained in articles of wearing apparel, subject to the act, produced prior to the effective date of the act, and which have not been tested under the applicable requirements of paragraphs (a), (b), or (c) of this section, shall be an initial test for each class of such fabrics, and such tests shall be applicable to all fabrics having the same fiber composition, construction and finish type.
(e) In the case of articles of wearing apparel which are not made from fabrics but directly from yarns, the fabrics contained in such articles of wearing apparel shall be tested by the testing requirements provided in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.
(f) Where fabrics or fabrics contained in articles of wearing apparel have not been tested when in production by the applicable testing requirements provided in paragraphs (a), (b) or (c) of
this section, one test of each such fabrics shall be made every 10,000 yards or fraction thereof, or of the fabric contained in one of every 5,000 of such articles of wearing apparel or fraction thereof, and these shall be deemed reasonable and representative tests of such fabrics.
(g) In the case of textile fabrics or textile fabrics contained in articles of wearing apparel having an appliqued, overstitched, or embroidered type of design of a loop, pile, nap, or tufted construction, tests shall be conducted according to paragraph (b) of this section on each type of applique, overstitch, or embroidery.
(h) If tests of any textile fabric made subsequent to the initial test show a burning time of another category, then such fabric shall be tested thereafter under the testing requirements of such changed time.
(i) The application of this section, insofar as it relates to the testing of plain surface textile fabrics or such fabrics contained in articles of wearing apparel weighing two ounces or more per square yard, shall be limited to fabrics made of fibers in use or capable of being used as of May 31, 1954. Such fabrics weighing two ounces or more per square yard made in whole or in part of fibers developed and used subsequent to May 31, 1954, shall be tested in accordance with the testing requirements set out in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
§ 1611.38
Maintenance of records by those furnishing guaranties.
(a) In order to properly administer and enforce section 8 of the act relating to guaranties, it is required that any person furnishing either a separate or continuing guaranty who has made the tests prescribed by the act and regulations shall keep and maintain records of such tests. The records to be maintained shall show:
(1) The style or range number, fiber composition, construction and finish type of each textile fabric and each textile fabric (including those with a nitro-cellulose fiber, finish or coating) used or contained in an article of wearing apparel covered by the guaranty, including a swatch of the fabric tested.
(2) The stock or formula number, color, thickness and general description of each film or film used in an article of wearing apparel covered by the guaranty, including a sample of the film tested.
(3) The results of the actual tests made on the textile fabric and film or the fabric and film used or contained in an article of wearing apparel.
(b) Persons furnishing guaranties based upon class tests shall maintain records showing:
(1) Identification of the class test.
(2) Fiber composition, construction and finish type of the fabrics, or the fabrics used or contained in articles of wearing apparel so guaranteed.
(3) A swatch of each class of fabrics guaranteed.
(c) Persons furnishing guaranties based upon guaranties received by them shall maintain records showing:
(1) The guaranty received and identification of the fabrics or fabrics contained in articles of wearing apparel guaranteed in turn by them.
(2) [Reserved]
(d) The records referred to in this section shall be preserved for a period of three years from the date the tests were performed, or in the case of paragraph (c) of this section the guaranties were furnished.
(e) Any person furnishing a guaranty under section 8(a) of the act who neglects or refuses to maintain and preserve the records prescribed in this section shall be deemed to have furnished a false guaranty under the provisions of section 8(b) of the act.
§ 1611.39
Shipments under section 11(c) of the act.
(a) The invoice or other paper relating to the shipment or delivery for shipment in commerce of articles of wearing apparel or textile fabrics for the purpose of finishing or processing to render them not so highly flammable as to be dangerous when worn by individuals, shall contain a statement disclosing such purpose.
(b) An article of wearing apparel or textile fabric shall not be deemed to fall within the provisions of section 11(c) of the act as being shipped or delivered for shipment in commerce for the purpose of finishing or processing to render such article of wearing apparel or textile fabric not so highly
flammable under section 4 of the act, as to be dangerous when worn by individuals, unless the shipment or delivery for shipment in commerce of such article of wearing apparel or textile fabric is made direct to person engaged in the business of processing or finishing textile products for the prearranged purpose of having such article of apparel or textile fabric processed or finished to render it not so highly flammable under section 4 of the act, as to be dangerous when worn by individuals, and any person shipping or delivering for shipment the article of wearing apparel or fabric in commerce for such purpose maintains records which establish (1) that the textile fabric or article of wearing apparel has been shipped for appropriate flammability treatment, and (2) that such treatment has been completed, as well as records to show the disposition of such textile fabric or article of wearing apparel subsequent to the completion of such treatment.
(c) The importation of textile fabrics or articles of wearing apparel may be considered as incidental to a transaction involving shipment or delivery for shipment for the purpose of rendering such textile fabrics or articles of wearing apparel not so highly flammable under the provisions of section 4 of the act, as to be dangerous when worn by individuals, if:
(1) The importer maintains records which establish (i) that the imported textile fabrics or articles of wearing apparel have been shipped for appropriate flammability treatment, and (ii) that such treatment has been completed, as well as records to show the disposition of such textile fabrics or articles of wearing apparel subsequent to the completion of such treatment.
(2) The importer, at the time of importation, execute and furnishes to the Bureau of Customs an affidavit stating
These fabrics (or articles of wearing apparel) are dangerously flammable under the provisions of section 4 of the Flammable Fabrics Act, and will not be sold or used in their present condition but will be processed or finished by the undersigned or by a duly authorized agent so as to render them not so highly flammable under the provisions of section 4 of the Flammable Fabrics Act, as to be dangerously flammable when worn by individuals. The importer agrees to maintain the records required by 16 CFR 1610.39(c)(1).
(3) The importer, if requested to do so by the Bureau of Customs, furnishes an adequate specific-performance bond conditioned upon the complete discharge of the obligations assumed in paragraphs (c) (1) and (2) of this section.

# Note:
The purpose of section 11(c) is only to permit articles of wearing apparel or textile fabrics which are dangerously flammable to be shipped or delivered for shipment in commerce for the purpose of treatment or processing to render them not dangerously flammable. Section 11(c) does not in any other respect limit the force and effect of sections 3, 6, 7, and 9 of the act. In particular, section 11(c) does not authorize the sale or offering for sale of any article of wearing apparel or textile fabric which is in fact dangerously flammable at the time of sale or offering for sale, even though the seller intends to ship the article for treatment prior to delivery to the purchaser or has already done so. Moreover, under section 3 of the act a person is liable for a subsequent sale or offering for sale if, despite the purported completion of treatment to render it not dangerously flammable, the article in fact remains dangerously flammable.

(b)
Specimens and sampling—General.
(1) The test criteria of § 1615.3(b) shall be used in conjunction with the following fabric and garment sampling plan, or any other approved by the Consumer Product Safety Commission that provides at least the equivalent level of fire safety to the consumer. Alternate sampling plans submitted for approval shall have operating characteristics such that the probability of Unit acceptance at any percentage defective does not exceed the corresponding probability of Unit acceptance of the following sampling plan in the region of the latter's operating characteristic curves that lies between 5 and 95 percent acceptance probability.
(2) Different colors or different print patterns of the same fabric may be included in a single Fabric or Garment Production Unit, provided such colors or print patterns demonstrate char lengths that are not significantly different from each other as determined by previous testing of at least three samples from each color or print pattern to be included in the Unit.
(3) Garments with different trim and findings may be included in a single Garment Production Unit providing the other garment characteristics are identical except for size, color, and print pattern.
(4) For fabrics whose flammability characteristics are not dependent on chemical additives or chemical reactants to fiber, yarns, or fabrics, the laundering requirement of paragraph (g)(4) of this section is met on subsequent Fabric Production Units if results of testing an initial Fabric Production Unit demonstrate acceptability according to the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section, Normal Sampling, both before and after the appropriate laundering.
(5) If the fabric has been shown to meet the laundering requirement, paragraph (g)(4) of this section, the garments produced from that fabric are not required to be laundered.
(6) Each Sample (five specimens) for all Fabric Sampling shall be selected so that two specimens are in one fabric direction (machine or cross-machine) and three specimens are in the other fabric direction except for the additional Sample selected after a failure, in which case, all five specimens shall be selected in the same fabric direction in which the specimen failure occurred.
(7) Fabric Samples may be selected from fabric as outlined in paragraph (c) of this section entitled Fabric Sampling, or, for verification purposes, from randomly selected garments.
(8) Multilayer fabrics shall be tested with a hem of approximately 2.5 cm. (1 in.) sewn at the bottom edge of the specimen with a suitable thread and
stitch. The specimen shall include each of the components over its entire length. Garments manufactured from multilayer fabrics shall be tested with the edge finish at the bottom edge of the specimen which is used in the garment.
(c)
Specimens and Sampling—Fabric Sampling.
A Fabric Production Unit (Unit) is either accepted or rejected in accordance with the following plan:
(1)
Normal Sampling.
Select one Sample from the beginning of the first Fabric Piece (Piece) in the Unit and one Sample from the end of the last Piece in the Unit, or select a sample from each end of the Piece if the Unit is made up of only one Piece. Test the two selected Samples. If both Samples meet all the Test Criteria of § 1615.3(b), accept the unit. If either or both of the Samples fail the 17.8 cm. (7.0 in.) average char length criterion, § 1615.3(b)(1), reject the Unit. If two or more of the individual specimens, from the 10 selected specimens fail, the 25.4 cm. (10 in.) char length, .3(b)(2), reject the Unit. If only one individual specimen, from the 10 selected specimens, fails the 25.4 cm. (10 in.) char length, § 1615.3(b)(2), select five additional specimens from the same end of the Piece in which the failure occurred, all five to be taken in the fabric direction in which the specimen failure occurred. If this additional Sample passes all the test criteria, accept the Unit. If this additional Sample fails any part of the test criteria, reject the Unit.
(2)
Reduced Sampling.
(i) The level of sampling required for fabric acceptance may be reduced provided the preceding 15 Units of the fabric have all been accepted using the Normal Sampling plan.
(ii) The Reduced Sampling plan shall be the same as for Normal Sampling except that the quantity of fabric in the Unit may be increased to 10,000 linear yards.
(iii) Select and test two Samples in the same manner as in Normal Sampling. Accept or reject the Unit on the same basis as with Normal Sampling.
(iv) Reduced Sampling shall be discontinued and Normal Sampling resumed if a Unit is rejected.
(3)
Tightened Sampling.
The level of sampling required for acceptance shall be increased when a Unit is rejected under the Normal Sampling plan. The Tightened Sampling shall be the same as Normal Sampling except that one additional Sample shall be selected and cut from a middle Piece in the Unit. If the Unit is made up of less than two pieces, the Unit shall be divided into at least two Pieces. The division shall be such that the Pieces produced by the division shall not be smaller than 100 linear yards or greater than 2,500 linear yards. If the unit is made up of two Pieces, the additional Sample shall be selected from the interior end of one of the Pieces. Test the three selected Samples. If all three selected Samples meet all the test criteria of § 1615.3(b), accept the unit. If one or more of the three selected Samples fail the 17.8 cm. (7.0 in.) average char length criterion, § 1615.3(b)(1), reject the Unit. If two or more of the individual specimens from the 15 selected specimens fail the 25.4 cm. (10 in.) char length, § 1615.3(b)(2), reject the unit. If only one individual specimen, of the 15 selected Specimens fails the 25.4 cm. (10 in.) char length, § 1615.3(b)(2), select five additional specimens from the same end of the same piece in which the failure occurred, all five to be taken in the fabric direction in which the Specimen failure occurred. If this additional Sample passes all the test criteria, accept the Unit. If this additional Sample fails any part of the test criteria, reject the Unit. Tightened Sampling may be discontinued and Normal Sampling resumed after five consecutive Units have all been accepted using Tightened Sampling. If Tightened Sampling remains in effect for 15 consecutive units, production of the specific fabric in Tightened Sampling must be discontinued until that part of the process or component which is causing failure has been identified and the quality of the end product has been improved.
(4)
Disposition of rejected Units.
(i) The Piece or Pieces which have failed and resulted in the initial rejection of the Unit may not be retested, used, or promoted for use in children's sleepwear as defined in § 1615.1(a) except after reworking to improve the flammability characteristics and subsequent retesting in accordance with the procedures in Tightened Sampling.
(ii) The remainder of a rejected Unit, after removing the Piece or Pieces the failure of which resulted in Unit rejection, may be accepted if the following test plan is successfully concluded at all required locations. The required locations are those adjacent to each such failed Piece. (Required locations exist on both sides of the “Middle Piece” tested in Tightened Sampling if failure of that Piece resulted in Unit rejection.) Failure of a Piece shall be deemed to have resulted in Unit rejection if Unit rejection occurred and a Sample or specimen from the Piece failed any test criterion of § 1615.3(b).
(iii) The Unit should contain at least 15 Pieces for disposition testing after removing the failing Pieces. If necessary for this purpose, the Unit shall be demarcated into at least 15 approximately equal length Pieces unless such division results in Pieces shorter than 100 linear yards. In this latter case, the Unit shall be demarcated into roughly equal length Pieces of approximately 100 linear yards each. If such a division results in five Pieces or less in the Unit for each failing Piece after removing the failing Pieces, only the individual Piece retest procedure (described subsequently) may be used.
(iv) Select and cut a Sample from each end of each adjoining Piece beginning adjacent to the Piece which failed. Test the two Samples from the Piece. If both Samples meet all the test criteria of § 1615.3(b), the Piece is acceptable. If one or both of the two selected Samples fail the 17.8 cm. (7.0 in.) average char length criterion, § 1615.3(b)(1), the Piece is unacceptable. If two or more of the individual Specimens, from the 10 selected specimens, fail the 25.4 cm. (10 in.) char length § 1615.3(b)(2), the Piece is unacceptable. If only one individual specimen, from the 10 selected specimens, fails the 25.4 cm. (10 in.) char length, § 1615.3(b)(2), select five additional specimens from the same end of the Piece in which the failure occurred, all five to be taken in the fabric direction in which the specimen failure occurred. If this additional Sample passes all the test criteria, the Piece is acceptable. If this additional Sample fails any part of the test criteria, the Piece is unacceptable.
(v) Continue testing adjoining Pieces until a Piece has been found acceptable. Then continue testing adjoining Pieces until three successive adjoining Pieces, not including the first acceptable Piece, have been found acceptable or until five such Pieces not including the first acceptable Piece, have been tested, whichever occurs sooner. Unless three successive adjoining Pieces have been found acceptable among five such Pieces, testing shall be stopped and the entire Unit rejected without further testing. If three successive Pieces have been found acceptable among five such Pieces, accept the three successive acceptable Pieces and the remaining Pieces in the Unit.
(vi) Alternatively, individual Pieces from a rejected Unit containing three or more Pieces may be tested and accepted or rejected on a Piece-by-Piece basis according to the following plan, after removing the Piece or Pieces, the failure of which resulted in Unit rejection. Select four Samples (two from each end) from the Piece. Test the four selected Samples. If all four Samples meet all the Test Criteria of § 1615.3(b), accept the Piece. If one or more of the Samples fail the 17.8 cm. (7 in.) average char length criterion, § 1615.3(b)(1), reject the Piece. If two or more of the individual Specimens from the 20 selected specimens, fail the 25.4 cm. (10 in.) char length, § 1615.3(b)(1), reject the Piece. If only one individual specimen, from the 20 selected specimens, fails the 25.4 cm. (10 in.) char length, § 1615.3(b)(2), select two additional Samples from the same end of the Piece in which the failure occurred. If these additional two Samples meet all the Test Criteria of § 1615.3(b), accept the Piece. If one or both of the two additional Samples fail any part of the Test Criteria, reject the Piece.
(vii) The Pieces of a Unit rejected after retesting may not be retested, used, or promoted for use in children's sleepwear as defined in § 1615.1(a) except after reworking to improve the flammability characteristics, and subsequent retesting in accordance with the procedures set forth in Tightened Sampling.
(5)
Records.
Records of all Unit sizes, test results, and the disposition of rejected Pieces and Units must be maintained by the manufacturer upon the effective date of this Standard. Rules and regulations may be established by the Consumer Product Safety Commission.
(d)
Specimens and Sampling—Garment Sampling.
(1)(i) The garment sampling plan is made up of two parts: (A) Prototype Testing and (B) Production Testing. Prior to production, prototypes must be tested to assure that the design characteristics of the garments are acceptable. Garment Production Units (Units) are then accepted or rejected on an individual Unit basis.
(ii) Edge finishes such as hems and binding are excluded from testing except that when trim is used on an edge the trim must be subjected to prototype testing. Seams attaching findings are excluded from testing.
(2)
Prototype Testing.
Preproduction prototypes of a garment style or type shall be tested to assure that satisfactory garment specifications in terms of flammability are set up prior to production.
(i)
Seams.
Make three Samples (15 specimens) using the longest seam type and three Samples using each other seam type 10 inches or longer that is to be included in the garment. Prior to testing, assign each specimen to one of the three Samples. Test each set of three Samples and accept or reject each seam design in accordance with the following plan:
(A) If all three Samples meet all the test criteria of § 1615.3(b), accept the seam design. If one or more of the three Samples fail the 17.8 cm. (7 in.) average char length criterion, § 1615.3(b)(1), reject the seam design. If three or more of the individual Specimens from the 15 selected specimens fail the 25.4 cm. (10 in.) char length, § 1615.3(b)(2), reject the seam design. If only one of the individual specimens from the 15 selected specimens fails the 25.4 cm. (10 in.) char length, § 1615.3(b)(2), accept the seam design.
(B) If two of the individual specimens from the 15 selected specimens, fail the 25.4 cm. (10 in.) char length, § 1615.3(b)(2), select three more Samples (15 specimens) and retest. If all three additional Samples meet all the test criteria of § 1615.3(b) accept the seam design. If one or more of the three additional Samples fail the 17.8 cm. (7 in.) average char length criterion, § 1615.3(b)(1), reject the seam design. If two or more of the individual specimens from the 15 selected specimens, fail the 25.4 cm. (10 in.) char length, § 1615.3(b)(2) reject the seam design. If only one of the individual specimens from the 15 selected specimens, fails the 25.4 cm. (10 in.) char length § 1615.3(b)(2) accept the seam design.
(ii)

) Make three samples (15 specimens) from each type of trim to be included in the garment. For trim used only in a horizontal configuration on the garment, specimens shall be prepared by sewing or attaching the trim horizontally to the bottom edge of an appropriate section of untrimmed fabric. Sleeve and neckline trim may not be tested in this manner. Where more than one row of trim is used on the garment, specimens shall be prepared with the same configuration (same number of rows and spacing between rows up to the limit of the specimen size) as the garment.
(
2
) For trim used in other than a horizontal configuration, specimens shall be prepared by sewing or attaching the trim to the center of the vertical axis of an appropriate section of untrimmed fabric, beginning the sewing or attachment at the lower edge of each specimen.
(
3
) For either configuration, the sewing or attachment shall be made in the manner in which the trim is attached in the garment.
(B)(
1
) Sewing or otherwise attaching the trim shall be done with thread or fastening material of the same composition and size to be used for this purpose in the garment and using the same stitching or seamtype. Trim used in the horizontal configuration shall be sewn or fastened the entire width (smaller dimension) of the specimen. Trim used in other than the horizontal configuration shall be sewn or fastened the entire length (longer dimension) of the specimen.
(
2
) Prior to testing, assign each specimen to one of the three samples. Test the sets of three samples and accept or reject the type of trim and design on
the same basis as seam design. A type of trim and design accepted when tested in a vertical configuration may be used in a horizontal configuration without further testing.
(3)
Production Testing.
A Unit is either accepted or rejected according to the following plan:
(i)(A) From each Unit select at random sufficient garments and cut three Samples (15 specimens) from the longest seam type. No more than five specimens may be cut from a single garment. Prior to testing, assign each specimen to one of the three Samples. All specimens cut from a single garment must be included in the same Sample. Test the three selected Samples. If all three Samples meet all the test criteria of § 1615.3(b), accept the Unit. If one or more of the three Samples fail the 17.8 cm. (7 in.) average char length criterion, § 1615.3(b)(1), reject the Unit. If four or more of the individual specimens, from the 15 selected specimens, fail the 25.4 cm (10 in.) char length, § 1615.3(b)(2), reject the Unit. If three or less of the individual specimens, from the 15 selected specimens, fail the 25.4 cm. (10 in.) char length, § 1615.3(b)(2), accept the Unit.
(B)(
1
) If the garment under test does not have a 10-inch seam in the largest size in which it is produced, the following selection and testing procedure shall be followed.
(
2
) Select and cut specimens 8.9 cm. (3.5 in.) wide by the maximum available seam length, with the seam in the center of the specimen and extending the entire specimen length. Cut three Samples (15 specimens). These specimens shall be placed in specimen holders so that the bottom edge is even with the bottom of the specimen holder and the seam begins in the center of the bottom edge. Prior to testing, assign each specimen to one of the three Samples. All specimens cut from a single garment must be included in the same Sample.
(
3
) Test the three Samples. If all three Samples pass the 17.8 cm. (7 in.) average char length criterion, § 1615.3(b)(1), and if three or less individual specimens fail by charring the entire specimen length, accept the Unit. If the Unit is not accepted in the above test, three Samples (15 specimens) of the longest seam type shall be made using fabric and thread from production inventory and sewn on production machines by production operators. The individual fabric sections prior to sewing must be no larger than 20.3 × 63.3 cm. (8 in. × 25 in.) and must be selected from more than one area of the base fabric. Test the three prepared Samples. Accept or reject the Unit as described previously in this subsection.
(
4
)
Disposition of Rejected Units.
Rejected Units shall not be retested, used, or promoted for use in children's sleepwear as defined in § 1615.1(a), except after reworking to improve the flammability characteristics and subsequent retesting in accordance with the procedures set forth in garment production testing.
(
5
)
Records.
Records of all Unit sizes, test results, and the disposition of rejected Units must be maintained by the manufacturer upon the effective date of this standard. Rules and regulations may be established by the Consumer Product Safety Commission.
(e)
Specimens and Sampling—Compliance Market Sampling Plan.
Sampling plans for use in market testing of items covered by this Standard may be issued by the Consumer Product Safety Commission. Such plans shall define noncompliance of a production Unit to exist only when it is shown, with a high level of statistical confidence, those production Units represented by tested items which fail such plans will, in fact, fail this standard. Production units found to be non-complying under the provisions of paragraph (e) of this section shall be deemed not to conform to this Standard. The Consumer Product Safety Commission may publish such plans in the
Federal Register.
(f)
Mounting and conditioning of specimens.
(1) The specimens shall be placed in specimen holders so that the bottom edge of each specimen is even with the bottom of the specimen holder. Mount the specimen in as close to a flat configuration as possible. The sides of the specimen holder shall cover 1.9 cm. (
3/4
in.) of the specimen width along each long edge of the specimen, and thus shall expose 5.1 cm. (2 in.) of the specimen width. The sides of the specimen holder shall be clamped with a sufficient number of clamps or shall be
taped to prevent the specimen from being displaced during handling and testing. The specimens may be taped in the holders if the clamps fail to hold them. Place the mounted specimens in the drying oven in a manner that will permit free circulation of air at 105 °C. (221 °F.) around them for 30 minutes.
4
4
If the specimens are moist when received, permit them to air dry at laboratory conditions prior to placement in the oven. A satisfactory preconditioning procedure may be found in ASTM D 1776-67, “Conditioning Textiles and Textile Products for Testing.” (“1970 Book of ASTM Standards,” part 24, published by the American Society for Testing and Materials, 1916 Race Street, Philadelphia, PA 19103.)
(2) Remove the mounted specimens from the oven and place them in the desiccator for 30 minutes to cool. No more than five specimens shall be placed in a desiccator at one time. Specimens shall remain in the desiccator no more than 60 minutes.
(g)
Testing
—(1)
Burner adjustment.
With the hood fan turned off, use the needle valve to adjust the flame height of the burner to 3.8 cm. (1
1/2
in.) above the highest point of the barrel of the burner. A suitable height indicator is shown in Engineering Drawing No. 6 and Figure 1.
(2) Specimen Burning and Evaluation. (i) One at a time, the mounted specimens shall be removed from the desiccator and suspended in the cabinet for testing. The cabinet door shall be closed and the burner flame impinged on the bottom edge of the specimen for 3.0±0.2 seconds. Flame impingement is accomplished by moving the burner under the specimen for this length of time, and then removing it.
(ii) When afterglow has ceased, remove the specimen from the cabinet and holder, and place it on a clean flat surface. Fold the specimen lengthwise along a line through the highest peak of the charred or melted area; crease the specimen firmly by hand. Unfold the specimen and insert the hook with the correct weight as shown in table 1 in the specimen on one side of the charred area 6.4 mm. (
1/4
in.) from the lower edge.
(iii) Tear the specimen by grasping the other lower corner of the fabric and gently raising the specimen and weight clear of the supporting surface.
5
Measure the char length as the distance from the end of the tear to the edge of the specimen exposed to the flame. After testing each specimen, vent the hood and cabinet to remove the smoke and/or toxic gases.
5
A figure showing how this is done is given in AATCC 34-1969, Technical Manual of the American Association of Textile Chemists and Colorists, vol. 46, 1970, published by AATCC, Post Office Box 12215, Research Triangle Park, N.C. 27709.
(3)
Report.
Report the value of char length, in centimeters (inches), for each specimen, as well as the average char length for each set of five specimens.
(4)
Laundering.
(i) The procedures described in sections 1615.4(b) through (g) shall be carried out on finished items (as produced or after one washing and drying) and after they have been washed and dried 50 times in accordance with sections 8.2.2, 8.2.3, and 8.3.1(A) of AATCC Test Method 124-1996 “Appearance of Fabrics after Repeated Home Laundering,” Technical Manual of the American Association of Textile Chemists and Colorists, vol. 73, 1997, which is incorporated by reference.

This incorporation by reference was approved by the Director of the Federal Register in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51. Items which do not withstand 50 launderings shall be tested at the end of their useful service life.
(ii) Washing shall be performed in accordance with sections 8.2.2 and 8.2.3 of AATCC Test Method 124-1996, using wash temperature V (60° ±3 °C, 140° ±5 °F) specified in Table II of that method, and the water level, agitator speed, washing time, spin speed and final spin cycle specified for “Normal/Cotton Sturdy” in Table III. A maximum
washer load shall be 3.64 Kg (8 pounds) and may consist of any combination of test samples and dummy pieces. Drying shall be performed in accordance with section 8.3.1(A) of that test method, Tumble Dry, using the exhaust temperature (66° ±5 °C, 150° ±10 °F) and cool down time of 10 minutes specified in the “Durable Press” conditions of Table IV. Alternatively, a different number of times under another washing and drying procedure may be specified and used, if that procedure has previously been found to be equivalent by the Consumer Product Safety Commission. Such laundering is not required of items which are not intended to be laundered, as determined by the Consumer Product Safety Commission.
(iii) Items which are not susceptible to being laundered and are labeled “dry-clean only” shall be drycleaned by a procedure which has previously been found to be acceptable by the Consumer Product Safety Commission.
(iv) For the purpose of the issuance of a guarantee under section 8 of the act, finished sleepwear garments to be tested according to paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section need not be laundered or drycleaned provided all fabrics used in making the garments (except trim) have been guaranteed by the fabric producer to be acceptable when tested according to paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section.

(1) Applicants seeking approval for use of an alternate laundering procedure under § 1615.4(g)(4)(ii) of the standard must submit the following information in writing to the Assistant Executive Director for Compliance, Consumer Product Safety Commission, Washington, DC 20207:
(i) A detailed description of the proposed alternate laundering procedure, and a 6 in. by 6 in. swatch of the fabric or garment for which the procedure is proposed.
(ii) Upon request of the Commission staff, any other information concerning the procedure and/or any machine used in connection with it.
(iii) With regard to each fabric or garment for which an alternate laundering procedure is sought, test data comparing twenty test specimens washed and dried by the proposed alternate laundering procedure and twenty specimens tested in accordance with the 50-wash and dry cycle procedure required in section 4(g)(4)(ii) of the standard. (For purposes of applications, similar fabrics or garments of different finishes shall be considered as different fabrics or garments and therefore separate test results must be submitted). Each group of twenty specimens upon which these data are based must be cut for testing, half in the machine direction and half in the cross machine direction. Where the applicant manufactures the fabric or garments in more than one plant, the data described in this paragraph must be submitted separately for the fabric or garments of each plant for which the proposed alternate laundering procedure is intended to be used. Subsequent applications for use of the same procedure for additional fabrics and garments may incorporate portions of the original application by reference, as appropriate.
(2) Applications shall be certified by the chief executive officer of the applicant or the official to whom the duty to certify has been delegated in writing. The Commission's Assistant Executive Director for Compliance must be notified in writing of any such delegation.
(c)
Use of alternate laundering procedure.
(1) The applicant may begin to use the alternate laundering procedure 30 days after the application is received by the Assistant Executive Director for Compliance unless notified to the contrary. The Assistant Executive Director for Compliance will normally furnish an applicant with written notice of approval within 30 days. The applicant may be notified that a longer time is needed for evaluation of the application, and in the discretion of the Assistant Executive Director for Compliance, may be authorized to use the alternate laundering procedure pending the final decision. The notice of approval shall be kept by the applicant with other written records required to be maintained in connection with the use of an alternate laundering procedure. So the applicants may ascertain that the application has been received and when the 30-day period has elapsed, it is suggested that applications be sent by certified mail, return receipt requested.
(2) As provided in detail in § 1615.32(e), applicants must immediately discontinue use of an alternate procedure, and must immediately notify the Assistant Executive Director for Compliance if there are test failures during revalidation testing.
(d)
Revalidation testing.
(1) In order to assure a continued satisfactory correlation between the alternate laundering procedure and the laundering procedure of the standard, applicants shall perform all the testing described in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section for fabrics or garments from current production at least once for every three-month period during which any of the fabric or garments are produced.
(2) If following initial approval, four successive comparisons of the alternate and the 50-cycle methods as described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, consistently show acceptable results under the criteria specified by paragraph (f) of this section, the Commission will deem such comparisons to be sufficient demonstration of the equivalence of the alternate laundering procedure with the 50 launderings required in the standard and further revalidation testing will not be required.
(3) Records of revalidation testing need not be submitted to the Assistant Executive Director for Compliance. However such records must be maintained in accordance with paragraph (h) of this section.
(e)
Revalidation testing failures.
(1) If revalidation testing for any fabric or garment does not meet the criteria of § 1615.32(f), the applicant must immediately discontinue use of the alternate laundering procedure for the fabric or garment and must immediately notify the Assistant Executive Director for Compliance in writing of the failure to meet the criteria. Also, the testing from the production unit from which the non-correlating samples were taken and the testing from subsequent production units (if any) must be repeated immediately using the laundering procedure prescribed in the standard. These repeat tests shall then be the tests applicable to such production unit(s) and the tests previously performed on the production unit(s) shall be considered invalid.
(2) When use of an alternate laundering procedure for a particular fabric or garment has been discontinued because of a failure to meet the criteria of § 1615.32(f), the alternate laundering procedure shall not be used again unless a new application for approval is submitted to the Assistant Executive Director for Compliance and that officer approves the application in writing. In addition to the other information required for applications, the additional application should give facts or reasons showing why the applicant believes the procedure should be considered reliable with the fabric or garments involved, in view of previous failure.
(f)
Commission criteria for evaluating applications.
(1) The Assistant Executive Director for Compliance will approve the alternate laundering procedure as equivalent to the laundering procedure specified in § 1615.4(g)(4)(ii) of
the standard if testing from 20 specimens laundered by the proposed alternate procedure yields as many or more char lengths in excess of five inches as does testing from the twenty specimens laundered by the 50-laundering cycle method prescribed in the standard.
(2) If the alternate laundering procedure yields fewer char lengths in excess of five inches than does the 50-wash and dry cycle, then the Assistant Executive Director for Compliance will not consider the alternate procedure to be equivalent, with the following exception: If the number of five-inch chars from the alternate procedure is within one of the number of five-inch chars obtained from the 50-cycle procedure, the applicant may repeat the original test with new specimens and if the combined results of both tests show the count of chars exceeding five inches from the alternate is equal to, or greater than, the count from the 50-wash cycle procedure, the Assistant Executive Director for Compliance will approve the alternate laundering procedure.
(g)
Commission testing for compliance.
(1) For the purpose of determining compliance with the standard, the Commission will rely on testing employing the laundering procedure now prescribed in section 4(g)(4)(ii) of the standard.
(2) The Commission may verify equivalency of any procedure submitted by independent testing and evaluation, by or on behalf of the Commission.
(h)
Recordkeeping.
The applicant must maintain a record of all applications filed with the Commission and of all equivalency tests for as long as the procedures to which they relate are in use and for three years thereafter.

§ 1615.35
Use of alternate apparatus, procedures, or criteria for testing under the standard.
(a) The Standard for the Flammability of Children's Sleepwear: Sizes 0 through 6X (the Standard) requires every manufacturer, importer, and other person (such as a converter) initially introducing items subject to the Standard into commerce to group items into production units, and to test samples from each production unit. See 16 CFR 1615.4 (b), (c) and (d). The Standard prescribes an apparatus and procedure for performing tests of fabric and garments subject to its provisions. See 16 CFR 1615.4 (a), (f), and (g). The Standard prescribes pass/fail criteria at 16 CFR 1615.3(b).
(b)(1) By issuance of this § 1615.35, the Commission gives its approval to any person or firm desiring to use test apparatus or procedures other than those prescribed by the Standard for purposes of compliance with the Standard, if that person or firm has data or other information to demonstrate that a test utilizing such alternate apparatus or procedures is as stringent as, or more stringent than, a test utilizing the apparatus and procedures specified in the Standard. The Commission considers a test utilizing alternate apparatus or procedures to be “as stringent as, or more stringent than” a test utilizing the apparatus and procedures specified in the standard if, when testing identical specimens, a test utilizing alternate apparatus or procedures yields failing results as often as, or more often than, a test utilizing the apparatus and procedures specified in the Standard.
(2) The data or information required by this paragraph (b) of this section as a condition to the Commission's approval of the use of alternate test apparatus or procedures must be in the possession of the person or firm desiring to use such alternate apparatus or procedures before the alternate apparatus or procedures may be used for purposes of compliance with the Standard.
(3) The information required by this paragraph (b) of this section must be retained by the person or firm using the alternate test apparatus or procedure for as long as that apparatus or procedure is used for purposes of compliance with the Standard, and for a period of one year thereafter.
(c) Written application to the Commission is not required for approval of alternate test apparatus or procedure, and the Commission will not act on any individual written application for
approval of alternate test apparatus or procedure.
(d) Use of any alternate test apparatus or procedure without the data or information required by paragraph (b), of this section, may result in violation of the Standard and section 3 of the Flammable Fabrics Act (15 U.S.C. 1192).
(e) The Commission will test fabrics and garments subject to the Standard for compliance with the requirements of the Standard using the apparatus and procedures set forth in the Standard. The Commission will consider any failing results from compliance testing as evidence of a violation of the Standard and section 3 of the Flammable Fabrics Act (15 U.S.C 1192).
(Reporting requirements contained in paragraph (d) were approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 3041-0027)
[48 FR 21315, May 12, 1983]
§ 1615.36
Use of alternate apparatus or procedures for tests for guaranty purposes.
(a) Section 8(a) of the Flammable Fabrics Act (FFA, 15 U.S.C. 1197(a)) provides that no person shall be subject to criminal prosecution under section 7 of the FFA (15 U.S.C. 1196) for a violation of section 3 of the FFA (15 U.S.C. 1192) if that person establishes a guaranty received in good faith which meets all requirements set forth in section 8 of the FFA. One of those requirements is that the guaranty must be based upon “reasonable and representative tests” in accordance with the applicable standard.
(b) Section 1615.31(f) of the regulations implementing the Standard for the Flammability of Children's Sleepwear: Sizes 0 through 6X (the Standard) provides that for purposes of supporting guaranties issued in accordance with section 8 of the FFA for items subject to the Standard, “reasonable and representative tests” are tests “performed pursuant to any sampling plan or authorized alternative sampling plan engaged in pursuant to the requirements of the Standard.”
(c) At § 1615.35, the Commission has set forth conditions under which the Commission will approve the use of test apparatus or procedures other than those prescribed in the Standard for purposes of demonstrating compliance with the requirements of the Standard. Any person or firm meeting the requirements of § 1615.35 for use of alternate test apparatus or procedure for compliance with the Standard may also use such alternate test apparatus or procedures under the same conditions for purposes of conducting “reasonable and representative tests” to support guaranties of items subject to the Standard, following any sampling plan prescribed by the Standard or any approved alternate sampling plan.
(d) The Commission will test fabrics and garments subject to the Standard for compliance with the Standard using the apparatus and procedures set forth in the Standard. The Commission will consider any failing results from compliance testing as evidence that the person or firm using alternate test apparatus or procedures has furnished a false guaranty in violation of section 8(b) of the FFA (15 U.S.C. 1197(b)).

§ 1615.61
[Reserved]
§ 1615.62
Policy and interpretation relative to items in inventory or as to recordkeeping requirements.
(a) The Standard for the Flammability of Children's Sleepwear: Sizes 0 through 6X (FF 3-71) (subpart A of this part) was published in the
Federal Register
on July 29, 1971, at 36 FR 14062
et seq.,
and amended in the
Federal Register
of July 21, 1972 (37 FR 14624). The Notice of Standard provided at 36 FR 14063 that “Items in inventory or with the trade on the effective date of the Standard are exempt. All concerned parties shall be required to maintain records that these items offered for sale after the effective date of the Standard are eligible for the exemption.”
(b) The Children's Sleepwear Standard was amended on July 21, 1972, at 37 FR 14624
et seq.
to incorporate a sleepwear sampling plan therein and to make certain nonsubstantive technical
corrections as to the test equipment. The effective date remained the same. In issuance of such amendment the Notice of Amendment specified at 37 FR 14625 that “It is emphasized that the only substantive change made to the standard involves the amendment necessary to include the sampling plan.”
(c) The Notice of Amendment did not repeat the language in the original 1971 Notice of Standard relative to items in inventory or as to recordkeeping requirements.
(d) Questions have arisen under this standard as to the application of the standard to goods manufactured outside the United States prior to the effective date of the standard on July 29, 1972, as to whether a person claiming the exemption specified in the standard must maintain records showing eligibility for exemption from the standard.
(e) In the Commission's view, the provisions of the July 29, 1971, Notice of Standard as to exemption of items of children's sleepwear in inventory or with the trade on the effective date of the standard and as to the necessity of maintenance of records to show eligibility for such exemption are in full force and effect.

# Note:
This policy was published by the Federal Trade Commission on January 31, 1973 (38 FR 3014). It continues in effect.
§ 1615.63
Policy regarding garment production unit identification.
No provision of § 1615.31(b)(8) prohibits placement of a garment production unit identification on a label containing other information. Provided, however, that when the garment production unit identification appears on a label containing other information, provisions of § 1615.31(b)(7) require that the garment production unit identification must be set forth separately from any other information appearing on the same label, and that information not required by the applicable enforcement regulation § 1615.31, but placed on the same label with the garment production unit identification, shall not interfere with the garment production unit identification.
§ 1615.64
Policy to clarify scope of the standard.
(a) The Standard for Flammability of Children's Sleepwear: Size 0 Through 6X (16 CFR part 1615) is applicable to any item of children's sleepwear in sizes 0 through 6X.
(1) The term
item
is defined in the Standard at § 1615.1(d) to mean “any product of children's sleepwear, or any fabric or related material intended or promoted for use in children's sleepwear.”
(2) The term
children's sleepwear
is defined in the Standard at § 1615.1(a) to mean “any product of wearing apparel up to and including size 6X, such as nightgowns, pajamas, or similar or related items, such as robes, intended to be worn primarily for sleeping or activities relating to sleeping. Diapers and underwear are excluded from the definition.”
(b) The Commission makes the following statement of policy regarding (1) the phrase “intended or promoted” as used in the definition of “item” in § 1615.1(d), and (2) the phrase “intended to be worn primarily for sleeping or activities related to sleeping” as used in the definition of “children's sleepwear” in § 1615.1(a).
(c) For enforcement purposes, the meaning of these phrases will be interpreted by the Commission in accordance with the following principles:
(1)
Sleepwear fabrics and related materials.
Whether fabric or related material is “intended or promoted” for use in children's sleepwear depends on the facts and circumstances in each case. Relevant factors include:
(i) The nature of the fabric and its suitability for use in children's sleepwear;
(ii) The extent to which the fabric or a comparable fabric has been sold to manufacturers of children's sleepwear for use in the manufacture of children's sleepwear garments; and
(iii) The likelihood that the fabric will be used primarily for children's sleepwear in a substantial number of cases.
(2)
Sleepwear garments.
Whether a product of wearing apparel is “intended to be worn primarily for sleeping or activities related to sleeping” depends on
the facts and circumstances present in each case. Relevant factors include:
(i) The nature of the product and its suitability for use by children for sleeping or activities related to sleeping;
(ii) The manner in which the product is distributed and promoted; and
(iii) The likelihood that the product will be used by children primarily for sleeping or activities related to sleeping in a substantial number of cases.
(3) The factors set forth in this policy statement are guidelines only, and are not elements of the definition of the term “children's sleepwear” in § 1615.1(a) of the Standard. For this reason, a particular fabric or garment may meet the definition of “children's sleepwear” set forth in the Standard, even though all factors listed in this policy statement are not present.
(d) Retailers, distributors, and wholesalers, as well as manufacturers, importers, and other persons (such as converters) introducing a fabric or garment into commerce which does not meet the requirements of the flammability standards for children's sleepwear, have an obligation not to promote or sell such fabric or garment for use as an item of children's sleepwear. Also, retailers, distributors, and wholesalers are advised not to advertise, promote, or sell as an item of children's sleepwear any item which a manufacturer, importer, or other person (such as a converter) introducing the item into commerce has indicated by label, invoice, or, otherwise, does not meet the requirements of the children's sleepwear flammability standards and is not intended or suitable for use as sleepwear. “Infant garments” as defined by § 1615.1(c) and “tight-fitting” garments as defined by § 1615.1(o) are exempt from the standard which requires flame resistance. They may be marketed as sleepwear for purposes of this section. Additionally, retailers are advised:
(1) To segregate, by placement in different parts of a department or store, fabrics and garments covered by the children's sleepwear standards from all fabrics and garments that are beyond the scope of the children's sleepwear standards but which resemble items of children's sleepwear;
(2) To utilize store display signs indicating the distinction between types of fabrics and garments, for example by indicating which are sleepwear items and which are not; and
(3) To avoid the advertisement or promotion of a fabric or garment that does not comply with the children's sleepwear flammability standard in a manner that may cause the item to be viewed by the consumer as an item of children's sleepwear.

§ 1616.3
General requirements.
(a)
Summary of test method.
Conditioned specimens are suspended one at a time vertically in holders in a prescribed cabinet and subjected to a standard flame along their bottom edges for a specified time under controlled conditions. The char lengths are recorded.
(b)
Test criteria.
The test criteria when the testing is done in accordance with § 1616.4
Sampling and acceptance procedures
and § 1616.5
Test procedures
are:
(1)
Average char length.
The average char length of five specimens shall not exceed 17.8 cm. (7.0 in.).
(2)
Full-specimen burn.
No individual specimen shall have a char length of 25.4±0.5 cm. (10±0.2 in.).
(c) Details of the number of specimens which must meet the above test criteria for unit acceptance is specified in § 1616.4.
§ 1616.4
Sampling and acceptance procedures.
(a)
General.
(1) The test criteria of § 1616.3(b) shall be used in conjunction with the following fabric and garment sampling plan. The Consumer Product Safety Commission may consider and approve other sampling plans that provide at least the equivalent level of fire safety to the consumer, provided such alternate sampling plans have operating characteristics such that the probability of unit acceptance at any percentage defective does not exceed the corresponding probability of unit acceptance of the following sampling plan in the region of the latter's operating characteristic curves that lies between 5 and 95 percent acceptance probability. Alternate sampling plans approved for one manufacturer may be used by other manufacturers without prior Consumer Product Safety Commission approval.
(2) Different colors or different print patterns of the same fabric may be included in a single fabric or garment production unit, provided such colors or print patterns demonstrate char lengths that are not significantly different from each other as determined by previous testing of at least three samples from each color or print pattern to be included in the unit.
(3) Garments with different trim and findings may be included in a single garment production unit provided the other garment characteristics are identical except for size, color, and print pattern.
(4) For fabrics whose flammability characteristics are not dependent on chemical additives or chemical reactants to polymer, fiber, yarns, or fabrics, the laundering requirement of § 1616.5(c)(4) is met on subsequent fabric production units if results of testing an
initial fabric production unit demonstrate acceptability according to the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section,
Normal sampling,
both before and after the appropriate laundering.
(5) If the fabric has been shown to meet the laundering requirement, § 1616.5(c)(4), the garments produced from that fabric are not required to be laundered prior to testing.
(6) Each sample (five specimens), for Fabric Sampling shall be selected so that two specimens are in one fabric direction (machine or cross-machine) and three specimens are in the other fabric direction, except for the additional sample selected after a failure, in which case all five specimens shall be selected in the fabric direction in which the specimen failure occurred.
(7) Fabric samples may be selected from fabric as outlined in paragraph (b) of this section,
Fabric sampling
or, for verification purposes, from randomly selected garments.
(8) Multi-layer fabrics shall be tested with a hem of approximately 2.5 cm. (1 in.) sewn at the bottom edge of the specimen with a suitable thread and stitch. The specimen shall include each of the components over its entire length. Garments manufactured from multi-layer fabrics shall be tested with the edge finish which is used in the garment at the bottom edge of the specimen.
(b)
Fabric sampling.
A fabric production unit (unit) is either accepted or rejected in accordance with the following plan:
(1)
Normal sampling.
Select one sample from the beginning of the first fabric piece (piece) in the unit and one sample from the end of the last piece in the unit, or select a sample from each end of the piece if the unit is made up of only one piece. Test the two selected samples. If both samples meet all the test criteria of § 1616.3(b), accept the unit. If either or both of the samples fail the 17.8 cm. (7.0 in.) average char length criterion, § 1616.3(b)(1), reject the unit. If two or more of the individual specimens, from the 10 selected specimens, fail the 25.4 cm. (10 in.) char length criterion, § 1616.3(b)(2), reject the unit. If only one individual specimen, from the 10 selected specimens, fails the 25.4 cm. (10 in.) char length criterion, § 1616.3(b)(2), select five additional specimens from the same end of the piece in which the failure occurred, all five to be taken in the fabric direction in which the specimen failure occurred. If this additional sample passes all the test criteria, accept the unit. If this additional sample fails any part of the test criteria, reject the unit.
(2)
Reduced sampling.
(i) The level of sampling required for fabric acceptance may be reduced provided the preceding 15 units of the fabric have all been accepted using the Normal Sampling Plan.
(ii) The reduced Sampling Plan shall be the same as for Normal Sampling except that the quantity of fabric in the unit may be increased to 9,200 linear m. (10,000 linear yds.)
(iii) Select and test two samples in the same manner as in Normal Sampling. Accept or reject the unit on the same basis as with Normal Sampling.
(iv) Reduced Sampling shall be discontinued and Normal Sampling resumed if a unit is rejected.
(3)
Tightened sampling.
Tightened sampling shall be used when a unit is rejected under the Normal Sampling Plan. The Tightened Sampling shall be the same as Normal Sampling except that one additional sample shall be selected and cut from a middle piece in the unit. If the unit is made up of less than two pieces, the unit shall be divided into at least two pieces. The division shall be such that the pieces produced by the division shall not be smaller than 92 linear m. (100 linear yds.) or greater than 2,300 linear m. (2,500 linear yds.). If the unit is made up of two pieces, the additional sample shall be selected from the interior end of one of the pieces. Test the three selected samples. If all three selected samples meet all the test criteria of § 1616.3(b), accept the unit. If one or more of the three selected samples fail the 17.8 cm. (7.0 in.) average char length criterion, § 1616.3(b)(1), reject the unit. If two or more of the individual specimens, from the 15 selected specimens, fail the 25.4 cm. (10 in.) char length criterion, § 1616.3(b)(2), reject the unit. If only one individual specimen, from the 15 selected specimens, fails the 25.4 cm. (10 in.) char length
criterion, § 1616.3(b)(2), select five additional specimens from the same end of the same piece in which the failure occurred, all five to be taken in the fabric direction in which the specimen failure occurred. If this additional sample passes all the test criteria, accept the unit. If this additional sample fails any part of the test criteria, reject the unit. Tightened Sampling may be discontinued and Normal Sampling resumed after five consecutive units have all been accepted using Tightened Sampling. If Tightened Sampling remains in effect for 15 consecutive units, production of the specific fabric in Tightened Sampling must be discontinued until that part of the process or component which is causing failure has been identified and the quality of the end product has been improved.
(4)
Disposition of rejected units.
(i) The piece or pieces which have failed and resulted in the initial rejection of the unit may not be retested, used, or promoted for use in children's sleepwear as defined in §§ 1616.2(a) and 1615.1(a) of the (Standard for the Flammability of Children's Sleepwear: Sizes 0 through 6X) (FF 3-71) (subpart A of part 1615 of this chapter) except after reworking to improve the flammability characteristics and subsequent retesting and acceptance in accordance with the procedures in
Tightened Sampling.
(ii) The remainder of a rejected unit, after removing the piece or pieces, the failure of which resulted in unit rejection, may be accepted if the following test plan is successfully concluded at all required locations. The required locations are those adjacent to each such failed piece. (Required locations exist on both sides of the “Middle Piece” tested in Tightened Sampling if failure of that piece resulted in unit rejection). Failure of a piece shall be deemed to have resulted in unit rejection if unit rejection occurred and a sample or specimen from the piece failed any test criterion of § 1616.3(b).
(iii) The unit should contain at least 15 pieces for disposition testing after removing the failing pieces. If necessary for this purpose, the unit shall be demarcated into at least 15 approximately equal length pieces unless such division results in pieces shorter than 92 linear m. (100 linear yds.). In this latter case, the unit shall be demarcated into roughly equal length pieces of approximately 92 linear m. (100 linear yds.) each. If such a division results in five pieces or less in the unit for each failing piece after removing the failing pieces, only the individual pieces retest procedure [described in paragraph (b)(4)(vi) of this section] may be used.
(iv) Select and cut a sample from each end of each adjoining piece beginning adjacent to the piece which failed. Test the two samples from the piece. If both samples meet all the test criteria of § 1616.3(b), the piece is acceptable. If one or both of the two selected samples fail the 17.8 cm. (7.0 in.) average char length criterion, § 1616.3(b)(1), the piece is unacceptable. If two or more of the individual specimens, from the 10 selected specimens, fail the 25.4 cm. (10 in.) char length criterion, § 1616.3(b)(2), the piece is unacceptable. If only one individual specimen, from the 10 selected specimens, fails the 25.4 cm. (10 in.) char length criterion, § 1616.3(b)(2), select five additional specimens from the same end of the piece in which the failure occurred, all five to be taken in the fabric direction in which the specimen failure occurred. If this additional sample passes all the test criteria, the piece is acceptable. If this additional sample fails any part of the test criteria, the piece is unacceptable.
(v) Continue testing adjoining pieces until a piece has been found acceptable. Then continue testing adjoining pieces until three successive adjoining pieces, not including the first acceptable piece, have been found acceptable or until five such pieces, not including the first acceptable piece, have been tested, whichever occurs sooner. Unless three successive adjoining pieces have been found acceptable among five such pieces, testing shall be stopped and the entire unit rejected without further testing. If three successive pieces have been found acceptable among five such pieces, accept the three successive acceptable pieces and the remaining pieces in the unit.
(vi)(A) Alternately, individual pieces from a rejected unit containing three or more pieces may be tested and accepted or rejected on a piece by piece basis according to the following plan,
after removing the piece or pieces, the failure of which resulted in unit rejection.
(B) Select four samples (two from each end) from the piece. Test the four selected samples. If all four samples meet all the test criteria of § 1616.3(b), accept the piece. If one or more of the samples fail the 17.8 cm. (7.0 in.) average char length criterion, § 1616.3(b)(1), reject the piece. If two or more of the individual specimens, from the 20 selected specimens, fail the 25.4 cm. (10 in.) char length criterion, § 1616.3(b)(2), reject the piece. If only one individual specimen, from the 20 selected specimens, fails the 25.4 cm. (10 in.) char length criterion, § 1613.3(b)(2), select two additional samples from the same end of the piece in which the failure occurred. If these additional two samples meet all the test criteria of § 1616.3(b), accept the piece. If one or both of the two additional samples fail any part of the test criteria, reject the piece.
(vii) The pieces of a unit rejected after retesting may not be retested, used, or promoted for use in children's sleepwear as defined in §§ 1616.2(a) and 1615.1(a) of the Standard for the Flammability of Children's Sleepwear: Sizes 0 through 6X (FF 3-71) (subpart A of part 1615 of this chapter) except after reworking to improve the flammability characteristics, and subsequent retesting in accordance with the procedures set forth in
Tightened Sampling.
(5)
Records.
Written and physical records related to all tests performed under this Standard must be maintained by the manufacturer, importer, or other persons initially introducing items into commerce which are subject to this Standard, beginning on the effective date of the Standard. Such records shall include results of all tests, sizes of all units, and the disposition of all rejected pieces and units. Rules and regulations regarding recordkeeping may be established by the Consumer Product Safety Commission.
(c)
Garment sampling.
(1)(i) The Garment Sampling Plan is made up of two parts: (A) Prototype Testing and (B) Production Testing. Prior to production, prototypes must be tested to assure that the design characteristics of the garment are acceptable. Garment production units (units) are then accepted or rejected on an individual unit basis.
(ii) Edge finishes such as hems, except in multi-layer fabrics, and binding are excluded from testing except that when trim is used on an edge the trim must be subjected to prototype testing. Seams attaching bindings are excluded from testing.
(2)
Prototype testing.
Pre-production prototype testing of each seam and trim specification to be included in each garment in a garment production unit shall be conducted to assure that garment specifications meet the flammability requirements of the Standard prior to production.
(i)
Seams.
Make three samples (15 specimens) using the longest seam type and three samples using each other seam type 10 inches or longer that is to be included in the garment. For purposes of recordkeeping, prior to testing, assign each specimen to one of the three samples. Test each set of three samples and accept or reject each seam design in accordance with the following plan:
(A) If all three samples meet all the test criteria of § 1616.3(b), accept the seam design. If one or more of the three samples fail the 17.8 cm. (7.0 in.) average char length criterion, § 1616.3(b)(1), reject the seam design. If three or more of the individual specimens from the 15 selected specimens fail the 25.4 cm. (10 in.) char length criterion, § 1616.3(b)(2), reject the seam design. If only one of the individual specimens from the 15 selected specimens fails the 25.4 cm. (10 in.) char length criterion, § 1616.3(b)(2), accept the seam design.
(B) If two of the individual specimens; from the 15 selected specimens, fail the 25.4 cm. (10 in.) char length criterion, § 1616.3(b)(2), select three more samples (15 specimens) and retest. If all three additional samples meet all the test criteria of § 1616.3(b), accept the seam design. If one or more of the three additional samples fail the 17.8 cm. (7.0 in.) average char length criterion, § 1616.3(b)(1), reject the seam design. If two or more of the individual specimens, from the 15 selected additional specimens, fail the 25.4 cm. (10 in.) char length criterion, § 1616.3(b)(2), reject the seam design. If only one of
the individual specimens, from the 15 selected additional specimens, fails the 25.4 cm. (10 in.) char length criterion, § 1616.3(b)(2), accept the seam design.
(ii)
Trim.
(A) Make three samples (15 specimens) from each type of trim to be included in the garment. For trim used only in a horizontal configuration on the garment, specimens shall be prepared by sewing or attaching the trim horizontally to the bottom edge of an appropriate section of untrimmed fabric. Sleeve and necking trim may not be tested in this manner. Where more than one row of trim is used on the garment, specimens shall be prepared with the same configuration (same number of rows and spacing between rows up to the limit of the specimen size) as the garment. For trim used in other than a horizontal configuration, specimens shall be prepared by sewing or attaching the trim to the center of the vertical axis of an appropriate section of untrimmed fabric, beginning the sewing or attachment at the lower edge of each specimen. For either configuration, the sewing or attachment shall be made in the manner in which the trim is attached in the garment.
(B) Sewing or otherwise attaching the trim shall be done with thread or fastening material of the same composition and size to be used for this purpose in the garment and using the same stitching or seamtype. Trim used in the horizontal configuration shall be sewn or fastened the entire width (smaller dimension) of the specimen. Trim used in other than the horizontal configuration shall be sewn or fastened the entire length (longer dimension) of the specimen. Prior to testing, assign each specimen to one of the three samples. Test the sets of three samples and accept or reject the type of trim and design on the same basis as seam design. A type of trim and design accepted when tested in a vertical configuration, may be used in a horizontal configuration without further testing.
(3)
Production testing.
A unit is either accepted or rejected according to the following plan:
(i)
Normal sampling.
(A) From each unit, select at random sufficient garments and cut three samples (15 specimens) from the longest seam type. No more than five specimens may be cut from a single garment. Prior to testing, assign each specimen to one of the three samples. All specimens cut from a single garment must be included in the same sample. Test the three selected samples. If all three samples meet all the test criteria of § 1616.3(b), accept the unit. If one or more of the three samples fail the 17.8 cm. (7.0 in.) average char length criterion, § 1616.3(b)(1), reject the unit. If four or more of the individual specimens, from the 15 selected specimens, fail the 25.4 cm. (10 in.) char length criterion, § 1616.3(b)(2), reject the unit. If three or less of the individual specimens, from the 15 selected specimens, fail the 25.4 cm. (10 in.) char length criterion, § 1616.3(b)(2), accept the unit.
(B) If the garment under test does not have a seam at least 10 inches long in the largest size in which it is produced, the following selection and testing procedure shall be followed:
(
1
) Select and cut specimens 8.9 cm. (3.5 in.) wide by the maximum available seam length, with the seam in the center of the specimen and extending the entire specimen length. Cut three samples (15 specimens). These specimens shall be placed in specimen holders so that the bottom edge is even with the bottom edge of the specimen holder and the seam begins in the center of the bottom edge. Prior to testing, assign each specimen to one of the three samples. All specimens cut from a single garment must be included in the same sample.
(
2
) Test the three samples. If all three samples pass the 17.8 cm. (7.0 in.) average char length criterion, § 1616.3(b)(1), and if three or fewer individual specimens fail by charring the entire specimen length, accept the unit. If the unit is not accepted in the above test, three samples (15 specimens) of the longest seam type shall be made using fabric and thread from production inventory and sewn on production machines by production operators. The individual fabric sections prior to sewing must be no larger than 20.3 × 63.3 cm. (8 × 25 in.) and must be selected from more than one area of the base fabric. Test the three prepared samples. Accept or reject the unit as described previously in this subsection.
(ii)
Reduced sampling.
(A) The level of sampling required for garment acceptance may be reduced provided the previous 15 units of the garments have all been accepted using the Normal Sampling Plan. The Reduced Sampling Plan shall be the same as for Normal Sampling except that the quantity of garments under test may be increased to up to two production units containing garments which have the same specific identity except for size, trim, findings, color, and print patterns as specified in paragraph (a) of this section.
(B) Select and test three samples in the same manner as in Normal Sampling. Accept or reject both units on the same basis as with Normal Sampling. Reduced Sampling shall be discontinued and Normal Sampling resumed if a unit is rejected.

(2)
Specimen holder.
The specimen holder to be used in this test method is detailed in Engineering Drawing Number 7. It is designed to permit suspension of the specimen in a fixed vertical position and to prevent curling of the specimen when the flame is applied. The specimen shall be fixed between the plates, which shall be held together with side clamps.
(3)
Burner.
The burner shall be the same as that illustrated in Figure 1 and detailed in Engineering Drawing Number 6. It shall have a tube of 1.1 cm. (0.43 in.) inside diameter. The input line to the burner shall be equipped
with a needle valve. It shall have a variable orifice to adjust the height of the flame. The barrel of the burner shall be at an angle of 25 degrees from the vertical. The burner may be equipped with an adjustable stop collar so that it may be positioned quickly under the test specimen. The burner shall be connected to the gas source by rubber or other flexible tubing.
(4)
Gas supply system.
There shall be a pressure regulator to furnish gas to the burner under a pressure of 103-259 mm. Hg. (2-5 lbs. per sq. in.) at the burner inlet. (
Caution.
Precautionary laboratory practices must be followed to prevent the leakage of methane. Methane is a flammable gas which can be explosive when mixed with air and exposed to a source of ignition, and can cause asphyxiation because of the lack of air.)
(5)
Gas.
The gas shall be at least 97 percent pure methane.
(6)
Hooks and weights.
Metal hooks and weights shall be used to produce a series of loads for char length determinations. Suitable metal hooks consist of No. 19 gauge steel wire, or equivalent, made from 7.6 cm. (3 in.) lengths of the wire, bent 1.3 cm. (0.5 in.) from one end to a 45-degree angle hook. The longer end of the wire is fastened around the neck of the weight to be used and the other in the lower end of each burned specimen to one side of the burned area. The requisite loads are given in table 1.

Weight of the original fabric, containing no seams or trim, is calculated from the weight of a specimen which has been conditioned for at least 8 hr at 21±1.1 °C (70±2 °F) and 65±2 pct relative humidity. Shorter conditioning times may be used if the change in weight of a specimen in successive weighings made at intervals of not less than 2 hr does not exceed 0.2 pct of the weight of the specimen.
(7)
Stopwatch.
A stopwatch or similar timing device shall be used to measure time to 0.1 second.
(8)
Scale.
A linear scale graduated in mm. or 0.1-inch divisions shall be used to measure char length.
(9)
Circulating air oven.
A forced circulation drying oven capable of maintaining the specimen at 105±2.8 °C. (221±5 °F.), shall be used to dry the specimen while mounted in the specimen holders.
3
3
Procedure 1(1.1.1) of ASTM D 2654-71 “Standard Methods of Test for moisture content and moisture regain of textile material,” describes a satisfactory oven (1972 Book of ASTM Standards, part 24, published by the American Society for Testing and Materials, 1916 Race Street, Philadelphia, Pa. 19103).
(10)
Desiccator.
An air-tight and moisture-tight desiccating chamber shall be used for cooling mounted specimens after drying. Anhydrous silica gel with an indicator shall be used as the desiccant in the desiccating chamber. Replace or reactivate the desiccant when it becomes inactive.
(11)
Hood.
A hood or other suitable enclosure shall be used to provide a draft-protected environment surrounding the test chamber without restricting the availability of air. This enclosure shall have a fan or other suitable means for exhausting smoke and/or toxic gases produced by testing.
(12)
Extinguishing plates.
Extinguishing plates shall be used to extinguish afterglow. The plates shall be metal, approximately 35.6 cm. × 5.1 cm. (14 × 2 in.) which fit within the opening of the specimen holder. The bottom plate shall be the thickness of the specimen holder and the top plate shall be at least 0.32 cm. (
1/8
in.) thick. A suitable metal specimen mounting block may be used for the bottom plate.
(b)
Mounting and conditioning of specimens.
(1) The specimens shall be placed in specimen holders so that the bottom edge of each specimen is even with the bottom of the specimen holder. Mount the specimen in as close to a flat configuration as possible. The sides of the specimen holder shall cover 1.9 cm. (
3/4
in.) of the specimen width along each long edge of the specimen, and thus shall expose 5.1 cm. (2 in.) of the specimen width. The sides of the specimen holder shall be clamped with a sufficient number of clamps or shall be taped to prevent the specimen from being displaced during handling and testing. The specimens may be taped in the holders if the clamps fail to hold
them. Place the mounted specimens in the drying oven in a manner that will permit free circulation of air at 105 °C. (221 °F.) around them for 30 minutes.
4
4
If the specimens are moist when received, permit them to air dry in laboratory conditions prior to placement in the oven. A satisfactory preconditioning procedure may be found in ASTM D 1776-67, “Conditioning Textiles and Textile Products for Testing”. (1972 Book of ASTM Standards, part 24, published by the American Society for Testing and Materials, 1916 Race Street, Philadelphia Pennsylvania 19103.)
(2) Remove the mounted specimens from the oven and place them in the desiccator for 30 minutes to cool. No more than five specimens shall be placed in a desiccator at one time. Specimens shall remain in the desiccator no more than 60 minutes.
(c)
Testing
—(1)
Burner adjustment.
With the hood fan turned off, use the needle valve to adjust the flame height of the burner to 3.8 cm. (1
1/2
in.) above the highest point of the barrel of the burner. A suitable height indicator is shown in Engineering Drawing Number 6 and Figure 1.
(2)
Specimen burning and evaluation.
(i) One at a time, the mounted specimens shall be removed from the desiccator and suspended in the cabinet for testing. The cabinet door shall be closed and the burner flame impinged on the bottom edge of the specimen for 3.0±0.2 seconds.
5
Flame impingement is accomplished by moving the burner under the specimen for this length of time, and then removing it.
5
If more than 30 seconds elapse between removal of a specimen from the desiccator and the initial flame impingement, that specimen shall be reconditioned prior to testing.
(ii) When flaming has ceased, remove the specimen from the cabinet, except for specimens which exhibit afterglow. If afterglow is evident, the specimen shall be removed from the cabinet 1 minute after the burner flame is impinged on the specimen if no flaming exists at that time. Upon removal from the cabinet, the afterglow shall be promptly extinguished. The afterglow shall be extinguished by placing the specimen while still in the specimen holder on the bottom extinguishing plate and immediately covering it with the top plate until all evidence of afterglow has ceased. After removing the specimen from the cabinet and, if appropriate, extinguishing afterglow, remove it from the holder and place it on a flat clean surface. Fold the specimen lengthwise along a line through the highest peak of the charred or melted area; crease the specimen firmly by hand. Unfold the specimen and insert the hook with the correct weight as shown in table 1 in the specimen on one side of the charred area 6.4 mm. (
1/4
in.) from the lower edge. Tear the specimen by grasping the other lower corner of the fabric and gently raising the specimen and weight clear of the supporting surface.
6
Measure the char length as the distance from the end of the tear to the original lower edge of the specimen exposed to the flame. After testing each specimen, vent the hood and cabinet to remove the smoke and/or toxic gases.
6
A figure showing how this is done is given in AATCC Test method 34-1969, “Fire Resistance of Textile Fabrics,” Technical Manual of the American Association of Textile Chemists and Colorists, Vol. 46, 1970, published by AATCC, P.O. Box 12215, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27709.
(3)
Report.
Report the value of char length, in centimeters (or inches), for each specimen, as well as the average char length for each set of five specimens.
(4)
Laundering.
(i) The procedures described under §§ 1616.4 Sampling and acceptance procedures, 1616.5(b) Conditioning and mounting of specimens, and 1616.5(c) Testing shall be carried out on finished items (as produced or after one washing and drying) and after they have been washed and dried 50 times in accordance with sections 8.2.2, 8.2.3, and 8.3.1(A) of AATCC Test Method 124-1996 “Appearance of Fabrics after Repeated Home Laundering,” Technical Manual of the American Association of Textile Chemists and Colorists, vol. 73, 1997, which is incorporated by reference.

§ 1616.32
Method for establishment and use of alternate laundering procedures under section 5(c)(4)(ii) of the standard.
(a)
Scope.
(1) Section 1616.5(c)(4)(ii) of the Standard for the Flammability of Children's Sleepwear in sizes 7-14 (16 CFR 1616.5(c)(4)(ii)) requires that all fabrics and certain garments subject to the standard be tested for flammability as produced (or after one washing and drying) and after the items have been washed and dried 50 times in machines, using the procedure specified in AATCC Test Method 124-1996.
7
This section also provides that items may be laundered a different number of times under another washing and drying procedure if the Commission finds that such an alternate laundering procedure is equivalent to the procedure specified in the standard.

This incorporation by reference was approved by the Director of the Federal Register in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51.
(2) This rule provides the procedures to be followed by persons seeking Commission approval for alternate laundering procedures. It also provides the criteria the Commission will use in evaluating the applications.
(3) The alternate laundering procedures provided for in this section apply only to procedures under section 5(c)(4)(ii) of the standard and shall not be used for determining whether different colors or different print patterns of the same fabric may be included in a single fabric or garment production unit.
(4) As used in this section, fabric means fabric or related material promoted or intended for use in children's sleepwear made to identical specifications and containing the same identity while in production.
(b)
Application procedure.
(1) Applicants seeking approval for use of an alternate laundering procedure under § 1616.5(c)(4)(ii) of the standard must submit the following information in writing to the Assistant Executive Director for Compliance, Consumer Product Safety Commission, Washington, DC 20207:
(i) A detailed description of the proposed alternate laundering procedure, and a 6 in. by 6 in. swatch of the fabric or garment for which the procedure is proposed,
(ii) Upon request of the Commission staff, any other information concerning the procedure and/or any machine used in connection with it,
(iii) With regard to each fabric or garment for which an alternate laundering procedure is sought, test data comparing twenty test specimens washed and dried by the proposed alternate laundering procedure and twenty specimens tested in accordance with the 50-wash and dry cycle procedure required in section 5(c)(4)(ii) of the standard. (For purposes of applications, similar fabrics or garments of different finishes shall be considered as different fabrics or garments and therefore separate test results must be submitted). Each group of twenty specimens upon which these data are based must be cut for testing, half in the machine direction and half in the cross machine direction. Where the applicant manufactures the fabric or garments in more than one plant, the data described in this paragraph must be submitted separately for the fabric or garments of
each plant for which the proposed alternate laundering procedure is intended to be used. Subsequent applications for use of the same procedure for additional fabrics and garments may incorporate portions of the original application by reference, as appropriate.
(2) Applications shall be certified by the chief executive officer of the applicant or the official to whom the duty to certify has been delegated in writing. The Commission's Assistant Executive Director for Compliance must be notified in writing of any such delegation.
(c)
Use of alternate laundering procedure.
(1) The applicant may begin to use the alternate laundering procedure 30 days after the application is received by the Assistant Executive Director for Compliance unless notified to the contrary. The Assistant Executive Director for Compliance will normally furnish an applicant with written notice of approval within 30 days. The applicant may be notified that a longer time is needed for evaluation of the application, and in the discretion of the Assistant Executive Director for Compliance, may be authorized to use the alternate laundering procedure pending the final decision. The notice of approval shall be kept by the applicant with other written records required to be maintained in connection with the use of an alternate laundering procedure. So that the applicants may ascertain that the application has been received when the 30-day period has elapsed, it is suggested that applications be sent by certified mail, return receipt requested.
(2) As provided in detail in § 1616.32(e), applicants must immediately discontinue use of an alternate procedure, and must immediately notify the Assistant Executive Director for Compliance if there are test failures during revalidation testing.
(d)
Revalidation testing.
(1) In order to assure a continued satisfactory correlation between the alternate laundering procedure and the laundering procedure of the standard, applicants shall perform all the testing described in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section for fabrics or garments from current production at least once for every three-month period during which any of the fabric or garments are produced.
(2) If following initial approval, four successive comparisons of the alternate and the 50-cycle methods as described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section consistently show acceptable results under the criteria specified by paragraph (f) of this section, the Commission will deem such comparisons to be sufficient demonstration of the equivalence of the alternate laundering procedure with the 50 launderings required in the standard and further revalidation testing will not be required.
(3) Records of revalidation testing need not be submitted to the Assistant Executive Director for Compliance. However such records must be maintained in accordance with paragraph (h) of this section.
(e)
Revalidation testing failures.
(1) If revalidation testing for any fabric or garment does not meet the criteria of § 1616.32(f), the applicant must immediately discontinue use of the alternate laundering procedure for the fabric or garment and must immediately notify the Assistant Executive Director for Compliance in writing of the failure to meet the criteria. Also the testing from the production unit from which the non-correlating samples were taken and the testing from subsequent production units (if any) must be repeated immediately using the laundering procedure prescribed in the standard. These repeat tests shall then be the tests applicable to such production unit(s) and those tests previously performed on the production unit(s) shall be considered invalid.
(2) When use of an alternate laundering procedure for a particular fabric or garment has been discontinued because of a failure to meet the criteria of § 1616.32(f), the alternate laundering procedure shall not be used again unless a new application for approval is submitted to the Assistant Executive Director for Compliance and that officer approves the application in writing. In addition to the other information required for applications, the additional application should give facts or
reasons showing why the applicant believes the procedure should be considered reliable with the fabric or garments involved, in view of the previous failure.
(f)
Commission criteria for evaluating applications.
(1) The Assistant Executive Director for Compliance will approve the alternate laundering procedure as equivalent to the laundering procedure specified in § 1616.5(c)(4)(ii) of the standard if testing from 20 specimens laundered by the proposed alternate procedure yields as many or more char lengths in excess of five inches as does testing from the twenty specimens laundered by the 50-laundering cycle method prescribed in the standard.
(2) If the alternate laundering procedure yields fewer char lengths in excess of five inches than does the 50-wash and dry cycle, then the Assistant Executive Director for Compliance will not consider the alternate procedure to be equivalent, with the following exception: If the number of five-inch chars from the alternate procedure is within one of the number of five-inch chars obtained from the 50-cycle procedure, the applicant may repeat the original test with new specimens and if the combined results of both tests show the count of chars exceeding five inches from the alternate is equal to, or greater than, the count from the 50-wash cycle procedure, the Assistant Executive Director for Compliance will approve the alternate laundering procedure.
(g)
Commission testing for compliance.
(1) For the purpose of determining compliance with the standard, the Commission will rely on testing employing the laundering procedure now prescribed by § 1616.5(c)(4)(ii) of the standard. (15 U.S.C. 1193, 1194; 15 U.S.C. 2079(b)).
(2) The Commission may verify equivalency of any procedure submitted by independent testing and evaluation, by or on behalf of the Commission.
(h)
Recordkeeping.
The applicant must maintain a record of all applications filed with the Commission and of all equivalency tests for as long as the procedures to which they relate are in use and for three years thereafter.

§ 1616.35
Use of alternate apparatus, procedures, or criteria for testing under the standard.
(a) The Standard for the Flammability of Children's Sleepwear: Sizes 7 through 14 (the Standard) requires every manufacturer, importer, and other person (such as a converter) initially introducing items subject to the Standard into commerce to group items into production units, and to test samples from each production unit. See 16 CFR 1616.4. The Standard prescribes an apparatus and procedure for performing tests of fabric and garments subject to its provisions. See 16 CFR 1616.5. The Standard prescribes pass/fail criteria at 16 CFR 1616.3(b).
(b) Section 1616.5(a) states that alternate test apparatus may be used by persons or firms required to perform testing under the Standard “only with prior approval” of the Commission.
(c)(1) By issuance of this § 1616.35, the Commission gives its approval to any person or firm desiring to use test apparatus or procedures other than those prescribed by the Standard for purposes of compliance with the Standard, if that person or firm has data or other information to demonstrate that a test utilizing such alternate apparatus or procedure is as stringent as, or more stringent than, a test utilizing the apparatus and procedure specified in the Standard. The Commission considers a test utilizing alternate apparatus or procedures to be “as stringent as, or more stringent than” a test utilizing the apparatus and procedures specified in the standard, if when testing identical specimens, a test utilizing alternative apparatus or procedures yields failing results as often as, or more often than, a test utilizing the apparatus and procedures specified in the standard.
(2) The data or information required by this paragraph (c) of this section as a condition to the Commission's approval of the use of alternate test apparatus or procedures must be in the possession of the person or firm desiring
to use such alternate apparatus or procedures before the alternate apparatus or procedures may be used for purposes of compliance with the standard.
(3) The information required by this paragraph (c) of this section must be retained by the person or firm using the alternate test apparatus or procedures for as long as that apparatus or procedure is used for purposes of compliance with the standard, and for a period of one year there after.
(d) Written application to the Commission is not required for approval of alternate test apparatus or procedures, and the Commission will not act on any individual written application for approval of alternate test apparatus or procedures.
(e) Use of any alternate test apparatus or procedures without the data or information required by paragraph (c), of this section, may result in violation of the Standard and section 3 of the Flammable Fabrics Act (15 U.S.C. 1192).
(f) The Commission will test fabrics and garments subject to the standard for compliance with the requirements of the standard using the apparatus and procedures set forth in the standard. The Commission will consider any failing results from compliance testing as evidence of a violation of the standard and section 3 of the Flammable Fabrics Act (15 U.S.C. 1192).

[48 FR 21316, May 12, 1983]
§ 1616.36
Use of alternate apparatus or procedures for tests for guaranty purposes.
(a) Section 8(a) of the Flammable Fabrics Act (FFA, 15 U.S.C. 1197(a)) provides that no person shall be subject to criminal prosecution under section 7 of the FFA (15 U.S.C. 1196) for a violation of section 3 of the FFA (15 U.S.C. 1192) if that person establishes a guaranty received in good faith which meets all requirements set forth in section 8 of the FFA. One of those requirements is that the guaranty must be based upon “reasonable and representative tests” in accordance with the applicable standard.
(b) Section 1616.31(e) of the regulations implementing the Standard for the Flammability of Children's Sleepwear: Sizes 7 through 14 (the Standard) provides that for purposes of supporting guaranties issued in accordance with section 8 of the FFA for items subject to the Standard, “reasonable and representative tests” are tests “performed pursuant to any sampling plan or authorized alternative sampling plan engaged in pursuant to the requirements of the Standard.”
(c) At § 1616.35, the Commission has set forth conditions under which the Commission will approve the use of test apparatus or procedures other than those prescribed in the Standard for purposes of demonstrating compliance with the requirements of the Standard. Any person or firm meeting the requirements of § 1616.35 for use of alternate test apparatus or procedure for compliance with the Standard may also use such alternate test apparatus or procedure under the same conditions for purposes of conducting “reasonable and representative tests” to support guaranties of items subject to the Standard, following any sampling plan prescribed by the Standard or any approved alternate sampling plan.
(d) The Commission will test fabrics and garments subject to the Standard for compliance with the Standard using the apparatus and procedures set forth in the Standard. The Commission will consider any failing results from compliance testing as evidence that the person or firm using alternate test apparatus or procedures has furnished a false guaranty in violation of section 8(b) of the FFA (15 U.S.C. 1197(b)).

# Subpart C—Interpretations and Policies

# Authority:
Secs. 1-17, 67 Stat. 111-15, as amended, 81 Stat. 568-74; 15 U.S.C. 1191-1204.
§ 1616.61
Enforcement policy.
(a) It is the policy of the Consumer Product Safety Commission that all items of children's sleepwear in sizes 7 through 14 (including garments and fabric or related material intended or promoted for use in such children's sleepwear) are subject to the Standard FF 5-74 (subpart A of this part) unless the manufacturing process has ended before May 1, 1975. The manufacturing process is deemed to end, for the purposes of the Standard, at the time the item is completely assembled, all functional materials have been affixed, and labeling of a permanent nature has been stamped, sewn, or otherwise permanently affixed to the item. Affixing of temporary price or promotional information or the packaging of items of sleepwear (including garments and fabrics or related material intended or promoted for use in such sleepwear) does not affect the date on which the manufacturing process is deemed to end.
(b) All items of children's sleepwear in sizes 7 through 14 (including garments and fabric or related material intended or promoted for use in such children's sleepwear) which are in inventory or with the trade on the effective date of Standard FF 5-74 are exempt from the requirements of the Standard. For domestically-made items of children's sleepwear in sizes 7 through 14 to be considered “in inventory or with the trade” on the effective date of the Standard, the manufacturing process must have ended prior to May 1, 1975. For foreign-made items of children's sleepwear in sizes 7 through 14 to be considered “in inventory or with the trade” on the effective date of the Standard, the manufacturing process must have ended and the goods must have been entered into the United States before May 1, 1975.
§ 1616.62
Policy regarding retail display requirements for items.
For purposes of the retail display and identification requirements of § 1616.31(c), and for those purposes only, any item which was manufactured before May 1, 1975, and for which a retailer has documentary evidence of compliance with all sampling and testing requirements of the Standard (FF 5-74) (subpart A of this part), will be deemed to be a complying item notwithstanding the absence of an affirmative label to indicate compliance with the Standard as required by § 1616.6(b) of the Standard and § 1616.31(b)(8), or the absence of a garment production unit identification or style identification which meets all requirements of § 1616.31(b) (4) and (7), provided that such an item complies with all other labeling requirements of § 1616.31(b).
§ 1616.63
Policy regarding garment production unit identification.
No provision of 16 CFR 1616.31(b)(7) prohibits placement of a garment production unit identification on a label containing other information. Provided, however, that when the garment production unit identification appears on a label containing other information, provisions of § 1616.31(b)(6) require that the garment production unit identification must be set forth separately from any other information appearing on the same label, and that information not required by the applicable enforcement regulation (§ 1616.31), but placed on the same label with the garment production unit identification, shall not interfere with the garment production unit identification.
§ 1616.64
Policy regarding recordkeeping requirements.
No provision of the Standard for the Flammability of Children's Sleepwear: Sizes 7 through 14 (FF 5-74) (subpart A of this part) or of the enforcement regulations at § 1616.31 prohibits the utilization of fabric which was manufactured before May 1, 1975, and which was not manufactured in production units, in the manufacture of children's sleepwear garments which are subject to the Standard. When such fabric is utilized in the manufacture of such garments, the inability of the garment manufacturer to record the fabric production unit identification of such fabric does not constitute a violation of § 1616.31(d)(4)(i).
§ 1616.65
Policy scope of the standard.
(a) The Standard for the Flammability of Children's Sleepwear: Sizes 7
through 14 (16 CFR part 1616) is applicable to any item of children's sleepwear in sizes 7 through 14.
(1) The term
item
is defined in the Standard at § 1616.2(c) to mean “any product of children's sleepwear or any fabric or related material intended or promoted for use in children's sleepwear.”
(2) The term
children's sleepwear
is defined in the Standard at § 1616.2(a) to mean “any product of wearing apparel size 7 through 14, such as nightgowns, pajamas, or similar or related items, such as robes, intended to be worn primarily for sleeping or activities related to sleeping. Underwear and diapers are excluded from this definition.”
(b) The Commission makes the following statement of policy regarding (1) the phrase “intended or promoted” as used in the definition of “item” in § 1616.2(c), and (2) the phrase “intended to be worn primarily for sleeping or activities related to sleeping” as used in the definition of “children's sleepwear” in § 1616.2(a).
(c) For enforcement purposes, the meaning of these phrases will be interpreted by the Commission in accordance with the following principles:
(1)
Sleepwear fabrics and related materials.
Whether fabric or related material is “intended or promoted” for use in children's sleepwear depends on the facts and circumstances in each case. Relevant factors include:
(i) The nature of the fabric and its suitability for use in children's sleepwear.
(ii) The extent to which the fabric or a comparable fabric has been sold to manufacturers of children's sleepwear for use in the manufacture of children's sleepwear garments; and
(iii) The likelihood that the fabric will be used primarily for children's sleepwear in a substantial number of cases.
(2)
Sleepwear garments.
Whether a product of wearing apparel is “intended to be worn primarily for sleeping or activities related to sleeping” depends on the facts and circumstances present in each case. Relevant factors include:
(i) The nature of the product and its suitability for use by children for sleeping or activities related to sleeping;
(ii) The manner in which the product is distributed and promoted; and
(iii) The likelihood that the product will be used by children primarily for sleeping or activities related to sleeping in a substantial number of cases.
(3) The factors set forth in this policy statement are guidelines only, and are not elements of the definition of the term “children's sleepwear” in § 1616.2(a) of the Standard. For this reason, a particular fabric or garment may meet the definition of “children's sleepwear” set forth in the Standard, even though all factors listed in this policy statement are not present.
(d) Retailers, distributors, and wholesalers, as well as manufacturers, importers, and other persons (such as converters) introducing a fabric or garment into commerce which does not meet the requirements of the flammability standards for children's sleepwear, have an obligation not to promote or sell such fabric or garment for use as an item of children's sleepwear. Also, retailers, distributors, and wholesalers are advised not to advertise, promote, or sell as an item of children's sleepwear any item which a manufacturer, importer, or other person (such as a converter) introducing the item into commerce has indicated by label, invoice, or, otherwise, does not meet the requirements of the children's sleepwear flammability standards and is not intended or suitable for use as sleepwear. “Tight-fitting” garments as defined by § 1616.2(m) are exempt from the standard which requires flame resistance. They may be marketed as sleepwear for purposes of this section. Additionally, retailers are advised:
(1) To segregate, by placement in different parts of a department or store, fabrics and garments covered by the children's sleepwear standards from all fabrics and garments that are beyond the scope of the children's sleepwear standards but which resemble items of children's sleepwear.
(2) To utilize store display sign indicating the distinction between types of fabrics and garments, for example by indicating which are sleepwear items and which are not; and
(3) To avoid the advertisement or promotion of a fabric or garment that
does not comply with the children's sleepwear flammability standards in a manner that may cause the item to be viewed by the consumer as an item of children's sleepwear.

[40 FR 59931, Dec. 30, 1975, as amended at 72 FR 60767, Oct. 26, 2007]
§ 1630.2
Scope and application.
(a) This Standard provides a test method to determine the surface flammability of carpets and rugs when exposed to a standard small source of ignition under carefully prescribed draft-protected conditions. It is applicable to all types of carpets and rugs used as floor covering materials regardless of their method of fabrication or whether they are made of natural or synthetic fibers or films, or combinations of or substitutes for these.
(b) One of a kind, carpet or rug, such as an antique, an Oriental, or a hide, may be excluded from testing under this Standard pursuant to conditions established by the Consumer Product Safety Commission.
§ 1630.3
General requirements.
(a)
Summary of test method.
This method involves the exposure of each of eight conditioned, replicate specimens of a given carpet or rug to a standard igniting source in a draft-protected environment, and measurement of the proximity of the charred portion to the edge of the hole in the prescribed flattening frame.
(b)
Test criterion.
A specimen passes the test if the charred portion does not extend to within 2.54 cm. (1.0 in.) of the edge of the hole in the flattening frame at any point.
(c)
Acceptance criterion.
At least seven of the eight specimens shall meet the test criterion in order to conform with this Standard.
§ 1630.4
Test procedure.
(a)
Apparatus
—(1)
Test chamber.
The test chamber shall consist of an open top hollow cube made of noncombustible material
1
with inside dimensions 30.48 × 40.48 × 30.48 cm. (12 × 12 × 12 in.) and a minimum of 6.35 (
1/4
in.) wall thickness. The flat bottom of the box shall be made of the same material as the sides and shall be easily removable. The sides shall be fastened together with screws or brackets and taped to prevent air leakage into the box during use.
1
6.35 mm (
1/4
in.) cement asbestos board is a suitable material.

# Note:
A minimum of two chambers and two extra bottoms is suggested for efficient operation.

Option 1 of ASTM D 2654-67T, “Methods of Test for Amount of Moisture in Textile Materials,” describes a satisfactory oven. (“1969 Book of ASTM Standards,” part 24, published by the American Society for Testing and Materials, 1916 Race Street, Philadelphia, Pa. 19103.)
(6)
Desiccating cabinet.
An airtight and moisture tight cabinet capable of holding the floor covering specimens horizontally without contacting each other during the cooling period following drying, and containing silica gel desiccant.
(7)
Gloves.
Nonhygroscopic gloves (such as rubber polyethylene) for handling the sample after drying, and raising the pile on specimens prior to testing.
(8)
Hood.
A hood capable of being closed and having its draft turned off during each test and capable of rapidly removing the products of combustion
following each test. The front or sides of the hood should be transparent to permit observation of the tests in progress.
(9)
Mirror.
A small mirror mounted above each test chamber at an angle to permit observation of the specimen from outside of the hood.
(10)
Vacuum cleaner.
A vacuum cleaner to remove all loose material from each specimen prior to conditioning. All surfaces of the vacuum cleaner contacting the specimen shall be flat and smooth.
(b)
Sampling
—(1)(i)
Selection of samples.
Select a sample of the material representative of the lot and large enough to permit cutting eight test specimens 22.86 × 22.86 cm. (9 × 9 in.), free from creases, fold marks, delaminations, or other distortions. The test specimens should contain the most flammable parts of the traffic surface at their centers. The most flammable area may be determined on the basis of experience or through pretesting.
(ii) If the carpet or rug has had a fire-retardant treatment, or is made of fibers which have had a fire-retardant treatment, the selected sample or over-sized specimens thereof shall be washed, prior to cutting of test specimens after they have been washed and dried either 10 times in accordance with sections 8.2.2, 8.2.3, and 8.3.1(A) of AATCC Test Method 124-1996 “Appearance of Fabrics after Repeated Home Laundering,” using wash temperature V (60° ±3 °C, 140° ±5 °F) specified in Table II of that method, and the water level, agitator speed, washing time, spin speed and final spin cycle specified for “Normal/Cotton Sturdy” in Table III, and drying shall be performed in accordance with section 8.3.1(A) of that test method, Tumble Dry, maximum load 3.64 Kg (8 pounds), using the exhaust temperature (66° ±5 °C, 150° ±10 °F) and cool down time of 10 minutes specified in the “Durable Press” conditions of Table IV; or such number of times by another washing and drying procedure which the Consumer Product Safety Commission has determined to be equivalent of AATCC Test Method 124-1996. Alternatively, the selected sample or oversized specimens thereof may be washed, drycleaned, or shampooed 10 times, prior to cutting of test specimens, in such manner as the manufacturer or other interested party shall previously have established to the satisfaction of the Consumer Product Safety Commission is normally used for that type of carpet or rug in service.
(iii) AATCC Test Method 124-1996 “Appearance of Fabrics after Repeated Home Laundering,” is found in Technical Manual of the American Association of Textile Chemists and Colorists, vol. 73, 1997, which is incorporated by reference. Copies of this document are available from the American Association of Textile Chemists and Colorists, P.O. Box 12215, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27709.

This incorporation by reference was approved by the Director of the Federal Register in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51.
(2)
Cutting.
Cut eight 22.86±0.64 cm. (9±
1/4
in.) square specimens of each carpet or rug to be tested to comply with paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
(c)
Conditioning.
(1) Clean each specimen with the vacuum cleaner until it is free of all loose ends left during the manufacturing process and from any material that may have been worked into the pile during handling. Care must be exercised to avoid “fuzzing” of the pile yarn.
(2) Place the specimens in the drying oven in a manner that will permit free circulation of the air at 105 °C. (221 °F.) around them for 2 hours.
3
Remove the specimens from the oven with gloved hands and place them horizontally in
the desiccator with traffic surface up and free from contact with each other until cooled to room temperature, but in no instance less than 1 hour.
3
If the specimens are moist when received, permit them to air-dry at laboratory conditions prior to placement in the oven. A satisfactory preconditioning procedure may be found in ASTM D 1776-67, “Conditioning Textiles and Textile Products for Testing.” (“1969 Book of ASTM Standards”, part 24, published by the American Society for Testing and Materials, 1916 Race Street, Philadelphia, Pa. 19103.)
(d)
Testing.
(1) Place the test chamber in the draft-protected environment (hood with draft off) with its bottom in place. Wearing gloves, remove a test specimen from the desiccator and brush its surface with a gloved hand in such a manner as to raise its pile. Place the specimen on the center of the floor of the test chamber, traffic surface up, exercising care that the specimen is horizontal and flat. Place the flattening frame on the specimen and position a methenamine tablet on one of its flat sides in the center of the 20.32 cm. (8 in.) hole.
(2) Ignite the tablet by touching a lighted match or an equivalent igniting source carefully to its top. If more than 2 minutes elapse between the removal of the specimen from the desiccator and the ignition of the tablet, the conditioning must be repeated.
(3) Continue each test until one of the following conditions occurs:
(i) The last vestige of flame or glow disappears. (This is frequently accompanied by a final puff of smoke.)
(ii) The flaming or smoldering has approached within 2.54 cm. (1.0 in.) of the edge of the hole in the flattening frame at any point.
(4) When all combustion has ceased, ventilate the hood and measure the shortest distance between the edge of the hole in the flattening frame and the charred area. Record the distance measured for each specimen.
(5) Remove the specimen from the chamber and remove any burn residue from the floor of the chamber. Before proceeding to the next test, the floor must be cooled to normal room temperature or replaced with one that is at normal room temperature.
(e)
Report.
The number of specimens of the eight tested in which the charred area does not extend to within 2.54 cm. (1.0 in.) of the edge of the hole in the flattening frame shall be reported.
(f)
Interpretation of results.
If the charred area does not extend to within 2.54 cm. (1.0 in.) of the edge of the hole in the flattening frame at any point for at least seven of the eight specimens, the carpet or rug meets the acceptance criterion.

# Subpart B—Rules and Regulations
§ 1630.31
Reasonable and representative tests and recordkeeping requirements.
Explanation:
Section 8 of the act, among other things, provides that no person shall be subject to criminal prosecution under section 7 of the act for a violation of section 3 of the act if such person establishes a guaranty received in good faith signed by and containing the name and address of the person by whom the product, fabric, or related material guaranteed was manufactured, or from whom it was received; to the effect that reasonable and representative tests made in accordance with applicable flammability standards show that the product, fabric, or related material covered by the guaranty conforms with such standards.
While a person establishing a guaranty received in good faith would not be subject to criminal prosecution under section 7 of the act, he and/or the merchandise involved, would nevertheless remain subject to the administrative processes of the Consumer Product Safety Commission under section 5 of the act as well as injunction and condemnation procedures under section 6 thereof. A guarantor derives no immunity of any kind, civil or criminal, from the issuance of his own guaranty or performance of the reasonable and representative tests prescribed by this section.
The furnishing of guaranties is not mandatory under the act. The purpose of this section is to establish minimum requirements for reasonable and representative tests upon which guaranties may be based. The section does not have any legal effect beyond that specified in section 8 of the act.
(a) For the purposes of this section the following definitions apply:
(1)
Standard
means the standards in subpart A of this part.
(2)
Test
means a test as prescribed by the Standard.
(3)
Acceptance criterion
means “acceptance criterion” as defined in the Standard.
(4)
Test criterion
means “test criterion” as defined in the Standard.
(5)
Carpet
and
rug
mean “carpet” and “rug” as defined in the Standard.
(6)
Quality of machine-made carpets or rugs
means any line of carpets or rugs, essentially machine-made, which are substantially alike in all respects, including, as applicable, constructional units (needles, pitch, rows, shot, stitches, and weight), dye class, dyestuff, dyeing application method, gage, pile levels, pile height, average pile thickness, pile weight, pile yarn, total thickness, total weight, tufts, tuft length, tuft bind, warp yarn, filler yarn, yarn ends per needle, loop length, backing, back coating, primary backing, secondary backing, backing thickness, backing fabric count, backing warp and filler yarns, including stuffer and dead frame yards, backing weight, fiber and/or other materials content, and fire-retardant treatment received including the specifications and quantity of chemicals used.
(7)
Quality of handmade or hide carpets or rugs
means any line of carpets or rugs which are essentially handmade and/or are essentially hides and which are alike in all respects, including those specified in paragraph (a)(6) of this section, where applicable, except that such carpets or rugs may vary where unavoidable and/or may vary because of natural variations in hides of the same type, so long as such variations do not affect flammability.
(b) The tests set forth in paragraphs (c), (d), (e), and (f) of this section are reasonable and representative tests with regard to any carpets or rugs or qualities thereof to which they apply, except, however, that any test of any quality, whenever performed, which does not show a meeting of the acceptance criterion of the Standard shall be considered the reasonable and representative test for that quality and no guaranty with respect thereto shall be issued after the performance of such test. Immediately before conditioning and testing, each carpet or rug specimen tested pursuant to this section shall be in the form in which the carpet or rug or quality thereof which it represents is sold or offered for sale to the ultimate consumer.
(c) Reasonable and representative tests with respect to any quality of machine-made carpets or rugs are (1) at least one test performed upon commencement of production, importation, or other receipt thereof, (2) at least one test performed after production, importation, or other receipt of the first 25,000 linear yards of the quality, and (3) at least one test after production, importation, or other receipt of every 50,000 linear yards of the quality thereafter. Except, however, that tests need be performed only after production, importation, or receipt of each additional 100,000 linear yards of the quality, so long as all 24 specimens required to be tested in a complete series of three required tests immediately preceding any given test (eight out of eight specimens in each of the three preceding tests) meet the test criterion, rather than seven out of eight specimens, as permitted under the acceptance criterion of the Standard.
(d) Reasonable and representative tests with respect to any quality of handmade or hide carpets or rugs are at least one test performed upon the commencement of production, importation, or other receipt thereof and at least one test after production, importation, or other receipt of every 10,000 square yards of the quality thereafter.
(e) Reasonable and representative tests of a one-of-a-kind carpet or rug, machine-made, handmade, or hide, is one test thereof or one test of an identical representative sample.
(f) Guaranties for carpets or rugs in inventory upon the effective date of the Standard may be issued in the same manner as other guaranties are issued. Reasonable and representative tests with respect to qualities of such carpets or rugs are at least one test performed upon approximately the first linear yard and one test thereafter for each 25,000 linear yards of a quality of machine-made carpets or rugs and at least one test performed upon approximately the first square yard and thereafter for each 10,000 square yards of a category of handmade or hide carpets or rugs, in the order of the production, importation, or receipt by the guarantor of that quality.
(g) Any person issuing a guaranty for one or more carpets or rugs or qualities thereof based on reasonable and representative tests, shall maintain the following records for a period of 3 years from the date the tests were performed, or in the case of paragraph (h) of this section, the date the guaranties were furnished. These records must be maintained in the United States by a person subject to section 3 of the act:
(1) All identifying numbers, symbols, etc., manufacturing specifications including all other information described in paragraph (a)(6) of this section, as applicable, and source of products or raw materials used therein.
(2) A physical sample of each carpet or rug or quality thereof covered by the guaranty at least 6 inches by 6 inches in size (36 square inches).
(3) The original or a copy of the report of each test performed for purposes of the guaranty (whether or not such report shows a meeting of the acceptance criterion) which shall disclose the date of the test, the results, and sufficient information to clearly identify the carpet or rug tested.
(4) A record applicable to each test in paragraph (g)(3) of this section showing the approximate yardage at which it was performed. Records otherwise required to be maintained in linear yards may be maintained in square yards on the basis of 4 square yards equals 1 linear yard.
(h) Persons furnishing guaranties based on guaranties received by them shall maintain records showing the guaranty received and identification of the carpet or rug or quality thereof guaranteed in turn by them.
(i) Any person furnishing a carpet or rug guaranty under section 8(a) of the act who neglects or refuses to maintain and preserve the records prescribed in this section shall be deemed to have furnished a false guaranty under the provisions of section 8(b) of the act.

This incorporation by reference was approved by the Director of the Federal Register in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51. Alternatively the selected sample or oversized specimens thereof may be washed, dry-cleaned, or shampooed 10 times, prior to the cutting of test specimens, in such manner as the manufacturer or other interested party has previously established to the satisfaction of the Consumer Product Safety Commission is normally used for that type of carpet or rug in service.
(2) Section 1630.5 of the Standard provides that if a carpet or rug has had a fire-retardant treatment or is made of fibers which have had a fire-retardant treatment, it shall be labeled with the letter “T.”
(b) On April 10, 1972, the Federal Trade Commission, which then had responsibility for enforcement of the Flammable Fabrics Act, announced that the use of alumina trihydrate in adhesives, foams, or latexes in carpet backings or elsewhere in the backings will be considered as a fire-retardant treatment. Therefore, the provisions of §§ 1630.4(b)(1)(ii) and 1630.5 of the Standard apply to carpets with alumina trihydrate in the backings. This interpretation continues in effect.
(c) On May 19, 1972, the Federal Trade Commission published a notice in the
Federal Register
(37 FR 10104) temporarily suspending the washing requirements under FF 1-70 for carpets and rugs containing alumina trihydrate in the backing. This temporary suspension was extended a number of times. On March 28, 1973 the Federal Trade Commission proposed in the
Federal Register
(38 FR 8101) an alternative laundering procedure for such carpets and rugs and gave notice that the suspension of the laundering requirement was extended until the completion of the proceeding to establish an alternative laundering procedure. The suspension continues in effect.

§ 1631.1
Definitions.
In addition to the definitions given in section 2 of the Flammable Fabrics Act, as amended (sec. 1, 81 Stat. 568; 15 U.S.C. 1191), and the procedures under that act for setting standards (part 1607 of this chapter), the following definitions apply for the purposes of this Standard:
(a)
Acceptance Criterion
means that at least seven out of eight individual specimens of a small carpet or rug shall meet the test criterion as defined in this Standard.
(b)
Test Criterion
means the basis for judging whether or not a single specimen of small carpet or rug has passed the test, i.e., the charred portion of a tested specimen shall not extend to within 2.54 cm. (1.0 in.) of the edge of the hole in the flattening frame at any point.
(c)
Small Carpet
means any type of finished product made in whole or in part of fabric or related material and intended for use or which may reasonably be expected to be used as a floor covering which is exposed to traffic in homes, offices, or other places of assembly or accommodation, and which may or may not be fastened to the floor by mechanical means such as nails, tacks, barbs, staples, adhesives, and which has no dimension greater than 1.83 m. (6 ft.) and an area not greater than 2.23 m.
2
(24 sq. ft.). Products such as “Carpet Squares” with dimensions smaller than these but intended to be assembled, upon installation, into assemblies which may have dimensions greater than these, are excluded from this definition. They are, however, included in the Standard for the surface flammability of carpets and rugs (FF 1-70) (subpart A of part 1630 of this chapter). Mats, hides with natural or synthetic fibers, and other similar products are included in this definition if they are within the defined dimensions, but resilient floor coverings such as linoleum, asphalt tile and vinyl tile are not.
(d)
Small Rug
means, for the purposes of this Standard, the same as small carpet and shall be accepted as interchangeable with small carpet.
(e)
Traffic Surface
means a surface of a small carpet or rug which is intended to be walked upon.
(f)
Timed Burning Tablet
(pill) means a methenamine tablet, flat, with a nominal heat of combustion value of 7180 calories/gram, a mass of 150 mg ±5mg and a nominal diameter of 6mm.
(g)
Fire-Retardant Treatment
means any process to which a small carpet or rug has been exposed which significantly decreases the flammability of that small carpet or rug and enables it to meet the acceptance criterion of this Standard.
[40 FR 59935, Dec. 30, 1975, as amended at 72 FR 60767, Oct. 26, 2007]
§ 1631.2
Scope and application.
(a) This Standard provides a test method to determine the surface flammability of small carpets and rugs when exposed to a standard small source of ignition under carefully prescribed draft-protected conditions. It is applicable to all types of small carpets and rugs used as floor covering materials regardless of their method of fabrication or whether they are made of natural or synthetic fibers or films, or combinations of, or substitutes for these.
(b) One of a kind small carpet or rug, such as an antique, an Oriental or a hide, may be excluded from testing under this Standard pursuant to conditions established by the Consumer Product Safety Commission.
§ 1631.3
General requirements.
(a)
Summary of test method.
This method involves the exposure of each of eight conditioned, replicate specimens of a small carpet or rug to a
standard igniting source in a draft-protected environment and measurement of the proximity of the charred portion to the edge of the hole in the prescribed flattening frame.
(b)
Test criterion.
A specimen passes the test if the charred portion does not extend to within 2.54 cm. (1.0 in.) of the edge of the hole in the flattening frame at any point.
(c)
Acceptance criterion.
At least seven of the eight specimens shall meet the test criterion in order to conform with this Standard.
§ 1631.4
Test procedure.
(a)
Apparatus
—(1)
Test chamber.
The test chamber shall consist of an open top hollow cube made of noncombustible material
1
with inside dimensions 30.48 × 30.48 × 30.48 cm. (12 × 12 × 12 in.) and a minimum of 6.35 mm. (
1/4
in.) wall thickness. The flat bottom of the box shall be made of the same material as the sides and shall be easily removable. The sides shall be fastened together with screws or brackets and taped to prevent air leakage into the box during use.
1
6.35 mm. (
1/4
in.) cement asbestos board is a suitable material.

# Note:
A minimum of two chambers and two extra bottoms is suggested for efficient operation.
(2)
Flattening frame.
A steel plate, 22.86 × 22.86 cm. (9 × 9 in.) 6.35 mm. (
1/4
in.) thick with a 20.32 cm. (8 in.) diameter hole in its center is required to hold the specimen flat during the course of the test. It is recommended that one be provided for each test chamber.
(3)
Standard igniting source.
A methenamine tablet, flat, with a nominal heat of combustion value of 7180 calories/gram, a mass of 150 mg ±5 mg and a nominal diameter of 6mm. These tablets shall be stored in a desiccator over a desiccant for 24 hours prior to use. (Small quantities of absorbed water may cause the tablets to fracture when first ignited. If a major fracture occurs, any results from that test shall be ignored, and it shall be repeated.)
(4)
Test specimens.
Each test specimen shall be a 22.86 × 22.86 cm. (9 × 9 in.) section of the small carpet or rug to be tested. Eight specimens are required.
(5)
Circulating air oven.
A forced circulation drying oven capable of removing the moisture from the specimens when maintained at 105 °C. (221 °F.) for 2 hours.
2
2
Option 1 of ASTM D 2654-67T, “Methods of Test for Amount of Moisture in Textile Materials,” describes a satisfactory oven. (“1969 Book of ASTM Standards,” part 24, published by the American Society for Testing and Materials, 1916 Race Street, Philadelphia, PA 19103.)
(6)
Desiccating cabinet.
An airtight and moisture tight cabinet capable of holding the floor covering specimens horizontally without contacting each other during the cooling period following drying, and containing silica gel desiccant.
(7)
Gloves.
Nonhygroscopic gloves (such as rubber or polyethylene) for handling the sample after drying and raising the pile on specimens prior to testing.
(8)
Hood.
A hood capable of being closed and having its draft turned off during each test and capable of rapidly removing the products of combustion following each test. The front or sides of the hood should be transparent to permit observation of the tests in progress.
(9)
Mirror.
A small mirror mounted above each test chamber at an angle to permit observation of the specimen from outside the hood.
(10)
Vacuum cleaner.
A vacuum cleaner to remove all loose material from each specimen prior to conditioning. All surfaces of the vacuum cleaner contacting the specimen shall be flat and smooth.
(b)
Sampling
—(1)
Selection of samples.
(i) Select a sample of the material representative of the lot and large enough to permit cutting eight test specimens 22.86 × 22.86 cm. (9 × 9 in.) free from creases, fold marks, delaminations or other distortions. The representative sample of material may require the use of more than one small carpet or rug. The test specimens should contain the most flammable parts of the traffic surface at their centers. The most flammable area may be determined on the basis of experience or through pretesting.
(ii) If the carpet or rug has had a fire-retardant treatment, or is made of fibers which have had a fire-retardant treatment, the selected sample or over-sized specimens thereof shall be washed, prior to cutting of test specimens after they have been washed and dried either 10 times in accordance with sections 8.2.2, 8.2.3, and 8.3.1(A) of AATCC Test Method 124-1996 “Appearance of Fabrics after Repeated Home Laundering,” using wash temperature V (60° ±3 °C, 140° ±5 °F) specified in Table II of that method, and the water level, agitator speed, washing time, spin speed and final spin cycle specified for “Normal/Cotton Sturdy” in Table III, and drying shall be performed in accordance with section 8.3.1(A) of that test method, Tumble Dry, maximum load 3.64 Kg (8 pounds), using the exhaust temperature (66° ±5 °C, 150° ±10 °F) and cool down time of 10 minutes specified in the “Durable Press” conditions of Table IV; or such number of times by another washing and drying procedure which the Consumer Product Safety Commission has determined to be equivalent of AATCC Test Method 124-1996. Alternatively, the selected sample or oversized specimens thereof may be washed, drycleaned, or shampooed 10 times, prior to cutting of test specimens, in such manner as the manufacturer or other interested party shall previously have established to the satisfaction of the Consumer Product Safety Commission is normally used for that type of carpet or rug in service.
(iii) AATCC Test Method 124-1996 “Appearance of Fabrics after Repeated Home Laundering,” is found in Technical Manual of the American Association of Textile Chemists and Colorists, vol. 73, 1997, which is incorporated by reference.

This incorporation by reference was approved by the Director of the Federal Register in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51.
(2)
Cutting.
Cut eight 22.86±0.64 cm. (9±
1/4
in.) square specimens of each small carpet or rug to be tested to comply with paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
(c)
Conditioning.
(1) Clean each specimen with the vacuum cleaner until it is free of all loose ends left during the manufacturing process and from any material that may have been worked into the pile during handling.
3
Care must be exercised to avoid “fuzzing” of the pile yarn.
3
The vacuum cleaning described is not intended to simulate the effects of repeated vacuum cleaning in service.
(2) Place the specimens in a drying oven in a manner that will permit free circulation of the air at 105 °C. (221 °F.) around them for 2 hours.
4
Remove the specimens from the oven with gloved hands and place them horizontally in the desiccator with traffic surface up and free from contact with each other until cooled to room temperature, but in no instance less than 1 hour.
4
If the specimens are moist when received, permit them to air-dry at laboratory conditions prior to placement in the oven. A satisfactory preconditioning procedure may be found in ASTM D 1776-67, “Conditioning Textiles and Textile Products for Testing.” (“1969 Book of ASTM Standards,” part 24, published by the American Society for Testing and Materials, 1916 Race Street, Philadelphia, Pa. 19103.)
(d)
Testing.
(1) Place the test chamber in the draft-protected environment (hood with draft off) with its bottom in place. Wearing gloves, remove a test specimen from the desiccator and brush its traffic surface with a gloved hand in such a manner as to raise its pile. Place the specimen on the center of the floor of the test chamber, traffic surface up, exercising care that the specimen is horizontal and flat. Place the flattening frame on the specimen and position a methenamine tablet on one of its flat sides in the center of the 20.32 cm. (8 in.) hole.
(2) Ignite the tablet by touching a lighted match or an equivalent igniting source carefully to its top. If more
than 2 minutes elapse between the removal of the specimen from the desiccator and the ignition of the tablet, the conditioning must be repeated.
(3) Continue each test until one of the following conditions occurs:
(i) The last vestige of flame or glow disappears. (This is frequently accompanied by a final puff of smoke.)
(ii) The flaming or smoldering has approached within 2.54 cm. (1.0 in.) of the edge of the hole in the flattening frame at any point.
(4) When all combustion has ceased, ventilate the hood and measure the shortest distance between the edge of the hole in the flattening frame and the charred area. Record the distance measured for each specimen.
(5) Remove the specimen from the chamber and remove any burn residue from the floor of the chamber. Before proceeding to the next test, the floor must be cooled to normal room temperature or replaced with one that is at normal room temperature.
(e)
Report.
The number of specimens of the eight tested in which the charred area does not extend to within 2.54 cm. (1.0 in.) of the edge of the hole in the flattening frame shall be reported.
(f)
Interpretation of results.
If the charred area does not extend to within 2.54 cm. (1.0 in.) of the edge of the hole in the flattening frame at any point for at least seven of the eight specimens, the small carpet or rug meets the acceptance criterion.

§ 1631.5
Labeling requirements.
(a) If a small carpet or rug does not meet the acceptance criterion, it shall, prior to its introduction into commerce, be permanently labeled, pursuant to rules and regulations established by the Consumer Product Safety Commission with the following statement: FLAMMABLE (FAILS U.S. DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE STANDARD FF 2-70): SHOULD NOT BE USED NEAR SOURCES OF IGNITION.
(b) If a small carpet or rug has had a fire-retardant treatment or is made of fibers which have had a fire-retardant treatment, it shall be labeled with the letter “T” pursuant to rules and regulations established by the Consumer Product Safety Commission.

# Subpart B—Rules and Regulations

# Authority:
Sec. 5, 67 Stat. 112, as amended, 81 Stat. 570; 15 U.S.C. 1194.
§ 1631.31
Reasonable and representative tests and recordkeeping requirements.
Explanation:
Section 8 of the act, among other things, provides that no person shall be subject to criminal prosecution under section 7 of the act for a violation of section 3 of the act if such person establishes a guaranty received in good faith signed by and containing the name and address of the person by whom the product, fabric, or related material guaranteed was manufactured, or from whom it was received, to the effect that reasonable and representative tests made in accordance with applicable flammability standards show that the product, fabric, or related material covered by the guaranty conforms with such standards.
While a person establishing a guaranty received in good faith would not be subject to criminal prosecution under section 7 of the act, he, and/or the merchandise involved, would nevertheless remain subject to the administrative processes of the Consumer Product Safety Commission under section 5 of the act as well as injunction and condemnation procedures under section 6 thereof. A guarantor derives no immunity of any kind, civil or criminal, from the issuance of his own guaranty or performance of the reasonable and representative tests prescribed by this section.
The furnishing of guaranties is not mandatory under the act. The purpose of this section is to establish minimum requirements for reasonable and representative tests upon which guaranties may be based. The section does not have any legal effect beyond that specified in section 8 of the act.
(a) For the purposes of this section the following definitions apply:
(1)
Standard
means the Standard in subpart A of this part.
(2)
Test
means a test as prescribed by the Standard.
(3)
Acceptance criterion
means “acceptance criterion” as defined in the Standard.
(4)
Test criterion
means “test criterion” as defined in the Standard.
(5)
Carpet
and
rug
mean “carpet” and “rug” as defined in the Standard.
(6)
Quality of machine-made carpets or rugs
means any line of carpets or rugs, essentially machine-made, which are
substantially alike in all respects, including, as applicable, constructional units (needles, pitch, rows, shot, stitches, and weight), dye class, dyestuff, dyeing application method, gage, pile levels, pile height, average pile thickness, pile weight, pile yarn, total thickness, total weight, tufts, tuft length, tuft bind, warp yarn, filler yarn, yarn ends per needle, loop length, backing, back coating, primary backing, secondary backing, backing thickness, backing fabric count, backing warp and filler yarns, including stuffer and dead frame yarns, backing weight, fiber and/or other materials content, and fire retardant treatment received including the specifications and quantity of chemicals used.
(7)
Quality of handmade or hide carpets or rugs
means any line of carpets or rugs which are essentially handmade and/or are essentially hides and which are alike in all respects, including those specified in paragraph (a)(6) of this section, where applicable, except that such carpets or rugs may vary where unavoidable and/or may vary because of natural variations in hides of the same type, so long as such variations do not affect flammability.
(b) The tests set forth in paragraphs (c), (d), (e), and (f) of this section are reasonable and representative tests with regard to any carpets or rugs or qualities thereof to which they apply, except, however, that any test of any quality, whenever performed, which does not show a meeting of the acceptance criterion of the Standard shall be considered the reasonable and representative test for that quality and no guaranty with respect thereto shall be issued after the performance of such test. Immediately before conditioning and testing, each carpet or rug specimen tested pursuant to this section shall be in the form in which the carpet or rug or quality thereof which it represents is sold or offered for sale to the ultimate consumer.
(c) Reasonable and representative tests with respect to any quality of machine-made carpets or rugs are (1) at least one test performed upon commencement of production, importation, or other receipt thereof, (2) at least one test performed after production, importation, or other receipt of the first 25,000 linear yards of the quality, and (3) at least one test after production, importation, or other receipt of every 50,000 linear yards of the quality thereafter. Except, however, that tests need be performed only after production, importation, or receipt of each additional 100,000 linear yards of the quality, so long as all 24 specimens required to be tested in a complete series of three required tests immediately preceding any given test (eight out of eight specimens in each of the three preceding tests) meet the test criterion, rather than seven out of eight specimens, as permitted under the acceptance criterion of the Standard.
(d) Reasonable and representative tests with respect to any quality of handmade or hide carpets or rugs are at least one test performed upon the commencement of production, importation, or other receipt thereof and at least one test after production, importation, or other receipt of every 10,000 square yards of the quality thereafter.
(e) Reasonable and representative tests of a one-of-a-kind carpet or rug, machine made, handmade, or hide, is one test thereof or one test of an identical representative sample.
(f) Guaranties for carpets or rugs in inventory upon the effective date of the Standard may be issued in the same manner as other guaranties are issued. Reasonable and representative tests with respect to qualities or such carpets or rugs are at least one test performed upon approximately the first linear yard and one test thereafter for each 25,000 linear yards of a quality of machine-made carpets or rugs and at least one test performed upon approximately the first square yard and thereafter for each 10,000 square yards of a category of hand-made or hide carpets or rugs, in the order of the production, importation, or receipt by the guarantor of that quality.
