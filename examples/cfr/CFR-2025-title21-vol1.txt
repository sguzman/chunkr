# Explanation
The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.
Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:
Title 1 through Title 16
as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27
as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41
as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50
as of October 1
The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.

# LEGAL STATUS
The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

# HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS
The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, April 1, 2025), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

# EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES
Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.

# OMB CONTROL NUMBERS
The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request.
Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.

# PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE
Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.

# “[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY
The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not dropped in error.

# INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE
What is incorporation by reference?
Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.
What is a proper incorporation by reference?
The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:
(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.
(b) The matter incorporated is adequately summarized in the preamble of the final rule and is available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.
(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?
If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or email fr.inspection@nara.gov.

# CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES
A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR
Index and Finding Aids.
This volume contains the Parallel Table of Authorities and Rules. A list of CFR titles, chapters, subchapters, and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in this volume.
An index to the text of “Title 3—The President” is carried within that volume.
The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. This index is based on a consolidation of the “Contents” entries in the daily Federal Register.
A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

# REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL
There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing in the Code of Federal Regulations.

means the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act) provides for the establishment by regulation of reasonable variations and exemptions for small packages from the required declaration of net quantity of contents. Section 403(i) of the act provides for the establishment by regulation of exemptions from the required declaration of ingredients where such declaration is impracticable, or results in deception or unfair competition.

Subparts F-G [Reserved]

# Subpart H—Registration of Food Facilities

# Source:
68 FR 58960, Oct. 10, 2003, unless otherwise noted.

# General Provisions
§ 1.225
Who must register under this subpart?
(a) You must register your facility under this subpart if you are the owner, operator, or agent in charge of either a domestic or foreign facility, as defined in this subpart, and your facility is engaged in the manufacturing/processing, packing, or holding of food for consumption in the United States, unless your facility qualifies for one of the exemptions in § 1.226.
(b) If you are an owner, operator, or agent in charge of a domestic facility, you must register your facility whether or not the food from the facility enters interstate commerce.
(c) If you are the owner, operator, or agent in charge of a facility, you may authorize an individual to register your facility on your behalf.
§ 1.226
Who does not have to register under this subpart?
This subpart does not apply to the following facilities:
(a) A foreign facility, if food from such facility undergoes further manufacturing/processing (including packaging) by another facility outside the United States. A facility is not exempt under this provision if the further manufacturing/processing (including packaging) conducted by the subsequent facility consists of adding labeling or any similar activity of a
de minimis
nature;
(b) Farms;
(c) Retail food establishments;
(d) Restaurants;
(e) Nonprofit food establishments in which food is prepared for, or served directly to, the consumer;
(f) Fishing vessels, including those that not only harvest and transport fish but also engage in practices such as heading, eviscerating, or freezing intended solely to prepare fish for holding on board a harvest vessel. However, those fishing vessels otherwise engaged in processing fish are subject to this subpart. For the purposes of this section, “processing” means handling, storing, preparing, shucking, changing into different market forms, manufacturing, preserving, packing, labeling, dockside unloading, holding, or heading, eviscerating, or freezing other than solely to prepare fish for holding on board a harvest vessel;
(g) Facilities that are regulated exclusively, throughout the entire facility, by the U.S. Department of Agriculture under the Federal Meat Inspection Act (21 U.S.C. 601
et seq.
), the Poultry Products Inspection Act (21 U.S.C. 451
et seq.
), or the Egg Products Inspection Act (21 U.S.C. 1031
et seq.
);
§ 1.227
What definitions apply to this subpart?
The definitions of terms in section 201 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act apply to such terms when used in this subpart. In addition, for the purposes of this subpart:
Calendar day
means every day shown on the calendar.
Facility
means any establishment, structure, or structures under one ownership at one general physical location, or, in the case of a mobile facility,
traveling to multiple locations, that manufactures/processes, packs, or holds food for consumption in the United States. Transport vehicles are not facilities if they hold food only in the usual course of business as carriers. A facility may consist of one or more contiguous structures, and a single building may house more than one distinct facility if the facilities are under separate ownership. The private residence of an individual is not a facility. Nonbottled water drinking water collection and distribution establishments and their structures are not facilities.
(1)
Domestic facility
means any facility located in any State or Territory of the United States, the District of Columbia, or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico that manufactures/processes, packs, or holds food for consumption in the United States.
(2)
Foreign facility
means a facility other than a domestic facility that manufactures/processes, packs, or holds food for consumption in the United States.
Farm
means:
(1) Primary production farm. A primary production farm is an operation under one management in one general (but not necessarily contiguous) physical location devoted to the growing of crops, the harvesting of crops, the raising of animals (including seafood), or any combination of these activities. The term “farm” includes operations that, in addition to these activities:
(i) Pack or hold raw agricultural commodities;
(ii) Pack or hold processed food, provided that all processed food used in such activities is either consumed on that farm or another farm under the same management, or is processed food identified in paragraph (1)(iii)(B)(
1
) of this definition; and
(iii) Manufacture/process food, provided that:
(A) All food used in such activities is consumed on that farm or another farm under the same management; or
(B) Any manufacturing/processing of food that is not consumed on that farm or another farm under the same management consists only of:
(
1
) Drying/dehydrating raw agricultural commodities to create a distinct commodity (such as drying/dehydrating grapes to produce raisins), and packaging and labeling such commodities, without additional manufacturing/processing (an example of additional manufacturing/processing is slicing);
(
2
) Treatment to manipulate the ripening of raw agricultural commodities (such as by treating produce with ethylene gas), and packaging and labeling treated raw agricultural commodities, without additional manufacturing/processing; and
(
3
) Packaging and labeling raw agricultural commodities, when these activities do not involve additional manufacturing/processing (an example of additional manufacturing/processing is irradiation); or
(2) Secondary activities farm. A secondary activities farm is an operation, not located on a primary production farm, devoted to harvesting (such as hulling or shelling), packing, and/or holding of raw agricultural commodities, provided that the primary production farm(s) that grows, harvests, and/or raises the majority of the raw agricultural commodities harvested, packed, and/or held by the secondary activities farm owns, or jointly owns, a majority interest in the secondary activities farm. A secondary activities farm may also conduct those additional activities allowed on a primary production farm as described in paragraphs (1)(ii) and (iii) of this definition.
Food
has the meaning given in section 201(f) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act:
(1) Except for purposes of this subpart, it does not include:
(i) Food contact substances as defined in section 409(h)(6) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act; or
(ii) Pesticides as defined in 7 U.S.C. 136(u).
(2) Examples of food include: Fruits, vegetables, fish, dairy products, eggs, raw agricultural commodities for use as food or as components of food, animal feed (including pet food), food and feed ingredients, food and feed additives, dietary supplements and dietary ingredients, infant formula, beverages (including alcoholic beverages and bottled water), live food animals, bakery goods, snack foods, candy, and canned foods.
Harvesting
applies to farms and farm mixed-type facilities and means activities that are traditionally performed on farms for the purpose of removing raw agricultural commodities from the place they were grown or raised and preparing them for use as food. Harvesting is limited to activities performed on raw agricultural commodities, or on processed foods created by drying/dehydrating a raw agricultural commodity without additional manufacturing/processing, on a farm. Harvesting does not include activities that transform a raw agricultural commodity into a processed food as defined in section 201(gg) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Examples of harvesting include cutting (or otherwise separating) the edible portion of the raw agricultural commodity from the crop plant and removing or trimming part of the raw agricultural commodity (
e.g.,
foliage, husks, roots or stems). Examples of harvesting also include cooling, field coring, filtering, gathering, hulling, shelling, sifting, threshing, trimming of outer leaves of, and washing raw agricultural commodities grown on a farm.
Holding
means storage of food and also includes activities performed incidental to storage of a food (
e.g.,
activities performed for the safe or effective storage of that food, such as fumigating food during storage, and drying/dehydrating raw agricultural commodities when the drying/dehydrating does not create a distinct commodity (such as drying/dehydrating hay or alfalfa)). Holding also includes activities performed as a practical necessity for the distribution of that food (such as blending of the same raw agricultural commodity and breaking down pallets), but does not include activities that transform a raw agricultural commodity into a processed food as defined in section 201(gg) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Holding facilities could include warehouses, cold storage facilities, storage silos, grain elevators, and liquid storage tanks.
Manufacturing/processing
means making food from one or more ingredients, or synthesizing, preparing, treating, modifying or manipulating food, including food crops or ingredients. Examples of manufacturing/processing activities include: Baking, boiling, bottling, canning, cooking, cooling, cutting, distilling, drying/dehydrating raw agricultural commodities to create a distinct commodity (such as drying/dehydrating grapes to produce raisins), evaporating, eviscerating, extracting juice, formulating, freezing, grinding, homogenizing, irradiating, labeling, milling, mixing, packaging (including modified atmosphere packaging), pasteurizing, peeling, rendering, treating to manipulate ripening, trimming, washing, or waxing. For farms and farm mixed-type facilities, manufacturing/processing does not include activities that are part of harvesting, packing, or holding.
Mixed-type facility
means an establishment that engages in both activities that are exempt from registration under section 415 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and activities that require the establishment to be registered. An example of such a facility is a “farm mixed-type facility,” which is an establishment that is a farm, but also conducts activities outside the farm definition that require the establishment to be registered.
Nonprofit food establishment
means a charitable entity that prepares or serves food directly to the consumer or otherwise provides food or meals for consumption by humans or animals in the United States. The term includes central food banks, soup kitchens, and nonprofit food delivery services. To be considered a nonprofit food establishment, the establishment must meet the terms of section 501(c)(3) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3)).
Packaging
(when used as a verb) means placing food into a container that directly contacts the food and that the consumer receives.
Packing
means placing food into a container other than packaging the food and also includes re-packing and activities performed incidental to packing or re-packing a food (
e.g.,
activities performed for the safe or effective packing or re-packing of that food (such as sorting, culling, grading, and weighing or conveying incidental to packing or re-packing)), but does not include activities that transform a raw agricultural commodity, as defined in
section 201(r) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, into a processed food as defined in section 201(gg) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.
Restaurant
means a facility that prepares and sells food directly to consumers for immediate consumption. “Restaurant” does not include facilities that provide food to interstate conveyances, central kitchens, and other similar facilities that do not prepare and serve food directly to consumers.
(1) Entities in which food is provided to humans, such as cafeterias, lunchrooms, cafes, bistros, fast food establishments, food stands, saloons, taverns, bars, lounges, catering facilities, hospital kitchens, day care kitchens, and nursing home kitchens are restaurants; and
(2) Pet shelters, kennels, and veterinary facilities in which food is provided to animals are restaurants.
Retail food establishment
means an establishment that sells food products directly to consumers as its primary function. The term “retail food establishment” includes facilities that manufacture, process, pack, or hold food if the establishment's primary function is to sell from that establishment food, including food that it manufactures, processes, packs, or holds, directly to consumers. A retail food establishment's primary function is to sell food directly to consumers if the annual monetary value of sales of food products directly to consumers exceeds the annual monetary value of sales of food products to all other buyers. The term “consumers” does not include businesses. A “retail food establishment” includes grocery stores, convenience stores, and vending machine locations. A “retail food establishment” also includes certain farm-operated businesses selling food directly to consumers as their primary function.
(1) Sale of food directly to consumers from an establishment located on a farm includes sales by that establishment directly to consumers:
(i) At a roadside stand (a stand situated on the side of or near a road or thoroughfare at which a farmer sells food from his or her farm directly to consumers) or farmers' market (a location where one or more local farmers assemble to sell food from their farms directly to consumers);
(ii) Through a community supported agriculture program. Community supported agriculture (CSA) program means a program under which a farmer or group of farmers grows food for a group of shareholders (or subscribers) who pledge to buy a portion of the farmer's crop(s) for that season. This includes CSA programs in which a group of farmers consolidate their crops at a central location for distribution to shareholders or subscribers; and
(iii) At other such direct-to-consumer sales platforms, including door-to-door sales; mail, catalog and Internet order, including online farmers markets and online grocery delivery; religious or other organization bazaars; and State and local fairs.
(2) Sale of food directly to consumers by a farm-operated business includes the sale of food by that farm-operated business directly to consumers:
(i) At a roadside stand (a stand situated on the side of or near a road or thoroughfare at which a farmer sells food from his or her farm directly to consumers) or farmers' market (a location where one or more local farmers assemble to sell food from their farms directly to consumers);
(ii) Through a community supported agriculture program. Community supported agriculture (CSA) program means a program under which a farmer or group of farmers grows food for a group of shareholders (or subscribers) who pledge to buy a portion of the farmer's crop(s) for that season. This includes CSA programs in which a group of farmers consolidate their crops at a central location for distribution to shareholders or subscribers; and
(iii) At other such direct-to-consumer sales platforms, including door-to-door sales; mail, catalog and Internet order, including online farmers markets and online grocery delivery; religious or other organization bazaars; and State and local fairs.
(3) For the purposes of this definition, “farm-operated business” means a business that is managed by one or more farms and conducts manufacturing/processing not on the farm(s).
Trade name
means the name or names under which the facility conducts business, or additional names by which the facility is known. A trade name is associated with a facility, and a brand name is associated with a product.
U.S. agent
means a person (as defined in section 201(e) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 321(e))) residing or maintaining a place of business in the United States whom a foreign facility designates as its agent for purposes of this subpart. A U.S. agent may not be in the form of a mailbox, answering machine or service, or other place where an individual acting as the foreign facility's agent is not physically present.
(1) The U.S. agent acts as a communications link between FDA and the foreign facility for both emergency and routine communications. The U.S. agent will be the person FDA contacts when an emergency occurs, unless the registration specifies another emergency contact.
(2) FDA will treat representations by the U.S. agent as those of the foreign facility, and will consider information or documents provided to the U.S. agent the equivalent of providing the information or documents to the foreign facility. FDA will consider the U.S. agent the equivalent of the registrant for purposes of sharing information and communications. The U.S. agent of a foreign facility may view the information submitted in the foreign facility's registration.
(3) Having a single U.S. agent for the purposes of this subpart does not preclude facilities from having multiple agents (such as foreign suppliers) for other business purposes. A firm's commercial business in the United States need not be conducted through the U.S. agent designated for purposes of this subpart.
You or registrant
means the owner, operator, or agent in charge of a facility that manufactures/processes, packs, or holds food for consumption in the United States.

# Procedures for Registration of Food Facilities
§ 1.230
When must you register or renew your registration?
(a)
Registration.
You must register before your facility begins to manufacture, process, pack, or hold food for consumption in the United States. You may authorize an individual to register the facility on your behalf.
(b)
Registration renewal.
You must submit a registration renewal containing the information required under § 1.232 every other year, during the period beginning on October 1 and ending on December 31 of each even-numbered year. You may authorize an individual to renew a facility's registration on your behalf. If the individual submitting the registration renewal is not the owner, operator, or agent in charge of the facility, the registration renewal must also include a statement in which the individual certifies that the information submitted is true and accurate, certifies that he/she is authorized to submit the registration renewal, and identifies by name, address, and telephone number, the individual who authorized submission of the registration renewal. In addition, the registration renewal must also identify the individual who authorized submission of the registration renewal by email address, unless FDA has granted a waiver under § 1.245. Each registration renewal must include the name of the individual submitting the registration renewal, and the individual's signature (for the paper option). Each electronic registration renewal must include the name of the individual submitting the renewal.
(c)
Abbreviated registration renewal process.
If you do not have any changes to the information required under § 1.232 since you submitted the preceding registration, registration renewal, or update for your facility, you may use the abbreviated registration renewal process. If you use the abbreviated registration renewal process, you must confirm that no changes have been made to the information required under § 1.232 since you submitted the preceding registration, registration renewal or update, and you must certify that the information submitted is
truthful and accurate. Each abbreviated registration renewal must include the name of the individual submitting the abbreviated renewal, and the individual's signature (for the paper option). Each electronic abbreviated registration renewal must include the name of the individual submitting the abbreviated renewal. For abbreviated registration renewals not submitted by the owner, operator, or agent in charge of the facility, the abbreviated renewal must provide the email address of the individual who authorized submission of the abbreviated renewal, unless FDA has granted a waiver under § 1.245. You must use Form FDA 3537 to submit abbreviated registration renewals to FDA.

In addition to the requirements of this subpart, you must comply with the registration regulations found in part 108 of this chapter, related to emergency permit control, and any other Federal, State, or local registration requirements that apply to your facility.
§ 1.241
What are the consequences of failing to register, update, renew, or cancel your registration?
(a) Section 301 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 331) prohibits the doing of certain acts or causing such acts to be done. Under section 302 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 332), the United States can bring a civil action in Federal court to enjoin a person who commits a prohibited act. Under section 303 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 333), the United States can bring a criminal action in Federal court to prosecute a person who is responsible for the commission of a prohibited act. Under section 306 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 335a), FDA can seek debarment of any person who has been convicted of a felony relating to importation of food into the United States. Failure of an owner, operator, or agent in charge of a domestic or foreign facility to register its facility, renew the registration of its facility, update required elements of its facility's registration, or cancel its registration in accordance with the requirements of this subpart is a prohibited act under section 301(dd) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.
(b) FDA will consider a registration for a food facility to be expired if the registration is not renewed, as required by § 1.230(b). Thus, if you previously submitted a registration to FDA, but do not submit a registration renewal to FDA during the period beginning on October 1 and ending on December 31 of each even-numbered year, FDA will consider the registration for the facility to be expired. FDA will consider a food facility with an expired registration to have failed to register in accordance with section 415 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.
(c) FDA will cancel a registration if FDA independently verifies that the facility is no longer in business or has changed owners, and the owner, operator, or agent in charge of the facility fails to cancel the registration, or if FDA determines that the registration is for a facility that does not exist, is not required to register, or where the information about the facility's address was not updated in a timely manner in accordance with § 1.234(a) or the registration was submitted by a person not authorized to submit the registration under § 1.225. Also, FDA will cancel a registration if the facility's registration has expired because the facility has failed to renew its registration in accordance with § 1.230(b). If FDA cancels a facility's registration, FDA will send a confirmation of the cancellation using contact information submitted by the facility in the registration database.
(d) If an article of food is imported or offered for import into the United States and a foreign facility that manufactured/processed, packed, or held that article of food has not registered in accordance with this subpart, the disposition of the article of food shall be governed by the procedures set out in subpart I of this part.
[81 FR 45953, July 14, 2016]
§ 1.242
What does assignment of a registration number mean?
Assignment of a registration number to a facility means that the facility is registered with FDA. Assignment of a registration number does not in any way convey FDA's approval or endorsement of a facility or its products.
§ 1.243
Is food registration information available to the public?
(a) The list of registered facilities and registration documents submitted under this subpart are not subject to disclosure under 5 U.S.C. 552 (the Freedom of Information Act). In addition, any information derived from such list or registration documents that would disclose the identity or location of a specific registered person, is not subject to disclosure under 5 U.S.C. 552 (the Freedom of Information Act).
(b) Paragraph (a) of this section does not apply to any information obtained by other means or that has previously been disclosed to the public as defined in § 20.81 of this chapter.
§ 1.245
Waiver request.
Under §§ 1.231(a)(2) and (b), 1.234(d), and 1.235(d), beginning January 4, 2020, you must submit your registration, registration renewal, updates, and cancellations to FDA electronically unless FDA has granted a waiver from such
requirement. Under § 1.232(a)(6), you must provide the email address of the owner, operator, or agent in charge of the facility unless FDA has granted a waiver from such requirement. In addition, under §§ 1.230(b) and (c), 1.232(a)(10), 1.234(a), and 1.235(b)(5), registration renewals, abbreviated registration renewals, registrations, updates, and cancellations not submitted by the owner, operator, or agent in charge must include the email address for the individual who authorized the submission, unless FDA has granted a waiver. To request a waiver from these requirements, you must submit a written request to FDA that explains why it is not reasonable for you to submit your registration, registration renewal, update, or cancellation to FDA electronically or to provide the email address of the owner, operator, or agent in charge of the facility. You must submit your request to: U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, 5001 Campus Dr. (HFS-681), College Park, MD 20740.

# Consequences
§ 1.283
What happens to food that is imported or offered for import without adequate prior notice?
(a) For each article of food that is imported or offered for import into the United States, except for food arriving by international mail or food carried by or otherwise accompanying an individual, the consequences are:
(1)
Inadequate prior notice
—(i)
No prior notice.
If an article of food arrives at the port of arrival and no prior notice has been submitted and confirmed by FDA for review, the food is subject to refusal of admission under section 801(m)(1) of the act (21 U.S.C. 381(m)(1)). If an article of food is refused for lack of prior notice, unless U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) concurrence is obtained for export and the article is immediately exported from the port of arrival under CBP supervision, it must be held within the port of entry for the article unless directed by CBP or FDA.
(ii)
Inaccurate prior notice.
If prior notice has been submitted and confirmed by FDA for review, but upon review of the notice or examination of the article of food, the notice is determined to be inaccurate, the food is subject to refusal of admission under section 801(m)(1) of the act. If the article of food is refused due to inaccurate prior notice, unless CBP concurrence is obtained for export and the article is immediately exported from the port of arrival under CBP supervision, it must be held within the port of entry for the article unless directed by CBP or FDA.
(iii)
Untimely prior notice.
If prior notice has been submitted and confirmed by FDA for review, but the full time that applies under § 1.279 for prior notice has not elapsed when the article of food arrives, the food is subject to refusal of admission under section 801(m)(1) of the act, unless FDA has already reviewed the prior notice, determined its response to the prior notice, and advised CBP of that response. If the article of food is refused due to untimely prior notice, unless CBP concurrence is obtained for export and the article is immediately exported from the port of arrival under CBP supervision, it must be held within the port of entry for the article unless directed by CBP or FDA.
(2)
Status and movement of refused food.
(i) An article of food that has been refused under section 801(m)(1) of the act and paragraph (a) of this section shall be considered general order merchandise as described in section 490 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1490).
(ii) Refused food must be moved under appropriate custodial bond unless immediately exported under CBP supervision. If the food is to be held at the port, FDA must be notified of the location where the food is held at that port before the food is moved there. If the food is to be held at a secure facility outside the port, FDA must be notified of the location of the secure facility before the food is moved there. The refused food shall not be entered and shall not be delivered to any importer, owner, or ultimate consignee. If the food is to be held at a secure facility outside a port, the food must be taken directly to that secure facility.
(3)
Segregation of refused foods.
If an article of food that is refused is part of a shipment that contains articles of food that have not been placed under hold or other merchandise not subject to this subpart, the refused article of food may be segregated from the rest of the shipment. This segregation must take place where the article is held. FDA or CBP may supervise segregation. If FDA or CBP determines that supervision is necessary, segregation must not take place without supervision.
(4)
Costs.
Neither FDA nor CBP are liable for transportation, storage, or other expenses resulting from refusal.
(5)
Export after refusal.
An article of food that has been refused under paragraph (a) of this section may be exported with CBP concurrence and under CBP supervision unless it is seized or administratively detained by FDA or CBP under other authority. If an article of food that has been refused admission under paragraph (a) of this section is exported, the prior notice should be cancelled within 5-business days of exportation.
(6)
No post-refusal submission or request for review.
If an article of food is refused under section 801(m)(1) of the act
and no prior notice is submitted or resubmitted, no request for FDA review is submitted in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section, or export has not occurred in accordance with paragraph (a)(5) of this section, the article of food shall be dealt with as set forth in CBP regulations relating to general order merchandise (19 CFR part 127), except that, unless otherwise agreed to by CBP and FDA, the article may only be sold for export or destroyed.
(b)
Food carried by or otherwise accompanying an individual.
If food carried by or otherwise accompanying an individual arriving in the United States is not for personal use and does not have adequate prior notice or the individual cannot provide FDA or CBP with a copy of the prior notice (PN) confirmation, the food is subject to refusal of admission under section 801(m)(1) of the act. If before leaving the port, the individual does not arrange to have the food held at the port or exported, FDA or CBP may destroy the article of food.
(c)
Post-Refusal prior notice submissions.
(1) If an article of food is refused under paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section (no prior notice) and the food is not exported, prior notice must be submitted in accordance with §§ 1.280 and 1.281(c).
(2) If an article of food is refused under paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section (inaccurate prior notice) and the food is not exported, the prior notice should be canceled in accordance with § 1.282 and you must resubmit prior notice in accordance with §§ 1.280 and 1.281(c).
(3) Once the prior notice has been submitted or resubmitted and confirmed by FDA for review, FDA will endeavor to review and respond to the prior notice submission within the timeframes set out in § 1.279.
(d)
FDA review after refusal.
(1) If an article of food has been refused admission under section 801(m)(1) of the act, a request may be submitted asking FDA to review whether the article is subject to the requirements of this subpart under § 1.277, or whether the information submitted in a prior notice is complete and accurate. A request for review may not be used to submit prior notice or to resubmit an inaccurate prior notice.
(2) A request may be submitted only by the carrier, submitter, importer, owner, or ultimate consignee. A request must identify which one the requester is.
(3) A request must be submitted in writing to FDA and delivered by fax or e-mail. The location for receipt of a request is listed at
http://www.fda.gov
—see Prior Notice. A request must include all factual and legal information necessary for FDA to conduct its review. Only one request for review may be submitted for each refused article.
(4) The request must be submitted within 5-calendar days of the refusal. FDA will review and respond within 5-calendar days of receiving the request.
(5) If FDA determines that the article is not subject to the requirements of this subpart under § 1.277 or that the prior notice submission is complete and accurate, it will notify the requester, the transmitter, and CBP that the food is no longer subject to refusal under section 801(m)(1) of the act.
(e)
International mail.
If an article of food arrives by international mail with inadequate prior notice or the PN confirmation number is not affixed as required, the parcel will be held by CBP for 72 hours for FDA inspection and disposition. If FDA refuses the article under section 801(m)(1) of the act and there is a return address, the parcel may be returned to sender marked “No Prior Notice—FDA Refused.” If the article is refused and there is no return address or FDA determines that the article of food in the parcel appears to present a hazard, FDA may dispose of or destroy the parcel at its expense. If FDA does not respond within 72 hours of the CBP hold, CBP may return the parcel to the sender or, if there is no return address, destroy the parcel, at FDA expense.
(f)
Prohibitions on delivery and transfer.
(1) Notwithstanding section 801(b) of the act, an article of food refused under section 801(m)(1) of the act may not be delivered to the importer, owner, or ultimate consignee until prior notice is submitted to FDA in accordance with this subpart, FDA has examined the prior notice, FDA has determined that the prior notice is adequate, and FDA has notified CBP and the transmitter that the article of food
is no longer refused admission under section 801(m)(1) of the act.
(2) During the time an article of food that has been refused under section 801(m)(1) of the act is held, the article may not be transferred by any person from the port or other designated secure facility until prior notice is submitted to FDA in accordance with this subpart, FDA has examined the prior notice, FDA has determined that the prior notice is adequate, and FDA has notified CBP and the transmitter that the article of food no longer is refused admission under section 801(m)(1) of the act. After this notification by FDA to CBP and transmitter, entry may be made in accordance with law and regulation.
(g)
Relationship to other admissibility decisions.
A determination that an article of food is no longer refused under section 801(m)(1) of the act is different than, and may come before, determinations of admissibility under other provisions of the act or other U.S. laws. A determination that an article of food is no longer refused under section 801(m)(1) of the act does not mean that it will be granted admission under other provisions of the act or other U.S. laws.
§ 1.284
What are the other consequences of failing to submit adequate prior notice or otherwise failing to comply with this subpart?

If an article of food is placed under hold under section 801(l) of the act and no registration number or request for FDA review is submitted in accordance with paragraph (j) of this section or export has not occurred in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section, the food shall be dealt with as set forth in CBP regulations relating to general order merchandise, except that, unless otherwise agreed to by CBP and FDA, the article may only be sold for export or destroyed.
(h)
Food carried by or otherwise accompanying an individual.
If an article of food carried by or otherwise accompanying an individual arriving in the United States is not for personal use and is placed under hold under section 801(l) of the act because it is from a foreign facility that is not registered as required under section 415 of the act and subpart H of this part, the individual may arrange to have the food held at the port or exported. If such arrangements cannot be made, the article of food may be destroyed.
(i)
Post-hold submissions.
(1) To resolve a hold, if an article of food is held under paragraph (b) of this section because it is from a foreign facility that is not registered, the facility must be registered and a registration number must be obtained.
(2) The FDA Division of Food Defense Targeting must be notified of the applicable registration number in writing. The notification must provide the name and contact information for the person submitting the information. The notification may be delivered to FDA by fax or e-mail. The contact information for these delivery methods is listed at
http://www.fda.gov
—see Prior Notice. The notification should include the applicable CBP entry identifier.

(j)
FDA review after hold.
(1) If an article of food has been placed under hold under section 801(l) of the act, a request may be submitted asking FDA to review whether the facility associated with the article is subject to the requirements of section 415 of the act. A request for review may not be submitted to obtain a registration number.
(2) A request may be submitted only by the carrier, submitter, importer, owner, or ultimate consignee of the article. A request must identify which one the requestor is.
(3) A request must be submitted in writing to FDA and delivered by fax or e-mail. The location for receipt of a request is listed at
http://www.fda.gov
—see Prior Notice. A request must include all factual and legal information necessary for FDA to conduct its review. Only one request for review may be submitted for each article under hold.
(4) The request must be submitted within 5-calendar days of the hold. FDA will review and respond within 5-calendar days of receiving the request.
(5) If FDA determines that the article is not from a facility subject to the requirements of section 415 of the act, it will notify the requestor and CBP that the food is no longer subject to hold under section 801(l) of the act.
(k)
International mail.
If an article of food that arrives by international mail is from a foreign facility that is not registered as required under section 415 of the act and subpart H of this part, the parcel will be held by CBP for 72 hours for FDA inspection and disposition. If the article is placed under hold under section 801(l) of the act and there
is a return address, the parcel may be returned to sender marked “No Registration—No Admission Permitted.” If the article is under hold and there is no return address or FDA determines that the article of food in the parcel appears to present a hazard, FDA may dispose of or destroy the parcel at its expense. If FDA does not respond within 72 hours of the CBP hold, CBP may return the parcel to the sender marked “No Registration—No Admission Permitted” or, if there is no return address, destroy the parcel, at FDA expense.
(l)
Prohibitions on delivery and transfer.
Notwithstanding section 801(b) of the act, while an article of food is under hold under section 801(l) of the act, it may not be delivered to the importer, owner, or ultimate consignee.

(m)
Relationship to other admissibility provisions.
A determination that an article of food is no longer subject to hold under section 801(l) of the act is different than, and may come before, determinations of admissibility under other provisions of the act or other U.S. laws. A determination that an article of food is no longer under hold under section 801(l) of the act does not mean that it will be granted admission under other provisions of the act or other U.S. laws.

§ 1.328
What definitions apply to this subpart?
The definitions of terms in section 201 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) (21 U.S.C. 321) apply to such terms when used in this subpart. In addition, for the purposes of this subpart:
Farm
means:
(1)
Primary production farm.
A primary production farm is an operation under one management in one general (but not necessarily contiguous) physical location devoted to the growing of
crops, the harvesting of crops, the raising of animals (including seafood), or any combination of these activities. The term “farm” includes operations that, in addition to these activities:
(i) Pack or hold raw agricultural commodities;
(ii) Pack or hold processed food, provided that all processed food used in such activities is either consumed on that farm or another farm under the same management, or is processed food identified in paragraph (1)(iii)(B)(
1
) of this definition; and
(iii) Manufacture/process food, provided that:
(A) All food used in such activities is consumed on that farm or another farm under the same management; or
(B) Any manufacturing/processing of food that is not consumed on that farm or another farm under the same management consists only of:
(
1
) Drying/dehydrating raw agricultural commodities to create a distinct commodity (such as drying/dehydrating grapes to produce raisins), and packaging and labeling such commodities, without additional manufacturing/processing (an example of additional manufacturing/processing is slicing);
(
2
) Treatment to manipulate the ripening of raw agricultural commodities (such as by treating produce with ethylene gas), and packaging and labeling treated raw agricultural commodities, without additional manufacturing/processing; and
(
3
) Packaging and labeling raw agricultural commodities, when these activities do not involve additional manufacturing/processing (an example of additional manufacturing/processing is irradiation); or
(2)
Secondary activities farm.
A secondary activities farm is an operation, not located on a primary production farm, devoted to harvesting (such as hulling or shelling), packing, and/or holding of raw agricultural commodities, provided that the primary production farm(s) that grows, harvests, and/or raises the majority of the raw agricultural commodities harvested, packed, and/or held by the secondary activities farm owns, or jointly owns, a majority interest in the secondary activities farm. A secondary activities farm may also conduct those additional activities allowed on a primary production farm as described in paragraphs (1)(ii) and (iii) of this definition.
Food
has the meaning given in section 201(f) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Examples of food include, but are not limited to fruits; vegetables; fish; dairy products; eggs; raw agricultural commodities for use as food or as components of food; animal feed, including pet food; food and feed ingredients and additives, including substances that migrate into food from the finished container and other articles that contact food; dietary supplements and dietary ingredients; infant formula; beverages, including alcoholic beverages and bottled water; live food animals; bakery goods; snack foods; candy; and canned foods.
Full-time equivalent employee
means all individuals employed by the person claiming the exemption. The number of full-time equivalent employees is determined by dividing the total number of hours of salary or wages paid directly to employees of the person and of all of its affiliates by the number of hours of work in 1 year, 2,080 hours (i.e., 40 hours × 52 weeks).
Harvesting
applies to farms and farm mixed-type facilities and means activities that are traditionally performed on farms for the purpose of removing raw agricultural commodities from the place they were grown or raised and preparing them for use as food. Harvesting is limited to activities performed on raw agricultural commodities, or on processed foods created by drying/dehydrating a raw agricultural commodity without additional manufacturing/processing, on a farm. Harvesting does not include activities that transform a raw agricultural commodity into a processed food as defined in section 201(gg) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Examples of harvesting include cutting (or otherwise separating) the edible portion of the raw agricultural commodity from the crop plant and removing or trimming part of the raw agricultural commodity (
e.g.,
foliage, husks, roots, or stems). Examples of harvesting also include cooling, field coring, filtering, gathering, hulling, shelling, sifting, threshing, trimming of outer leaves of,
and washing raw agricultural commodities grown on a farm.
Holding
means storage of food and also includes activities performed incidental to storage of a food (
e.g.,
activities performed for the safe or effective storage of that food, such as fumigating food during storage, and drying/dehydrating raw agricultural commodities when the drying/dehydrating does not create a distinct commodity (such as drying/dehydrating hay or alfalfa)). Holding also includes activities performed as a practical necessity for the distribution of that food (such as blending of the same raw agricultural commodity and breaking down pallets), but does not include activities that transform a raw agricultural commodity into a processed food as defined in section 201(gg) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Holding facilities could include warehouses, cold storage facilities, storage silos, grain elevators, and liquid storage tanks.
Manufacturing/processing
means making food from one or more ingredients, or synthesizing, preparing, treating, modifying or manipulating food, including food crops or ingredients. Examples of manufacturing/processing activities include: Baking, boiling, bottling, canning, cooking, cooling, cutting, distilling, drying/dehydrating raw agricultural commodities to create a distinct commodity (such as drying/dehydrating grapes to produce raisins), evaporating, eviscerating, extracting juice, formulating, freezing, grinding, homogenizing, irradiating, labeling, milling, mixing, packaging (including modified atmosphere packaging), pasteurizing, peeling, rendering, treating to manipulate ripening, trimming, washing, or waxing. For farms and farm mixed-type facilities, manufacturing/processing does not include activities that are part of harvesting, packing, or holding.
Mixed-type facility
means an establishment that engages in both activities that are exempt from registration under section 415 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and activities that require the establishment to be registered. An example of such a facility is a “farm mixed-type facility,” which is an establishment that is a farm, but also conducts activities outside the farm definition that require the establishment to be registered.
Nonprofit food establishment
means a charitable entity that prepares or serves food directly to the consumer or otherwise provides food or meals for consumption by humans or animals in the United States. The term includes central food banks, soup kitchens, and nonprofit food delivery services. To be considered a nonprofit food establishment, the establishment must meet the terms of section 501(c)(3) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3)).
Nontransporter
means a person who owns food or who holds, manufactures, processes, packs, imports, receives, or distributes food for purposes other than transportation.
Nontransporter immediate previous source
means a person that last had food before transferring it to another nontransporter.
Nontransporter immediate subsequent recipient
means a nontransporter that acquires food from another nontransporter.
Packaging
(when used as a noun) means the outer packaging of food that bears the label and does not contact the food. Packaging does not include food contact substances as they are defined in section 409(h)(6) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.
Packaging
(when used as a verb) means placing food into a container that directly contacts the food and that the consumer receives.
Packing
means placing food into a container other than packaging the food and also includes re-packing and activities performed incidental to packing or re-packing a food (
e.g.,
activities performed for the safe or effective packing or re-packing of that food (such as sorting, culling, grading, and weighing or conveying incidental to packing or re-packing)), but does not include activities that transform a raw agricultural commodity, as defined in section 201(r) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, into a processed food as defined in section 201(gg) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.
Person
includes individual, partnership, corporation, and association.
Recipe
means the formula, including ingredients, quantities, and instructions, necessary to manufacture a food product. Because a recipe must have all three elements, a list of the ingredients used to manufacture a product without quantity information and manufacturing instructions is not a recipe.
Restaurant
means a facility that prepares and sells food directly to consumers for immediate consumption. “Restaurant” does not include facilities that provide food to interstate conveyances, central kitchens, and other similar facilities that do not prepare and serve food directly to consumers.
(1) Facilities in which food is directly provided to humans, such as cafeterias, lunchrooms, cafes, bistros, fast food establishments, food stands, saloons, taverns, bars, lounges, catering facilities, hospital kitchens, day care kitchens, and nursing home kitchens, are restaurants.
(2) Pet shelters, kennels, and veterinary facilities in which food is directly provided to animals are restaurants.
Transporter
means a person who has possession, custody, or control of an article of food in the United States for the sole purpose of transporting the food, whether by road, rail, water, or air. Transporter also includes a foreign person that transports food in the United States, regardless of whether that foreign person has possession, custody, or control of that food for the sole purpose of transporting that food.
Transporter's immediate previous source
means a person from whom a transporter received food. This source can be either another transporter or a nontransporter.
Transporter's immediate subsequent recipient
means a person to whom a transporter delivered food. This recipient can be either another transporter or a nontransporter.
You
means a person subject to this subpart under § 1.326.
[69 FR 71651, Dec. 9, 2004, as amended at 80 FR 56143, Sept. 17, 2015; 81 FR 3715, Jan. 22, 2016]
§ 1.329
Do other statutory provisions and regulations apply?
(a) In addition to the regulations in this subpart, you must comply with all other applicable statutory provisions and regulations related to the establishment and maintenance of records for foods except as described in paragraph (b) of this section. For example, the regulations in this subpart are in addition to existing recordkeeping regulations for low acid canned foods, juice, seafood, infant formula, color additives, bottled water, animal feed, and medicated animal feed.
(b) Records established or maintained to satisfy the requirements of this subpart that meet the definition of electronic records in § 11.3(b)(6) (21 CFR 11.3 (b)(6)) of this chapter are exempt from the requirements of part 11 of this chapter. Records that satisfy the requirements of this subpart but that are also required under other applicable statutory provisions or regulations remain subject to part 11 of this chapter.
§ 1.330
Can existing records satisfy the requirements of this subpart?
The regulations in this subpart do not require duplication of existing records if those records contain all of the information required by this subpart. If a covered person keeps records of all of the information as required by this subpart to comply with other Federal, State, or local regulations, or for any other reason, then those records may be used to meet these requirements. Moreover, persons do not have to keep all of the information required by this rule in one set of records. If they have records containing some of the required information, they may keep those existing records and keep, either separately or in a combined form, any new information required by this rule. There is no obligation to create an entirely new record or compilation of records containing both existing and new information, even if the records containing some of the required information were not created at the time the food was received or released.

§ 1.653
What must an accredited third-party certification body do when issuing food or facility certifications?
(a)
Basis for issuance of a food or facility certification.
(1) Prior to issuing a food or facility certification to an eligible entity, an accredited third-party certification body (or, where applicable, an audit agent on its behalf) must complete a regulatory audit that meets the requirements of § 1.651 and any other activities that may be necessary to determine compliance with the applicable food safety requirements of the FD
C Act and FDA regulations.
(2) If, as a result of an observation during a regulatory audit, an eligible entity must implement a corrective action plan to address a deficiency, an accredited third-party certification body may not issue a food or facility certification to such entity until after the accredited third-party certification body verifies that eligible entity has implemented the corrective action plan through methods that reliably verify the corrective action was taken and as a result the identified deficiency is unlikely to recur, except onsite verification is required for corrective actions required to address deficiencies that are the subject of a notification under § 1.656(c).
(3) An accredited third-party certification body must consider each observation and the data and other information from a regulatory audit and other activities conducted under § 1.651 to determine whether the entity was in compliance with the applicable food safety requirements of the FD
C Act and FDA regulations at the time of the audit and whether the eligible entity, given its food safety system and practices, would be likely to remain in compliance for the duration of any certification issued under this subpart.
(4) A single regulatory audit may result in issuance of one or more food or facility certifications under this subpart, provided that the requirements of issuance are met as to each such certification.
(5) Where an accredited third-party certification body uses an audit agent to conduct a regulatory audit of an eligible entity under this subpart, the accredited third-party certification body (and not the audit agent) must make the determination whether to issue a food or facility certification based on the results of such regulatory audit.
(b)
Issuance of a food or facility certification and submission to FDA.
(1) Any food or facility certification issued under this subpart must be submitted to FDA electronically and in English. The accredited third-party certification body may issue a food or facility certification under this subpart for a term of up to 12 months.
(2) A food or facility certification must contain, at a minimum, the following elements:
(i) The name and address of the accredited third-party certification body and the scope and date of its accreditation under this subpart;
(ii) The name, address, FDA Establishment Identifier, and unique facility identifier, if designated by FDA, of the eligible entity to which the food or facility certification was issued;
(iii) The name, address, FDA Establishment Identifier, and unique facility identifier, if designated by FDA, of the facility where the regulatory audit was conducted, if different than the eligible entity;
(iv) The scope and date(s) of the regulatory audit and the certification number;
(v) The name of the audit agent(s) (where applicable) conducting the regulatory audit; and
(vi) The scope of the food or facility certification, date of issuance, and date of expiration.
(3) FDA may refuse to accept any certification for purposes of section 801(q) or 806 of the FD
C Act, if FDA determines, that such food or facility certification is not valid or reliable because, for example:
(i) The certification is offered in support of the admissibility of a food that was not within the scope of the certification;
(ii) The certification was issued by an accredited third-party certification body acting outside the scope of its accreditation under this subpart; or
(iii) The certification was issued without reliable demonstration that the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section were met.
§ 1.654
When must an accredited third-party certification body monitor an eligible entity that it has issued a food or facility certification?
If an accredited third-party certification body has reason to believe that an eligible entity to which it issued a food or facility certification may no longer be in compliance with the applicable food safety requirements of the FD
C Act and FDA regulations, the accredited third-party certification body must conduct any monitoring (including an onsite audit) of such eligible entity necessary to determine whether the entity is in compliance with such requirements. The accredited third-party certification body must immediately notify FDA, under § 1.656(d), if it withdraws or suspends a food or facility certification because it determines that the entity is no longer in compliance with the applicable food safety requirements of the FD
C Act and FDA regulations. The accredited third-party certification body must maintain records of such monitoring under § 1.658.
§ 1.655
How must an accredited third-party certification body monitor its own performance?

Subpart P [Reserved]

# Subpart Q—Administrative Detention of Drugs Intended for Human or Animal Use
§ 1.980
Administrative detention of drugs.
(a)
General.
This section sets forth the procedures for detention of drugs believed to be adulterated or misbranded. Administrative detention is intended to protect the public by preventing distribution or use of drugs encountered during inspections that may
be adulterated or misbranded, until the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has had time to consider what action it should take concerning the drugs, and to initiate legal action, if appropriate. Drugs that FDA orders detained may not be used, moved, altered, or tampered with in any manner by any person during the detention period, except as authorized under paragraph (h) of this section, until FDA terminates the detention order under paragraph (j) of this section, or the detention period expires, whichever occurs first.
(b)
Criteria for ordering detention.
Administrative detention of drugs may be ordered in accordance with this section when an authorized FDA representative, during an inspection under section 704 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, has reason to believe that a drug, as defined in section 201(g) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, is adulterated or misbranded.
(c)
Detention period.
The detention is to be for a reasonable period that may not exceed 20 calendar days after the detention order is issued, unless the FDA Division Director in whose division the drugs are located determines that a greater period is required to seize the drugs, to institute injunction proceedings, or to evaluate the need for legal action, in which case the Division Director may authorize detention for 10 additional calendar days. The additional 10-calendar-day detention period may be ordered at the time the detention order is issued or at any time thereafter. The entire detention period may not exceed 30 calendar days, except when the detention period is extended under paragraph (g)(6) of this section. An authorized FDA representative may, in accordance with paragraph (j) of this section, terminate a detention before the expiration of the detention period.
(d)
Issuance of detention order.
(1) The detention order must be issued in writing, in the form of a detention notice, signed by the authorized FDA representative who has reason to believe that the drugs are adulterated or misbranded, and issued to the owner, operator, or agent in charge of the place where the drugs are located. If the owner or the user of the drugs is different from the owner, operator, or agent in charge of the place where the drugs are detained, a copy of the detention order must be provided to the owner or user of the drugs if the owner's or user's identity can be readily determined.
(2) If detention of drugs in a vehicle or other carrier is ordered, a copy of the detention order must be provided to the shipper of record and the owner of the vehicle or other carrier, if their identities can be readily determined.
(3) The detention order must include the following information:
(i) A statement that the drugs identified in the order are detained for the period shown;
(ii) A brief, general statement of the reasons for the detention;
(iii) The location of the drugs;
(iv) A statement that these drugs are not to be used, moved, altered, or tampered with in any manner during that period, except as permitted under paragraph (h) of this section, without the written permission of an authorized FDA representative;
(v) Identification of the detained drugs;
(vi) The detention order number;
(vii) The date and hour of the detention order;
(viii) The period of the detention;
(ix) The text of section 304(g) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and paragraphs (g)(1) and (g)(2) of this section;
(x) A statement that any informal hearing on an appeal of a detention order must be conducted as a regulatory hearing under part 16 of this chapter, with certain exceptions described in paragraph (g)(3) of this section; and
(xi) The mailing address, telephone number, and name of the FDA Division Director.
(e)
Approval of detention order.
A detention order, before issuance, must be approved by the FDA Division Director in whose division the drugs are located. If prior written approval is not feasible, prior oral approval must be obtained and confirmed by written memorandum within FDA as soon as possible.
(f)
Labeling or marking a detained drug.
An FDA representative issuing a detention order under paragraph (d) of this section must label or mark the drugs with official FDA tags that include the following information:
(1) A statement that the drugs are detained by the U.S. Government in accordance with section 304(g) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 334(g)).
(2) A statement that the drugs must not be used, moved, altered, or tampered with in any manner for the period shown, without the written permission of an authorized FDA representative, except as authorized in paragraph (h) of this section.
(3) A statement that the violation of a detention order or the removal or alteration of the tag is punishable by fine or imprisonment or both (section 303 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 333)).
(4) The detention order number, the date and hour of the detention order, the detention period, and the name of the FDA representative who issued the detention order.
(g)
Appeal of a detention order.
(1) A person who would be entitled to claim the drugs, if seized, may appeal a detention order. Any appeal must be submitted in writing to the FDA Division Director in whose division the drugs are located within 5 working days of receipt of a detention order. If the appeal includes a request for an informal hearing, as defined in section 201(x) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 321(x)), the appellant must request either that a hearing be held within 5 working days after the appeal is filed or that the hearing be held at a later date, which must not be later than 20 calendar days after receipt of a detention order.
(2) The appellant of a detention order must state the ownership or proprietary interest the appellant has in the detained drugs. If the detained drugs are located at a place other than an establishment owned or operated by the appellant, the appellant must include documents showing that the appellant would have legitimate authority to claim the drugs if seized.
(3) Any informal hearing on an appeal of a detention order must be conducted as a regulatory hearing under regulation in accordance with part 16 of this chapter, except that:
(i) The detention order under paragraph (d) of this section, rather than the notice under § 16.22(a) of this chapter, provides notice of opportunity for a hearing under this section and is part of the administrative record of the regulatory hearing under § 16.80(a) of this chapter;
(ii) A request for a hearing under this section should be addressed to the FDA Division Director;
(iii) The last sentence of § 16.24(e) of this chapter, stating that a hearing may not be required to be held at a time less than 2 working days after receipt of the request for a hearing, does not apply to a hearing under this section;
(iv) Paragraph (g)(4) of this section, rather than § 16.42(a) of this chapter, describes the FDA employees who preside at hearings under this section.
(4) The presiding officer of a regulatory hearing on an appeal of a detention order, who also must decide the appeal, must be an Office of Regulatory Affairs Program Director or another FDA official senior to an FDA Division Director who is permitted by § 16.42(a) of this chapter to preside over the hearing.
(5) If the appellant requests a regulatory hearing and requests that the hearing be held within 5 working days after the appeal is filed, the presiding officer must, within 5 working days, hold the hearing and render a decision affirming or revoking the detention.
(6) If the appellant requests a regulatory hearing and requests that the hearing be held at a date later than within 5 working days after the appeal is filed, but not later than 20 calendar days after receipt of a detention order, the presiding officer must hold the hearing at a date agreed upon by FDA and the appellant. The presiding officer must decide whether to affirm or revoke the detention within 5 working days after the conclusion of the hearing. The detention period extends to the date of the decision even if the 5-working-day period for making the decision extends beyond the otherwise applicable 20-calendar-day or 30-calendar-day detention period.
(7) If the appellant appeals the detention order but does not request a regulatory hearing, the presiding officer must render a decision on the appeal, affirming or revoking the detention within 5 working days after the filing of the appeal.
(8) If the presiding officer affirms a detention order, the drugs continue to be detained until FDA terminates the detention under paragraph (j) of this section or the detention period expires, whichever occurs first.
(9) If the presiding officer revokes a detention order, FDA must terminate the detention under paragraph (j) of this section.
(h)
Movement of detained drugs.
(1) Except as provided in this paragraph, no person may move detained drugs within or from the place where they have been ordered detained until FDA terminates the detention under paragraph (j) of this section or the detention period expires, whichever occurs first.
(2) If detained drugs are not in final form for shipment, the manufacturer may move them within the establishment where they are detained to complete the work needed to put them in final form. As soon as the drugs are moved for the purpose in the preceding sentence, the individual responsible for their movement must orally notify the FDA representative who issued the detention order, or another responsible division office official, of the movement of the drugs. As soon as the drugs are put in final form, they must be segregated from other drugs, and the individual responsible for their movement must orally notify the FDA representative who issued the detention order, or another responsible division office official, of their new location. The drugs put in final form must not be moved further without FDA approval.
(3) The FDA representative who issued the detention order, or another responsible division office official, may approve, in writing, the movement of detained drugs for any of the following purposes:
(i) To prevent interference with an establishment's operations or harm to the drugs;
(ii) To destroy the drugs;
(iii) To bring the drugs into compliance;
(iv) For any other purpose that the FDA representative who issued the detention order, or other responsible division office official, believes is appropriate in the case.
(4) If an FDA representative approves the movement of detained drugs under paragraph (h)(3) of this section, the detained drugs must remain segregated from other drugs and the person responsible for their movement must immediately orally notify the official who approved the movement of the drugs, or another responsible FDA division office official, of the new location of the detained drugs.
(5) Unless otherwise permitted by the FDA representative who is notified of, or who approves, the movement of drugs under this paragraph, the required tags must accompany the drugs during and after movement and must remain with the drugs until FDA terminates the detention or the detention period expires, whichever occurs first.
(i)
Actions involving adulterated or misbranded drugs.
If FDA determines that the detained drugs, including any that have been put in final form, are adulterated or misbranded, or both, it may initiate legal action against the drugs or the responsible individuals, or both, or request that the drugs be destroyed or otherwise brought into compliance with the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act under FDA's supervision.
(j)
Detention termination.
If FDA decides to terminate a detention or when the detention period expires, whichever occurs first, an FDA representative authorized to terminate a detention will issue a detention termination notice releasing the drugs to any person who received the original detention order or that person's representative and will remove, or authorize in writing the removal of, the required labels or tags.
(k)
Recordkeeping requirements.
(1) After issuance of a detention order under paragraph (d) of this section, the owner, operator, or agent in charge of any factory, warehouse, other establishment, or consulting laboratory where detained drugs are manufactured, processed, packed, or held, must
have, or establish, and maintain adequate records relating to how the detained drugs may have become adulterated or misbranded, records on any distribution of the drugs before and after the detention period, records on the correlation of any in-process detained drugs that are put in final form under paragraph (h) of this section to the completed drugs, records of any changes in, or processing of, the drugs permitted under the detention order, and records of any other movement under paragraph (h) of this section. Records required under this paragraph must be provided to FDA on request for review and copying. Any FDA request for access to records required under this paragraph must be made at a reasonable time, must state the reason or purpose for the request, and must identify to the fullest extent practicable the information or type of information sought in the records to which access is requested.
(2) Records required under this paragraph must be maintained for a maximum period of 2 years after the issuance of the detention order or for such other shorter period as FDA directs. When FDA terminates the detention or when the detention period expires, whichever occurs first, FDA will advise all persons required under this paragraph to keep records concerning that detention whether further recordkeeping is required for the remainder of the 2-year, or shorter, period. FDA ordinarily will not require further recordkeeping if the Agency determines that the drugs are not adulterated or misbranded or that recordkeeping is not necessary to protect the public health, unless the records are required under other regulations in this chapter (e.g., the good manufacturing practice regulation in part 211 of this chapter).

§ 1.1310
What definitions apply to this subpart?
The definitions of terms in section 201 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act apply to such terms when used in this subpart. In addition, the following definitions apply to words and phrases as they are used in this subpart:
Commingled raw agricultural commodity
means any commodity that is combined or mixed after harvesting but before processing, except that the term “commingled raw agricultural commodity” does not include types of fruits and vegetables that are raw agricultural commodities to which the standards for the growing, harvesting, packing, and holding of produce for human consumption in part 112 of this chapter apply. For the purpose of this definition, a commodity is “combined or mixed” only when the combination or mixing involves food from different farms under different company management; except that for food obtained from a fishing vessel, a commodity is “combined or mixed” only when the combination or mixing involves food from different landing vessels and occurs after the vessels have landed. Also, for the purpose of this definition, the term “processing” means operations that alter the general state of the commodity, such as canning, cooking, freezing, dehydration, milling, grinding, pasteurization, or homogenization.
Cooling
means active temperature reduction of a raw agricultural commodity using hydrocooling, icing (except icing of seafood), forced air cooling, vacuum cooling, or a similar process.
Critical tracking event
means an event in the supply chain of a food involving the harvesting, cooling (before initial packing), initial packing of a raw agricultural commodity other than a food obtained from a fishing vessel, first land-based receiving of a food obtained from a fishing vessel, shipping, receiving, or transformation of the food.
Farm
means farm as defined in § 1.328. For producers of shell eggs, “farm” means all poultry houses and grounds immediately surrounding the poultry houses covered under a single biosecurity program, as set forth in § 118.3 of this chapter.
First land-based receiver
means the person taking possession of a food for the first time on land directly from a fishing vessel.
Fishing vessel
means any vessel, boat, ship, or other craft which is used for, equipped to be used for, or of a type which is normally used for fishing or aiding or assisting one or more vessels at sea in the performance of any activity relating to fishing, including, but not limited to, preparation, supply, storage, refrigeration, transportation, or processing, as set forth in the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1802(18)).
Food Traceability List
means the list of foods for which additional traceability records are required to be maintained, as designated in accordance with section 204(d)(2) of the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act. The term “Food Traceability List” includes both the foods specifically listed and foods that contain listed foods as ingredients, provided that the listed food that is used as an ingredient remains in the same form (
e.g.,
fresh) in which it appears on the list.
Harvesting
applies to farms and farm mixed-type facilities and means activities that are traditionally performed on farms for the purpose of removing raw agricultural commodities from the place they were grown or raised and preparing them for use as food. Harvesting is limited to activities performed on raw agricultural commodities, or on processed foods created by drying/dehydrating a raw agricultural commodity without additional manufacturing/processing, on a farm. Harvesting does not include activities that transform a raw agricultural commodity into a processed food as defined
in section 201(gg) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Examples of harvesting include cutting (or otherwise separating) the edible portion of the raw agricultural commodity from the crop plant and removing or trimming part of the raw agricultural commodity (
e.g.,
foliage, husks, roots, or stems). Examples of harvesting also include cooling, field coring, filtering, gathering, hulling, shelling, sifting, threshing, trimming of outer leaves of, and washing raw agricultural commodities grown on a farm.
Holding
means storage of food and also includes activities performed incidental to storage of a food (
e.g.,
activities performed for the safe or effective storage of that food, such as fumigating food during storage, and drying/dehydrating raw agricultural commodities when the drying/dehydrating does not create a distinct commodity (such as drying/dehydrating hay or alfalfa)). Holding also includes activities performed as a practical necessity for the distribution of that food (such as blending of the same raw agricultural commodity and breaking down pallets), but does not include activities that transform a raw agricultural commodity into a processed food as defined in section 201(gg) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Holding facilities could include warehouses, cold storage facilities, storage silos, grain elevators, and liquid storage tanks.
Initial packing
means packing a raw agricultural commodity (other than a food obtained from a fishing vessel) for the first time.
Key data element
means information associated with a critical tracking event for which a record must be maintained and/or provided in accordance with this subpart.
Kill step
means lethality processing that significantly minimizes pathogens in a food.
Location description
means key contact information for the location where a food is handled, specifically the business name, phone number, physical location address (or geographic coordinates), and city, State, and zip code for domestic locations and comparable information for foreign locations, including country.
Manufacturing/processing
means making food from one or more ingredients, or synthesizing, preparing, treating, modifying, or manipulating food, including food crops or ingredients. Examples of manufacturing/processing activities include: Baking, boiling, bottling, canning, cooking, cooling, cutting, distilling, drying/dehydrating raw agricultural commodities to create a distinct commodity (such as drying/dehydrating grapes to produce raisins), evaporating, eviscerating, extracting juice, formulating, freezing, grinding, homogenizing, irradiating, labeling, milling, mixing, packaging (including modified atmosphere packaging), pasteurizing, peeling, rendering, treating to manipulate ripening, trimming, washing, or waxing. For farms and farm mixed-type facilities, manufacturing/processing does not include activities that are part of harvesting, packing, or holding.
Mixed-type facility
means an establishment that engages in both activities that are exempt from registration under section 415 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and activities that require the establishment to be registered. An example of such a facility is a “farm mixed-type facility,” which is an establishment that is a farm, but also conducts activities outside the farm definition that require the establishment to be registered.
Nonprofit food establishment
means a charitable entity that prepares or serves food directly to the consumer or otherwise provides food or meals for consumption by humans or animals in the United States. The term includes central food banks, soup kitchens, and nonprofit food delivery services. To be considered a nonprofit food establishment, the establishment must meet the terms of section 501(c)(3) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3)).
Packing
means placing food into a container other than packaging the food and also includes re-packing and activities performed incidental to packing or re-packing a food (
e.g.,
activities performed for the safe or effective packing or re-packing of that food (such as sorting, culling, grading, and weighing or conveying incidental to packing or re-packing)), but does not
include activities that transform a raw agricultural commodity into a processed food as defined in section 201(gg) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.
Person
includes an individual, partnership, corporation, and association.
Point of contact
means an individual having familiarity with an entity's procedures for traceability, including their name and/or job title, and their phone number.
Produce
means produce as defined in § 112.3 of this chapter.

Raw agricultural commodity
means “raw agricultural commodity” as defined in section 201(r) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.
Receiving
means an event in a food's supply chain in which a food is received by someone other than a consumer after being transported (
e.g.,
by truck or ship) from another location. Receiving includes receipt of an intracompany shipment of food from one location at a particular street address of a firm to another location at a different street address of the firm.
Reference document
means a business transaction document, record, or message, in electronic or paper form, that may contain some or all of the key data elements for a critical tracking event in the supply chain of a food. A reference document may be established by you or obtained from another person.

(1) Entities in which food is provided to humans, such as cafeterias, lunchrooms, cafes, bistros, fast food establishments, food stands, saloons, taverns, bars, lounges, catering facilities, hospital kitchens, day care kitchens, and nursing home kitchens are restaurants; and
(2) Pet shelters, kennels, and veterinary facilities in which food is provided to animals are restaurants.
Retail food establishment
means an establishment that sells food products directly to consumers as its primary function. The term “retail food establishment” includes facilities that manufacture, process, pack, or hold food if the establishment's primary function is to sell from that establishment food, including food that it manufactures, processes, packs, or holds, directly to consumers. A retail food establishment's primary function is to sell food directly to consumers if the annual monetary value of sales of food products directly to consumers exceeds the annual monetary value of sales of food products to all other buyers. The term “consumers” does not include businesses. A “retail food establishment” includes grocery stores, convenience stores, and vending machine locations. A “retail food establishment” also includes certain farm-operated businesses selling food directly to consumers as their primary function.
(1) Sale of food directly to consumers from an establishment located on a farm includes sales by that establishment directly to consumers:

(iii) At other such direct-to-consumer sales platforms, including door-to-door sales; mail, catalog and internet order, including online farmers' markets and online grocery delivery; religious or other organization bazaars; and State and local fairs.
(3) For the purposes of this definition, “farm-operated business” means a business that is managed by one or more farms and conducts manufacturing/processing not on the farm(s).
Shipping
means an event in a food's supply chain in which a food is arranged for transport (
e.g.,
by truck or ship) from one location to another location. Shipping does not include the sale or shipment of a food directly to a consumer or the donation of surplus food. Shipping includes sending an intracompany shipment of food from one location at a particular street address of a firm to another location at a different street address of the firm.
Traceability lot
means a batch or lot of food that has been initially packed (for raw agricultural commodities other than food obtained from a fishing vessel), received by the first land-based receiver (for food obtained from a fishing vessel), or transformed.
Traceability lot code
means a descriptor, often alphanumeric, used to uniquely identify a traceability lot within the records of the traceability lot code source.
Traceability lot code source
means the place where a food was assigned a traceability lot code.

# Subpart A—General Provisions
§ 2.5
Imminent hazard to the public health.
(a) Within the meaning of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act an imminent hazard to the public health is considered to exist when the evidence is sufficient to show that a product or practice, posing a significant threat of danger to health, creates a public health situation (1) that should be corrected immediately to prevent
injury and (2) that should not be permitted to continue while a hearing or other formal proceeding is being held. The
imminent hazard
may be declared at any point in the chain of events which may ultimately result in harm to the public health. The occurrence of the final anticipated injury is not essential to establish that an
imminent hazard
of such occurrence exists.
(b) In exercising his judgment on whether an
imminent hazard
exists, the Commissioner will consider the number of injuries anticipated and the nature, severity, and duration of the anticipated injury.
§ 2.10
Examination and investigation samples.
(a)(1) When any officer or employee of the Department collects a sample of a food, drug, or cosmetic for analysis under the act, the sample shall be designated as an official sample if records or other evidence is obtained by him or any other officer or employee of the Department indicating that the shipment or other lot of the article from which such sample was collected was introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce, or was in or was received in interstate commerce, or was manufactured within a Territory. Only samples so designated by an officer or employee of the Department shall be considered to be official samples.
(2) For the purpose of determining whether or not a sample is collected for analysis, the term
analysis
includes examinations and tests.
(3) The owner of a food, drug, or cosmetic of which an official sample is collected is the person who owns the shipment or other lot of the article from which the sample is collected.
(b) When an officer or employee of the Department collects an official sample of a food, drug, or cosmetic for analysis under the act, he shall collect at least twice the quantity estimated by him to be sufficient for analysis, unless:
(1) The amount of the article available and reasonably accessible for sampling is less than twice the quantity so estimated, in which case he shall collect as much as is available and reasonably accessible.
(2) The cost of twice the quantity so estimated exceeds $150.
(3) The sample cannot by diligent use of practicable preservation techniques available to the Food and Drug Administration be kept in a state in which it could be readily and meaningfully analyzed in the same manner and for the same purposes as the Food and Drug Administration's analysis.
(4) The sample is collected from a shipment or other lot which is being imported or offered for import into the United States.
(5) The sample is collected from a person named on the label of the article or his agent, and such person is also the owner of the article.
(6) The sample is collected from the owner of the article, or his agent, and such article bears no label or, if it bears a label, no person is named thereon.
In addition to the quantity of sample set forth in this paragraph, the officer or employee shall, if practicable, collect such further amount as he estimates will be sufficient for use as trial exhibits.
(c) After the Food and Drug Administration has completed such analysis of an official sample of a food, drug, or cosmetic as it determines, in the course of analysis and interpretation of analytical results, to be adequate to establish the respects, if any, in which the article is adulterated or misbranded within the meaning of the act, or otherwise subject to the prohibitions of the act, and has reserved an amount of the article it estimates to be adequate for use as exhibits in the trial of any case that may arise under the act based on the sample, a part of the sample, if any remains available, shall be provided for analysis, upon written request, by any person named on the label of the article, or the owner thereof, or the attorney or agent of such person or owner, except when:
(1) After collection, the sample or remaining part thereof has become decomposed or otherwise unfit for analysis, or
(2) The request is not made within a reasonable time before the trial of any case under the act, based on the sample to which such person or owner is a party. The person, owner, attorney, or
agent who requests the part of sample shall specify the amount desired. A request from an owner shall be accompanied by a showing of ownership, and a request from an attorney or agent by a showing of authority from such person or owner to receive the part of sample. When two or more requests for parts of the same sample are received the requests shall be complied with in the order in which they were received so long as any part of the sample remains available therefor.
(d) When an official sample of food, drug, or cosmetic is the basis of a notice given under section 305 of the act, or of a case under the act, and the person to whom the notice was given, or any person who is a party to the case, has no right under paragraph (c) of this section to a part of the sample, such person or his attorney or agent may obtain a part of the sample upon request accompanied by a written waiver of right under such paragraph (c) from each person named on the label of the article and owner thereof, who has not exercised his right under such paragraph (c). The operation of this paragraph shall be subject to the exceptions, terms, and conditions prescribed in paragraph (c) of this section.
(e) The Food and Drug Administration is authorized to destroy:
(1) Any official sample when it determines that no analysis of such sample will be made;
(2) Any official sample or part thereof when it determines that no notice under section 305 of the act, and no case under the act, is or will be based on such sample;
(3) Any official sample or part thereof when the sample was the basis of a notice under section 305 of the act, and when, after opportunity for presentation of views following such notice, it determines that no other such notice, and no case under the act, is or will be based on such sample;
(4) Any official sample or part thereof when the sample was the basis of a case under the act which has gone to final judgment, and when it determines that no other such case is or will be based on such sample;
(5) Any official sample or part thereof if the article is perishable;
(6) Any official sample or part thereof when, after collection, such sample or part has become decomposed or otherwise unfit for analysis;
(7) That part of any official sample which is in excess of three times the quantity it estimates to be sufficient for analysis.
[42 FR 15559, Mar. 22, 1977, as amended at 63 FR 51299, Sept. 25, 1998]
§ 2.19
Methods of analysis.
Where the method of analysis is not prescribed in a regulation, it is the policy of the Food and Drug Administration in its enforcement programs to utilize the methods of analysis of the AOAC INTERNATIONAL (AOAC) as published in the latest edition (13th Ed., 1980) of their publication “Official Methods of Analysis of the Association of Official Analytical Chemists,” and the supplements thereto (“Changes in Methods” as published in the March issues of the “Journal of the Association of Official Analytical Chemists”), which are incorporated by reference, when available and applicable. Copies are available from the AOAC INTERNATIONAL, 481 North Frederick Ave., suite 500, Gaithersburg, MD 20877, or at the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). For information on the availability of this material at NARA, call 202-741-6030, or go to:
http://www.archives.gov/federal_register/code_of_federal_regulations/ibr_locations.html.
In the absence of an AOAC method, the Commissioner will furnish a copy of the particular method, or a reference to the published method, that the Food and Drug Administration will use in its enforcement program. Other methods may be used for quality control, specifications, contracts, surveys, and similar nonregulatory functions, but it is expected that they will be calibrated in terms of the method which the Food and Drug Administration uses in its enforcement program. Use of an AOAC method does not relieve the practioner of the responsibility to demonstrate that he can perform the method properly
through the use of positive and negative controls and recovery and reproducibility studies.
[42 FR 15559, Mar. 22, 1977, as amended at 47 FR 946, Jan. 8, 1982; 54 FR 9034, Mar. 3, 1989; 70 FR 40880, July 15, 2005; 70 FR 67651, Nov. 8, 2005]

# Subpart B—Human and Animal Foods
§ 2.25
Grain seed treated with poisonous substances; color identification to prevent adulteration of human and animal food.
(a) In recent years there has developed increasing use of poisonous treatments on seed for fungicidal and other purposes. Such treated seed, if consumed, presents a hazard to humans and livestock. It is not unusual for stocks of such treated food seeds to remain on hand after the planting season has passed. Despite the cautions required by the Federal Seed Act (53 Stat. 1275, as amended 72 Stat. 476, 7 U.S.C. 1551
et seq.
) in the labeling of the treated seed, the Food and Drug Administration has encountered many cases where such surplus stocks of treated wheat, corn, oats, rye, barley, and sorghum seed had been mixed with untreated seed and sent to market for food or feed use. This has resulted in livestock injury and in legal actions under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act against large quantities of food adulterated through such admixture of poisonous treated seeds with good food. Criminal cases were brought against some firms and individuals. Where the treated seeds are prominently colored, buyers and users or processors of agricultural food seed for food purposes are able to detect the admixture of the poisonous seed and thus reject the lots; but most such buyers, users, and processors do not have the facilities or scientific equipment to determine the presence of the poisonous chemical at the time crops are delivered, in cases where the treated seeds have not been so colored. A suitable color for this use is one that is in sufficient contrast to the natural color of the food seed as to make admixture of treated, denatured seeds with good food easily apparent, and is so applied that it is not readily removed.
(b) On and after December 31, 1964, the Food and Drug Administration will regard as adulterated any interstate shipment of the food seeds wheat, corn, oats, rye, barley, and sorghum bearing a poisonous treatment in excess of a recognized tolerance or treatment for which no tolerance or exemption from tolerance is recognized in regulations promulgated pursuant to section 408 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, unless such seeds have been adequately denatured by a suitable color to prevent their subsequent inadvertent use as food for man or feed for animals.
(c) Attention is called to the labeling requirements of the Federal Hazardous Substances Act, where applicable to denatured seeds in packages suitable for household use.
§ 2.35
Use of secondhand containers for the shipment or storage of food and animal feed.
(a) Investigations by the Food and Drug Administration, the National Communicable Disease Center of the U.S. Public Health Service, the Consumer and Marketing Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and by various State public health agencies have revealed practices whereby food and animal feed stored or shipped in secondhand containers have been rendered dangerous to health. Such contamination has been the result of the original use of these containers for the storage and shipment of articles containing or bearing disease organisms or poisonous or deleterious substances.
(b) The Commissioner concludes that such dangerous or potentially dangerous practices include, but are not limited to, the following:
(1) Some vegetable growers and packers employ used poultry crates for shipment of fresh vegetables, including cabbage and celery. Salmonella organisms are commonly present on dressed poultry and in excreta and fluid exudates from dressed birds. Thus wooden crates in which dressed poultry has been iced and packed are potential sources of Salmonella or other enteropathogenic microorganisms that may contaminate fresh vegetables which are frequently consumed without heat treatment.
(2) Some potato growers and producers of animal feeds use secondhand bags for shipment of these articles. Such bags may have originally been used for shipping or storing pesticide-treated seed or other articles bearing or containing poisonous substances. Thus these secondhand bags are potential sources of contamination of the food or animal feed stored or shipped therein.
(c) In a policy statement issued April 11, 1968, the Food and Drug Administration declared adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act shipments of vegetables or other edible food in used crates or containers that may render the contents injurious to health. This policy statement is extended so that the Food and Drug Administration will regard as adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a) of the act shipments of vegetables, other edible food, or animal feed in used crates, bags, or other containers that may render the contents injurious to health.
Subparts C-E [Reserved]

# Subpart F—Caustic Poisons
§ 2.110
Definition of ammonia under Federal Caustic Poison Act.
For the purpose of determining whether an article containing ammonia is subject to the Federal Caustic Poison Act, the ammonia content is to be calculated as NH
3
.

# Subpart G—Provisions Applicable to Specific Products Subject to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act
§ 2.125
Use of ozone-depleting substances in foods, drugs, devices, or cosmetics.
(a) As used in this section,
ozone-depleting substance
(ODS) means any class I substance as defined in 40 CFR part 82, appendix A to subpart A, or class II substance as defined in 40 CFR part 82, appendix B to subpart A.
(b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, any food, drug, device, or cosmetic that is, consists in part of, or is contained in an aerosol product or other pressurized dispenser that releases an ODS is not an essential use of the ODS under the Clean Air Act.
(c) A food, drug, device, or cosmetic that is, consists in part of, or is contained in an aerosol product or other pressurized dispenser that releases an ODS is an essential use of the ODS under the Clean Air Act if paragraph (e) of this section specifies the use of that product as essential. For drugs, including biologics and animal drugs, and for devices, an investigational application or an approved marketing application must be in effect, as applicable.
(d) [Reserved]
(e) The use of ODSs in the following products is essential:
(1)
Metered-dose corticosteroid human drugs for oral inhalation.
Oral pressurized metered-dose inhalers containing the following active moieties:
(i)-(v) [Reserved]
(2)
Metered-dose short-acting adrenergic bronchodilator human drugs for oral inhalation.

(i)-(v) [Reserved]
(3) [Reserved]
(4)
Other essential uses.
(i)-(ii) [Reserved]
(iii) Anesthetic drugs for topical use on accessible mucous membranes of humans where a cannula is used for application.
(iv)-(ix) [Reserved]
(f) Any person may file a petition under part 10 of this chapter to request that FDA initiate rulemaking to amend paragraph (e) of this section to add an essential use. FDA may initiate notice-and-comment rulemaking to add an essential use on its own initiative or in response to a petition, if granted.
(1) If the petition is to add use of a noninvestigational product, the petitioner must submit compelling evidence that:
(i) Substantial technical barriers exist to formulating the product without ODSs;
(ii) The product will provide an unavailable important public health benefit; and
(iii) Use of the product does not release cumulatively significant amounts of ODSs into the atmosphere or the release is warranted in view of the unavailable important public health benefit.
(2) If the petition is to add use of an investigational product, the petitioner must submit compelling evidence that:
(i) Substantial technical barriers exist to formulating the investigational product without ODSs;
(ii) A high probability exists that the investigational product will provide an unavailable important public health benefit; and
(iii) Use of the investigational product does not release cumulatively significant amounts of ODSs into the atmosphere or the release is warranted in view of the high probability of an unavailable important public health benefit.
(g) Any person may file a petition under part 10 of this chapter to request that FDA initiate rulemaking to amend paragraph (e) of this section to remove an essential use. FDA may initiate notice-and-comment rulemaking to remove an essential use on its own initiative or in response to a petition, if granted. If the petition is to remove an essential use from paragraph (e) of this section, the petitioner must submit compelling evidence of any one of the following criteria:
(1) The product using an ODS is no longer being marketed; or
(2) After January 1, 2005, FDA determines that the product using an ODS no longer meets the criteria in paragraph (f) of this section after consultation with a relevant advisory committee(s) and after an open public meeting; or
(3) For individual active moieties marketed as ODS products and represented by one new drug application (NDA):
(i) At least one non-ODS product with the same active moiety is marketed with the same route of administration, for the same indication, and with approximately the same level of convenience of use as the ODS product containing that active moiety;
(ii) Supplies and production capacity for the non-ODS product(s) exist or will exist at levels sufficient to meet patient need;
(iii) Adequate U.S. postmarketing use data is available for the non-ODS product(s); and
(iv) Patients who medically required the ODS product are adequately served by the non-ODS product(s) containing that active moiety and other available products; or
(4) For individual active moieties marketed as ODS products and represented by two or more NDAs:
(i) At least two non-ODS products that contain the same active moiety are being marketed with the same route of delivery, for the same indication, and with approximately the same level of convenience of use as the ODS products; and
(ii) The requirements of paragraphs (g)(3)(ii), (g)(3)(iii), and (g)(3)(iv) of this section are met.

# Subpart A—Assignment of Agency Component for Review of Premarket Applications
§ 3.1
Purpose.
This regulation relates to agency management and organization and has two purposes. The first is to implement section 503(g) of the act, as added by section 16 of the Safe Medical Devices Act of 1990 (Public Law 101-629) and amended by section 204 of the Medical Device User Fee and Modernization Act of 2002 (Public Law 107-250), by specifying how FDA will determine the organizational component within FDA designated to have primary jurisdiction for the premarket review and regulation of products that are comprised of any combination of a drug and a device; a device and a biological; a biological and a drug; or a drug, a device and a biological. This determination will eliminate, in most cases, the need to receive approvals from more than one FDA component for such combination products. The second purpose of this regulation is to enhance the efficiency of agency management and operations by providing procedures for determining which agency component will have primary jurisdiction for any drug, device, or biological product where such jurisdiction is unclear or in dispute. Nothing in this section prevents FDA from using any agency resources it deems necessary to ensure adequate review of the safety and effectiveness of any product, or the substantial equivalence of any device to a predicate device.
[56 FR 58756, Nov. 21, 1991, as amended at 68 FR 37077, June 23, 2003]
§ 3.2
Definitions.
For the purpose of this part:
(a)
Act
means the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.
(b)
Agency component
means the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, the Center for Devices and Radiological Health, the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, or alternative organizational component of the agency.
(c)
Applicant
means any person who submits or plans to submit an application to the Food and Drug Administration for premarket review. For purposes of this section, the terms “sponsor” and “applicant” have the same meaning.
(d)
Biological product
has the meaning given the term in section 351(a) of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 262(a)).
(e)
Combination product
includes:
(1) A product comprised of two or more regulated components, i.e., drug/device, biologic/device, drug/biologic, or drug/device/biologic, that are physically, chemically, or otherwise combined or mixed and produced as a single entity;
(2) Two or more separate products packaged together in a single package or as a unit and comprised of drug and device products, device and biological products, or biological and drug products;
(3) A drug, device, or biological product packaged separately that according to its investigational plan or proposed labeling is intended for use only with an approved individually specified drug, device, or biological product where both are required to achieve the intended use, indication, or effect and where upon approval of the proposed product the labeling of the approved product would need to be changed, e.g., to reflect a change in intended use, dosage form, strength, route of administration, or significant change in dose; or
(4) Any investigational drug, device, or biological product packaged separately that according to its proposed labeling is for use only with another individually specified investigational drug, device, or biological product where both are required to achieve the intended use, indication, or effect.
(f)
Device
has the meaning given the term in section 201(h) of the act.
(g)
Drug
has the meaning given the term in section 201(g)(1) of the act.
(h)
FDA
means Food and Drug Administration.
(i)
Letter of designation
means the written notice issued by the product jurisdiction officer specifying the agency component with primary jurisdiction for a combination product.
(j)
Letter of request
means an applicant's written submission to the product jurisdiction officer seeking the designation of the agency component with primary jurisdiction.
(k)
Mode of action
is the means by which a product achieves an intended therapeutic effect or action. For purposes of this definition, “therapeutic” action or effect includes any effect or action of the combination product intended to diagnose, cure, mitigate, treat, or prevent disease, or affect the structure or any function of the body. When making assignments of combination products under this part, the agency will consider three types of mode of action: The actions provided by a biological product, a device, and a drug. Because combination products are comprised of more than one type of regulated article (biological product, device, or drug), and each constituent part contributes a biological product, device, or drug mode of action, combination products will typically have more than one identifiable mode of action.
(1) A constituent part has a biological product mode of action if it acts by means of a virus, therapeutic serum, toxin, antitoxin, vaccine, blood, blood component or derivative, allergenic product, or analogous product applicable to the prevention, treatment, or cure of a disease or condition of human beings, as described in section 351(i) of the Public Health Service Act.
(2) A constituent part has a device mode of action if it meets the definition of device contained in section 201(h)(1) to (h)(3) of the act, it does not have a biological product mode of action, and it does not achieve its primary intended purposes through chemical action within or on the body of man or other animals and is not dependent upon being metabolized for the achievement of its primary intended purposes.
(3) A constituent part has a drug mode of action if it meets the definition of drug contained in section 201(g)(1) of the act and it does not have a biological product or device mode of action.
(l)
Premarket review
includes the examination of data and information in an application for premarket review described in sections 505, 510(k), 513(f), 515, or 520(g) or 520(l) of the act or section 351 of the Public Health Service Act of data and information contained in any investigational new drug (IND) application, investigational device exemption (IDE), new drug application (NDA), biologics license application, device premarket notification, device reclassification petition, and premarket approval application (PMA).
(m)
Primary mode of action
is the single mode of action of a combination product that provides the most important therapeutic action of the combination product. The most important therapeutic action is the mode of action expected to make the greatest contribution to the overall intended therapeutic effects of the combination product.
(n)
Product
means any article that contains any drug as defined in section 201(g)(1) of the act; any device as defined in section 201(h) of the act; or any biologic as defined in section 351(a) of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 262(a)).
(o)
Product jurisdiction officer
is the person or persons responsible for designating the component of FDA with primary jurisdiction for the premarket review and regulation of a combination product or any product requiring a jurisdictional designation under this part.
(p)
Sponsor
means “applicant” (see § 3.2(c)).
[56 FR 58756, Nov. 21, 1991, as amended at 64 FR 398, Jan. 5, 1999; 64 FR 56447, Oct. 20, 1999; 68 FR 37077, June 23, 2003; 70 FR 49861, Aug. 25, 2005]
§ 3.3
Scope.
This section applies to:
(a) Any combination product, or
(b) Any product where the agency component with primary jurisdiction is unclear or in dispute.
§ 3.4
Designated agency component.
(a) To designate the agency component with primary jurisdiction for the premarket review and regulation of a combination product, the agency shall determine the primary mode of action of the product. Where the primary mode of action is that of:
(1) A drug (other than a biological product), the agency component charged with premarket review of drugs shall have primary jurisdiction;
(2) A device, the agency component charged with premarket review of devices shall have primary jurisdiction;
(3) A biological product, the agency component charged with premarket review of biological products shall have primary jurisdiction.
(b) In some situations, it is not possible to determine, with reasonable certainty, which one mode of action will provide a greater contribution than any other mode of action to the overall therapeutic effects of the combination product. In such a case, the agency will assign the combination product to the agency component that regulates other combination products that present similar questions of safety and effectiveness with regard to the combination product as a whole. When there are no other combination products that present similar questions of safety and effectiveness with regard to the combination product as a whole, the agency will assign the combination product to the agency component with the most expertise related to the most significant safety and effectiveness questions presented by the combination product.

Subpart B [Reserved]

# Subpart C—Recalls (Including Product Corrections)—Guidance on Policy, Procedures, and Industry Responsibilities

# Source:
43 FR 26218, June 16, 1978, unless otherwise noted.
§ 7.40
Recall policy.
(a) Recall is an effective method of removing or correcting consumer products that are in violation of laws administered by the Food and Drug Administration. Recall is a voluntary action that takes place because manufacturers and distributors carry out their responsibility to protect the public
health and well-being from products that present a risk of injury or gross deception or are otherwise defective. This section and §§ 7.41 through 7.59 recognize the voluntary nature of recall by providing guidance so that responsible firms may effectively discharge their recall responsibilities. These sections also recognize that recall is an alternative to a Food and Drug Administration-initiated court action for removing or correcting violative, distributed products by setting forth specific recall procedures for the Food and Drug Administration to monitor recalls and assess the adequacy of a firm's efforts in recall.
(b) Recall may be undertaken voluntarily and at any time by manufacturers and distributors, or at the request of the Food and Drug Administration. A request by the Food and Drug Administration that a firm recall a product is reserved for urgent situations and is to be directed to the firm that has primary responsibility for the manufacture and marketing of the product that is to be recalled.
(c) Recall is generally more appropriate and affords better protection for consumers than seizure, when many lots of product have been widely distributed. Seizure, multiple seizure, or other court action is indicated when a firm refuses to undertake a recall requested by the Food and Drug Administration, or where the agency has reason to believe that a recall would not be effective, determines that a recall is ineffective, or discovers that a violation is continuing.
[43 FR 26218, June 16, 1978, as amended at 65 FR 56476, Sept. 19, 2000]
§ 7.41
Health hazard evaluation and recall classification.
(a) An evaluation of the health hazard presented by a product being recalled or considered for recall will be conducted by an ad hoc committee of Food and Drug Administration scientists and will take into account, but need not be limited to, the following factors:
(1) Whether any disease or injuries have already occurred from the use of the product.
(2) Whether any existing conditions could contribute to a clinical situation that could expose humans or animals to a health hazard. Any conclusion shall be supported as completely as possible by scientific documentation and/or statements that the conclusion is the opinion of the individual(s) making the health hazard determination.
(3) Assessment of hazard to various segments of the population, e.g., children, surgical patients, pets, livestock, etc., who are expected to be exposed to the product being considered, with particular attention paid to the hazard to those individuals who may be at greatest risk.
(4) Assessment of the degree of seriousness of the health hazard to which the populations at risk would be exposed.
(5) Assessment of the likelihood of occurrence of the hazard.
(6) Assessment of the consequences (immediate or long-range) of occurrence of the hazard.
(b) On the basis of this determination, the Food and Drug Administration will assign the recall a classification, i.e., Class I, Class II, or Class III, to indicate the relative degree of health hazard of the product being recalled or considered for recall.
§ 7.42
Recall strategy.
(a)
General.
(1) A recall strategy that takes into account the following factors will be developed by the agency for a Food and Drug Administration-requested recall and by the recalling firm for a firm-initiated recall to suit the individual circumstances of the particular recall:
(i) Results of health hazard evaluation.
(ii) Ease in identifying the product.
(iii) Degree to which the product's deficiency is obvious to the consumer or user.
(iv) Degree to which the product remains unused in the market-place.
(v) Continued availability of essential products.
(2) The Food and Drug Administration will review the adequacy of a proposed recall strategy developed by a recalling firm and recommend changes as appropriate. A recalling firm should conduct the recall in accordance with an approved recall strategy but need
not delay initiation of a recall pending review of its recall strategy.
(b)
Elements of a recall strategy.
A recall strategy will address the following elements regarding the conduct of the recall:
(1)
Depth of recall.
Depending on the product's degree of hazard and extent of distribution, the recall strategy will specify the level in the distribution chain to which the recall is to extend, as follows:
(i) Consumer or user level, which may vary with product, including any intermediate wholesale or retail level; or
(ii) Retail level, including any intermediate wholesale level; or
(iii) Wholesale level.
(2)
Public warning.
The purpose of a public warning is to alert the public that a product being recalled presents a serious hazard to health. It is reserved for urgent situations where other means for preventing use of the recalled product appear inadequate. The Food and Drug Administration in consultation with the recalling firm will ordinarily issue such publicity. The recalling firm that decides to issue its own public warning is requested to submit its proposed public warning and plan for distribution of the warning for review and comment by the Food and Drug Administration. The recall strategy will specify whether a public warning is needed and whether it will issue as:
(i) General public warning through the general news media, either national or local as appropriate, or
(ii) Public warning through specialized news media, e.g., professional or trade press, or to specific segments of the population such as physicians, hospitals, etc.
(3)
Effectiveness checks.
The purpose of effectiveness checks is to verify that all consignees at the recall depth specified by the strategy have received notification about the recall and have taken appropriate action. The method for contacting consignees may be accomplished by personal visits, telephone calls, letters, or a combination thereof. A guide entitled “Methods for Conducting Recall Effectiveness Checks” that describes the use of these different methods is available upon request from the Dockets Management Staff (HFA-305), Food and Drug Administration, 5630 Fishers Lane, rm. 1061, Rockville, MD 20852. The recalling firm will ordinarily be responsible for conducting effectiveness checks, but the Food and Drug Administration will assist in this task where necessary and appropriate. The recall strategy will specify the method(s) to be used for and the level of effectiveness checks that will be conducted, as follows:
(i) Level A—100 percent of the total number of consignees to be contacted;
(ii) Level B—Some percentage of the total number of consignees to be contacted, which percentage is to be determined on a case-by-case basis, but is greater that 10 percent and less than 100 percent of the total number of consignees;
(iii) Level C—10 percent of the total number of consignees to be contacted;
(iv) Level D—2 percent of the total number of consignees to be contacted; or
(v) Level E—No effectiveness checks.
[43 FR 26218, June 16, 1978, as amended at 46 FR 8455, Jan. 27, 1981; 59 FR 14363, Mar. 28, 1994; 68 FR 24879, May 9, 2003; 88 FR 45064, July 14, 2023]
§ 7.45
Food and Drug Administration-requested recall.
(a) The Commissioner of Food and Drugs or designee may request a firm to initiate a recall when the following determinations have been made:
(1) That a product that has been distributed presents a risk of illness or injury or gross consumer deception.
(2) That the firm has not initiated a recall of the product.
(3) That an agency action is necessary to protect the public health and welfare.
(b) The Commissioner or his designee will notify the firm of this determination and of the need to begin immediately a recall of the product. Such notification will be by letter or telegram to a responsible official of the firm, but may be preceded by oral communication or by a visit from an authorized representative of the local Food and Drug Administration district office, with formal, written confirmation from the Commissioner or his designee afterward. The notification will
specify the violation, the health hazard classification of the violative product, the recall strategy, and other appropriate instructions for conducting the recall.
(c) Upon receipt of a request to recall, the firm may be asked to provide the Food and Drug Administration any or all of the information listed in § 7.46(a). The firm, upon agreeing to the recall request, may also provide other information relevant to the agency's determination of the need for the recall or how the recall should be conducted.
[43 FR 26218, June 16, 1978, as amended at 69 FR 17290, Apr. 2, 2004]
§ 7.46
Firm-initiated recall.
(a) A firm may decide of its own volition and under any circumstances to remove or correct a distributed product. A firm that does so because it believes the product to be violative is requested to notify immediately the appropriate Food and Drug Administration district office listed in § 5.115 of this chapter. Such removal or correction will be considered a recall only if the Food and Drug Administration regards the product as involving a violation that is subject to legal action, e.g., seizure. In such cases, the firm will be asked to provide the Food and Drug Administration the following information:
(1) Identity of the product involved.
(2) Reason for the removal or correction and the date and circumstances under which the product deficiency or possible deficiency was discovered.
(3) Evaluation of the risk associated with the deficiency or possible deficiency.
(4) Total amount of such products produced and/or the timespan of the production.
(5) Total amount of such products estimated to be in distribution channels.
(6) Distribution information, including the number of direct accounts and, where necessary, the identity of the direct accounts.
(7) A copy of the firm's recall communication if any has issued, or a proposed communication if none has issued.
(8) Proposed strategy for conducting the recall.
(9) Name and telephone number of the firm official who should be contacted concerning the recall.
(b) The Food and Drug Administration will review the information submitted, advise the firm of the assigned recall classification, recommend any appropriate changes in the firm's strategy for the recall, and advise the firm that its recall will be placed in the weekly FDA Enforcement Report. Pending this review, the firm need not delay initiation of its product removal or correction.
(c) A firm may decide to recall a product when informed by the Food and Drug Administration that the agency has determined that the product in question violates the law, but the agency has not specifically requested a recall. The firm's action also is considered a firm-initiated recall and is subject to paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.
(d) A firm that initiates a removal or correction of its product which the firm believes is a market withdrawal should consult with the appropriate Food and Drug Administration district office when the reason for the removal or correction is not obvious or clearly understood but where it is apparent, e.g., because of complaints or adverse reactions regarding the product, that the product is deficient in some respect. In such cases, the Food and Drug Administration will assist the firm in determining the exact nature of the problem.
§ 7.49
Recall communications.
(a)
General.
A recalling firm is responsible for promptly notifying each of its affected direct accounts about the recall. The format, content, and extent of a recall communication should be commensurate with the hazard of the product being recalled and the strategy developed for that recall. In general terms, the purpose of a recall communication is to convey:
(1) That the product in question is subject to a recall.
(2) That further distribution or use of any remaining product should cease immediately.
(3) Where appropriate, that the direct account should in turn notify its customers who received the product about the recall.
(4) Instructions regarding what to do with the product.
(b)
Implementation.
A recall communication can be accomplished by telegrams, mailgrams, or first class letters conspicuously marked, preferably in bold red type, on the letter and the envelope:
“drug
[or
food, biologic,
etc.]
recall
[or
correction]”.
The letter and the envelope should be also marked:
“urgent”
for class I and class II recalls and, when appropriate, for class III recalls. Telephone calls or other personal contacts should ordinarily be confirmed by one of the above methods and/or documented in an appropriate manner.
(c)
Contents.
(1) A recall communication should be written in accordance with the following guidelines:
(i) Be brief and to the point;
(ii) Identify clearly the product, size, lot number(s), code(s) or serial number(s) and any other pertinent descriptive information to enable accurate and immediate identification of the product;
(iii) Explain concisely the reason for the recall and the hazard involved, if any;
(iv) Provide specific instructions on what should be done with respect to the recalled products; and
(v) Provide a ready means for the recipient of the communication to report to the recalling firm whether it has any of the product, e.g., by sending a postage-paid, self-addressed postcard or by allowing the recipient to place a collect call to the recalling firm.
(2) The recall communication should not contain irrelevant qualifications, promotional materials, or any other statement that may detract from the message. Where necessary, followup communications should be sent to those who fail to respond to the initial recall communication.
(d)
Responsibility of recipient.
Consignees that receive a recall communication should immediately carry out the instructions set forth by the recalling firm and, where necessary, extend the recall to its consignees in accordance with paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.
§ 7.50
Public notification of recall.
The Food and Drug Administration will promptly make available to the public in the weekly FDA Enforcement Report a descriptive listing of each new recall according to its classification, whether it was Food and Drug Administration-requested or firm-initiated, and the specific action being taken by the recalling firm. The Food and Drug Administration will intentionally delay public notification of recalls of certain drugs and devices where the agency determines that public notification may cause unnecessary and harmful anxiety in patients and that initial consultation between patients and their physicians is essential. The report will not include a firm's product removals or corrections which the agency determines to be market withdrawals or stock recoveries. The report, which also includes other Food and Drug Administration regulatory actions, e.g., seizures that were effected and injunctions and prosecutions that were filed, is available upon request from the Office of Public Affairs (HFI-1), Food and Drug Administration, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857.
§ 7.53
Recall status reports.
(a) The recalling firm is requested to submit periodic recall status reports to the appropriate Food and Drug Administration district office so that the agency may assess the progress of the recall. The frequency of such reports will be determined by the relative urgency of the recall and will be specified by the Food and Drug Administration in each recall case; generally the reporting interval will be between 2 and 4 weeks.
(b) Unless otherwise specified or inappropriate in a given recall case, the recall status report should contain the following information:
(1) Number of consignees notified of the recall, and date and method of notification.
(2) Number of consignees responding to the recall communication and quantity of products on hand at the time it was received.
(3) Number of consignees that did not respond (if needed, the identity of nonresponding consignees may be requested by the Food and Drug Administration).
(4) Number of products returned or corrected by each consignee contacted and the quantity of products accounted for.
(5) Number and results of effectiveness checks that were made.
(6) Estimated time frames for completion of the recall.
(c) Recall status reports are to be discontinued when the recall is terminated by the Food and Drug Administration.
§ 7.55
Termination of a recall.
(a) A recall will be terminated when the Food and Drug Administration determines that all reasonable efforts have been made to remove or correct the product in accordance with the recall strategy, and when it is reasonable to assume that the product subject to the recall has been removed and proper disposition or correction has been made commensurate with the degree of hazard of the recalled product. Written notification that a recall is terminated will be issued by the appropriate Food and Drug Administration district office to the recalling firm.
(b) A recalling firm may request termination of its recall by submitting a written request to the appropriate Food and Drug Administration district office stating that the recall is effective in accordance with the criteria set forth in paragraph (a) of this section, and by accompanying the request with the most current recall status report and a description of the disposition of the recalled product.
§ 7.59
General industry guidance.
A recall can be disruptive of a firm's operation and business, but there are several steps a prudent firm can take in advance to minimize this disruptive effect. Notwithstanding similar specific requirements for certain products in other parts of this chapter, the following is provided by the Food and Drug Administration as guidance for a firm's consideration:
(a) Prepare and maintain a current written contingency plan for use in initiating and effecting a recall in accordance with §§ 7.40 through 7.49, 7.53, and 7.55.
(b) Use sufficient coding of regulated products to make possible positive lot identification and to facilitate effective recall of all violative lots.
(c) Maintain such product distribution records as are necessary to facilitate location of products that are being recalled. Such records should be maintained for a period of time that exceeds the shelf life and expected use of the product and is at least the length of time specified in other applicable regulations concerning records retention.
Subpart D [Reserved]

# Subpart E—Criminal Violations
§ 7.84
Opportunity for presentation of views before report of criminal violation.
(a)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (a) (2) and (3) of this section, a person against whom criminal prosecution under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is contemplated by the Commissioner of Food and Drugs shall be given appropriate notice and an opportunity to present information and views to show cause why criminal prosecution should not be recommended to a United States attorney.
(2) Notice and opportunity need not be provided if the Commissioner has reason to believe that they may result in the alteration or destruction of evidence or in the prospective defendant's fleeing to avoid prosecution.
(3) Notice and opportunity need not be provided if the Commissioner contemplates recommending further investigation by the Department of Justice.
(b) If a statute enforced by the Commissioner does not contain a provision for an opportunity to present views, the Commissioner need not, but may in the Commissioner's discretion, provide notice and an opportunity to present views.
(c) If an apparent violation of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act also constitutes a violation of any other Federal statute(s), and the Commissioner contemplates recommending prosecution under such other statute(s) as well, the notice of opportunity to
present views will include all violations.
(d) Notice of an opportunity to present views may be by letter, standard form, or other document(s) identifying the products and/or conduct alleged to violate the law. The notice shall—
(1) Be sent by registered or certified mail, telegram, telex, personal delivery, or any other appropriate mode of written communication;
(2) Specify the time and place where those named may present their views;
(3) Summarize the violations that constitute the basis of the contemplated prosecution;
(4) Describe the purpose and procedure of the presentation; and
(5) Furnish a form on which the legal status of any person named in the notice may be designated.
(e) If more than one person is named in a notice, a separate opportunity for presentation of views shall be scheduled on request. Otherwise, the time and place specified in a notice may be changed only upon a showing of reasonable grounds. A request for any change shall be addressed to the Food and Drug Administration office that issued the notice and shall be received in that office at least 3 working days before the date set in the notice.
(f) A person who has received a notice is under no legal obligation to appear or answer in any manner. A person choosing to respond may appear personally, with or without a representative, or may designate a representative to appear for him or her. Alternatively, a person may respond in writing. If a person elects not to respond on or before the time scheduled, the Commissioner will, without further notice, decide whether to recommend criminal prosecution to a United States attorney on the basis of the information available.
(g) If a respondent chooses to appear solely by designated representative, that representative shall present a signed statement of authorization. If a representative appears for more than one respondent, the representative shall submit independent documentation of authority to act for each respondent. If a representative appears without written authorization, the opportunity to present views with respect to that respondent may be provided at that time only if the authenticity of the representative's authority is first verified by telephone or other appropriate means.
[44 FR 12167, Mar. 6, 1979]
§ 7.85
Conduct of a presentation of views before report of criminal violation.
(a) The presentation of views shall be heard by a designated Food and Drug Administration employee. Other Food and Drug Administration employees may be present.
(b) A presentation of views shall not be open to the public. The agency employee designated to receive views will permit participation of other persons only if they appear with the respondent or the respondent's designated representative, and at the request of, and on behalf of, the respondent.
(c) A respondent may present any information of any kind bearing on the Commissioner's determination to recommend prosecution. Information may include statements of persons appearing on the respondent's behalf, letters, documents, laboratory analyses, if applicable, or other relevant information or arguments. The opportunity to present views shall be informal. The rules of evidence shall not apply. Any information given by a respondent, including statements by the respondent, shall become part of the agency's records concerning the matter and may be used for any official purpose. The Food and Drug Administration is under no obligation to present evidence or witnesses.
(d) If the respondent holds a “guaranty or undertaking” as described in section 303(c) of the act (21 U.S.C. 333(c)) that is applicable to the notice, that document, or a verified copy of it, may be presented by the respondent.
(e) A respondent may have an oral presentation recorded and transcribed at his or her expense, in which case a copy of the transcription shall be furnished to the Food and Drug Administration office from which the notice issued. The employee designated to receive views may order a presentation of views recorded and transcribed at agency expense, in which case a copy of
such transcription shall be provided to each respondent.
(f) If an oral presentation is not recorded and transcribed, the agency employee designated to receive views shall dictate a written summary of the presentation. A copy of the summary shall be provided to each respondent.
(g) A respondent may comment on the summary or may supplement any response by additional written or documentary evidence. Any comment or addition shall be furnished to the Food and Drug Administration office where the respondent's views were presented. If materials are submitted within 10 calendar days after receipt of the copy of the summary or transcription of the presentation, as applicable, they will be considered before a final decision as to whether or not to recommend prosecution. Any materials received after the supplemental response period generally will be considered only if the final agency decision has not yet been made.
(h)(1) When consideration of a criminal prosecution recommendation involving the same violations is closed by the Commissioner with respect to all persons named in the notice, the Commissioner will so notify each person in writing.
(2) When it is determined that a person named in a notice will not be included in the Commissioner's recommendation for criminal prosecution, the Commissioner will so notify that person, if and when the Commissioner concludes that notification will not prejudice the prosecution of any other person.
(3) When a United States attorney informs the agency that no persons recommended will be prosecuted, the Commissioner will so notify each person in writing, unless the United States attorney has already done so.
(4) When a United States attorney informs the agency of intent to prosecute some, but not all, persons who had been provided an opportunity to present views and were subsequently named in the Commissioner's recommendation for criminal prosecution, the Commissioner, after being advised by the United States attorney that the notification will not prejudice the prosecution of any other person, will so notify those persons eliminated from further consideration, unless the United States attorney has already done so.
[44 FR 12168, Mar. 6, 1979]
§ 7.87
Records related to opportunities for presentation of views conducted before report of criminal violation.
(a) Records related to a section 305 opportunity for presentation of views constitute investigatory records for law enforcement purposes and may include inter- and intra-agency memorandums.
(1) Notwithstanding the rule established in § 20.21 of this chapter, no record related to a section 305 presentation is available for public disclosure until consideration of criminal prosecution has been closed in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, except as provided in § 20.82 of this chapter. Only very rarely and only under circumstances that demonstrate a compelling public interest will the Commissioner exercise, in accordance with § 20.82 of this chapter, the authorized discretion to disclose records related to a section 305 presentation before the consideration of criminal prosecution is closed.
(2) After consideration of criminal prosecution is closed, the records are available for public disclosure in response to a request under the Freedom of Information Act, except to the extent that the exemptions from disclosure in subpart D of part 20 of this chapter are applicable. No statements obtained through promises of confidentiality shall be available for public disclosure.
(b) Consideration of criminal prosecution based on a particular section 305 notice of opportunity for presentation of views shall be deemed to be closed within the meaning of this section and § 7.85 when a final decision has been made not to recommend criminal prosecution to a United States attorney based on charges set forth in the notice and considered at the presentation, or when such a recommendation has been finally refused by the United States attorney, or when criminal prosecution has been instituted and the matter and all related appeals have
been concluded, or when the statute of limitations has run.
(c) Before disclosure of any record specifically reflecting consideration of a possible recommendation for criminal prosecution of any individual, all names and other information that would identify an individual whose prosecution was considered but not recommended, or who was not prosecuted, shall be deleted, unless the Commissioner concludes that there is a compelling public interest in the disclosure of the names.
(d) Names and other information that would identify a Food and Drug Administration employee shall be deleted from records related to a section 305 presentation of views before public disclosure only under § 20.32 of this chapter.

§ 10.25
Initiation of administrative proceedings.
An administrative proceeding may be initiated in the following three ways:
(a) An interested person may petition the Commissioner to issue, amend, or revoke a regulation or order, or to take or refrain from taking any other form of administrative action. A petition must be either:
(1) In the form specified in other applicable FDA regulations,
e.g.,
the form for a color additive petition in § 71.1, for a food additive petition in § 171.1 or § 571.1, for a new drug application in § 314.50, for a request to establish or amend an import tolerance in § 510.205, for a new animal drug application in § 514.1, or
(2) in the form for a citizen petition in § 10.30.
(b) The Commissioner may initiate a proceeding to issue, amend, or revoke a regulation or order or take or refrain from taking any other form of administrative action. FDA has primary jurisdiction to make the initial determination on issues within its statutory mandate, and will request a court to dismiss, or to hold in abeyance its determination of or refer to the agency for administrative determination, any issue which has not previously been determined by the agency or which, if it has previously been determined, the agency concluded should be reconsidered and subject to a new administrative determination. The Commissioner may utilize any of the procedures established in this part in reviewing and making a determination on any matter initiated under this paragraph.
(c) The Commissioner will institute a proceeding to determine whether to issue, amend, or revoke a regulation or order, or take or refrain from taking any other form of administrative action whenever any court, on its own initiative, holds in abeyance or refers any matter to the agency for an administrative determination and the Commissioner concludes that an administrative determination is feasible within agency priorities and resources.

(iv) Provide a tentative response, indicating why the agency has been unable to reach a decision on the petition, e.g., because of the existence of other agency priorities, or a need for additional information. The tentative response may also indicate the likely ultimate agency response, and may specify when a final response may be furnished.
(3) The Commissioner may grant or deny such a petition, in whole or in part, and may grant such other relief or take other action as the petition warrants. If, at any time, the Commissioner determines that changes in law, facts, or circumstances since the date on which the petition was submitted have rendered the petition moot, the Commissioner may dismiss the petition. The petitioner is to be notified of the Commissioner's decision. The decision will be placed in the public docket file and may also be in the form of a notice published in the
Federal Register.
(4) The Commissioner shall furnish a response to each petitioner within 90 days of receipt of a petition filed under section 505(j)(2)(C) of the act. The response will either approve or disapprove the petition. Agency action on a petition shall be governed by § 314.93 of this chapter.

After a ruling or referral, a petition may be supplemented, amended, or withdrawn only with the approval of the Commissioner. The Commissioner may approve withdrawal, with or without prejudice against resubmission of the petition.
(h) In reviewing a petition the Commissioner may use the following procedures:
(1) Conferences, meetings, discussions, and correspondence under § 10.65.
(2) A hearing under parts 12, 13, 14, 15, or 16.

submit a petition for reconsideration under § 10.33 or a petition for stay of action under § 10.35. A person who wishes to rely upon information or views not included in the administrative record shall submit them to the Commissioner with a new petition to modify the decision in accordance with this section.
(k) This section does not apply to the referral of a matter to a United States attorney for the initiation of court enforcement action and related correspondence, or to requests, suggestions, and recommendations made informally in routine correspondence received by FDA. Routine correspondence does not constitute a petition within the meaning of this section unless it purports to meet the requirements of this section. Action on routine correspondence does not constitute final administrative action subject to judicial review under § 10.45.
(l) The Dockets Management Staff will maintain a chronological list of each petition filed under this section and § 10.85, but not of petitions submitted elsewhere in the agency under § 10.25(a)(1), showing:

The Commissioner may approve withdrawal with or without prejudice against resubmission of the petition for stay of action.

§ 10.40
Promulgation of regulations for the efficient enforcement of the law.
(a) The Commissioner may propose and promulgate regulations for the efficient enforcement of the laws administered by FDA whenever it is necessary or appropriate to do so. The issuance, amendment, or revocation of a regulation may be initiated in any of the ways specified in § 10.25.
(1) This section applies to any regulation: (i) Not subject to § 10.50 and part 12, or (ii) if it is subject to § 10.50 and part 12, to the extent that those provisions make this section applicable.
(2) A regulation proposed by an interested person in a petition submitted under § 10.25(a) will be published in the
Federal Register
as a proposal if:
(i) The petition contains facts demonstrating reasonable grounds for the proposal; and
(ii) The petition substantially shows that the proposal is in the public interest and will promote the objectives of the act and the agency.
(3) Two or more alternative proposed regulations may be published on the same subject to obtain comment on the different alternatives.
(4) A regulation proposed by an interested person in a petition submitted under § 10.25(a) may be published together with the Commissioner's preliminary views on the proposal and any alternative proposal.
(b) Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, each regulation must be the subject of a notice of proposed rulemaking published in the
Federal Register.
(1) The notice will contain:
(i) The name of the agency;
(ii) The nature of the action, e.g., proposed rule, or notice;
(iii) A summary in the first paragraph describing the substance of the document in easily understandable terms;
(iv) Relevant dates, e.g., comment closing date, and proposed effective date(s);
(v) The name, business address, and phone number of an agency contact person who can provide further information to the public about the notice;
(vi) An address for submitting written comments;
(vii) Supplementary information about the notice in the form of a preamble that summarizes the proposal and the facts and policy underlying it, includes references to all information on which the Commissioner relies for the proposal (copies or a full list of which are a part of the docket file on the matter in the office of the Dockets Management Staff), and cites the authority under which the regulation is proposed;
(viii) Either the terms or substance of the proposed regulation or a description of the subjects and issues involved;
(ix) A reference to the existence or lack of need for an environmental impact statement under § 25.52 of this chapter; and
(x) The docket number of the matter, which identifies the docket file established by the Dockets Management Staff for all relevant submissions.
(2) The proposal will provide 60 days for comment, although the Commissioner may shorten or lengthen this time period for good cause. In no event is the time for comment to be less than 10 days.
(3) After publication of the proposed rule, any interested person may request the Commissioner to extend the comment period for an additional specified period by submitting a written request to the Dockets Management Staff stating the grounds for the request. The request is submitted under § 10.35 but should be headed “REQUEST FOR EXTENSION OF COMMENT PERIOD.”
(i) A request must discuss the reason comments could not feasibly be submitted within the time permitted, or that important new information will shortly be available, or that sound public policy otherwise supports an extension of the time for comment. The Commissioner may grant or deny the request or may grant an extension for a time period different from that requested. An extension may be limited to specific persons who have made and justified the request, but will ordinarily apply to all interested persons.
(ii) A comment time extension of 30 days or longer will be published in the
Federal Register
and will be applicable to all interested persons. A comment time extension of less than 30 days will be the subject either of a letter or memorandum filed with the Dockets Management Staff or of a notice published in the
Federal Register.
(4) A notice of proposed rulemaking will request that four copies of all comments be submitted to the Dockets Management Staff, except that individuals may submit single copies. Comments will be stamped with the date of receipt and will be numbered chronologically.
(5) Persons submitting comments critical of a proposed regulation are encouraged to include their preferred alternative wording.
(c) After the time for comment on a proposed regulation has expired, the Commissioner will review the entire administrative record on the matter, including all comments and, in a notice published in the
Federal Register,
will terminate the proceeding, issue a new proposal, or promulgate a final regulation.
(1) The quality and persuasiveness of the comments will be the basis for the Commissioner's decision. The number or length of comments will not ordinarily be a significant factor in the decision unless the number of comments is material where the degree of public interest is a legitimate factor for consideration.
(2) The decision of the Commissioner on the matter will be based solely upon the administrative record.
(3) A final regulation published in the
Federal Register
will have a preamble stating: (i) The name of the agency, (ii) the nature of the action e.g., final rule, notice, (iii) a summary first paragraph describing the substance of the document in easily understandable terms, (iv) relevant dates, e.g., the rule's effective date and comment closing date, if an opportunity for comment is provided, (v) the name, business address, and phone number of an agency contact person who can provide further information to the public about the notice, (vi) an address for the submission of written comments when they are permitted, (vii) supplementary information about the regulation in the body of the preamble that contains references to prior notices relating to the same matter and a summary of each type of comment submitted on the proposal and the Commissioner's conclusions with respect to each. The preamble is to contain a thorough and comprehensible explanation of the reasons for the Commissioner's decision on each issue.
(4) The effective date of a final regulation may not be less than 30 days after the date of publication in the
Federal Register,
except for:
(i) A regulation that grants an exemption or relieves a restriction; or
(ii) A regulation for which the Commissioner finds, and states in the notice good cause for an earlier effective date.
(d) The provisions for notice and comment in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section apply only to the extent required by the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 551, 552, and 553). As a matter of discretion, however, the Commissioner may voluntarily follow those provisions in circumstances in which they are not required by the Administrative Procedure Act.
(e) The requirements of notice and public procedure in paragraph (b) of this section do not apply in the following situations:
(1) When the Commissioner determines for good cause that they are impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest. In these cases, the notice promulgating the regulation will state the reasons for the determination, and provide an opportunity for comment to determine whether the regulation should subsequently be modified or revoked. A subsequent notice based on those comments may, but need not, provide additional opportunity for public comment.
(2) Food additive and color additive petitions, which are subject to the provisions of § 12.20(b)(2).
(3) New animal drug regulations, which are promulgated under section 512(i) of the act.
(f) In addition to the notice and public procedure required under paragraph (b) of this section, the Commissioner may also subject a proposed or final regulation, before or after publication
in the
Federal Register,
to the following additional procedures:
(1) Conferences, meetings, discussions, and correspondence under § 10.65.
(2) A hearing under parts 12, 13, 14, or 15.
(3) A notice published in the
Federal Register
requesting information and views before the Commissioner determines whether to propose a regulation.
(4) A draft of a proposed regulation placed on public display in the office of the Dockets Management Staff. If this procedure is used, the Commissioner shall publish an appropriate notice in the
Federal Register
stating that the document is available and specifying the time within which comments on the draft proposal may be submitted orally or in writing.
(5) A revised proposal published in the
Federal Register,
which proposal is subject to all the provisions in this section relating to proposed regulations.
(6) A tentative final regulation or tentative revised final regulation placed on public display in the office of the Dockets Management Staff and, if deemed desirable by the Commissioner, published in the
Federal Register.
If the tentative regulation is placed on display only, the Commissioner shall publish an appropriate notice in the
Federal Register
stating that the document is available and specifying the time within which comments may be submitted orally or in writing on the tentative final regulation. The Commissioner shall mail a copy of the tentative final regulation and the
Federal Register
notice to each person who submitted comments on the proposed regulation if one has been published.
(7) A final regulation published in the
Federal Register
that provides an opportunity for the submission of further comments, in accordance with paragraph (e)(1) of this section.
(8) Any other public procedure established in this chapter and expressly applicable to the matter.
(g) The record of the administrative proceeding consists of all of the following:
(1) If the regulation was initiated by a petition, the administrative record specified in § 10.30(i).
(2) If a petition for reconsideration or for a stay of action is filed, the administrative record specified in §§ 10.33(k) and 10.35(h).
(3) The proposed rule published in the
Federal Register,
including all information identified or filed by the Commissioner with the Dockets Management Staff on the proposal.

(7) All documents submitted to the Dockets Management Staff under § 10.65(h).
(h) The record of the administrative proceeding closes on the date of publication of the final regulation in the
Federal Register
unless some other date is specified. Thereafter, any interested person may submit a petition for reconsideration under § 10.33 or a petition for stay of action under § 10.35. A person who wishes to rely upon information or views not included in the administrative record shall submit it to the Commissioner with a new petition to modify the final regulation.
(i) The Dockets Management Staff shall maintain a chronological list of all regulations proposed and promulgated under this section and § 10.50 (which list will not include regulations resulting from petitions filed and assigned a docket number under § 10.30) showing—
(1) The docket number (for a petition submitted directly to a center, the list also includes the number or other designation assigned by the center, e.g., the number assigned to a food additive petition);

§ 10.45
Court review of final administrative action; exhaustion of administrative remedies.
(a) This section applies to court review of final administrative action taken by the Commissioner, including action taken under §§ 10.25 through 10.40 and § 16.1(b), except action subject to § 10.50 and part 12.
(b) A request that the Commissioner take or refrain from taking any form of administrative action must first be the subject of a final administrative decision based on a petition submitted under § 10.25(a) or, where applicable, a hearing under § 16.1(b) before any legal action is filed in a court complaining of the action or failure to act. If a court action is filed complaining of the action or failure to act before the submission of the decision on a petition under § 10.25(a) or, where applicable, a hearing under § 16.1(b), the Commissioner shall request dismissal of the court action or referral to the agency for an initial administrative determination on the grounds of a failure to exhaust administrative remedies, the lack of final agency action as required by 5 U.S.C. 701
et seq.,
and the lack of an actual controversy as required by 28 U.S.C. 2201.
(c) A request that administrative action be stayed must first be the subject of an administrative decision based upon a petition for stay of action submitted under § 10.35 before a request is made that a court stay the action. If a court action is filed requesting a stay of administrative action before the Commissioner's decision on a petition submitted in a timely manner pursuant to § 10.35, the Commissioner shall request dismissal of the court action or referral to the agency for an initial determination on the grounds of a failure to exhaust administrative remedies, the lack of final agency action as required by 5 U.S.C. 701
et seq.,
and the lack of an actual controversy as required by 28 U.S.C. 2201. If a court action is filed requesting a stay of administrative action after a petition for a stay of action is denied because it was submitted after expiration of the time period provided under § 10.35, or after the time for submitting such a petition has expired, the Commissioner will request dismissal of the court action on the ground of a failure to exhaust administrative remedies.
(d) Unless otherwise provided, the Commissioner's final decision constitutes final agency action (reviewable in the courts under 5 U.S.C. 701
et seq.
and, where appropriate, 28 U.S.C. 2201) on a petition submitted under § 10.25(a), on a petition for reconsideration submitted under § 10.33, on a petition for stay of action submitted under § 10.35, on an advisory opinion issued under § 10.85, on a matter involving administrative action which is the subject of an opportunity for a hearing under § 16.1(b) of this chapter, or on the issuance of a final regulation published in accordance with § 10.40, except that the agency's response to a petition filed under section 505(j)(2)(C) of the act (21 U.S.C. 355(j)(2)(C)) and § 314.93 of this chapter will not constitute final agency action until any petition for reconsideration submitted by the petitioner is acted on by the Commissioner.
(1) It is the position of FDA except as otherwise provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, that:
(i) Final agency action exhausts all administrative remedies and is ripe for preenforcement judicial review as of the date of the final decision, unless applicable law explicitly requires that the petitioner take further action before judicial review is available;
(ii) An interested person is affected by, and thus has standing to obtain judicial review of final agency action; and
(iii) It is not appropriate to move to dismiss a suit for preenforcement judicial review of final agency action on the ground that indispenable parties are not joined or that it is an unconsented suit against the United States if the defect could be cured by amending the complaint.
(2) The Commissioner shall object to judicial review of a matter if:
(i) The matter is committed by law to the discretion of the Commissioner,
e.g., a decision to recommend or not to recommend civil or criminal enforcement action under sections 302, 303, and 304 of the act; or
(ii) Review is not sought in a proper court.
(e) An interested person may request judicial review of a final decision of the Commissioner in the courts without first petitioning the Commissioner for reconsideration or for a stay of action, except that in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section, the person shall request a stay by the Commissioner under § 10.35 before requesting a stay by the court.
(f) The Commissioner shall take the position in an action for judicial review under 5 U.S.C. 701
et seq.,
whether or not it includes a request for a declaratory judgment under 28 U.S.C. 2201, or in any other case in which the validity of administrative action is properly challenged, that the validity of the action must be determined solely on the basis of the administrative record specified in §§ 10.30(i), 10.33(k), 10.35(h), 10.40(g), and 16.80(a) or the administrative record applicable to any decision or action under the regulations referenced in § 16.1(b), and that additional information or views may not be considered. An interested person who wishes to rely upon information or views not included in the administrative record shall submit them to the Commissioner with a new petition to modify the action under § 10.25(a).
(g) The Commissioner requests that all petitions for judicial review of a particular matter be filed in a single U.S. District court. If petitions are filed in more than one jurisdiction, the Commissioner will take appropriate action to prevent a multiplicity of suits in various jurisdictions, such as:
(1) A request for transfer of one or more suits to consolidate separate actions, under 28 U.S.C. 1404(a) or 28 U.S.C. 2112(a);
(2) A request that actions in all but one jurisdiction be stayed pending the conclusion of one proceeding;
(3) A request that all but one action be dismissed pending the conclusion of one proceeding, with the suggestion that the other plaintiffs intervene in that one suit; or
(4) A request that one of the suits be maintained as a class action in behalf of all affected persons.
(h)(1) For the purpose of 28 U.S.C. 2112(a), a copy of any petition filed in any U.S. Court of Appeals challenging a final action of the Commissioner shall be sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, or by personal delivery to the Chief Counsel of FDA. The petition copy shall be time-stamped by the clerk of the court when the original is filed with the court. The petition copy should be addressed to: Office of the Chief Counsel (GCF-1), Food and Drug Administration, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857. The Chief Counsel requests that the purpose of all petitions mailed or delivered to the Office of Chief Counsel to satisfy 28 U.S.C. 2112(a) be clearly identified in a cover letter.
(2) If the Chief Counsel receives two or more petitions filed in two or more U.S. Courts of Appeals for review of any agency action within 10 days of the effective date of that action for the purpose of judicial review, the Chief Counsel will notify the U.S. Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation of any petitions that were received within the 10-day period, in accordance with the applicable rule of the panel.
(3) For the purpose of determining whether a petition for review has been received within the 10-day period under paragraph (h)(2) of this section, the petition shall be considered to be received on the date of delivery, if personally delivered. If the delivery is accomplished by mail, the date of receipt shall be the date noted on the return receipt card.
(i) Upon judicial review of administrative action under this section:
(1) If a court determines that the administrative record is inadequate to support the action, the Commissioner shall determine whether to proceed with such action. (i) If the Commissioner decides to proceed with the action, the court will be requested to remand the matter to the agency to reopen the administrative proceeding and record, or on the Commissioner's own initiative the administrative proceeding and record may be reopened
upon receipt of the court determination. A reopened administrative proceeding will be conducted under the provisions of this part and in accordance with any directions of the court.
(ii) If the Commissioner concludes that the public interest requires that the action remain in effect pending further administrative proceedings, the court will be requested not to stay the matter in the interim and the Commissioner shall expedite the further administrative proceedings.
(2) If a court determines that the administrative record is adequate, but the rationale for the action must be further explained:
(i) The Commissioner shall request either that further explanation be provided in writing directly to the court without further administrative proceedings, or that the administrative proceeding be reopened in accordance with paragraph (i)(1)(i) of this section; and
(ii) If the Commissioner concludes that the public interest requires that the action remain in effect pending further court or administrative proceedings, the court will be requested not to stay the matter in the interim and the Commissioner shall expedite the further proceedings.

(a) This section applies to any matter subject by statute to an opportunity for a formal evidentiary public hearing, as listed in § 10.50(c), and any matter subject to a hearing before a Public Board of Inquiry under part 13.
(b) In the case of a matter listed in § 10.50(c) (1) through (10) and (12) through (15):
(1) An interested person may meet or correspond with any FDA representative concerning a matter prior to publication of a notice announcing a formal evidentiary public hearing or a hearing before a Public Board of Inquiry on the matter; the provisions of § 10.65 apply to the meetings and correspondence; and
(2) Upon publication of a notice announcing a formal evidentiary public hearing or a hearing before a Public Board of Inquiry, the following separation of functions apply:
(i) The center responsible for the matter is, as a party to the hearing, responsible for all investigative functions and for presentation of the position of the center at the hearing and in any pleading or oral argument before the Commissioner. Representatives of the center may not participate or advise in any decision except as witness or counsel in public proceedings. There is to be no other communication between representatives of the center and representatives of the office of the Commissioner concerning the matter before the decision of the Commissioner. The Commissioner may, however, designate representatives of a center to advise the office of the Commissioner, or designate members of that office to advise a center. The designation will be in writing and filed with the Dockets Management Staff no later than the time specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section for the application of separation of functions. All members of FDA other than representatives of the involved center (except those specifically designated otherwise) shall be available to advise and participate with the office of the Commissioner in its functions relating to the hearing and the final decision.
(ii) The Chief Counsel for FDA shall designate members of the office of General Counsel to advise and participate with the center in its functions in the hearing and members who are to advise the office of the Commissioner in its functions related to the hearing and the final decision. The members of the office of General Counsel designated to advise the center may not participate or advise in any decision of the Commissioner except as counsel in public proceedings. The designation is to be in the form of a memorandum filed with the Dockets Management Staff and made a part of the administrative record in the proceeding. There may be no other communication between those members of the office of General Counsel designated to advise the office of the Commissioner and any other persons in the office of General Counsel or in the involved center with respect to the matter prior to the decision of the Commissioner. The Chief Counsel may assign new attorneys to advise either the center or the office of the Commissioner at any stage of the proceedings. The Chief Counsel will ordinarily advise and participate with the office of the Commissioner in its functions relating to the hearing and the final decision.
(iii) The office of the Commissioner is responsible for the agency review and final decision of the matter, with the advice and participation of anyone in FDA other than representatives of the involved center and those members of the office of General Counsel designated to assist in the center's functions in the hearing.
(c) In a matter listed in § 10.50(c) (11) and (16) through (19), the provisions relating to separation of functions set forth in §§ 314.200(f), 514.200, and 601.7(a) are applicable before publication of a
notice announcing a formal evidentiary public hearing or a hearing before a Public Board of Inquiry. Following publication of the notice of hearing, the rules in paragraph (b)(2) of this section apply.
(d) Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, between the date that separation of functions applies under paragraph (b) or (c) of this section and the date of the Commissioner's decision on the matter, communication concerning the matter involved in the hearing will be restricted as follows:
(1) No person outside the agency may have an ex parte communication with the presiding officer or any person representing the office of the Commissioner concerning the matter in the hearing. Neither the presiding officer nor any person representing the office of the Commissioner may have any ex parte communication with a person outside the agency concerning the matter in the hearing. All communications are to be public communications, as witness or counsel, under the applicable provisions of this part.
(2) A participant in the hearing may submit a written communication to the office of the Commissioner with respect to a proposal for settlement. These communications are to be in the form of pleadings, served on all other participants, and filed with the Dockets Management Staff like any other pleading.
(3) A written communication contrary to this section must be immediately served on all other participants and filed with the Dockets Management Staff by the presiding officer at the hearing, or by the Commissioner, depending on who received the communication. An oral communication contrary to this section must be immediately recorded in a written memorandum and similarly served on all other participants and filed with the Dockets Management Staff. A person, including a representative of a participant in the hearing, who is involved in an oral communication contrary to this section, must, if possible, be made available for cross-examination during the hearing with respect to the substance of that conversation. Rebuttal testimony pertinent to a written or oral communication contrary to this section will be permitted. Cross-examination and rebuttal testimony will be transcribed and filed with the Dockets Management Staff.
(e) The prohibitions specified in paragraph (d) of this section apply to a person who knows of a notice of hearing in advance of its publication from the time the knowledge is acquired.
(f) The making of a communication contrary to this section may, consistent with the interests of justice and the policy of the underlying statute, result in a decision adverse to the person knowingly making or causing the making of such a communication.

meetings may be held and correspondence may be exchanged between representatives of FDA and an interested person outside FDA on a matter within the jurisdiction of the laws administered by the Commissioner. Action on meetings and correspondence does not constitute final administrative action subject to judicial review under § 10.45.
(b) The Commissioner may conclude that it would be in the public interest to hold an open public meeting to discuss a matter (or class of matters) pending before FDA, in which any interested person may participate.
(1) The Commissioner shall inform the public of the time and place of the meeting and of the matters to be discussed.
(2) The meeting will be informal, i.e., any interested person may attend and participate in the discussion without prior notice to the agency unless the notice of the meeting specifies otherwise.
(c) Every person outside the Federal Government may request a private meeting with a representative of FDA in agency offices to discuss a matter. FDA will make reasonable efforts to accommodate such requests.
(1) The person requesting a meeting may be accompanied by a reasonable number of employees, consultants, or other persons with whom there is a commercial arrangement within the meaning of § 20.81(a) of this chapter. Neither FDA nor any other person may require the attendance of a person who is not an employee of the executive branch of the Federal Government without the agreement of the person requesting the meeting. Any person may attend by mutual consent of the person requesting the meeting and FDA.
(2) FDA will determine which representatives of the agency will attend the meeting. The person requesting the meeting may request, but not require or preclude, the attendance of a specific FDA employee.
(3) A person who wishes to attend a private meeting, but who is not invited to attend either by the person requesting the meeting or by FDA, or who otherwise cannot attend the meeting, may request a separate meeting with FDA to discuss the same matter or an additional matter.
(d) FDA employees have a responsibility to meet with all segments of the public to promote the objectives of the laws administered by the agency. In pursuing this responsibility, the following general policy applies where agency employees are invited by persons outside the Federal Government to attend or participate in meetings outside agency offices as representatives of the agency.
(1) A person outside the executive branch may invite an agency representative to attend or participate in a meeting outside agency offices. The agency representative is not obligated to attend or participate, but may do so where it is in the public interest and will promote the objectives of the act.
(2) The agency representative may request that the meeting be open if that would be in the public interest. The agency representative may decline to participate in a meeting held as a private meeting if that will best serve the public interest.
(3) An agency representative may not knowingly participate in a meeting that is closed on the basis of gender, race, or religion.
(e) An official transcript, recording, or memorandum summarizing the substance of any meeting described in this section will be prepared by a representative of FDA when the agency determines that such documentation will be useful.
(f) FDA promptly will file in the appropriate administrative file memoranda of meetings prepared by FDA representatives and all correspondence, including any written summary of a meeting from a participant, that relate to a matter pending before the agency.
(g) Representatives of FDA may initiate a meeting or correspondence on any matter concerning the laws administered by the Commissioner. Unless otherwise required by law, meetings may be public or private at FDA's discretion.
(h) A meeting of an advisory committee is subject to the requirements of part 14 of this chapter.
[66 FR 6468, Jan. 22, 2001]
§ 10.70
Documentation of significant decisions in administrative file.
(a) This section applies to every significant FDA decision on any matter under the laws administered by the Commissioner, whether it is raised formally, for example, by a petition or informally, for example, by correspondence.
(b) FDA employees responsible for handling a matter are responsible for insuring the completeness of the administrative file relating to it. The file must contain:
(1) Appropriate documentation of the basis for the decision, including relevant evaluations, reviews, memoranda, letters, opinions of consultants, minutes of meetings, and other pertinent written documents; and
(2) The recommendations and decisions of individual employees, including supervisory personnel, responsible for handling the matter.
(i) The recommendations and decisions are to reveal significant controversies or differences of opinion and their resolution.
(ii) An agency employee working on a matter and, consistent with the prompt completion of other assignments, an agency employee who has worked on a matter may record individual views on that matter in a written memorandum, which is to be placed in the file.
(c) A written document placed in an administrative file must:
(1) Relate to the factual, scientific, legal or related issues under consideration;
(2) Be dated and signed by the author;
(3) Be directed to the file, to appropriate supervisory personnel, and to other appropriate employees, and show all persons to whom copies were sent;
(4) Avoid defamatory language, intemperate remarks, undocumented charges, or irrelevant matters (e.g., personnel complaints);
(5) If it records the views, analyses, recommendations, or decisions of an agency employee in addition to the author, be given to the other employees; and
(6) Once completed (i.e., typed in final form, dated, and signed) not be altered or removed. Later additions to or revisions of the document must be made in a new document.
(d) Memoranda or other documents that are prepared by agency employees and are not in the administrative file have no status or effect.
(e) FDA employees working on a matter have access to the administrative file on that matter, as appropriate for the conduct of their work. FDA employees who have worked on a matter have access to the administrative file on that matter so long as attention to their assignments is not impeded. Reasonable restrictions may be placed upon access to assure proper cataloging and storage of documents, the availability of the file to others, and the completeness of the file for review.
§ 10.75
Internal agency review of decisions.
(a) A decision of an FDA employee, other than the Commissioner, on a matter, is subject to review by the employee's supervisor under the following circumstances:
(1) At the request of the employee.
(2) On the initiative of the supervisor.
(3) At the request of an interested person outside the agency.
(4) As required by delegations of authority.
(b)(1) The review will be made by consultation between the employee and the supervisor or by review of the administrative file on the matter, or both. The review will ordinarily follow the established agency channels of supervision or review for that matter.
(2) A sponsor, applicant, or manufacturer of a drug or device regulated under the act or the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 262), may request review of a scientific controversy by an appropriate scientific advisory panel as described in section 505(n) of the act, or an advisory committee as described in section 515(g)(2)(B) of the act. The reason(s) for any denial of a request for such review shall be briefly set forth in writing to the requester. Persons who receive a Center denial of their request under this section may submit a request for review of the denial. The request should be sent to the Chief Mediator and Ombudsman.
(c) An interested person outside the agency may request internal agency review of a decision through the established agency channels of supervision or review. Personal review of these matters by center directors or the office of the Commissioner will occur for any of the following purposes:
(1) To resolve an issue that cannot be resolved at lower levels within the agency (e.g., between two parts of a center or other component of the agency, between two centers or other components of the agency, or between the agency and an interested person outside the agency).
(2) To review policy matters requiring the attention of center or agency management.
(3) In unusual situations requiring an immediate review in the public interest.
(4) As required by delegations of authority.
(d) Internal agency review of a decision must be based on the information in the administrative file. If an interested person presents new information not in the file, the matter will be returned to the appropriate lower level in the agency for reevaluation based on the new information.
(e) Each request by an interested person for review of a decision within the Center for Devices and Radiological Health shall also comply with § 800.75 of this chapter.

(a) A representative of FDA may discuss orally or in writing with an interested person ideas and recommendations for notices or regulations. FDA welcomes assistance in developing ideas for, and in gathering the information to support, notices and regulations.
(b) (1) Once it is determined that a notice or proposed regulation will be prepared, the general concepts may be discussed by a representative of FDA with an interested person. Details of a draft of a notice or proposed regulation may be discussed with a person outside the executive branch only with the specific permission of the Commissioner. The permission must be in writing and filed with the Dockets Management Staff.
(2) A draft of a notice or proposed regulation or its preamble, or a portion of either, may be furnished to an interested person outside the executive branch only if it is made available to all interested persons by a notice published in the
Federal Register.
A draft of a notice or proposed regulation made available in this manner may, without the prior permission of the Commissioner, be discussed with an interested person to clarify and resolve questions raised and concerns expressed about the draft.
(c) After publication of a notice or proposed regulation in the
Federal Register,
and before preparation of a draft of the final notice or regulation, a representative of FDA may discuss the proposal with an interested person as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
(d) (1) Details of a draft of a final notice or regulation may be discussed with an interested person outside the executive branch only with the specific permission of the Commissioner. The permission must be in writing and filed with the Dockets Management Staff.
(2) A draft of a final notice or regulation or its preamble, or any portion of either, may be furnished to an interested person outside the executive branch only if it is made available to all interested persons by a notice published in the
Federal Register,
except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (g) and (j) of this section. A draft of a final notice or regulation made available to an interested person in this manner may, without the prior permission of the Commissioner, be discussed as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
(i) The final notice or regulation and its preamble will be prepared solely on the basis of the administrative record.
(ii) If additional technical information from a person outside the executive branch is necessary to draft the final notice or regulation or its preamble, it will be requested by FDA in general terms and furnished directly to the Dockets Management Staff to be
included as part of the administrative record.
(iii) If direct discussion by FDA of a draft of a final notice or regulation or its preamble is required with a person outside the executive branch, appropriate protective procedures will be undertaken to make certain that a full and impartial administrative record is established. Such procedures may include either:
(
a
) The scheduling of an open public meeting under § 10.65(b) at which interested persons may participate in review of and comment on the draft document; or
(
b
) The preparation of a tentative final regulation or tentative revised final regulation under § 10.40(f)(6), on which interested persons will be given an additional period of time for oral and written comment.
(e) After a final regulation is published, an FDA representative may discuss any aspect of it with an interested person.
(f) In addition to the requirements of this section, the provisions of § 10.55 apply to the promulgation of a regulation subject to § 10.50 and part 12.
(g) A draft of a final food additive color additive, or new animal drug regulation may be furnished to the petitioner for comment on the technical accuracy of the regulation. Every meeting with a petitioner relating to the draft will be recorded in a written memorandum, and all memoranda and correspondence will be filed with the Dockets Management Staff as part of the administrative record of the regulation under the provisions of § 10.65.
(h) In accordance with section 534 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the Commissioner shall consult with interested persons and with the Technical Electronic Product Radiation Safety Standards Committee (TEPRSSC) before prescribing any performance standard for an electronic product. Accordingly, the Commissioner shall publish in the
Federal Register
an announcement when a proposed or final performance standard, including any amendment, is being considered for an electronic product, and any draft of any proposed or final standard will be furnished to an interested person upon request and may be discussed in detail.
(i) The provisions of § 10.65 apply to meetings and correspondence relating to draft notices and regulations.
(j) The provisions of this section restricting discussion and disclosure of draft notices and regulations do not apply to situations covered by §§ 20.83 through 20.89.
[44 FR 22323, Apr. 13, 1979, as amended at 54 FR 9035, Mar. 3, 1989; 64 FR 398, Jan. 5, 1999; 88 FR 16879, Mar. 21, 2023]

# Request for Advisory Opinion
The undersigned submits this request for an advisory opinion of the Commissioner of Food and Drugs with respect to ______ (the general nature of the matter involved).
A.
Issues involved.
(A concise statement of the issues and questions on which an opinion is requested.)
B.
Statement of facts and law.
(A full statement of all facts and legal points relevant to the request.)
The undersigned certifies that, to the best of his/her knowledge and belief, this request includes all data, information, and views relevant to the matter, whether favorable or unfavorable to the position of the undersigned, which is the subject of the request.
(Signature)
(Person making request)
(Mailing address)
(Telephone number)
(c) The Commissioner may respond to an oral or written request to the agency as a request for an advisory opinion, in which case the request will be filed with the Dockets Management Staff and be subject to this section.
(d) A statement of policy or interpretation made in the following documents, unless subsequently repudiated by the agency or overruled by a court, will constitute an advisory opinion:
(1) Any portion of a
Federal Register
notice other than the text of a proposed or final regulation, e.g., a notice to manufacturers or a preamble to a proposed or final regulation.
(2) Trade Correspondence (T.C. Nos. 1-431 and 1A-8A) issued by FDA between 1938 and 1946.
(3) Compliance policy guides issued by FDA beginning in 1968 and codified in the Compliance Policy Guides manual.
(4) Other documents specifically identified as advisory opinions, e.g., advisory opinions on the performance standard for diagnostic X-ray systems, issued before July 1, 1975, and filed in a permanent public file for prior advisory opinions maintained by the Division of Freedom of Information (ELEM-1029)” and adding in its place “(the Freedom of Information Staff's address is available on the agency's web site at
http://www.fda.gov.
)
(e) An advisory opinion represents the formal position of FDA on a matter and except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section, obligates the agency to follow it until it is amended or revoked. The Commissioner may not recommend legal action against a person or product with respect to an action taken in conformity with an advisory opinion which has not been amended or revoked.
(f) In unusual situations involving an immediate and significant danger to health, the Commissioner may take appropriate civil enforcement action contrary to an advisory opinion before amending or revoking the opinion. This action may be taken only with the approval of the Commissioner, who may not delegate this function. Appropriate amendment or revocation of the advisory opinion involved will be expedited.
(g) An advisory opinion may be amended or revoked at any time after it has been issued. Notice of amendment or revocation will be given in the same manner as notice of the advisory opinion was originally given or in the
Federal Register,
and will be placed on public display as part of the file on the matter in the office of the Dockets Management Staff. The Dockets Management Staff shall maintain a separate chronological index of all advisory opinions filed. The index will specify the date of the request for the advisory opinion, the date of the opinion, and identification of the appropriate file.
(h) Action undertaken or completed in conformity with an advisory opinion which has subsequently been amended or revoked is acceptable to FDA unless the Commissioner determines that substantial public interest considerations preclude continued acceptance. Whenever possible, an amended or revoked advisory opinion will state when action previously undertaken or completed does not remain acceptable, and any transition period that may be applicable.
(i) An interested person may submit written comments on an advisory opinion or modified advisory opinion. Four copies of any comments are to be sent to the Dockets Management Staff for inclusion in the public file on the advisory opinion. Individuals may submit only one copy. Comments will be considered in determining whether further modification of an advisory opinion is warranted.
(j) An advisory opinion may be used in administrative or court proceedings to illustrate acceptable and unacceptable procedures or standards, but not as a legal requirement.
(k) A statement made or advice provided by an FDA employee constitutes an advisory opinion only if it is issued in writing under this section. A statement or advice given by an FDA employee orally, or given in writing but not under this section or § 10.90, is an
informal communication that represents the best judgment of that employee at that time but does not constitute an advisory opinion, does not necessarily represent the formal position of FDA, and does not bind or otherwise obligate or commit the agency to the views expressed.

§ 10.90
Food and Drug Administration regulations, recommendations, and agreements.
(a)
Regulations.
FDA regulations are issued in the
Federal Register
under § 10.40 or § 10.50 and codified in the Code of Federal Regulations. Regulations may contain provisions that will be enforced as legal requirements, or which are intended only as guidance documents and recommendations, or both. The dissemination of draft notices and regulations is subject to § 10.80.
(b) [Reserved]
(c)
Recommendations.
In addition to the guidance documents subject to § 10.115, FDA often formulates and disseminates recommendations about matters which are authorized by, but do not involve direct regulatory action under, the laws administered by the Commissioner, e.g., model State and local ordinances, or personnel practices for reducing radiation exposure, issued under 42 U.S.C. 243 and 21 U.S.C. 360ii. These recommendations may, in the discretion of the Commissioner, be handled under the procedures established in § 10.115, except that the recommendations will be included in a separate public file of recommendations established by the Dockets Management Staff and will be separated from the guidance documents in the notice of availability published in the
Federal Register,
or be published in the
Federal Register
as regulations under paragraph (a) of this section.
(d)
Agreements.
Formal agreements, memoranda of understanding, or other similar written documents executed by FDA and another person will be included in the public file on agreements established by the Division of Freedom of Information (ELEM-1029)” and adding in its place “(the Freedom of Information Staff's address is available on the agency's web site at
http://www.fda.gov
) under § 20.108. A document not included in the public file is deemed to be rescinded and has no force or effect whatever.
[44 FR 22323, Apr. 13, 1979, as amended at 54 FR 9035, Mar. 3, 1989; 65 FR 56477, Sept. 19, 2000; 75 FR 16346, Apr. 1, 2010; 79 FR 68114, Nov. 14, 2014]
§ 10.95
Participation in outside standard-setting activities.
(a)
General.
This section applies to participation by FDA employees in standard-setting activities outside the agency. Standard-setting activities include matters such as the development of performance characteristics, testing methodology, manufacturing practices, product standards, scientific protocols, compliance criteria, ingredient specifications, labeling, or other technical or policy criteria. FDA encourages employee participation in outside standard-setting activities that are in the public interest.
(b)
Standard-setting activities by other Federal Government agencies.
(1) An FDA employee may participate in these activities after approval of the activity under procedures specified in the current agency Staff Manual Guide.
(2) Approval forms and all pertinent background information describing the activity will be included in the public file on standard-setting activities established by the Division of Freedom of Information (ELEM-1029)” and adding in its place “(the Freedom of Information Staff's address is available on the agency's web site at
http://www.fda.gov
).
(3) If a member of the public is invited by FDA to present views to, or to accompany, the FDA employee at a meeting, the invitations will be extended to a representative sampling of the public, including consumer groups, industry associations, professional societies, and academic institutions.
(4) An FDA employee appointed as the liaison representative to an activity shall refer all requests for information about or participation in the activity to the group or organization responsible for the activity.
(c)
Standard-setting activities by State and local government agencies and by
United Nations organizations and other international organizations and foreign governments pursuant to treaty.
(1) An FDA employee may participate in these activities after approval of the activity under procedures specified in the current agency Staff Manual Guide.
(2) Approval forms and all pertinent background information describing the activity will be included in the public file on standard-setting activities established by the Division of Freedom of Information (ELEM-1029)” and adding in its place “(the Freedom of Information Staff's address is available on the agency's web site at
http://www.fda.gov
).
(3) The availability for public disclosure of records relating to the activity will be governed by part 20.
(4) If a member of the public is invited by FDA to present views to, or to accompany, the FDA employee at a meeting, the invitation will be extended to a representative sampling of the public, including consumer groups, industry associations, professional societies, and academic institutions.
(5) An FDA employee appointed as the liaison representative to an activity shall refer all requests for information about or participation in the activity to the group or organization responsible for the activity.
(d)
Standard-setting activities by private groups and organizations.
(1) An FDA employee may engage in these activities after approval of the activity under procedures specified in the current agency Staff Manual Guide. A request for official participation must be made by the group or organization in writing, must describe the scope of the activity, and must demonstrate that the minimum standards set out in paragraph (d)(5) of this section are met. Except as provided in paragraph (d)(7) of this section, a request that is granted will be the subject of a letter from the Commissioner or the center director to the organization stating—
(i) Whether participation by the individual will be as a voting or nonvoting liaison representative;
(ii) That participation by the individual does not connote FDA agreement with, or endorsement of, any decisions reached; and
(iii) That participation by the individual precludes service as the deciding official on the standard involved if it should later come before FDA. The deciding official is the person who signs a document ruling upon the standard.
(2) The letter requesting official FDA participation, the approval form, and the Commissioner's or center director's letter, together with all pertinent background information describing the activities involved, will be included in the public file on standard-setting activities established by the Division of Freedom of Information (ELEM-1029)” and adding in its place “(the Freedom of Information Staff's address is available on the agency's web site at
http://www.fda.gov
).
(3) The availability for public disclosure of records relating to the activities will be governed by part 20.
(4) An FDA employee appointed as the liaison representative to an activity shall refer all requests for information about or participation in the activity to the group or organization responsible for the activity.
(5) The following minimum standards apply to an outside private standard-setting activity in which FDA employees participate:
(i) The activity will be based upon consideration of sound scientific and technological information, will permit revision on the basis of new information, and will be designed to protect the public against unsafe, ineffective, or deceptive products or practices.
(ii) The activity and resulting standards will not be designed for the economic benefit of any company, group, or organization, will not be used for such antitrust violations as fixing prices or hindering competition, and will not involve establishment of certification or specific approval of individual products or services.
(iii) The group or organization responsible for the standard-setting activity must have a procedure by which an interested person will have an opportunity to provide information and views on the activity and standards involved, without the payment of fees, and the information and views will be considered. How this is accomplished, including whether the presentation will be in person or in writing, will be
decided by the group or organization responsible for the activity.
(6) Membership of an FDA employee in an organization that also conducts a standard-setting activity does not invoke the provisions of this section unless the employee participates in the standard-setting activity. Participation in a standard-setting activity is subject to this section.
(7) The Commissioner may determine in writing that, because direct involvement by FDA in a particular standard-setting activity is in the public interest and will promote the objectives of the act and the agency, the participation is exempt from the requirements of paragraph (d)(1) (ii) and/or (iii) of this section. This determination will be included in the public file on standard-setting activities established by the Division of Freedom of Information (ELEM-1029)” and adding in its place “(the Freedom of Information Staff's address is available on the agency's web site at
http://www.fda.gov
) and in any relevant administrative file. The activity may include the establishment and validation of analytical methods for regulatory use, drafting uniform laws and regulations, and the development of recommendations concerning public health and preventive medicine practices by national and international organizations.
(8) Because of the close daily cooperation between FDA and the associations of State and local government officials listed below in this paragraph, and the large number of agency employees who are members of or work with these associations, participation in the activities of these associations is exempt from paragraphs (d)(1) through (7) of this section, except that a list of the committees and other groups of these associations will be included in the public file on standard-setting activities established by the Division of Freedom of Information (ELEM-1029)” and adding in its place “(the Freedom of Information Staff's address is available on the agency's web site at

§ 10.100
Public calendar.
(a)
Public calendar.
A public calendar will be prepared and made publicly available by FDA each week showing, to the extent feasible, significant events of the previous week, including significant meetings with persons outside the executive branch, that involve the representatives of FDA designated under paragraph (c) of this section.
(1) Public calendar entries will include:
(i) Significant meetings with members of the judiciary, representatives of Congress, or staffs of congressional committees when the meeting relates to a pending court case, administrative hearing, or other regulatory action or decision;
(ii) Significant meetings, conferences, seminars, and speeches; and
(iii) Social events sponsored by the regulated industry.
(2) The public calendar will not include reports of meetings that would prejudice law enforcement activities (e.g., a meeting with an informant) or invade privacy (e.g., a meeting with a candidate for possible employment at FDA), meetings with members of the press, or meetings with onsite contractors.
(b)
Calendar entries.
The calendar will specify for each entry the date, person(s), and subject matter involved. If a large number of persons are in attendance, the name of each individual need not be specified. When more than one FDA representative is in attendance, the most senior agency official will report the meeting on the public calendar.
(c)
Affected persons.
The following FDA representatives are subject to the requirements of this section:
(1) Commissioner of Food and Drugs.
(2) Senior Associate Commissioners.
(3) Deputy Commissioners.

§ 10.105
Representation by an organization.
(a) An organization may represent its members by filing petitions, comments, and objections, and otherwise participating in an administrative proceeding subject to this part.
(b) A petition, comment, objection, or other representation by an organization will not abridge the right of a member to take individual action of a similar type, in the member's own name.
(c) It is requested that each organization participating in FDA administrative proceedings file annually with the Dockets Management Staff a current list of all of the members of the organization.
(d) The filing by an organization of an objection or request for hearing under §§ 12.20 through 12.22 does not provide a member a legal right with respect to the objection or request for hearing that the member may individually exercise. A member of an organization wishing to file an objection or request for hearing must do so individually.
(e) In a court proceeding in which an organization participates, the Commissioner will take appropriate legal measures to have the case brought or considered as a class action or otherwise as binding upon all members of the organization except those specifically excluded by name. Regardless of whether the case is brought or considered as a class action or as otherwise binding upon all members of the organization except those specifically excluded by name, the Commissioner will take the position in any subsequent suit involving the same issues and a member of the organization that the issues are precluded from further litigation by the member under the doctrines of collateral estoppel or res judicata.
§ 10.110
Settlement proposals.
At any time in the course of a proceeding subject to this part, a person may propose settlement of the issues involved. A participant in a proceeding will have an opportunity to consider a proposed settlement. Unaccepted proposals of settlement and related matters, e.g., proposed stipulations not agreed to, will not be admissible in evidence in an FDA administrative proceeding. FDA will oppose the admission in evidence of settlement information in a court proceeding or in another administrative proceeding.
§ 10.115
Good guidance practices.
(a)
What are good guidance practices?
Good guidance practices (GGP's) are FDA's policies and procedures for developing, issuing, and using guidance documents.
(b)
What is a guidance document?
(1) Guidance documents are documents
prepared for FDA staff, applicants/sponsors, and the public that describe the agency's interpretation of or policy on a regulatory issue.
(2) Guidance documents include, but are not limited to, documents that relate to: The design, production, labeling, promotion, manufacturing, and testing of regulated products; the processing, content, and evaluation or approval of submissions; and inspection and enforcement policies.
(3) Guidance documents do not include: Documents relating to internal FDA procedures, agency reports, general information documents provided to consumers or health professionals, speeches, journal articles and editorials, media interviews, press materials, warning letters, memoranda of understanding, or other communications directed to individual persons or firms.
(c)
What other terms have a special meaning?
(1) “Level 1 guidance documents” include guidance documents that:
(i) Set forth initial interpretations of statutory or regulatory requirements;
(ii) Set forth changes in interpretation or policy that are of more than a minor nature;
(iii) Include complex scientific issues; or
(iv) Cover highly controversial issues.
(2) “Level 2 guidance documents” are guidance documents that set forth existing practices or minor changes in interpretation or policy. Level 2 guidance documents include all guidance documents that are not classified as Level 1.
(3) “You” refers to all affected parties outside of FDA.
(d)
Are you or FDA required to follow a guidance document?
(1) No. Guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable rights or responsibilities. They do not legally bind the public or FDA.
(2) You may choose to use an approach other than the one set forth in a guidance document. However, your alternative approach must comply with the relevant statutes and regulations. FDA is willing to discuss an alternative approach with you to ensure that it complies with the relevant statutes and regulations.
(3) Although guidance documents do not legally bind FDA, they represent the agency's current thinking. Therefore, FDA employees may depart from guidance documents only with appropriate justification and supervisory concurrence.
(e)
Can FDA use means other than a guidance document to communicate new agency policy or a new regulatory approach to a broad public audience?
The agency may not use documents or other means of communication that are excluded from the definition of guidance document to informally communicate new or different regulatory expectations to a broad public audience for the first time. These GGP's must be followed whenever regulatory expectations that are not readily apparent from the statute or regulations are first communicated to a broad public audience.
(f)
How can you participate in the development and issuance of guidance documents?
(1) You can provide input on guidance documents that FDA is developing under the procedures described in paragraph (g) of this section.
(2) You can suggest areas for guidance document development. Your suggestions should address why a guidance document is necessary.
(3) You can submit drafts of proposed guidance documents for FDA to consider. When you do so, you should mark the document “Guidance Document Submission” and submit it to Dockets Management Staff (HFA-305), 5630 Fishers Lane, rm. 1061, Rockville, MD 20852. If you wish to submit the draft of a proposed guidance document electronically, submit it through
https://www.regulations.gov
at Docket No. FDA-2013-S-0610. It is only necessary to submit one copy.
(4) You can, at any time, suggest that FDA revise or withdraw an already existing guidance document. Your suggestion should address why the guidance document should be revised or withdrawn and, if applicable, how it should be revised.
(5) Once a year, FDA will publish, both in the
Federal Register
and on the Internet, a list of possible topics
for future guidance document development or revision during the next year. You can comment on this list (e.g., by suggesting alternatives or making recommendations on the topics that FDA is considering).
(6) To participate in the development and issuance of guidance documents through one of the mechanisms described in paragraphs (f)(1), (f)(2), or (f)(4) of this section, you should contact the center or office that is responsible for the regulatory activity covered by the guidance document.
(7) If FDA agrees to draft or revise a guidance document, under a suggestion made under paragraphs (f)(1), (f)(2), (f)(3) or (f)(4) of this section, you can participate in the development of that guidance document under the procedures described in paragraph (g) of this section.
(g)
What are FDA's procedures for developing and issuing guidance documents?
(1) FDA's procedures for the development and issuance of Level 1 guidance documents are as follows:
(i) Before FDA prepares a draft of a Level 1 guidance document, FDA can seek or accept early input from individuals or groups outside the agency. For example, FDA can do this by participating in or holding public meetings and workshops.

(A) Publish a notice in the
Federal Register
announcing that the draft guidance document is available;
(B) Post the draft guidance document on the Internet and make it available in hard copy; and
(C) Invite your comment on the draft guidance document. Paragraph (h) of this section tells you how to submit your comments.
(iii) After FDA prepares a draft of a Level 1 guidance document, FDA also can:
(A) Hold public meetings or workshops; or
(B) Present the draft guidance document to an advisory committee for review.
(iv) After providing an opportunity for public comment on a Level 1 guidance document, FDA will:
(A) Review any comments received and prepare the final version of the guidance document that incorporates suggested changes, when appropriate;

# Subpart C—Electronic Media Coverage of Public Administrative Proceedings; Guideline on Policy and Procedures

# Source:
49 FR 14726, Apr. 13, 1984, unless otherwise noted.
§ 10.200
Scope.
This guideline describes FDA's policy and procedures applicable to electronic media coverage of agency public administrative proceedings. It is a guideline intended to clarify and explain FDA's policy on the presence and operation of electronic recording equipment at such proceedings and to assure uniform and consistent application of practices and procedures throughout the agency.
§ 10.203
Definitions.
(a)
Public administrative proceeding
as used in this guideline means any FDA proceeding which the public has a right to attend. This includes a formal evidentiary public hearing as set forth in part 12, a public hearing before a Public Board of Inquiry as set forth in part 13, a public hearing before a Public Advisory Committee as set forth in part 14, a public hearing before the Commissioner as set forth in part 15, a regulatory hearing before FDA as set forth in part 16, consumer exchange meetings, and Commissioner's public meetings with health professionals.
(b)
Advance notice
as used in this guideline means written or telephone notification to FDA's Office of Public Affairs (Press Relations Staff) of intent to electronically record an agency public administrative proceeding.
(c)
Electronic recording
as used in this guideline means any visual or audio recording made by videotape recording equipment or moving film camera, and/or other electronic recording equipment.
[49 FR 14726, Apr. 13, 1984, as amended at 54 FR 9035, Mar. 3, 1989]
§ 10.204
General.
(a) FDA has for many years willingly committed itself to a policy of openness. In many instances FDA has sought to make the open portions of agency public administrative proceedings more accessible to public participation. Similarly, FDA has sought, wherever possible, to allow full written media access to its proceedings, so that members of the press would have the opportunity to provide first-hand reports. However, because electronic media coverage presents certain difficulties that are easier to resolve with advance notice to the agency and all participants, FDA believes that codification of its policy will facilitate and further increase media access to its public administrative proceedings. The agency intends to refer to this guideline when notices of hearing, or individual advisory committee meetings, are published in the
Federal Register.
Thus, all parties to a proceeding will be on notice that the proceeding may be recorded electronically and any person interested in videotaping or otherwise recording the proceeding will be notified that there are established procedures to be followed.
(b) The designated presiding officer of a public administrative proceeding retains the existing discretionary authority set forth in specific regulations pertaining to each type of administrative proceeding to regulate the conduct
of the proceeding over which he or she presides. The responsibilities of the presiding officer, established elsewhere in parts 10 through 16, include an obligation to be concerned with the timely conduct of a hearing, the limited availability of certain witnesses, and reducing disruptions to the proceeding which may occur. Each proceeding varies, and the presiding officer cannot anticipate all that might occur. Discretionary authority to regulate conduct at a proceeding has traditionally been granted to presiding officers to enable them to fulfill their responsibility to maintain a fair and orderly hearing conducted in an expeditious manner.
(c) This guideline provides the presiding officer with a degree of flexibility in that it sets forth the agency's policy as well as the procedures that presiding officers should ordinarily follow, but from which they may depart in particular situations if necessary, subject to the presumption of openness of public proceedings to electronic media coverage. The presiding officer's discretion to establish additional procedures or to limit electronic coverage is to be exercised only in the unusual circumstances defined in this guideline. Even though a presiding officer may establish additional procedures or limits as may be required in a particular situation, he or she will be guided by the policy expressed in this guideline in establishing these conditions. The presiding officer may also be less restrictive, taking into account such factors as the duration of a hearing and the design of the room.
(d) If a portion or all of a proceeding is closed to the public because material is to be discussed that is not disclosable to the public under applicable laws, the proceeding also will be closed to electronic media coverage.
(e) The agency requests advance notice of intent to record a proceeding electronically to facilitate the orderly conduct of the proceeding. Knowledge of anticipated media coverage will allow the presiding officer to make any special arrangements required by the circumstances of the proceeding. The agency believes that this guideline establishes sufficiently specific criteria to promote uniformity.
(f) The agency would like to allow all interested media representatives to videotape a proceeding in which they have an interest. However, should space limitations preclude a multitude of cameras, the presiding officer may require pool sharing. In such a case, pool sharing arrangements of the resulting videotape should be made between those allowed to film and those who were excluded. Arrangements for who is designated to present the pool and a method of distributing the resulting film or tape may be determined by the established networks' pooling system. However, the agency has a strong commitment to ensuring that media representatives other than the major networks also be able to obtain a copy of the tape at cost. FDA is concerned that if the network pool representative wishes to record only a short portion of a proceeding, but an excluded party wishes to record the entire proceeding, confusion will result. The agency expects the interested media representatives to negotiate a suitable agreement among themselves before commencement of the proceeding. For example, the network pool representatives might agree to record a portion of the proceeding up to a break in the proceeding, at which time, while the network representative is disassembling equipment, another media representative might set up to continue recording. If an agreement cannot be reached before the proceeding, the agency will use the time of receipt of any advance notice to determine the representation for each category of media, e.g., one network reporter, one independent reporter. The agency recommends that parties intending to videotape provide as much advance notice as possible, so that the agency may best respond to the needs of the electronic media.
(g) To ensure the timely conduct of agency hearings and to prevent disruptions, equipment is to be stationary during a proceeding and should be set up and taken down when the proceeding is not in progress. As noted previously, the presiding officer may, at his or her discretion, be less restrictive if appropriate.
(h) The agency recognizes that electronic media representatives may desire only short footage of a proceeding, a facsimile of the proceeding, and/or interview opportunities and may be unnecessarily restricted by requirements for setting up before a proceeding and then waiting until a break in the proceeding before being permitted to take down their equipment. To accommodate this possibility, FDA's Press Relations Staff will attempt to make arrangements to respond to such needs by, for example, requesting that the presiding officer provide a break shortly after commencement of the proceeding to permit take down of equipment.
(i) The agency is making a full commitment to allowing, whenever possible, electronic coverage of its public administrative proceedings subject to the limited restrictions established in this guideline.
§ 10.205
Electronic media coverage of public administrative proceedings.
(a) A person may record electronically any open public administrative proceeding, subject to the procedures specified in this guideline. The procedures include a presumption that agency public proceedings are open to the electronic media. Whenever possible, FDA will permit all interested persons access to record agency public administrative proceedings. Restrictions other than those listed in § 10.206 will be imposed only under exceptional circumstances.
(b) A videotape recording of an FDA public administrative proceeding is not an official record of the proceeding. The only official record is the written transcript of the proceeding, which is taken by the official reporter.
§ 10.206
Procedures for electronic media coverage of agency public administrative proceedings.
(a) To facilitate the agency's response to media needs, a person intending to videotape an FDA public administrative proceeding should, whenever possible, provide advance notice to the Press Relations Staff (HFI-20), Office of Public Affairs, Food and Drug Administration, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857, in writing or by telephone (telephone 301-443-4177), at least 48 hours in advance of the proceeding. The Press Relations Staff will inform the presiding officer that the proceeding will be attended by representatives of the electronic media, and ascertain whether any special provisions in addition to those set forth in this subpart are required by the presiding officer. If so, the Press Relations Staff will function as a liaison between the presiding officer and the person intending to record the proceeding in facilitating any procedures in addition to those outlined in this subpart. The presiding officer will not deny access for failure to provide a 48-hour advance notice. Any advance notice may describe the intended length of recording if known, the amount and type of equipment to be used, and any special needs such as interviews.
(b) Cameras should be completely set up before a proceeding is scheduled to begin or during a break in the proceeding and should remain standing in the area designated for electronic media equipment. Cameras may be taken down only during breaks or after the hearing is over. Roving cameras will not be permitted during the proceeding. Any artificial lighting should be unobtrusive. Microphones, like cameras, should be in place before the start of a proceeding and may be taken down as indicated in this paragraph.
(c) When space in the hearing room is limited, the presiding officer may restrict the number of cameras or the equipment present. Should such a restriction become necessary, the pool arrangements are the responsibility of the participating media. The agency encourages the network pool to make copies of the tape, film, or other product available at cost to nonpool participants. However, if this is not possible, the agency may need to use the time of receipt of any advance notice to determine the representation for each category, e.g., one network reporter, one independent reporter, etc.
(d)
Off the record
portions of a proceeding may not be videotaped.
(e) Before or during the proceeding, the presiding officer may establish other conditions specific to the proceeding for which the request is being made. These conditions may be more or
less restrictive than those stated in this guideline, except that the presiding officer shall observe the agency's presumption of openness of its public proceedings to the electronic media. Only a substantial and clear threat to the agency's interests in order, fairness, and timeliness authorizes the presiding officer to impose additional restrictions. This threat must outweigh the public interest in electronic media coverage of agency proceedings. Additional restrictions shall be narrowly drawn to the particular circumstances. The following factors are listed to assist presiding officers in determining whether the agency's interest is sufficiently compelling to call for the unusual step of imposing additional restrictions. Generally this step is justified when one of the following factors is met:
(1) Electronic recording would result in a substantial likelihood of disruption that clearly cannot be contained by the procedures established in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section.
(2) Electronic recording would result in a substantial likelihood of prejudicial impact on the fairness of the proceeding or the substantive discussion in a proceeding.
(3) There is a substantial likelihood that a witness' ability to testify may be impaired due to unique personal circumstances such as the age or psychological state of the witness or the particularly personal or private nature of the witness' testimony, if the witness' testimony were electronically recorded.
(f) Before the proceeding, the Press Relations Staff will, upon request, provide written copies of any additional conditions imposed by the presiding officer (as described in paragraph (e) of this section) to requesting members of the media. Any appeals should be made in accordance with paragraph (h) of this section.
(g) The presiding officer retains authority to restrict or discontinue videotaping or other recording of a proceeding, or parts of a proceeding, should such a decision become necessary. The presiding officer's responsibility to conduct the hearing includes the right and duty to remove a source of substantial disruption. In exercising his or her authority, the presiding officer shall observe the presumption that agency public proceedings are open to the electronic media. The presiding officer shall exercise his or her discretion to restrict or discontinue electronic coverage of a public proceeding, or portions of a public proceeding, only if he or she determines that the agency's interest in the fair and orderly administrative process is substantially threatened. A clear and substantial threat to the integrity of agency proceedings must clearly outweigh the public interest in electronic media coverage of the proceedings before additional restrictions are imposed on the electronic media during the course of the proceedings. The factors noted in paragraph (e) of this section indicate the kind of substantial threat to the agency interests that may require imposing additional restrictions during the course of the proceedings. If additional requirements are established during the hearing, the presiding officer shall notify immediately the Deputy Commissioner of Food and Drugs of that fact by telephone and submit a written explanation of the circumstances that necessitated such an action within 24 hours or sooner if requested by the Deputy Commissioner. In the absence or unavailability of the Deputy Commissioner, the presiding officer shall notify the Associate Commissioner for Regulatory Affairs.
(h) A decision by a presiding officer, made either before the proceeding or during the course of a proceeding, to establish requirements in addition to the minimum standards set forth in this guideline may be appealed by any adversely affected person who intends to record the proceeding electronically. Appeals may be made in writing or by phone to the Deputy Commissioner or, in his or her absence, to the Associate Commissioner for Regulatory Affairs. The filing of an appeal, whether before or during a proceeding, does not require the presiding officer to interrupt the proceeding. However, the Deputy Commissioner or, in his or her absence, the Associate Commissioner for Regulatory Affairs will resolve an appeal as
expeditiously as possible so as to preserve, to the extent possible, the reporters' opportunity to record the proceedings.

# Subpart B—Electronic Records
§ 11.10
Controls for closed systems.
Persons who use closed systems to create, modify, maintain, or transmit electronic records shall employ procedures and controls designed to ensure the authenticity, integrity, and, when appropriate, the confidentiality of electronic records, and to ensure that the signer cannot readily repudiate the signed record as not genuine. Such procedures and controls shall include the following:
(a) Validation of systems to ensure accuracy, reliability, consistent intended performance, and the ability to discern invalid or altered records.
(b) The ability to generate accurate and complete copies of records in both human readable and electronic form suitable for inspection, review, and copying by the agency. Persons should contact the agency if there are any questions regarding the ability of the agency to perform such review and copying of the electronic records.
(c) Protection of records to enable their accurate and ready retrieval throughout the records retention period.
(d) Limiting system access to authorized individuals.
(e) Use of secure, computer-generated, time-stamped audit trails to independently record the date and time of operator entries and actions that create, modify, or delete electronic records. Record changes shall not obscure previously recorded information. Such audit trail documentation shall be retained for a period at least as long as that required for the subject electronic records and shall be available for agency review and copying.
(f) Use of operational system checks to enforce permitted sequencing of steps and events, as appropriate.
(g) Use of authority checks to ensure that only authorized individuals can use the system, electronically sign a record, access the operation or computer system input or output device, alter a record, or perform the operation at hand.
(h) Use of device (e.g., terminal) checks to determine, as appropriate, the validity of the source of data input or operational instruction.
(i) Determination that persons who develop, maintain, or use electronic record/electronic signature systems have the education, training, and experience to perform their assigned tasks.
(j) The establishment of, and adherence to, written policies that hold individuals accountable and responsible for actions initiated under their electronic signatures, in order to deter record and signature falsification.
(k) Use of appropriate controls over systems documentation including:
(1) Adequate controls over the distribution of, access to, and use of documentation for system operation and maintenance.
(2) Revision and change control procedures to maintain an audit trail that documents time-sequenced development and modification of systems documentation.
§ 11.30
Controls for open systems.
Persons who use open systems to create, modify, maintain, or transmit electronic records shall employ procedures and controls designed to ensure the authenticity, integrity, and, as appropriate, the confidentiality of electronic records from the point of their creation to the point of their receipt. Such procedures and controls shall include those identified in § 11.10, as appropriate, and additional measures such as document encryption and use of appropriate digital signature standards to ensure, as necessary under the circumstances, record authenticity, integrity, and confidentiality.
§ 11.50
Signature manifestations.
(a) Signed electronic records shall contain information associated with the signing that clearly indicates all of the following:
(1) The printed name of the signer;
(2) The date and time when the signature was executed; and
(3) The meaning (such as review, approval, responsibility, or authorship) associated with the signature.
(b) The items identified in paragraphs (a)(1), (a)(2), and (a)(3) of this section shall be subject to the same controls as for electronic records and shall be included as part of any human readable form of the electronic record (such as electronic display or printout).
§ 11.70
Signature/record linking.
Electronic signatures and handwritten signatures executed to electronic records shall be linked to their respective electronic records to ensure that the signatures cannot be excised, copied, or otherwise transferred to falsify an electronic record by ordinary means.

# Subpart C—Electronic Signatures
§ 11.100
General requirements.
(a) Each electronic signature shall be unique to one individual and shall not be reused by, or reassigned to, anyone else.
(b) Before an organization establishes, assigns, certifies, or otherwise sanctions an individual's electronic signature, or any element of such electronic signature, the organization shall verify the identity of the individual.
(c) Persons using electronic signatures shall, prior to or at the time of such use, certify to the agency that the electronic signatures in their system, used on or after August 20, 1997, are intended to be the legally binding equivalent of traditional handwritten signatures.
(1) The certification shall be signed with a traditional handwritten signature and submitted in electronic or paper form. Information on where to submit the certification can be found on FDA's web page on Letters of Non-Repudiation Agreement.
(2) Persons using electronic signatures shall, upon agency request, provide additional certification or testimony that a specific electronic signature is the legally binding equivalent of the signer's handwritten signature.
[62 FR 13464, Mar. 20, 1997, as amended at 88 FR 13018, Mar. 2, 2023]
§ 11.200
Electronic signature components and controls.
(a) Electronic signatures that are not based upon biometrics shall:
(1) Employ at least two distinct identification components such as an identification code and password.
(i) When an individual executes a series of signings during a single, continuous period of controlled system access, the first signing shall be executed using all electronic signature components; subsequent signings shall be executed using at least one electronic signature component that is only executable by, and designed to be used only by, the individual.
(ii) When an individual executes one or more signings not performed during a single, continuous period of controlled system access, each signing
shall be executed using all of the electronic signature components.
(2) Be used only by their genuine owners; and
(3) Be administered and executed to ensure that attempted use of an individual's electronic signature by anyone other than its genuine owner requires collaboration of two or more individuals.
(b) Electronic signatures based upon biometrics shall be designed to ensure that they cannot be used by anyone other than their genuine owners.
§ 11.300
Controls for identification codes/passwords.
Persons who use electronic signatures based upon use of identification codes in combination with passwords shall employ controls to ensure their security and integrity. Such controls shall include:
(a) Maintaining the uniqueness of each combined identification code and password, such that no two individuals have the same combination of identification code and password.
(b) Ensuring that identification code and password issuances are periodically checked, recalled, or revised (e.g., to cover such events as password aging).
(c) Following loss management procedures to electronically deauthorize lost, stolen, missing, or otherwise potentially compromised tokens, cards, and other devices that bear or generate identification code or password information, and to issue temporary or permanent replacements using suitable, rigorous controls.
(d) Use of transaction safeguards to prevent unauthorized use of passwords and/or identification codes, and to detect and report in an immediate and urgent manner any attempts at their unauthorized use to the system security unit, and, as appropriate, to organizational management.
(e) Initial and periodic testing of devices, such as tokens or cards, that bear or generate identification code or password information to ensure that they function properly and have not been altered in an unauthorized manner.

Scope.
The procedures in this part apply when—
(a) A person has a right to an opportunity for a hearing under the laws specified in § 10.50; or
(b) The Commissioner concludes that it is in the public interest to hold a formal evidentiary public hearing on any matter before FDA.

# Subpart B—Initiation of Proceedings
§ 12.20
Initiation of a hearing involving the issuance, amendment, or revocation of a regulation.
(a) A proceeding under section 409(f), 502(n), 512(n)(5), 701(e), or 721(d) of the act or section 4 or 5 of the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act may be initiated—
(1) By the Commissioner on the Commissioner's own initiative, e.g., as provided in § 170.15 for food additives; or
(2) By a petition—
(i) In the form specified elsewhere in this chapter, e.g., the form for a color additive petition in § 71.1; or
(ii) If no form is specified, by a petition under § 10.30.
(b) If the Commissioner receives a petition under paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the Commissioner will—
(1) If it involves any matter subject to section 701(e) of the act or section 4 or 5 of the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act, and meets the requirements for filing, follow the provisions of § 10.40 (b) through (f);
(2) If it involves a color additive or food additive, and meets the requirements for filing in §§ 71.1 and 71.2, or in §§ 171.1, 171.6, 171.7, and 171.100, publish a notice of filing of the petition within 30 days after the petition is filed instead of a notice of proposed rulemaking.
(c) [Reserved]
(d) The notice promulgating the regulation will describe how to submit objections and requests for hearing.
(e) On or before the 30th day after the date of publication of a final regulation, or of a notice withdrawing a proposal initiated by a petition under § 10.25(a), a person may submit to the Commissioner written objections and a request for a hearing. The 30-day period may not be extended except that additional information supporting an objection may be received after 30 days upon a showing of inadvertent omission and hardship, and if review of the objection and request for hearing will not thereby be impeded. If, after a final color additive regulation is published, a petition or proposal relating to the regulation is referred to an advisory committee in accordance with section 721(b)(5)(C) of the act, objections and requests for a hearing may be submitted on or before the 30th day after the date on which the order confirming or modifying the Commissioner's previous order is published.
[44 FR 22339, Apr. 13, 1979, as amended at 64 FR 399, Jan. 5, 1999]
§ 12.21
Initiation of a hearing involving the issuance, amendment, or revocation of an order.
(a) A proceeding under section 505 (d) or (e), 512 (d), (e), (m) (3) or (4), of section 515(g)(1) of the act, or section

[44 FR 22339, Apr. 13, 1979, as amended at 47 FR 25734, June 15, 1982; 54 FR 9035, Mar. 3, 1989; 85 FR 72906, Nov. 16, 2020]
§ 12.22
Filing objections and requests for a hearing on a regulation or order.
(a) Objections and requests for a hearing under § 12.20(d) must be submitted to the Dockets Management Staff and will be accepted for filing if they meet the following conditions:
(1) They are submitted within the time specified in § 12.20(e).
(2) Each objection is separately numbered.
(3) Each objection specifies with particularity the provision of the regulation or proposed order objected to.
(4) Each objection on which a hearing is requested specifically so states. Failure to request a hearing on an objection constitutes a waiver of the right to a hearing on that objection.
(5) Each objection for which a hearing is requested includes a detailed description and analysis of the factual information to be presented in support of the objection. Failure to include a description and analysis for an objection constitutes a waiver of the right to a hearing on that objection. The description and analysis may be used only for the purpose of determining whether a hearing has been justified under § 12.24, and do not limit the evidence that may be presented if a hearing is granted.
(i) A copy of any report, article, survey, or other written document relied upon must be submitted, except if the document is—
(
a
) An FDA document that is routinely publicly available; or
(
b
) A recognized medical or scientific textbook that is readily available to the agency.
(ii) A summary of the nondocumentary testimony to be presented by any witnesses relied upon must be submitted.
(b) Requests for hearing submitted under § 12.21 will be submitted to the Dockets Management Staff and will be accepted for filing if they meet the following conditions:
(1) They are submitted on or before the 30th day after the date of publication of the notice of opportunity for hearing.
(2) They comply with §§ 314.200, 514.200, or 601.7(a).
(c) If an objection or request for a public hearing fails to meet the requirements of this section and the deficiency becomes known to the Dockets Management Staff, the Dockets Management Staff shall return it with a copy of the applicable regulations, indicating those provisions not complied with. A deficient objection or request for a hearing may be supplemented and subsequently filed if submitted within the 30-day time period specified in § 12.20(e) or § 12.21(b).
(d) If another person objects to a regulation issued in response to a petition submitted under § 12.20(a)(2), the petitioner may submit a written reply to the Dockets Management Staff.
[44 FR 22339, Apr. 13, 1979, as amended at 54 FR 9035, Mar. 3, 1989; 64 FR 69190, Dec. 10, 1999]
§ 12.23
Notice of filing of objections.
As soon as practicable after the expiration of the time for filing objections to and requests for hearing on agency action involving the issuance, amendment, or revocation of a regulation under sections 502(n), 701(e), or 721(d) of the act or sections 4 or 5 of the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act, the Commissioner shall publish a notice in the
Federal Register
specifying those parts of the regulation that have been stayed by the filing of proper objections and, if no objections have been filed, stating that fact. The notice does not constitute a determination that a hearing is justified on any objections or requests for hearing that have been filed. When to do so will cause no undue delay, the notice required by this section may be combined with the notices described in §§ 12.28 and 12.35.
§ 12.24
Ruling on objections and requests for hearing.
(a) As soon as possible the Commissioner will review all objections and requests for hearing filed under § 12.22 and determine—
(1) Whether the regulation should be modified or revoked under § 12.26;
(2) Whether a hearing has been justified; and
(3) Whether, if requested, a hearing before a Public Board of Inquiry under part 13 or before a public advisory committee under part 14 or before the Commissioner under part 15 has been justified.
(b) A request for a hearing will be granted if the material submitted shows the following:
(1) There is a genuine and substantial issue of fact for resolution at a hearing. A hearing will not be granted on issues of policy or law.
(2) The factual issue can be resolved by available and specifically identified reliable evidence. A hearing will not be granted on the basis of mere allegations or denials or general descriptions of positions and contentions.
(3) The data and information submitted, if established at a hearing, would be adequate to justify resolution of the factual issue in the way sought by the person. A hearing will be denied if the Commissioner concludes that the data and information submitted are insufficient to justify the factual determination urged, even if accurate.
(4) Resolution of the factual issue in the way sought by the person is adequate to justify the action requested. A hearing will not be granted on factual issues that are not determinative with respect to the action requested, e.g., if the Commissioner concludes that the action would be the same even if the factual issue were resolved in the way sought, or if a request is made that a final regulation include a provision not reasonably encompassed by the proposal. A hearing will be granted upon proper objection and request when a food standard or other regulation is shown to have the effect of excluding or otherwise affecting a product or ingredient.
(5) The action requested is not inconsistent with any provision in the act or any regulation in this chapter particularizing statutory standards. The proper procedure in those circumstances is for the person requesting the hearing to petition for an amendment or waiver of the regulation involved.
(6) The requirements in other applicable regulations, e.g., §§ 10.20, 12.21, 12.22, 314.200, 514.200, and 601.7(a), and in the notice promulgating the final regulation or the notice of opportunity for hearing are met.
(c) In making the determination in paragraph (a) of this section, the Commissioner may use any of the optional procedures specified in § 10.30(h) or in other applicable regulations, e.g., §§ 314.200, 514.200, and 601.7(a).
(d) If it is uncertain whether a hearing has been justified under the principles in paragraph (b) of this section, and the Commissioner concludes that summary decision against the person requesting a hearing should be considered, the Commissioner may serve upon the person by registered mail a proposed order denying a hearing. The person has 30 days after receipt of the proposed order to demonstrate that the submission justifies a hearing.
[44 FR 22339, Apr. 13, 1979, as amended at 54 FR 9035, Mar. 3, 1989; 64 FR 399, Jan. 5, 1999]
§ 12.26
Modification or revocation of regulation or order.
If the Commissioner determines upon review of an objection or request for
hearing that the regulation or order should be modified or revoked, the Commissioner will promptly take such action by notice in the
Federal Register.
Further objections to or requests for hearing on the modification or revocation may be submitted under §§ 12.20 through 12.22 but no further issue may be taken with other provisions in the regulation or order. Objections and requests for hearing that are not affected by the modification or revocation will remain on file and be acted upon in due course.
§ 12.28
Denial of hearing in whole or in part.
If the Commissioner determines upon review of the objections or requests for hearing that a hearing is not justified, in whole or in part, a notice of the determination will be published.
(a) The notice will state whether the hearing is denied in whole or in part. If the hearing is denied in part, the notice will be combined with the notice of hearing required by § 12.35, and will specify the objections and requests for hearing that have been granted and denied.
(1) Any denial will be explained. A denial based on an analysis of the information submitted to justify a hearing will explain the inadequacy of the information.
(2) The notice will confirm or modify or stay the effective date of the regulation or order involved.
(b) The record of the administrative proceeding relating to denial of a public hearing in whole or in part on an objection or request for hearing consists of the following:
(1) If the proceeding involves a regulation—
(i) The documents specified in § 10.40(g);
(ii) The objections and requests for hearing filed by the Dockets Management Staff;
(iii) If the proceeding involves a color additive regulation referred to an advisory committee in accordance with section 721(b)(5)(C) of the act, the committee's report and the record of the committee's proceeding; and
(iv) The notice denying a formal evidentiary public hearing.
(2) If the proceeding involves an order—
(i) The notice of opportunity for hearing;
(ii) The requests for hearing filed by the Dockets Management Staff;
(iii) The transcripts, minutes of meetings, reports,
Federal Register
notices, and other documents constituting the record of any of the optional procedures specified in § 12.24(c) used by the Commissioner, but not the transcript of a closed portion of a public advisory committee meeting; and
(iv) The notice denying the hearing.
(c) The record specified in paragraph (b) of this section is the exclusive record for the Commissioner's decision on the complete or partial denial of a hearing. The record of the proceeding will be closed as of the date of the Commissioner's decision unless another date is specified. A person who requested and was denied a hearing may submit a petition for reconsideration under § 10.33 or a petition for stay of action under § 10.35. A person who wishes to rely upon information or views not included in the administrative record shall submit them to the Commissioner with a petition under § 10.25(a) to modify the final regulation or order.
(d) Denial of a request for a hearing in whole or in part is final agency action reviewable in the courts, under the statutory provisions governing the matter involved, as of the date of publication of the denial in the
Federal Register.
(1) Before requesting a court for a stay of action pending review, a person shall first submit a petition for a stay of action under § 10.35.
(2) Under 28 U.S.C. 2112(a), FDA will request consolidation of all petitions on a particular matter.
(3) The time for filing a petition for judicial review of a denial of a hearing on an objection or issue begins on the date the denial is published in the
Federal Register,
(i) When an objection or issues relates to a regulation, if a hearing is denied on all objections and issues concerning a part of the proposal the effectiveness of which has not been deferred pending a hearing on other parts of the proposal; or (ii) when an issue relates to an order, if a hearing is
denied on all issues relating to a particular new drug application, new animal drug application, device premarket approval application or product development protocol, or biologics license. The failure to file a petition for judicial review within the period established in the statutory provision governing the matter involved constitutes a waiver of the right to judicial review of the objection or issue, regardless whether a hearing has been granted on other objections and issues.
§ 12.30
Judicial review after waiver of hearing on a regulation.
(a) A person with a right to submit objections and a request for hearing under § 12.20(d) may submit objections and waive the right to a hearing. The waiver may be either an explicit statement, or a failure to request a hearing, as provided in 12.22(a)(4).
(b) If a person waives the right to a hearing, the Commissioner will rule upon the person's objections under §§ 12.24 through 12.28. As a matter of discretion, the Commissioner may also order a hearing on the matter under any of the provisions of this part.
(c) If the Commissioner rules adversely on a person's objection, the person may petition for judicial review in a U.S. Court of Appeals under the act.
(1) The record for judicial review is the record designated in § 12.28(b)(1).
(2) The time for filing a petition for judicial review begins as of the date of publication of the Commissioner's ruling on the objections.
§ 12.32
Request for alternative form of hearing.
(a) A person with a right to request a hearing may waive that right and request one of the following alternatives:
(1) A hearing before a Public Board of Inquiry under part 13.
(2) A hearing before a public advisory committee under part 14.
(3) A hearing before the Commissioner under part 15.
(b) The request—
(1) May be on the person's own initiative or at the suggestion of the Commissioner.
(2) Must be submitted in the form of a citizen petition under § 10.30 before publication of a notice of hearing under § 12.35 or a denial of hearing under § 12.28; and
(3) Must be—
(i) In lieu of a request for a hearing under this part; or
(ii) If submitted after or with a request for hearing, in the form of a waiver of the right to request a hearing conditioned on an alternative form of hearing. Upon acceptance by the Commissioner, the waiver becomes binding and may be withdrawn only by waiving any right to any form of hearing unless the Commissioner determines otherwise.
(c) When more than one person requests and justifies a hearing under this part, an alternative form of hearing may by used only if all the persons concur and waive their right to request a hearing under this part.
(d) The Commissioner will determine whether an alternative form of hearing should be used, and if so, which alternative is acceptable, after considering the requests submitted and the appropriateness of the alternatives for the issues raised in the objections. The Commissioner's acceptance is binding unless, for good cause, the Commissioner determines otherwise.
(e) The Commissioner will publish a notice of an alternative form of hearing setting forth the following information:
(1) The regulation or order that is the subject of the hearing.
(2) A statement specifying any part of the regulation or order that has been stayed by operation of law or in the Commissioner's discretion.
(3) The time, date, and place of the hearing, or a statment that such information will be contained in a later notice.
(4) The parties to the hearing.
(5) The issues at the hearing. The statement of issues determines the scope of the hearing.
(6) If the hearing will be conducted by a Public Board of Inquiry, the time within which—
(i) The parties should submit nominees for the Board under § 13.10(b);
(ii) A notice of participation under § 12.45 should be filed; and
(iii) Participants should submit written information under § 13.25. The notice will list the contents of the portions of the administrative record relevant to the issues at the hearing before the Board. The portions listed will be placed on public display in the office of the Dockets Management Staff before the notice is published. Additional copies of material already submitted under § 13.25 need not be included with any later submissions.
(f)(1) The decision of a hearing before a Public Board of Inquiry or a public advisory committee under this section has legal status of and will be handled as an initial decision under § 12.120.
(2) The decision of a public hearing before the Commissioner under this section will be issued as a final order. The final order will have the same content as an initial decision, as specified in § 12.120 (b) and (c).

[44 FR 22339, Apr. 13, 1979, as amended at 46 FR 8456, Jan. 27, 1981; 59 FR 14364, Mar. 28, 1994; 68 FR 24879, May 9, 2003]
§ 12.50
Advice on public participation in hearings.
(a)
Designated agency contact.
All inquiries from the public about scheduling, location, and general procedures should be addressed to the Deputy Commissioner for Policy (HF-22), Food and Drug Administration, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857, or telephone 301-443-3480. The staff of the Associate Commissioner for Regulatory Affairs will attempt to respond promptly to all inquiries from members of the public, as well as to simple requests for information from participants in hearings.
(b)
Hearing schedule changes.
Requests by hearing participants for changes in the schedule of a hearing or for filing documents, briefs, or other pleadings should be made in writing directly to the Administrative Law Judge (HF-3), Food and Drug Administration, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857.
(c)
Legal advice to individuals.
FDA does not have the resources to provide legal advice to members of the public concerning participation in hearings. Furthermore, to do so would compromise the independence of the Commissioner's office and invite charges of improper interference in the hearing process. Accordingly, the Deputy Commissioner for Policy (HF-22) will not answer questions about the strengths or weaknesses of a party's position at a hearing, litigation strategy, or similar matters.
(d)
Role of the office of the Chief Counsel.
Under no circumstances will the office of the Chief Counsel of FDA directly provide advice about a hearing to any person who is participating or may participate in the hearing. In every hearing, certain attorneys in the office are designated to represent the center or centers whose action is the subject of the hearing. Other members of the office, including ordinarily the Chief Counsel, are designated to advise the Commissioner on a final decision in the matter. It is not compatible with these functions, nor would it be professionally responsible, for the attorneys in the office of the Chief Counsel also to advise other participants in a hearing, or for any attorney who may be called on to advise the Commissioner to respond to inquiries from other participants in the hearing, for such participants may be urging views contrary to those of the center involved or to what may ultimately be the final conclusions of the Commissioner. Accordingly, members of the office of the Chief Counsel, other than the attorneys responsible for representing the center whose action is the subject of the hearing, will not answer questions about the hearing from any participant or potential participant.
(e)
Communication between participants and attorneys.
Participants in a hearing may communicate with the attorneys responsible for representing the center whose action is the subject of the hearing, in the same way that they may communicate with counsel for any other party in interest about the presentation of matters at the hearing. It would be inappropriate to bar discussion of such matters as stipulations of fact, joint presentation of witnesses, or possible settlement of hearing issues. Members of the public, including participants at hearings, are advised, however, that all such communications, including those by telephone, will be recorded in memoranda that can be filed with the Dockets Management Staff.
[44 FR 22329, Apr. 13, 1979, as amended at 50 FR 8994, Mar. 6, 1985; 54 FR 9035, Mar. 3, 1989; 58 FR 17096, Apr. 1, 1993]

Otherwise, only one copy is necessary. To determine compliance with filing deadlines in a hearing, a submission is considered submitted on the date it is actually received by Dockets Management Staff.

(b) The person making a submission shall serve copies of it on the other participants. Submissions of documentary data and information are not required to be served on each participant, but any accompanying transmittal letter, pleading, summary, statement of position, certification under paragraph (d) of this section, or similar document must be served on each participant.
(c) Service is accomplished by mailing a submission to the address shown in the notice of participation or by personal delivery.
(d) All submissions are to be accompanied by a certificate of service, or a statement that service is not required.

(b) The petition will be in the form specified in § 10.30 except that the heading will be “Request to Participate in Forma Pauperis, Docket No. ____.” Filing and service requirements for the petition are described in paragraph (c) of this section, whether or not the petition is granted. The petition must demonstrate that either: (1) The person is indigent and a strong public interest justifies participation, or (2) the person's participation is in the public interest because it can be considered of primary benefit to the general public.
(c) The Commissioner may grant or deny the petition. If the petition is granted, the participant need file only one copy of each submission with the Dockets Management Staff. TheDockets Management Staff will make sufficient additional copies for the administrative record, and serve a copy on each other participant.
§ 12.83
Advisory opinions.
Before or during a hearing, a person may, under § 10.85, request the Commissioner for an advisory opinion on whether any regulation or order under consideration in the proceeding applies to a specific situation.
§ 12.85
Disclosure of data and information by the participants.
(a) Before the notice of hearing is published under § 12.35, the director of the center responsible for the matters involved in the hearing shall submit the following to the Dockets Management Staff:
(1) The relevant portions of the administrative record of the proceeding. Portions of the administrative record not relevant to the issues in the hearing are not part of the administrative record.
(2) All documents in the director's files containing factual information, whether favorable or unfavorable to the director's position, which relate to the issues involved in the hearing.
Files
means the principal files in the center in which documents relating to the issues in the hearing are ordinarily kept, e.g., the food additive master file and the food additive petition in the case of issues concerning a food additive, or the new drug application in the case of issues concerning a new drug. Internal memoranda reflecting the deliberative process, and attorney work product and material prepared specifically for use in connection with the hearing, are not required to be submitted.
(3) All other documentary data and information relied upon.
(4) A narrative position statement on the factual issues in the notice of hearing and the type of supporting evidence the director intends to introduce.
(5) A signed statement that, to the director's best knowledge and belief, the submission complies with this section.
(b) Within 60 days of the publication of the notice of hearing or, if no participant will be prejudiced, within another period of time set by the presiding officer, each participant shall submit to the Dockets Management Staff all data and information specified in paragraph (a)(2) through (5) of this section, and any objections that the administrative record filed under paragraph (a)(1) of this section is incomplete. With respect to the data and information specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, participants shall exercise reasonable diligence in identifying documents in files comparable to those described in that paragraph.
(c) Submissions required by paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section may be supplemented later in the proceeding, with the approval of the presiding officer, upon a showing that the material contained in the supplement was not reasonably known or available when the submission was made or that the relevance of the material contained in the supplement could not reasonably have been forseen.
(d) A participant's failure to comply substantially and in good faith with this section constitutes a waiver of the
right to participate further in the hearing; failure of a party to comply constitutes a waiver of the right to a hearing.
(e) Participants may reference each other's submissions. To reduce duplicative submissions, participants are encouraged to exchange and consolidate lists of documentary evidence. If a particular document is bulky or in limited supply and cannot reasonably be reproduced, and it constitutes relevant evidence, the presiding officer may authorize submission of a reduced number of copies.
(f) The presiding officer will rule on questions relating to this section.
[44 FR 22339, Apr. 13, 1979, as amended at 54 FR 9035, Mar. 3, 1989]
§ 12.87
Purpose; oral and written testimony; burden of proof.
(a) The objective of a formal evidentiary hearing is the fair determination of relevant facts consistent with the right of all interested persons to participate and the public interest in promptly settling controversial matters affecting the public health and welfare.
(b) Accordingly, the evidence at a hearing is to be developed to the maximum extent through written submissions, including written direct testimony, which may be in narrative or in question-and-answer form.
(1) In a hearing, the issues may have general applicability and depend on general facts that do not concern particular action of a specific party, e.g., the safety or effectiveness of a class of drug products, the safety of a food or color additive, or a definition and standard of identity for a food; or the issues may have specific applicability to past action and depend upon particular facts concerning only that party, e.g., the applicability of a grandfather clause to a particular brand of a drug or the failure of a particular manufacturer to meet required manufacturing and processing specifications or other general standards.
(i) If the proceeding involves general issues, direct testimony will be submitted in writing, except on a showing that written direct testimony is insufficient for a full and true disclosure of relevant facts and that the participant will be prejudiced if unable to present oral direct testimony. If the proceeding involves particular issues, each party may determine whether, and the extent to which, each wishes to present direct testimony orally or in writing.
(ii) Oral cross-examination of witnesses will be permitted if it appears that alternative means of developing the evidence are insufficient for a full and true disclosure of the facts and that the party requesting oral cross-examination will be prejudiced by denial of the request or that oral cross-examination is the most effective and efficient means to clarify the matters at issue.
(2) Witnesses shall give testimony under oath.
(c) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, in a hearing involving issuing, amending, or revoking a regulation or order, the originator of the proposal or petition or of any significant modification will be, within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. 556(d), the proponent of the regulation or order, and will have the burden of proof. A participant who proposes to substitute a new provision for a provision objected to has the burden of proof in relation to the new provision.
(d) At a hearing involving issuing, amending, or revoking a regulation or order relating to the safety or effectiveness of a drug, device, food additive, or color additive, the participant who is contending that the product is safe or effective or both and who is requesting approval or contesting withdrawal of approval has the burden of proof in establishing safety or effectiveness or both and thus the right to approval. The burden of proof remains on that participant in an amendment or revocation proceeding.
[44 FR 22339, Apr. 13, 1979, as amended at 64 FR 399, Jan. 5, 1999]
§ 12.89
Participation of nonparties.
(a) A nonparty participant may—
(1) Attend all conferences (including the prehearing conference), oral proceedings, and arguments;
(2) Submit written testimony and documentary evidence for inclusion in the record;
(3) File written objections, briefs, and other pleadings; and
(4) Present oral argument.
(b) A nonparty participant may not—
(1) Submit written interrogatories; and
(2) Conduct cross-examination.
(c) A person whose petition is the subject of the hearing has the same right as a party.
(d) A nonparty participant will be permitted additional rights if the presiding officer concludes that the participant's interests would not be adequately protected otherwise or that broader participation is required for a full and true disclosure of the facts, but the rights of a nonparty participant may not exceed the rights of a party.
[44 FR 22339, Apr. 13, 1979, as amended at 48 FR 51770, Nov. 14, 1983]
§ 12.90
Conduct at oral hearings or conferences.
All participants in a hearing will conduct themselves with dignity and observe judicial standards of practice and ethics. They may not indulge in personal attacks, unseemly wrangling, or intemperate accusations or characterizations. Representatives of parties shall, to the extent possible, restrain clients from improprieties in connection with any proceeding. Disrespectful, disorderly, or contumacious language or conduct, refusal to comply with directions, use of dilatory tactics, or refusal to adhere to reasonable standards of orderly and ethical conduct during any hearing, constitute grounds for immediate exclusion from the proceeding by the presiding officer.
§ 12.91
Time and place of prehearing conference.
A prehearing conference will commence at the date, time, and place announced in the notice of hearing, or in a later notice, or as specified by the presiding officer in a notice modifying a prior notice. At that conference the presiding officer will establish the methods and procedures to be used in developing the evidence, determine reasonable time periods for the conduct of the hearing, and designate the times and places for the production of witnesses for direct and cross-examination if leave to conduct oral examination is granted on any issue, as far as practicable at that time.
§ 12.92
Prehearing conference procedure.
(a) Participants in a hearing are to appear at the prehearing conference prepared to discuss and resolve all matters specified in paragraph (b) of this section.
(1) To expedite the hearing, participants are encouraged to prepare in advance for the prehearing conference. Participants should cooperate with each other, and request information and begin preparation of testimony at the earliest possible time. Failure of a participant to appear at the prehearing conference or to raise matters that could reasonably be anticipated and resolved at that time will not delay the progress of the hearing, and constitutes a waiver of the rights of the participant regarding such matters as objections to the agreements reached, actions taken, or rulings issued by the presiding officer and may be grounds for striking the participation under § 12.45.
(2) Participants shall bring to the prehearing conference the following specific information, which will be filed with the Dockets Management Staff under § 12.80:
(i) Any additional information to supplement the submission filed under § 12.85, which may be filed if approved under § 12.85(c).
(ii) A list of all witnesses whose testimony will be offered, orally or in writing, at the hearing, with a full curriculum vitae for each. Additional witnesses may later be identified, with the approval of the presiding officer, on a showing that the witness was not reasonably available at the time of the prehearing conference or the relevance of the witness' views could not reasonably have been foreseen at that time.
(iii) All prior written statements including articles and any written statement signed or adopted, or a recording or transcription of an oral statement made, by persons identified as witnesses if—
(
a
) The statement is available without making request of the witness or any other person;
(
b
) The statement relates to the subject matter of the witness' testimony; and
(
c
) The statement either was made before the time the person agreed to become a witness or has been made publicly available by the person.
(b) The presiding officer will conduct a prehearing conference for the following purposes:
(1) To determine the areas of factual disagreement to be considered at the hearing. The presiding officer may hold conferences off the record in an effort to reach agreement on disputed factual questions.
(2) To identify the most appropriate techniques for developing evidence on issues in controversy and the manner and sequence in which they will be used, including, where oral examination is to be conducted, the sequence in which witnesses will be produced for, and the time and place of, oral examination. The presiding officer may consider—
(i) Submission of narrative statements of position on factual issues in controversy;
(ii) Submission of evidence or identification of previously submitted evidence to support such statements, such as affidavits, verified statements of fact, data, studies, and reports;
(iii) Exchange of written interrogatories directed to particular witnesses;
(iv) Written requests for the production of additional documentation, data, or other relevant information;
(v) Submission of written questions to be asked by the presiding officer of a specific witness; and
(vi) Identification of facts for which oral examination and/or cross-examination is appropriate.
(3) To group participants with substantially like interests for presenting evidence, making motions and objections, including motions for summary decision, filing briefs, and presenting oral argument.
(4) To hear and rule on objections to admitting into evidence information submitted under § 12.85.
(5) To obtain stipulations and admissions of facts.
(6) To take other action that may expedite the hearing.
(c) The presiding officer shall issue, orally or in writing, a prehearing order reciting the actions taken at the prehearing conference and setting forth the schedule for the hearing. The order will control the subsequent course of the hearing unless modified by the presiding officer for good cause.
§ 12.93
Summary decisions.
(a) After the hearing commences, a participant may move, with or without supporting affidavits, for a summary decision on any issue in the hearing. Any other participant may, within 10 days after service of the motion, which time may be extended for an additional 10 days for good cause, serve opposing affidavits or countermove for summary decision. The presiding officer may set the matter for argument and call for the submission of briefs.
(b) The presiding officer will grant the motion if the objections, requests for hearing, other pleadings, affidavits, and other material filed in connection with the hearing, or matters officially noticed, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that a participant is entitled to summary decision.
(c) Affidavits should set forth facts that would be admissible in evidence and show affirmatively that the affiant is competent to testify to the matters stated. When a properly supported motion for summary decision is made, a participant opposing the motion may not rest upon mere allegations or denials or general descriptions of positions and contentions; affidavits or other responses must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue of fact for the hearing.
(d) Should it appear from the affidavits of a participant opposing the motion that for sound reasons stated, facts essential to justify the opposition cannot be presented by affidavit, the presiding officer may deny the motion for summary decision, order a continuance to permit affidavits or additional evidence to be obtained, or issue other just order.
(e) If on motion under this section a summary decision is not rendered upon the whole case or for all the relief asked. and evidentiary facts need to be developed, the presiding officer will
issue an order specifying the facts that appear without substantial controversy and directing further evidentiary proceedings. The facts so specified will be deemed established.
(f) A participant may obtain interlocutory review by the Commissioner of a summary decision of the presiding officer.
§ 12.94
Receipt of evidence.
(a) A hearing consists of the development of evidence and the resolution of factual issues as set forth in this subpart and in the prehearing order.
(b) All orders, transcripts, written statements of position, written direct testimony, written interrogatories and responses, and any other written material submitted in the proceeding is a part of the administrative record of the hearing, and will be promptly placed on public display in the office of the Dockets Management Staff, except as provided in § 12.105.
(c) Written evidence, identified as such, is admissible unless a participant objects and the presiding officer excludes it on objection of a participant or on the presiding officer's own initiative.
(1) The presiding officer may exclude written evidence as inadmissible only if—
(i) The evidence is irrelevant, immaterial, unreliable, or repetitive;
(ii) Exclusion of part or all of the written evidence of a participant is necessary to enforce the requirements of this subpart; or
(iii) The evidence was not submitted as required by § 12.85.
(2) Items of written evidence are to be submitted as separate documents, sequentially numbered, except that a voluminous document may be submitted in the form of a cross-reference to the documents filed under § 12.85.
(3) Written evidence excluded by the presiding officer as inadmissible remains a part of the administrative record, as an offer of proof, for judicial review.
(d) Testimony, whether on direct or on cross-examination, is admissible as evidence unless a participant objects and the presiding officer excludes it.
(1) The presiding officer may exclude oral evidence as inadmissible only if—
(i) The evidence is irrelevant, immaterial, unreliable, or repetitive; or
(ii) Exclusion of part or all of the evidence is necessary to enforce the requirements of this part.
(2) If oral evidence is excluded as inadmissible, the participant may take written exception to the ruling in a brief to the Commissioner, without taking oral exception at the hearing. Upon review, the Commissioner may reopen the hearing to permit the evidence to be admitted if the Commissioner determines that its exclusion was erroneous and prejudicial.
(e) The presiding officer may schedule conferences as needed to monitor the program of the hearing, narrow and simplify the issues, and consider and rule on motions, requests, and other matters concerning the development of the evidence.
(f) The presiding officer will conduct such proceedings as are necessary for the taking of oral testimony, for the oral examination of witnesses by the presiding officer on the basis of written questions previously submitted by the parties, and for the conduct of cross-examination of witnesses by the parties. The presiding officer shall exclude irrelevant or repetitious written questions and limit oral cross-examination to prevent irrelevant or repetitious examination.
(g) The presiding officer shall order the proceedings closed for the taking of oral testimony relating to matters specified in § 10.20(j)(2)(i) (
a
) and (
b
). Such closed proceedings will be conducted in accordance with § 10.20(j)(3). Participation in closed proceedings will be limited to the witness, the witness' counsel, and Federal Government executive branch employees and special government employees. Closed proceedings will be permitted only for, and will be limited to, oral testimony directly relating to matters specified in § 10.20(j)(3).
§ 12.95
Official notice.
(a) Official notice may be taken of such matters as might be judicially noticed by the courts of the United States or of any other matter peculiarly within the general knowledge of FDA as an expert agency.
(b) If official notice is taken of a material fact not appearing in the evidence of record, a participant, on timely request, will be afforded an opportunity to show the contrary.
§ 12.96
Briefs and arguments.
(a) Promptly after the taking of evidence is completed, the presiding officer will announce a schedule for the filing of briefs. Briefs are to be filed ordinarily within 45 days of the close of the hearing. Briefs must include a statement of position on each issue, with specific and complete citations to the evidence and points of law relied on. Briefs must contain proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law.
(b) The presiding officer may, as a matter of discretion, permit oral argument after the briefs are filed.
(c) Briefs and oral argument are to refrain from disclosing specific details of written and oral testimony and documents relating to matters specified in § 10.20(j)(2)(i)(
a
) and (
b
), except as specifically authorized in a protective order issued under § 10.20(j)(3).
