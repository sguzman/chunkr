# Explanation
The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.
Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:
Title 1 through Title 16
as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27
as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41
as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50
as of October 1
The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.

# LEGAL STATUS
The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

# HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS
The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, January 1, 2025), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

# EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES
Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.

# OMB CONTROL NUMBERS
The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request.
Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.

# PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE
Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.

# “[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY
The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not dropped in error.

# INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE
What is incorporation by reference?
Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.
What is a proper incorporation by reference?
The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:
(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.
(b) The matter incorporated is adequately summarized in the preamble of the final rule and is available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.
(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?
If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or email fr.inspection@nara.gov.

# CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES
A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR
Index and Finding Aids.
This volume contains the Parallel Table of Authorities and Rules. A list of CFR titles, chapters, subchapters, and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in this volume.
An index to the text of “Title 3—The President” is carried within that volume.
The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. This index is based on a consolidation of the “Contents” entries in the daily Federal Register.
A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

# REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL
There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing in the Code of Federal Regulations.

Classification of cotton.
For purposes of subsection 15b (f) of The Act, classification of cotton is the determination of the quality of a sample in accordance with the Universal Cotton Standards (the official cotton standards of the United States) for the color grade and leaf grade of American upland cotton, and fiber property measurements such as micronaire. High Volume Instruments will determine all fiber property measurements except extraneous matter. High Volume Instrument colormeter measurements will be used for determining the official color grade. Cotton classers authorized by the Cotton and Tobacco Programs will determine the presence of extraneous matter and authorized employees of the Cotton and Tobacco Programs will determine all fiber property measurements using High Volume Instruments.
[77 FR 20504, Apr. 5, 2012]
§ 27.32
Order of classification.
All cotton for which classifications requests shall be pending shall be classified as far as practicable in the order in which proper samples thereof, ready for such classification, shall have been delivered to the Marketing Services Office, except as otherwise provided in this subpart or when the Area Director or the Director shall find that an emergency exists and shall order otherwise.
[48 FR 49211, Oct. 25, 1983]
§ 27.33
Exposing of samples for classification.
Classification shall not proceed until the samples, after being delivered to the Marketing Services Office, shall have been exposed for such length of time as in the judgment of the Area Director shall be sufficient to put them in proper condition for the purpose.
[48 FR 49211, Oct. 25, 1983]
§ 27.34
Classification procedure.
Classification shall proceed as rapidly as possible, but not when light or other conditions make uncertain the accuracy of the results to be obtained.
§ 27.35
Lower class of two samples to prevail.
In case a sample drawn from one portion of a bale is lower in class than one drawn from another portion of such bale, except as otherwise provided in this subpart, the classification of the bale shall be that of the sample showing the lower class.
§ 27.36
Classification determinations based on official standards.
All cotton shall be classified on the basis of the official cotton standards of
the United States in effect at the time of such classification.

§ 27.45
No storage of cotton for classification at disapproved place.
No cotton submitted for classification under subsection 15b(f) of the Act shall be located or stored at a place disapproved for the purpose by the Area Director or the Director on account of being unsuitable for the safekeeping or proper storage of such cotton, or on account of the failure or refusal of the custodian thereof to comply or to permit compliance with the requirements of this subpart. Notice of such disapproval shall be given in such manner as the Director may direct. Thereafter every cotton class certificate previously issued for cotton located or stored at such place shall be invalid for the delivery of such cotton on a basis grade contract, unless the cotton shall be removed under the supervision of an exchange inspection agency, or a supervisor of cotton inspection, to a place which shall be suitable for the purpose.

# Costs of Classification and Micronaire
§ 27.80
Fees; review classification, futures classification and supervision.
For services rendered by the Cotton and Tobacco Programs pursuant to this subpart, whether the cotton involved is tenderable or not, the person requesting the services shall pay fees as follows:
(a) For each calendar year, AMS will calculate the rate for services, per hour per program employee using the following formulas:
(1)
Regular rate.
The total AMS grading or classification program personnel direct pay divided by direct hours, which is then multiplied by the next year's percentage of cost of living increase, plus the benefits rate, plus the operating rate, plus the allowance for bad debt rate. If applicable, travel expenses may also be added to the cost of providing the service.
(2)
Overtime rate.
The total AMS grading or classification program personnel direct pay divided by direct hours, which is then multiplied by the next year's percentage of cost of living increase and then multiplied by 1.5 plus
the benefits rate, plus the operating rate, plus an allowance for bad debt. If applicable, travel expenses may also be added to the cost of providing the service.
(3)
Holiday rate.
The total AMS grading or classification program personnel direct pay divided by direct hours which is then multiplied by the next year's percentage of cost of living increase and then multiplied by 2, plus benefits rate, plus the operating rate, plus an allowance for bad debt. If applicable, travel expenses may also be added to the cost of providing the service.
(b) For each calendar year, based on historical costs, AMS will calculate the benefits, operating, and allowance for bad debt components of the regular, overtime and holiday rates as follows:
(1)
Benefits rate.
The total AMS grading or classification program direct benefits costs divided by the total hours (regular, overtime, and holiday) worked, which is then multiplied by the next calendar year's percentage cost of living increase. Some examples of direct benefits are health insurance, retirement, life insurance, and Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) retirement basic and matching contributions.
(2)
Operating rate.
The total AMS grading or classification program operating costs divided by total hours (regular, overtime, and holiday) worked, which is then multiplied by the percentage of inflation.
(3)
Allowance for bad debt rate.
Total AMS grading or classification program allowance for bad debt divided by total hours (regular, overtime, and holiday) worked.
(c)
Basis.
The calendar year cost of living expenses and percentage of inflation factors used in the formulas in this section are based on the most current Office of Management and Budget's Presidential Economic Assumptions.

§ 27.98
Value of grade where no sale; determination.
As provided in § 27.96, whenever no sale of a particular grade of cotton shall have been made on a given day in a particular spot market, the value of such grade in the market on that day will be determined as follows:
(a) If on such given day there shall have been in such market both a sale of any higher grade and a sale of any lower grade, the average of the declines, or advances, or decline and advance, as the case may be, of the next higher grade and the next lower grade so sold shall be deducted from, or added to, as the case may be, the value, on the last preceding business day, of the grade the value of which on such given day is sought to be ascertained.

§ 28.40
Terms defined; cotton classification.
For the purposes of classification of any cotton or of its comparison with a type or other samples, the following terms shall be construed, respectively, to mean:
(a)
Fire-damaged cotton.
In those cases where it is certain that the cotton is fire damaged, the classification record shall be marked Code 97 (Fire-Damaged Upland Cotton saw ginned) and no official color grade assigned to the sample.
(b)
Micronaire (mike) reading.
The measurement of the fiber fineness and maturity, in combination, of cotton as determined by an airflow instrument. For any cotton that has a micronaire reading of 2.6 or lower, the Classing Office will enter the micronaire reading on all classification memoranda issued for such cotton.
(c)
Extraneous matter.
Extraneous matter is any substance appearing in a cotton sample that is not discernible in the official cotton standards. Such material may consist of rough preparation, sand, dust, oil, grass, whole seeds, parts of seeds, motes, spindle twist, bark, stems, cloth and plastic.
(d)
Re-ginned cotton.
Cotton that, after having been ginned and baled, has been subjected to a ginning process and then re-baled. Responsibility for identifying cotton, which has been actually re-ginned, rests with the owner of the cotton or the owner's agent.
(e)
Repacked cotton.
Cotton that is composed of factors', brokers', or other samples, or of loose or miscellaneous lots collected and rebaled, or cotton in a bale which is composed of cotton from two or more smaller bales or parts of bales that are combined after the cotton leaves the gin.
(f)
False packed cotton.
Cotton in a bale (1) containing substances entirely foreign to cotton; (2) containing damaged cotton in the interior with or without any indication of such damage upon the exterior; (3) composed of good cotton upon the exterior and decidedly inferior cotton in the interior, in such manner as not to be detected by customary examination; or (4) containing pickings or linters worked into the bale.
(g)
Mixed-packed cotton.
Cotton in a bale which, in the sample taken therefrom, shows a difference of two or more color grades, and/or a difference of two or more color groups, or grade of the other side that is one color grade and one color group higher between the two portions of the sample. White, Light Spotted, Spotted, Tinged, and Yellow Stained shall each constitute a color group. The classification assigned will be that of the portion showing the lower color grade. The classification record for the bale will contain a code 75, to designate mixed quality.
(h)
Water-damaged cotton.
Cotton in a bale that has been penetrated by water during the baling process, causing damage to the fiber, or a bale that through exposure to the weather or by other means, while apparently dry on the exterior, has been damaged by water in the interior. If such condition can be ascertained, the classification record shall be marked Code 98 (Water-Damaged Upland Cotton saw ginned) and no official color grade will be assigned.

Amounts of fees for classification; exemption.
(a) For the classification of any cotton or samples, the person requesting the services shall pay a fee, based on the description that follows, subject to the additional fee provided by paragraph (c) of this section.
(1) For each calendar year, AMS will calculate the rate for services per hour per program employee using the following formulas:
(i)
Regular rate.
The total AMS grading or classification program personnel direct pay divided by direct hours, which is then multiplied by the next year's percentage of cost of living increase, plus the benefits rate, plus the operating rate, plus the allowance for bad debt rate. If applicable, travel expenses may also be added to the cost of providing the service.
(ii)
Overtime rate.
The total AMS grading or classification program personnel direct pay divided by direct hours, which is then multiplied by the next year's percentage of cost of living increase and then multiplied by 1.5 plus the benefits rate, plus the operating rate, plus an allowance for bad debt. If applicable, travel expenses may also be added to the cost of providing the service.
(iii)
Holiday rate.
The total AMS grading or classification program personnel direct pay divided by direct hours which is then multiplied by the next year's percentage of cost of living increase and then multiplied by 2, plus benefits rate, plus the operating rate, plus an allowance for bad debt. If applicable, travel expenses may also be added to the cost of providing the service.
(2) For each calendar year, based on historical costs, AMS will calculate the benefits, operating, and allowance for bad debt components of the regular, overtime and holiday rates as follows:
(i)
Benefits rate.
The total AMS grading or classification program direct benefits costs divided by the total hours (regular, overtime, and holiday) worked, which is then multiplied by the next calendar year's percentage cost of living increase. Some examples of direct benefits are health insurance, retirement, life insurance, and Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) retirement basic and matching contributions.
(ii)
Operating rate.
The total AMS grading or classification program operating costs divided by total hours (regular, overtime, and holiday) worked, which is then multiplied by the percentage of inflation.
(iii)
Allowance for bad debt rate.
Total AMS grading or classification program allowance for bad debt divided by total hours (regular, overtime, and holiday) worked.
(3) The calendar year cost of living expenses and percentage of inflation factors used in the formulas in this section are based on the most current Office of Management and Budget's Presidential Economic Assumptions.
(b) When a comparison is requested of any samples with a type or with other samples, the fees prescribed in paragraph (a) of this section shall apply to every sample involved, including each of the samples of which the type is composed.
(c) An additional fee based on current shipping rates shall be assessed for returning samples unless the request for service is so worded that the samples
become government property immediately after classification.
(d) For any review of classification or comparison of any cotton, the fees prescribed in paragraph (a) of this section shall apply. The additional fee prescribed in paragraph (c) of this section is not applicable to review of classification if made on the same sample as the original class or comparison.

Methods of cotton classification and comparison.
(a) The classification of foreign-growth cotton samples shall be determined by the quality of a sample in accordance with the Universal Cotton Standards (the official cotton standards of the United States) for the color grade and the leaf grade of Upland Cotton, the length of staple, and fiber property measurements such as length uniformity, strength, and micronaire. High Volume Instruments will determine all fiber property measurements except the determination of the presence of extraneous matter, special conditions and remarks. High Volume Instrument colorimeter measurements will be used for determining the official color grade. Cotton classers certified by the Cotton and Tobacco Program will determine the presence of extraneous matter, special conditions and remarks and authorized employees of the Cotton and Tobacco Program will determine all fiber property measurements using High Volume Instruments. The classification record issued by the Quality Assurance Division with respect to any cotton sample shall be deemed to be the classification record of the Department.
(b) Additional procedures and methods pertaining to the classification of foreign-growth cotton samples are outlined in §§ 28.36 through 28.40.
(c) When a comparison of such cotton samples with other actual samples or with a type is requested, the procedure and methods shall be as outlined in §§ 28.45 through 28.47.

# Source:
Sections 28.601 through 28.603 appear at 30 FR 7239, May 29, 1965, unless otherwise noted.
§ 28.601
Official cotton standards for fiber fineness and maturity.
The official cotton standards of the United States for fiber fineness and maturity shall be the measure of such qualities, in combination, provided by air flow instrument tests in terms of micronaire readings in accordance with the procedure specified in § 28.603.
§ 28.602
Terms of designations.
The fiber fineness and maturity of any cotton shall be designated by the micronaire reading obtained from an air flow instrument test for a specimen of the cotton as determined under § 28.603, e.g., 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, etc. To simplify recording, the decimal point may be omitted, and the micronaire reading recorded as 41, 42, 43, etc.
§ 28.603
Procedures for air flow tests of micronaire reading.
In determining in terms of micronaire readings, the fiber fineness and maturity, in combination, of cotton, the following procedures shall apply:
(a) Facilities and equipment shall include:
(1) Air flow instrument complete with accessories to measure the fineness and maturity, in combination, of cotton in terms of micronaire reading on the curvilinear scale adopted in September 1950 by the Department of Agriculture, or its equivalent.
(2) A suitable supply of compressed air filtered to remove moisture and other impurities.
(3) Balance or scales suitable for accurately weighing the specimens required for the particular instrument.
(4) International Calibration Cotton Standards with established micronaire reading values for calibration of the air flow instrument.
(b) The instrument shall be calibrated each day before routine testing begins, as follows:
(1) The air shall be allowed to flow through the instrument until the indicator stabilizes.
(2) Specimens from at least two of the calibration cottons shall be tested to insure proper calibration of the instrument. The instrument shall be considered in calibration if the values obtained on the test specimens agree with the established values of the calibration cottons within 0.1 micronaire reading.
(c) Testing of the cotton specimen shall be performed as follows:
(1) Approximately the same amount of cotton shall be taken from each side of the sample for a test specimen. The weight of the test specimen shall be that weight prescribed for the air flow instrument being used.
(2) The weighed specimen shall be tested in a properly calibrated instrument.
(3) The specimen shall be inserted into the specimen holder of the instrument so that the mass of fibers is well distributed within the specimen holder.
(4) The air shall then be allowed to flow through the specimen in accordance with the method of operation of the instrument.
(5) The position of the instrument indicator shall be determined to the nearest 0.1 micronaire reading when it becomes stable.
(d) The accuracy of the instrument shall be checked at least every 2 hours during operation by testing appropriate calibration cottons. If the value obtained on a specimen from the calibration cotton is outside the established limits of 0.1 micronaire reading, or when successive readings show the results to be within the established limits, but consistently high or low, the instrument and technique shall be thoroughly checked to remedy the discrepancies. Additional tests using calibration cottons shall be made until acceptable results are obtained before routine testing is resumed.

(e)
Designated market
means an auction market designated by the Secretary under section 5 of the Tobacco Inspection Act including the town or city which is the population center of the market and whose name the market bears and all of the geographical area within 5 road miles of the boundaries of said city or town as they are constituted on January 1, 1993.
Provided,
That any warehouse beyond those boundaries which received tobacco inspection and price support services during the 1992 marketing season shall continue to receive such services at the same location regardless of any prohibition contained herein:

[37 FR 7765, Apr. 20, 1972, as amended at 39 FR 3548, Jan. 28, 1974; 42 FR 17097, Mar. 31, 1977; 58 FR 21343, Apr. 21, 1993]
§ 29.2
Policy statement.
Inspection and price support services currently provided in auction marketing areas are adequate and the lack of these services is not a limiting factor to accelerated marketings or the extension of price support to producers. Consequently, the extension of inspection and price support services, without limitation even though the cost of such service is paid by the seller, would not contribute to the effectuation of the purposes of either of these services. The additional cost incident to the unlimited extension of these services would be unjustifiable and excessive in relation to the total quantity of tobacco available for market. Accordingly, inspection and price support services shall be made available on new markets at warehouses which are located beyond the geographical limitation for “designated markets” set forth in § 29.1(e), and additional sales for other than flue-cured tobacco only as hereinafter provided. With regard to flue-cured tobacco, allocation of inspection services is based on producer designation, as provided for in 7 CFR 1464.2(e)(2)(iii), see subpart G. Also, since these services shall be made available to new markets to warehouses which are located beyond the geographical limitation for “designated markets” set forth in § 29.1(e), and additional sales only as herein provided, referenda incident to market designations shall not be conducted until auction markets seeking designation have qualified for inspection and price support services as herein provided.
(a)
Reasonable inspection and price support services.
The extension of tobacco inspection and price support services to new markets to warehouses which are located beyond the geographical limitation for “designated markets” set forth in § 29.1(e), and additional sales will be conditioned upon the reasonableness of such services existing in the marketing area of the proposed new market or additional sale. Transactions in tobacco as conducted at auction markets customarily involve the sale of tobacco at a bona fide auction sale. Determination with respect to reasonableness, and consequently with respect to granting or denying additional services, will be based on evidence (1) that the proposed new market, warehouse located beyond the geographical limitation for “designated markets” set forth in § 29.1(e), or additional sale will function as a bona fide auction sale, and (2) that additional services are justifiable in relation to other market data, including the volume of tobacco produced in the area surrounding the proposed new market, warehouse located beyond the geographical limitation for “designated markets” set forth in § 29.1(e), or additional sale; the roads and road distances involved in moving tobacco to the proposed new market, warehouse located beyond the geographical limitation for “designated markets” set forth in § 29.1(e), or additional sale in relation to other tobacco marketing centers; the relative availability or congestion of all facilities for redrying and packing tobacco handled or to be handled in the proposed new market, warehouse located beyond the geographical limitation for “designated markets” set forth in § 29.1(e), or additional sale; the location of other auction markets on which tobacco produced in the marketing area of the proposed new market, warehouse located beyond the geographical limitation for “designated markets” set forth in § 29.1(e), or additional sale may be marketed; the number of tobacco growers to be affected by the proposed new market, warehouse located beyond the geographical limitation for “designated markets” set forth in § 29.1(e), or additional sale; the volume of tobacco likely to be sold in the proposed new market, warehouse located beyond the geographical limitation for “designated markets” set forth in § 29.1(e), or additional sale; the relationship of sales in the proposed new market, warehouse located beyond the geographical limitation for “designated markets” set forth in § 29.1(e), or additional sale to sales in other auction markets in the producing area for that kind of tobacco; other economic factors affecting the marketing of tobacco, by growers, in the marketing area of the proposed new market, warehouse located beyond the geographical limitation for “designated markets” set forth in § 29.1(e), or additional sale
and in the producing area for that kind of tobacco, including limitations on sales imposed by any marketing agreement and/or order, or by any other means; and also, as to flue-cured tobacco, data with regard to producer designations which shall include, but not be limited to, the markets and warehouses currently available for the producers, who would be eligible to designate the new market or, warehouse located beyond the geographical limitation for “designated markets” set forth in § 29.1(e), who already designate and who desire to designate the new market.
(b)
Order of priority.
If the Secretary finds that there are insufficient qualified tobacco inspectors available to service adequately all applicants otherwise found to be qualified for additional inspection service pursuant to this subpart for a kind of tobacco, those applicants found to be eligible for additional services on auction markets designated for mandatory inspection shall be given priority over applicants for additional inspection service on other auction markets. If it becomes necessary to determine which of several qualified applicants having an equal order of priority under the preceding sentence shall receive additional inspection and price support services, those auction sales or auction markets where the greatest number of growers needing such service may be served with the qualified inspectors shall have priority. If an application for an additional sale on a designated market is denied for lack of qualified inspectors, the Secretary, on application from such market, may temporarily suspend the requirement of inspection and certification on such market pursuant to section 5 of the Tobacco Inspection Act.
(c)
Price support services to be through warehouses.
Price support services on any auction market will be offered through tobacco auction warehouses operating in such market, and, notwithstanding any provision of this subpart, the offering of price support services through any auction warehouse located on any auction market will be conditioned upon a qualified, responsible warehouseman entering into an approved auction warehouse contract under the provisions of the applicable tobacco price support program, published at part 1464 of this title.
[37 FR 7765, Aug. 20, 1972, as amended at 42 FR 17097, Mar. 31, 1977; 46 FR 62393, Dec. 24, 1981]
§ 29.3
Procedures for filing, hearing, and determination of applications.
(a)
Time and place of filing.
Applications for the extension of tobacco inspection and price support services to new markets, to warehouses located beyond the geographical limitation for “designated markets” set forth in § 29.1(e) and to additional sales on designated markets shall be filed, in triplicate, with the Hearing Clerk not later than September 15 in the case of flue-cured tobacco, December 1 in the case of Maryland tobacco, and July 15 in the case of burley and all other kinds of tobacco. Applications should be addressed to the Hearing Clerk, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Washington, DC 20250. Applications which are not received by the Hearing Clerk on or before the foregoing cutoff date for the kind of tobacco shall be rejected as untimely filed. After denial of an application for additional inspection and price support services for a marketing season, no application from the same auction market or proposed new market shall be considered for the next consecutive marketing season, unless the application contains a statement by the applicant setting forth new facts that constitute evidence of such a substantial change in conditions since the previous hearing as the review committee as specified in paragraph (h) of this section deems would warrant such further hearing.
(b)
Form and content of application.
The application shall be in writing, shall set forth the grounds for the application and shall be signed by the applicant or applicants. If an applicant is a corporation, the application shall be executed by a responsible officer of such corporation. The application shall include a statement of the name, address and form of business organization of each party to the application and the location of the proposed new market or additional sale.
(c)
Hearings on applications.
Following the closing date for filing applications
for each kind of tobacco, a hearing or hearings shall be held on the applications, if any, filed for additional inspection and price support services for the kind of tobacco in question. Such hearing or hearings shall be scheduled to begin within 60 days following the closing date for such applications. Notice of hearing shall be issued by the Secretary, filed with the Hearing Clerk, and published in the
Federal Register,
and a copy shall be mailed by the Hearing Clerk to each applicant. Such publication and mailing shall be not less than 5 days prior to the opening of the hearing.
(d)
Hearing officer.
A hearing officer shall preside over each such hearing. The hearing officer shall determine the order of procedure at the hearing, shall have power to administer oaths and affirmations, to rule on and admit evidence, and, following the opening of the hearing, to recess the hearing to such other times and places as he deems desirable or necessary.
(e)
Scope of hearing and burden of proof.
Each applicant shall have the burden of presenting evidence relative to the factors specified in § 29.2(a).
(f)
Record and evidence.
The proceedings at each such hearing shall be transcribed verbatim. All oral testimony shall be under oath or affirmation. All documentary exhibits shall be submitted in triplicate by the person offering the same. The Hearing Officer shall, insofar as possible, exclude testimony and exhibits which are irrelevant, immaterial, or not of the sort upon which responsible persons are accustomed to rely. Cross-examination shall be allowed only to the extent that the Hearing Officer in his discretion deems it desirable or necessary to develop the material facts.
(g)
Briefs.
If requested at the hearing, the presiding officer shall fix a time, not to exceed 20 days from the close of the hearing, within which interested persons may mail briefs to the Hearing Clerk.
(h)
Certification and referral.
As soon as practicable following the close of the hearing, the Hearing Officer shall certify the transcript of the proceedings at the hearing together with all exhibits and shall transmit the same to the Hearing Clerk for referral to a review committee comprised of the Administrator, Agricultural Marketing Service, the Administrator, Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service, and a representative of the Office of the Secretary to be designated by the Secretary.
(i)
Recommended action.
The review committee shall review and consider the applications, hearing record, including exhibits, and all other available information and data relating to applications for each kind of tobacco and shall submit a recommendation thereon to the Secretary.
(j)
Final decision.
The Secretary shall issue the decision on each application and such decision shall be final:
Provided,
That any determination that additional services will be provided may be reconsidered and may be vacated if it is subsequently found that any material fact upon which such determination was based was materially erroneous or false, or that the new market or additional sale in question is not functioning as a bona fide auction sale. Such decision shall be filed with the Hearing Clerk who shall mail a true copy thereof, by certified mail, to the applicant.

(b) Inspecting and certifying tobacco at receiving stations under the Appropriations Act at the time the tobacco is delivered for sale.
[67 FR 36080, May 23, 2002]
§ 29.72
Where mandatory inspection is required.
(a)
Auction.
All tobacco offered for sale at auction on a market designated in accordance with the Act and § 29.73 shall be inspected and certificated under the Act upon the date specified by the Secretary in public notice of such designation, and thereafter, except when the requirement of such inspection and certification is temporarily suspended by the Deputy Administrator in accordance with the Act and the regulations in this subpart.
(b)
Other.
Tobacco of the kinds specified below offered for sale by the producers thereof at receiving stations shall be inspected and certificated under the Appropriations Act at the time of delivery and prior to change of ownership.

§ 29.73
Designation of markets; termination of designation.
An auction market where tobacco bought or sold thereon at auction or the products customarily manufactured therefrom move in commerce may be designated under the Act by the Secretary after the Director has advised the Secretary that two-thirds of the growers voting in the referendum held in accordance with § 29.74 favored the designation of such market. When a market is designated by the Secretary, he shall give public notice of the fact and in such public notice he shall specify the date on which the requirement of inspection and certification of tobacco sold at auction on such market shall become effective. The Director may temporarily suspend the requirement of inspection and certification on a designated market when it is found impracticable to provide such services because competent inspectors are not obtainable or because the quantity of tobacco available for inspection is insufficient to justify the cost of such service. A designation shall terminate automatically at the end of any two consecutive marketing seasons during which a designated market does not conduct any sales of tobacco at auction. A market whose designation is terminated under this section shall be considered as a new market, as defined in § 29.1, and any future application for services shall be filed and determined in accordance with the provisions of §§ 29.3 and 29.2.
[38 FR 27599, Oct. 5, 1973]
§ 29.74
Growers' referendum.
(a)
Method of conducting.
Any referendum held as provided in section 5 of the Act shall be conducted by the Division in accordance with this section. The Director shall determine (1) the market or group of markets to be covered by a referendum; (2) when a referendum is to be held; and (3) the period during which growers, entitled to vote therein, may cast their ballots. When a referendum is held for a group of markets, the result of such referendum may be construed to apply either individually or collectively to such markets. Before holding a referendum, the Division shall establish from the records of the collectors of internal revenue for the preceding marketing season, or in the absence of such records then from such other reliable sources of information as are available, a list showing the names of all growers
who are entitled to vote in the referendum, and from the list so established the eligibility of growers to vote in a referendum shall be determined by the Division:
Provided,
That if a grower, whose name appears on such lists for two or more markets selling the same class of tobacco, votes in one referendum for a market selling such type, he shall not be eligible to vote in a referendum for any other market selling such type. If no growers sold tobacco at auction on a proposed new market during the preceding marketing season, then the list of growers entitled to vote in the referendum shall be comprised of the growers residing in the county where the pRoposed new market is located and in the adjacent counties.
(b)
Form of ballot.
Ballots to be used for voting in a referendum held under the Act shall be in a form approved for the purpose by the Director.
(c)
Distribution of ballots.
Ballots to be used by growers in a referendum under the act may be distributed by mail or otherwise as the Director may select. The Director may establish and publish a list of voting places for the purpose of any referendum and distribute ballots therefrom. When ballots are not mailed directly to growers who are entitled to vote, insofar as their addresses are known, the Director shall announce the voting places at which ballots can be secured, and copies of such announcement shall be given to the press and mailed, for posting and distribution, to the post offices of the market or group of markets covered by the referendum and to post offices in the vicinity of such markets or group of markets. Any explanatory statement with reference to a referendum, provisions of the Act and these regulations, or the operation and benefits of the services authorized by the act may be attached to or supplied with ballots.
(d)
Filing and tabulation of votes.
Each ballot, when filled in and signed by a grower entitled to vote in a referendum, shall be mailed or delivered by him as specified in the ballot. Persons authorized by the Director to receive votes in any referendum shall promptly file all votes received or collected by them with the Division. All ballots filed in a referendum shall be examined to verify the eligibility of the voter and the Director shall have compiled the result of the referendum and furnish the Secretary a statement showing whether or not two-thirds of the growers voting favored the designation of the market or group of markets covered by the referendum. In verifying votes, ballots which do not show the desire of the voter, or ballots which are defective or illegible, or ballots on which the signature or other identification does not correspond with the established list shall not be counted. The choice of any individual voter shall not be divulged by any official of the Division, except to the Secretary when requested. Votes, ballots, and other documents pertaining to a referendum shall be preserved in the Division for a period of 2 years from the closing date of such referendum, and may be destroyed thereafter.

§ 29.74a
Producer referenda on mandatory grading.
(a)(1)
Method of conducting.
Referenda shall be conducted among producers who were engaged in the production of the following types of tobacco harvested in the immediately preceding crop year: flue-cured tobacco, types 11, 12, 13, 14; Kentucky-Tennessee fire-cured tobacco, types 22 and 23; Virginia fire-cured tobacco, type 21; Virginia sun-cured tobacco, type 37; dark air-cured tobacco, types 35 and 36; burley tobacco, type 31; and cigar filler and binder tobacco, types 42, 43, 53, 54, and 55. A referendum will be conducted for each kind of tobacco and the results will apply to each individual kind. A producer is eligible to vote in referenda for each kind of tobacco they produce.
(2)
Farmers engaged in the production of tobacco.
For purposes of the referenda, persons engaged in the production of tobacco includes any person who is entitled to share in a crop of the tobacco or the proceeds thereof because he or she shares in the risks of production of the crop as an owner, landlord, tenant, or sharecropper (a landlord whose return from the crop is fixed regardless of the amount of the crop produced is excluded) on a farm on which such crop is planted in a workmanlike
manner for harvest: Provided, That any failure to harvest the crop because of conditions beyond the control of such person shall not affect his or her status as a person engaged in the production of the crop. In addition, persons engaged in the production of tobacco also includes each person who it is determined would have had an interest as a producer in the crop on a farm for which a farm allotment under the quota program (7 CFR part 723, subpart B) for the crop was established and no acreage of the crop was planted but an acreage of the crop was regarded as planted for history acreage purposes under the applicable Farm Service Agency commodity regulations of the Department of Agriculture.
(3)
One vote limitation.
Each person eligible to vote in a particular referendum shall be entitled to only one vote in such referendum regardless of the number of farms in which such person is interested or the number of communities, counties, or States in which farms are located in which farms such person is interested: Provided, That:
(i) The individual members of a partnership shall each be entitled to one vote, but the partnership as an entity shall not be entitled to vote;
(ii) An individual eligible voter shall be entitled to one vote even though he or she is interested in an entity (including but not limited to a corporation) which entity is also eligible to vote;
(iii) A person shall also be entitled to vote in each instance of his or her capacity as a fiduciary (including but not limited to a guardian, administrator, executor or trustee) if in such fiduciary capacity he or she is eligible to vote but the person for whom he or she acts as a fiduciary shall not be eligible to vote.
(4)
Joint and family interest.
Where several persons, such as members of a family, have participated or will participate in the production of tobacco under the same lease or cropping agreement, only the person or persons who signed the lease or agreement, or agreed to an oral lease or agreement, shall be eligible to vote. Where two or more persons have produced or will produce tobacco as joint tenants, tenants in common, or owners of community property, each such person shall be entitled to one vote if otherwise eligible. The eligibility of one spouse does not affect the eligibility of the other spouse.
(5)
Minors.
A minor shall be entitled to one vote if he or she is otherwise eligible and is 18 years of age or older when he or she votes.
(6)
Interpretation.
In the case of tobacco on a farm where no acreage of tobacco is actually planted but an acreage of the commodity is regarded as planted under applicable regulations of the Department of Agriculture, persons on the farm who it is determined would have had an interest in the commodity as a producer if an acreage of the commodity had been actually planted shall be eligible to vote in the referendum.
(b)
Referenda procedures.
See part 717 of chapter VII of this title for eligibility criteria and the procedures to be used in carrying out mandatory grading referenda. Where not inconsistent with this part, the definitions contained in parts 717, 718 and 723 of this title will govern administration of these referenda. A copy of the regulations in parts 717, 718, and 723 of this title, a referendum ballot, and voting procedures are available for review in any USDA Service Center.

Accessibility of tobacco.
(a) All tobacco subject to mandatory inspection shall be made readily accessible for inspection.
(b)(1) Each warehouse operator shall block off in his warehouse adequate space for each basket of flue-cured tobacco offered for sale on the auction market, and shall prominently number each 10th basket space. The blocking and numbering arrangement shall follow the order of sale; that is, down one row and back on the adjacent row.
(2) Each warehouse shall display a plainly visible sign with the total number of baskets of flue-cured tobacco allotted to be sold each day. Each warehouse operator shall designate to the inspector the number of the starting space for each day's sale and grading will begin at this designated space. All spaces, whether empty or full, shall be
counted. No tobacco will be graded beyond the numbered space corresponding with the number of baskets allotted for each day's sale. The grading shall proceed from the beginning point of the sale to the closing point of the sale in an orderly sequence. An inspector shall not go back and grade any basket of tobacco placed in a space which was empty when grading for the day's sales passed such sales space.
(c) Before starting inspection of the day's sale of flue-cured tobacco in each warehouse, the head grader or market supervisor grader shall determine if there is compliance with the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section. If he determines that the prescribed system has not been followed, the inspectors shall proceed to the next scheduled warehouse and shall return to the noncomplying warehouse on the next sales day for such warehouse when the head grader or market supervisor grader shall again determine if the prescribed system has been followed before starting the inspection.
(d) A reduction in daily sales for any warehouse resulting from noncompliance with this section, including empty spaces, shall not prevent the maximum number of baskets allotted per day per set of buyers from being sold in the market.
(e) Each receiving station operator shall make tobacco accessible to the inspector for proper examination including any necessary display in adequate light for determination of grade, class, type, or other characteristics.
[13 FR 9477, Dec. 31, 1948; 19 FR 57, Jan. 6, 1954, as amended at 28 FR 6211, June 18, 1963; 67 FR 36081, May 23, 2002]

(3) Each warehouse operator shall display a plainly visible sign showing the total number of lots of burley tobacco allotted to be sold each day. Such sign shall be displayed at the point of lots where the days' sales will conclude and no additional tobacco shall be graded beyond that point.
(4) Each warehouse operator shall arrange his entire day's sale in a continuous and orderly arrayed sequence of lots and rows of tobacco. Any arrangement of tobacco in rows of progressively varying lengths, or any deviations from an orderly arrayed sequence of lots and rows of tobacco, shall have prior approval of the Set Work Leader or Circuit Supervisor.
(5) Each warehouse operator shall designate to the Set Work Leader or Circuit Supervisor the starting point or lot for each day's sale, and counting and grading will begin at this designated point and proceed to the closing point of the sale in an orderly sequence. All lot spaces, containing or not containing a lot of tobacco, and all lots of tobacco, covered or uncovered, shall be counted and included in the daily sales allotment. Lots of tobacco shall not be removed, added, rearranged, or substituted between the time they are counted for the day's sale and the time they are graded for the day's sale, provided, however, that with prior approval of the Set Work Leader or Circuit Supervisor compensating lots of tobacco may be substituted for empty spaces and covered lots included in a daily sales count.
(6) Each operator of a warehouse at which baled burley tobacco is offered for sale shall open the particular bale, in a lot of tobacco, chosen by a grader for inspection and reseal that bale after inspection.
(7) Each seller, by offering burley tobacco for sale, certifies that the lot inspected by a grader is representative of the grade of all the tobacco in that lot, that the leaf was stalk-cured, that the bales do not contain any foreign matter or material, and are not nested.
(b) Before starting inspection of the day's sale of burley tobacco in each warehouse, the Set Work Leader or Circuit Supervisor shall determine if there is compliance with the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section.
If he determines that the prescribed requirements have not been followed, the inspector shall proceed to the next sale or sales as originally scheduled for that day and grade the number of lots of tobacco scheduled for such sale or sales, and shall return to the noncomplying warehouse on the next regularly scheduled sales day for such warehouse, at which time the Set Work Leader or Circuit Supervisor shall again determine if the prescribed system has been followed before starting the inspection. If noncompliance or failure to observe requirements of paragraph (a) of this section are discovered after inspection for the day's sale has started, the inspector shall discontinue inspection and proceed to the next sale or sales scheduled for that day and shall return to the noncomplying warehouse on the next regularly scheduled sales day for such warehouse.
(c) The provisions of this section shall not preclude the application of other administrative remedies or the institution of criminal proceedings in appropriate cases as provided by the Act.

§ 29.78
Changes or alterations.
No change or alteration shall be made, in the weight or other identification of the lot, on a mandatory inspection ticket after the certification of type and grade by an official inspector, and any such change or alteration shall constitute and be construed as a change or alteration in the certificate issued or authorized under the Act.

Auction.
(1) No person, including the owner, producer, warehouseman, purchaser, agent, or employee thereof shall attempt, in any manner, to influence an inspector with respect to the grade designation of tobacco, or impede, in any manner, an inspector while the inspector is in the process of grading tobacco on the warehouse auction floor, or ask any question or discuss any matter pertaining to the grading of tobacco while the inspector is grading any tobacco on the warehouse auction floor. While inspectors are engaged in grading the day's sale, all requests for information concerning the grade designation on or requests to review the grade of any lot of tobacco shall be made only to the head grader or to the market supervisor grader.
(2) In the event that the head grader or market supervisor grader determines that a person has violated any provision of this section, inspection ticket(s) if already issued on the lot(s) of unsold tobacco involved shall be null and void and no further inspection shall be performed on such lot(s) offered for sale by the warehouseman in whose premises the violation occurred until the next regularly-scheduled sale for such warehouse: Provided, That if violation consists of talking to the inspector while he/she is grading the tobacco, a warning shall be given on first offense and penalty provisions shall apply on any subsequent offense. A reduction in daily sales for any warehouse resulting from a violation of this section shall not prevent the maximum number of lots or pounds allotted per day per set of buyers from being sold in a designated market.

§ 29.110
Method of sampling.
In sampling tobacco under the Act, at least three breaks shall be made at different points in the lot, and in the discretion of the sampler as many more breaks shall be made as seem necessary to show the range of the entire lot.

The official shall, so far as practicable, include tobacco of each quality, color, length, and other characteristics found in the lot in such proportions as would truly represent the lot. In case a lot is found to be damaged, nested, or in doubtful keeping order, the official sample tag shall be so marked. Official sample tags shall be attached to the sample, in a manner prescribed by the Director.
§ 29.111

Suspension and termination.
The license of an inspector, sampler, or weigher may be suspended, pending final action by the Secretary, by any official authorized to countersign licenses whenever he considers such action to be for the best interest of the service. The designation of an appeal inspector may be withdrawn at any time by the Division. Before the license of an inspector, sampler, or weigher is terminated or revoked pursuant to the Act and the regulations in this subpart, such appointee or licensee shall be furnished by the Secretary, or his designated representative, with a written statement specifying the charges, and within 7 days after his suspension, the licensee may file an appeal in writing with the Secretary supported by any evidence he may wish to offer in connection therewith.

# elements of quality
§ 29.1101
Elements of quality and degrees of each element.
These standardized words or terms are used to describe tobacco quality and to assist in interpreting grade specifications. Tobacco attributes or characteristics which constitute quality are designated as elements of quality. The range within each element is expressed by the use of words or terms designated as degrees. These several degrees are arranged to show their relative value, but the actual value of each degree varies with group.

# rules
§ 29.1106
Rules.
The application of these official standard grades shall be in accordance with the following rules.
§ 29.1107
Rule 1.
Each grade shall be treated as a subdivision of a particular type. When the grade is stated in an inspection certificate, the type also shall be stated.
§ 29.1108
Rule 2.
The determination of a grade shall be based upon a thorough examination of a lot of tobacco or of an official sample of the lot.
§ 29.1109
Rule 3.
In drawing an official sample from a hogshead or other package of tobacco, three or more breaks shall be made at such points and in such manner as the inspector or sampler may find necessary to determine the kinds of tobacco and the percentage of each kind contained in the lot. All breaks shall be made so that the tobacco contained in the center of the package is visible to the sampler, except for baled tobacco that is not opened for inspection (see Rule 30). Tobacco shall be drawn from at least three breaks from which a representative sample shall be selected. The sample shall include tobacco of each different group, quality, color, length, and kind found in the lot in proportion to the quantities of each contained in the lot.
[65 FR 46086, July 27, 2000]
§ 29.1110
Rule 4.
All standard grades must be clean unless otherwise noted by a special factor.
§ 29.1111
Rule 5.
The grade assigned to any lot of tobacco shall be a true representation of the tobacco at the time of inspection and certification. If, at any time, it is found that a lot of tobacco does not comply with the specifications of the grade previously assigned, it shall not thereafter be represented as such grade.
§ 29.1112
Rule 6.
A lot of tobacco on the marginal line between two colors shall be placed in the color with which it best corresponds with respect to body or other associated elements of quality.
§ 29.1113
Rule 7.
Any lot of tobacco which meets the specifications of two grades shall be placed in the higher grade. Any lot of tobacco on the marginal line between
two grades shall be placed in the lower grade.
§ 29.1114
Rule 8.
A lot of tobacco meets the specifications of a grade when it is not lower in any degree of any element of quality than the minimum specifications of such grade.
§ 29.1115
Rule 9.
The use of any grade may be restricted by the Director during any marketing season when it is found that the grade is not needed or appears in insufficient volume to justify its use.
§ 29.1116
Rule 10.
Any special factor approved by the Director of the Tobacco Division, Agricultural Marketing Service, may be used to show a peculiar side or characteristic of the tobacco which tends to modify the grade.

Interpretations, the use of specifications, and the meaning of terms shall be in accordance with determinations or clarifications made by the Chief of the Marketing Programs Branch and approved by the Director.
§ 29.1118
Rule 12.
In determining the grade of a lot of tobacco, the lot as a whole shall be considered. Minor irregularities which do not affect over one percent of the tobacco shall be overlooked.
§ 29.1119
Rule 13.
Degrees of uniformity shall be expressed in terms of percentages. The percentages shall govern the portion of a lot which must meet the specifications of the grade. (These percentages shall not affect limitations established by other rules.) The minor portion must be closely related, but may be of a different group, quality, and color from the major portion.
§ 29.1120
Rule 14.
The application of injury tolerance as an element of quality shall be expressed in terms of a percentage. The appraisal of injury shall be based upon the percentage of affected leaf surface or the degree of injury. In appraising injury, consideration shall be given to the normal characteristics of the group as related to injury.
§ 29.1121
Rule 15.
Any lot of tobacco containing 20 percent or more of variegated tobacco other than variegated red or scorched shall be described as variegated and designated by the color symbol “K,” “KL,” “KF,” “KD,” or “KV.”

# elements of quality
§ 29.3101
Elements of quality and degrees of each element.
These standardized words or terms are used to describe tobacco quality and to assist in interpreting grade specifications. Tobacco attributes or characteristics which constitute quality are designated as elements of quality. The range within each element is expressed by the use of words or terms designated as degrees. These several degrees are arranged to show their relative value, but the actual value of each degree varies with type, group, and grade. In each case the first and last degrees represent the full range for the element, and the intermediate degrees show gradual steps between them.

§ 29.3105
Rule 2.
The determination of a grade shall be based upon a thorough examination of a lot of tobacco or of an official sample of the lot.
§ 29.3106
Rule 3.
In drawing an official sample from a hogshead or other package of tobacco, three or more breaks shall be made at such points and in such manner as the inspector or sampler may find necessary to determine the kinds of tobacco and the percentage of each kind contained in the lot. One break shall be made not more than six inches from the top of the package and one not more than six inches from the bottom. All breaks shall be made so that the tobacco contained in the center of the package is visible to the sampler. Tobacco shall be drawn from at least three breaks from which a representative sample shall be selected. The sample shall include tobacco of each different group, quality, color, length, and kind found in the lot in proportion to the quantities of each contained in the lot.

# elements of quality
§ 29.3586
Elements of quality and degrees of each element.
These standardized words or terms are used to describe tobacco quality and to assist in interpreting grade specifications. Tobacco attributes or characteristics which constitute quality are designated as elements of quality. The range within each element is expressed by the use of words or terms designated as degrees. These several degrees are arranged to show their relative value, but the actual value of each degree varies with type, group, and grade.

Rule 1.
Each grade shall be treated as a subdivision of a particular type. When the grade is stated in an inspection certificate, the type also shall be stated.
§ 29.3603
Rule 2.
The determination of a grade shall be based upon a thorough examination of a lot of tobacco or of an official sample of the lot.
§ 29.3604
Rule 3.
In drawing an official sample from a hogshead or other package of tobacco, three or more breaks shall be made at such points and in such manner as the inspector or sampler may find necessary to determine the kinds of tobacco and the percentage of each kind contained in the lot. All breaks shall be made so that the tobacco contained in the center of the package is visible to the sampler. Tobacco shall be drawn from at least three breaks from which a representative sample shall be selected. The sample shall include tobacco of each different group, quality, color, length, and kind found in the lot in proportion to the quantities of each contained in the lot.

# Rules
§ 29.6086
Rules.
The application of these official standard grades shall be in accordance with the following rules.
§ 29.6087
Rule 1.
Each grade shall be treated as a subdivision of a particular type. When the grade is stated in an inspection certificate, the type also shall be stated.
§ 29.6088
Rule 2.
The determination of grade shall be based upon a representative sample or a thorough examination of a packing of tobacco.
§ 29.6089
Rule 3.
The grade of unsorted tobacco shall be based upon a representative sample of the packing. A minimum of 10 percent of the bundles or bales shall be selected at random for sampling; a higher percentage may be sampled at the discretion of the inspector. To obtain the sample, a sufficient amount of tobacco shall be drawn to be representative of each selected bale. In determining the grade, the inspector shall consider the quality of all samples. The grade assigned shall represent the quality of the lot as a whole.
§ 29.6090
Rule 4.
Standard grades shall be assigned to clean and sound tobacco only.
§ 29.6091
Rule 5.
Tobacco leaves shall be placed straight in bundles or bales of normal weight, size, and shape with the butts out and tips overlapping from 6 to 8 inches or sufficiently to make a level, solid, and uniform pack. The sides of the bundles shall be completely covered with paper, or other suitable protective material, and tightly bound with not less than three large twines spaced so that the tobacco will be held securely together. Improperly packed tobacco shall be designated as “No—G.”
§ 29.6092
Rule 6.
The grade assigned to any lot of tobacco shall be a true representation of the tobacco at the time of inspection and certification. If, at any time, it is found that a lot of tobacco does not comply with the specifications of the grade previously assigned, it shall not thereafter be represented as such grade.
§ 29.6093
Rule 7.
Any lot of tobacco which meets the specifications of two grades shall be
placed in the higher grade. Any lot of tobacco on the marginal line between two grades shall be placed in the lower grade.
§ 29.6094
Rule 8.
A lot of tobacco meets the specifications of a grade when it is not lower in any degree of any element of quality than the minimum specifications of such grade.
§ 29.6095
Rule 9.
In determining the grade of a lot of tobacco, the lot as a whole shall be considered. Minor irregularities which do not affect over one percent of the tobacco shall be overlooked.
§ 29.6096
Rule 10.
Interpretations, the use of specifications, and the meaning of terms shall be in accordance with determinations or clarifications made by the Chief of the Standardization Branch and approved by the Director of the Tobacco Division, Agricultural Marketing Service.
§ 29.6097
Rule 11.
The use of any grade may be restricted by the Director during any marketing season when it is found that the grade is not needed or appears in insufficient volume to justify its use.
§ 29.6098
Rule 12.
Uniformity shall be expressed in percentages. These percentages shall govern the portion of a lot which must meet each specification of the grade; the remaining portion must be related. Grade specifications state the minimum acceptable degree of each element of quality. Specified percentages of uniformity shall not affect limitations established by other rules.
§ 29.6099
Rule 13.
Injury tolerance shall be expressed in percentages. The appraisal of injury shall be based upon the percentage of affected leaf surface or the degree of injury, and consideration shall be given to the kinds of injury normal to the group or grade.
§ 29.6100
Rule 14.
Stem rot shall not exceed 40 percent of the specified injury tolerance for any grade.
§ 29.6101
Rule 15.
In grade specifications the tolerance of crude shall apply to the entire leaf surface of the lot.
§ 29.6102
Rule 16.
In grade specifications frozen shall be treated as a separate kind of injury and the tolerance shall apply to the entire leaf surface of the lot.
§ 29.6103
Rule 17.
Tobacco shall be designated as No Grade, using the grademark “No—G,” when it is damaged, dirty, nested, offtype, semicured, wet, improperly packed, contains foreign matter, or has an odor foreign to the type.
§ 29.6104
Rule 18.
Burn shall be determined as the average burning time of leaves selected at random from the sample. A minimum of 10 leaves shall be selected as representative regardless of the number of bundles or bales in the lot. All burn tests shall be made in the bindercutting area on the same side of the leaf. The leaf shall be punctured to permit quick ignition when placed over a candle, alcohol lamp, or electrical-lighting device. Good burn shall average 6 seconds or longer; fair burn, 3 to 5 seconds; and poor burn, under 3 seconds. B1 and B2 shall require good burn and B3, fair burn.

The Act of Congress approved August 23, 1935 (49 Stat. 731; 7 U.S.C., Chapter 21A) entitled “The Tobacco Inspection Act” contains the following provisions:
Sec. 2. That transactions in tobacco involving the sale thereof at auction as commonly conducted at auction markets are affected with a public interest; that such transactions are carried on by tobacco producers generally and by persons engaged in the business of buying and selling tobacco in commerce; that the classification of tobacco according to type, grade, and other characteristics affects the prices received therefor by producers; that without uniform standards of classification and inspection the evaluation of tobacco is susceptible to speculation, manipulation, and control, and unreasonable fluctuations in prices and quality determinations occur which are detrimental to producers and persons handling tobacco in commerce; that such fluctuations constitute a burden upon commerce and make the use of uniform standards of classification and inspection imperative for the protection of producers and others engaged in commerce and the public interested therein. * * *
Sec. 5. That the Secretary is authorized to designate those auction markets where tobacco bought and sold thereon at auction, or the products customarily manufactured therefrom, moves in commerce. Before any market is designated by the Secretary under this section he shall determine by referendum the desire of tobacco growers who sold tobacco at auction on such market during the preceding marketing season. The Secretary may at his discretion hold one referendum for two or more markets or for all markets in a type area. No market or group of markets shall be designated by the Secretary unless two-thirds of the growers voting favor it. The Secretary shall have access to the tobacco records of the Collector of Internal Revenue and of the several collectors of internal revenue for the purpose of obtaining the names and addresses of growers who sold tobacco on any auction market, and the Secretary shall determine from said records the eligibility of such grower to vote in such referendum, and no grower shall be eligible to vote in more than one referendum. After public notice of not less than thirty days that any auction market has been so designated by the Secretary, no tobacco shall be offered for sale at auction on such market until it shall have been inspected and certified by an authorized representative of the Secretary according to the standards established under this Act, except that the Secretary may temporarily suspend the requirement of inspection and certification at any designated market whenever he finds it impracticable to provide for such inspection and certification because competent inspectors are not obtainable or because the quantity of tobacco available for inspection is insufficient to justify the cost of such service:
Provided,
That, in the event competent inspectors are not available, or for other reasons, the Secretary is unable to provide for such inspection and certification at all auction markets within a type area, he shall
first designate those auction markets where the greatest number of growers may be served with the facilities available to him. No fee or charge shall be imposed or collected for inspection or certification under this section at any designated auction market. Nothing contained in this Act shall be construed to prevent transactions in tobacco at markets not designated by the Secretary or at designated markets where the Secretary has suspended the requirement of inspection or to authorize the Secretary to close any market.

§ 29.9402
Policy statement.
The sets of inspectors available to serve the flue-cured marketing areas are currently adequate to provide inspection service as rapidly as tobacco can be purchased, handled and processed by the currently existing facilities of the buyers, and the lack of inspection personnel is not a limiting factor to accelerated marketings or the extension of price support to producers. The sets of buyers assigned to the flue-cured markets by the buying industry are adequate to purchase tobacco as rapidly as it can be handled and processed by the buyers' facilities. However, the tobacco ready for marketing during most weeks of the marketing season substantially exceeds the quantities which can be purchased, handled and processed by the currently existing facilities of the buyers. Moreover, the total number of flue-cured markets are
substantially greater than the number of sets of buyers assigned by the buying companies or the number of sets of available inspectors. In this situation, about 6 months is required to market a year's crop of flue-cured tobacco and all warehouses cannot be served at the same time by the available sets of inspectors and the sets of buyers assigned by the buying companies. As additional sets of inspectors would not relieve the situation, inspection service will be provided by assigning the available inspectors to the various marketing areas and to warehouses within the marketing areas in a manner determined by the Secretary to provide the best and most equitable service to all growers.
§ 29.9403
Flue-Cured Tobacco Advisory Committee.
To assist the Secretary in making the apportionment and assignment of inspectors, a Flue-Cured Tobacco Advisory Committee, appointed in accordance with the Federal Advisory Committee Act (5 U.S.C. appendix I), shall advise and recommend to the Secretary marketing area opening dates and selling schedules for both designated and undesignated flue-cured tobacco to be sold in each marketing area and in each warehouse within each marketing area.
[39 FR 30475, Aug. 23, 1974, as amended at 49 FR 4067, Feb. 2, 1984; 50 FR 45806, Nov. 4, 1985; 51 FR 5987, Feb. 19, 1986; 67 FR 61468, Oct. 1, 2002]
§ 29.9404
Marketing area opening dates and marketing schedules.
(a) The Flue-Cured Tobacco Advisory Committee shall recommend, to the Secretary, marketing areas in the flue-cured tobacco production area and marketing area opening dates and selling schedules for both designated and undesignated tobacco for each marketing area and for the individual warehouses in each marketing area, which specify the length of time inspectors will be available to inspect designated tobacco and undesignated tobacco and/or the quantity of designated or undesignated tobacco to be marketed in each area and through each warehouse within such marketing area. In developing such opening date and selling schedules, the Committee shall take into account the following:
(1) When a sufficient volume of tobacco produced within a specific area of the flue-cured tobacco production area will be ready for marketing;
(2) The volume of tobacco ready for marketing which the producers have designated under § 1464.2(e) of this title to be sold at specific warehouses and also the volume of tobacco ready for marketing which has not been so designated by the producer;
(3) With regard to undesignated tobacco, the Committee shall first determine, on the basis of all information available to it, the volume of undesignated tobacco in a geographical area, and then shall provide sales opportunity for each warehouse to sell an amount of the undesignated tobacco available for sale from that geographical area in proportion to the amount of tobacco designated to the warehouse in comparison to the total amount of tobacco designated in the marketing area in which the warehouse is located. Provided, however, that the Secretary may authorize additional undesignated sales opportunity if the warehouse provided proper proof that it does, in fact, have available for sale a volume of tobacco which has not previously been designated and which was eligible for designation to that warehouse had the producer chosen to designate and that such additional volume of tobacco warrants more sales opportunity than allowed by the schedule;
(4) The processing or redrying capacity of the industry and the number of inspectors available to provide inspection service during the specific period involved;
(5) Such other factors or information as may be necessary to develop an effective and equitable opening date and selling schedule.
(b) The Flue-Cured Tobacco Advisory Committee shall thereupon submit its recommended opening date and selling schedules for designated and undesignated tobacco and the geographic areas to be included in specific marketing areas to the Secretary together with a basis supporting its recommendations.
[39 FR 17754, May 20, 1974, as amended at 39 FR 30476, Aug. 23, 1974; 40 FR 24174, June 5, 1975; 40 FR 30917, July 24, 1975]
§ 29.9405
Issuance of marketing area opening date and selling schedules by the Secretary.
(a) The Secretary shall review the recommendations of the Flue-Cured Tobacco Advisory Committee and based upon such recommendations and the basis therefor and such other information as may be available to him, shall specify the geographic areas to be encompassed by specific marketing areas, set the opening dates for sale within the marketing areas and issue the selling schedules for designated and undesignated tobacco. The inspection of flue-cured tobacco shall be in accordance with said schedules.
(b) The Flue-Cured Tobacco Advisory Committee shall recommend modifications in the opening date and marketing schedule during the flue-cured tobacco marketing season as may be warranted by changes in marketing conditions and the Secretary shall act thereon in the same manner as approving the initial opening date and marketing schedules.
[39 FR 17754, May 20, 1974, as amended at 39 FR 30476, Aug. 23, 1974]
§ 29.9406
Failure of warehouse to comply with opening and selling schedule.
(a) Each warehouse shall comply with opening and selling schedules issued by the Secretary for designated and undesignated flue-cured tobacco.
(b) For each of any two consecutive sales days during the marketing season a warehouse may exceed its scheduled sales opportunity for designated or undesignated tobacco, but the pounds sold during the second or third sales day must be adjusted so the warehouse will be back in compliance at the end of the third sales day or no tobacco inspection or price support services will be made available on the next succeeding sales day. Any such adjustment which is within 100 pounds of the required reduction shall be considered as in compliance with this section. During the closeout period, if a warehouse sells tobacco in excess of that allowed by the sales schedule on either of the last two sales days of the marketing season, then such excess sales shall be deducted from its scheduled sales opportunity on the first, or more, sales days of the next marketing season.
(c) The amount of the poundage adjustment specified in paragraph (b) of this section for a warehouse selling in excess of the sales schedule shall be as follows:
(1) If the excess is 5,000 pounds or less of designated producer tobacco, the adjustment in producer sales opportunity shall be one pound for each pound of excess; sales in excess of 5,000 pounds shall be a violation of the sales schedule and the adjustment for the first violation shall be 5,000 pounds plus the larger of 3 pounds for each pound in excess of 5,000 pounds or 5,000 pounds; for the second violation, the adjustment shall be 5,000 pounds plus the larger of 5 pounds for each pound in excess of 5,000 or 15,000 pounds; and for the third and subsequent violations, the adjustment shall be 5,000 pounds plus the larger of 5 pounds for each pound in excess of 5,000 pounds or 50 percent of a scheduled day's sales opportunity.
(2) If the excess is 1,000 pounds or less of undesignated producer tobacco, the adjustment in producers sales opportunity is one pound for each pound of excess; if the excess is larger than 1,000 pounds, the adjustment is 1,000 pounds plus the larger of 3 pounds for each pound in excess of 1,000 or 2,000 pounds.
(3) If the excess is designated producer tobacco that is not eligible for sale at the warehouse on the day of the sale, the adjustment in producers sales opportunity for the first violation is the larger of 3 pounds for each pound in excess or 5,000 pounds, and for the second and succeeding violations, the larger of 5 pounds for each pound in excess or 10,000 pounds.
(d) If, on any sales day, a warehouse does not sell the full quantity of designated or undesignated tobacco authorized to be sold at such warehouse, the designated or undesignated sales opportunity at such warehouse on the next immediate sales day shall automatically be increased by the unsold quantity except that no such increase in sales opportunity shall exceed 5,000 pounds for designated tobacco or 500 pounds for undesignated tobacco.
[46 FR 56156, Nov. 16, 1981, as amended at 65 FR 46087, July 27, 2000]
§ 29.9407
Records and reports.
(a) Each warehouse, on a designated market, shall provide the Secretary with any information that is requested on forms provided said warehouse by the Secretary.
(b) Each warehouse shall keep records for a period of two years from the opening of the marketing season in which the tobacco is sold, and make available to the Secretary such records as are necessary for the Secretary to verify the information required by paragraph (a) of this section.
(c) Failure to comply with the requirements of this section including but not limited to failure to provide information which is accurate, shall result in suspension of tobacco inspection services for a minimum of the equivalent of one sales day or until such time as the warehouse comes into compliance.

# Classification of Leaf Tobacco Covering Classes, Types and Groups of Grades
§ 30.1
Definitions of terms used in classification of leaf tobacco.
For the purpose of §§ 30.1 through 30.44 the terms appearing in §§ 30.2 through 30.21 shall be construed as explained therein.
§ 30.2
Leaf tobacco.
Tobacco in the forms in which it appears between the time it is cured and stripped from the stalk, or primed and cured, and the time it enters into the different manufacturing processes. The acts of stemming, sweating or fermenting, and conditioning are not regarded as manufacturing processes. Leaf tobacco does not include any manufactured or semimanufactured tobacco, stems which have been removed from leaves, cuttings, clippings, trimmings, shorts, or dust.
§ 30.3
Unstemmed.
A form of leaf tobacco consisting of a collection of leaves from which the stems or midribs have not been removed, including leaf-scrap.
§ 30.4
Stemmed.
A form of leaf tobacco consisting of a collection of leaves from which the stems or midribs have been removed, including strip scrap.
§ 30.5
Class.
One of the major divisions of leaf tobacco based on the distinct characteristics of the tobacco caused by differences in varieties, soil and climatic conditions, and the methods of cultivation, harvesting, and curing.
§ 30.6
Type.
A subdivision of a class of leaf tobacco, having certain common characteristics which permit of its being divided into a number of related grades. Any tobacco that has the same characteristics and corresponding qualities, colors, and lengths, shall be treated as one type, regardless of any factors of historical or geographical nature which cannot be determined by an examination of the tobacco.
§ 30.7
Group.
A group of grades, or a division of a type covering several closely related grades, based on the general quality of the tobacco, including the percentage of injury, and other factors. The factors that determine the group divisions also largely determine the usage or suitability of tobacco for certain purposes.
§ 30.8
Scrap.
A byproduct from handling leaf tobacco in both the unstemmed and stemmed forms, consisting of loose and tangled portions of tobacco leaves, floor sweepings, and all other tobacco materials (except stems) which accumulate in auction and storage warehouses, packing and conditioning plants, and stemmeries. Scrap which accumulates from handling unstemmed leaf tobacco is known as leaf-scrap, and scrap which accumulates from handling stemmed leaf tobacco is known as strip-scrap. The scrap group, covering both leaf-scrap and strip-scrap is designated by the letter “S”.
§ 30.9
Nondescript.
Any tobacco of a certain type which cannot be placed in other groups of the type, or any nested tobacco, or any muddy or extremely dirty tobacco, or any tobacco containing an unusual quantity of foreign matter, or any crude tobacco, or any tobacco which is damaged to the extent of 20 percent or more, or any tobacco infested with live tobacco beetles or other injurious insects, or any wet tobacco, or any tobacco that contains fat stems or wet butts. The nondescript group is designated by the letter “N”.
[39 FR 11893, Apr. 1, 1974]
§ 30.10
Cure.
To dry the sap from newly harvested tobacco by either natural or artificial process. Proper curing is done under such conditions as will permit of the chemical and physiological changes necessary to develop the desired quality of color in tobacco.
§ 30.11
Flue-cure.
To cure tobacco under artificial atmospheric conditions by a process of regulating the heat and ventilation without allowing smoke or fumes from the fuel to come in contact with the tobacco.
§ 30.12
Fire-cure.
To cure tobacco under artificial atmospheric conditions by the use of open fires, the smoke and fumes of which are allowed to come in contact with the tobacco.
§ 30.13
Air-cure.
To cure tobacco under natural atmospheric conditions without the use of fire, except for the purpose of preventing pole burn (house burn) in damp weather.
§ 30.14
Cigar filler.
The tobacco that forms the core or inner part of a cigar. Cigar-filler tobacco is tobacco of the kind and quality commonly used for cigar fillers. Cigar-filler types are those which produce chiefly tobacco suitable for cigar-filler purposes.
§ 30.15
Cigar binder.
A portion of a tobacco leaf rolled around the filler of a cigar to bind or hold it together and form the first covering. Cigar-binder tobacco is tobacco of the kind and quality commonly used for cigar binders. Cigar-binder types
are those which produce chiefly tobacco suitable for cigar-binder purposes.
§ 30.16
Cigar wrapper.
A portion of a tobacco leaf forming the outer covering of a cigar. Cigar-wrapper tobacco is tobacco of the kind and quality commonly used for cigar wrappers. Cigar-wrapper types are those which produce chiefly tobacco suitable for cigar-wrapper purposes.
§ 30.17
Damage.
The effect of mold, must, rot, black rot, or other fungous or bacterial diseases which attack tobacco in its cured state. Any tobacco having the odor of mold, must, or rot shall be included in damaged tobacco. (Note distinction between “damage” and “injury.”)
§ 30.18
Injury.
Hurt or impairment from any cause except the fungous or bacterial diseases which attack tobacco in its cured state. Injured tobacco shall include any dead, burnt, or ragged tobacco; or tobacco that has been torn or broken, frozen or frosted, sunburned or scalded, scorched or fire-killed, bulk-burnt or stem-burnt, pole burnt or house burnt, bleached or bruised; or tobacco containing discolored or deformed leaves; or tobacco hurt by insects; or tobacco affected by wild-fire, black fire, rust, frogeye, mosaic, frenching, sanddrown, or other field diseases.
§ 30.19
Nested.
Any lot of tobacco which has been so handled or packed as to conceal damaged, injured, tangled, or inferior tobacco, or foreign matter.
§ 30.20
Crude.
A subdegree of maturity, crude leaves usually have the general appearance of being raw and unfinished as a result of extreme immaturity. Crude tobacco ordinarily has a characteristic green color.
§ 30.21
Foreign matter.
Any substance or material extraneous to tobacco leaves, such as dirt, sand, stalks, suckers, straws, and strings.
§ 30.31
Classification of leaf tobacco.
For the purpose of this classification leaf tobacco shall be divided into the following classes:
Class 1. Flue-cured types.
Class 2. Fire-cured types.
Class 3.
1
Air-cured types.
Class 4. Cigar-filler types.

(1) For any variety meeting specifications of paragraph (a) of § 35.11 “Meets requirements of Export Grape and Plum Act” or (2) For any variety meeting specifications of paragraph (b) of § 35.11 “Meets requirements of Export Grape and Plum Act except for export to destinations in Europe, Greenland, or Japan.” No carrier shall transport or receive for transportation any such variety to any foreign destination other than Canada or Mexico unless a copy of the certificate of inspection issued thereon showing that the grapes meet requirements for the applicable export destination is surrendered to such carrier when such variety is so received. The shipper shall deliver a copy of such certificate covering the shipment to the export carrier. Such grapes may be inspected at points other than port of exportation. Whenever such grapes are inspected and certified at any point other than port of exportation, the shipper shall deliver a copy of such certificate to the agent of the first carrier that thereafter transports such grapes and such agent shall deliver such copy to the proper official of the carrier on which the grapes are to be exported.
(c) A copy of the Certificate of Inspection shall be filed by the export carrier for a period of not less than three (3) years following date of export.
(d) Persons exporting grapes under the provisions of section 2 of the Act shall first submit to the Federal or Federal-State Inspection Service a certification in duplicate stating the names and addresses of the contracting parties, the date of contract, the quantity of grapes to be delivered, the U.S. grade specified, the expected date of shipment, and the name and address of the export carrier. The certificate of inspection shall indicate that the grapes are eligible for export under section 2 of the Act.
(e) If the inspector has reason to believe that samples of a lot of any variety of vinifera species table grapes have been obtained for a determination as to compliance with tolerance for spray residue, established under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, as amended (52 Stat. 1040; 21 U.S.C. 301
et seq.
), he shall not issue a certificate on the lot unless it complies with such tolerances.

§ 36.1
General information.
The Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS or agency) of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) facilitates the fair and efficient marketing of agricultural products by promulgating voluntary official grade standards for dairy, fresh and processed fruits and vegetables, livestock, meats and meat products, eggs, poultry and rabbit products, tobacco, wool, mohair, and other agricultural products. AMS standards provide a uniform language for describing the quality of various agricultural commodities in the marketplace. These standards may cover (but are not limited to) terms, classes, sizes (including quantities of packaged consumer agricultural commodities), dimensions, capacities, quality levels, performance criteria, inspection requirements, marking requirements, testing equipment, test procedures, and installation procedures.
(a) Grade standards are officially designated as U.S. Grade Standards and the AMS assigns each grade standard an appropriate identification number. AMS develops, revises, suspends, or terminates official grade standards under procedures that allows for input by interested parties.
(b) These procedures set forth the process by which AMS will develop, revise, suspend, or terminate the U.S. standards.
(c) Communications about AMS standards in general should be addressed to the Administrator, Attention: Functional Committee for Standards. Communications about specific standards (such as a request to develop or revise a standard) should be addressed to the Director of the appropriate Division (Dairy, Fruit and Vegetable, Livestock and Seed, Poultry, or Tobacco). All communications should include in the address: Agricultural Marketing Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, P.O. Box 96456, Washington, DC 20090-6456.
§ 36.2
Initiating action on grade standards.
The Agency will develop, revise, suspend, or terminate grade standards if it determines that such action is in the public interest. Any standardization action should reflect the broad interest of individuals or an industry involved in manufacturing, producing, packaging, distributing, testing, consuming, or using the product; or the interest of a Federal, State, or local agency. Proposed actions should always be based on sound technical and marketing information and should include careful consideration of the factors that determine a commodity's quality and condition and that will allow trained personnel to determine objectively conformance or non-conformance.
(a) AMS encourages interested parties to participate in the review, development, and revision of grade standards. Interested parties include growers, producers, processors, shippers, distributors, consumers, individuals or groups, trade associations, companies, and State or Federal agencies. Such groups and individuals may at any time recommend that AMS develop, revise suspend, or terminate a grade standard. Requests for Agency action should be in writing, preferably accompanied by a draft of the suggested change.
(1) The Agency, in cooperation with interested parties, as applicable, will:
(i) Determine the need for new or revised standards;
(ii) Collect technical, marketing, or other appropriate data;
(iii) Conduct research regarding new or revised standards, as appropriate; and,
(iv) Draft the proposed standards;
(2) [Reserved]
(b) If the Agency determines that new standards are needed, existing standards need to be revised, or the suspension or termination of existing standards is justified, it will undertake the action, with input from all interested parties.
§ 36.3
Public notification of grade standards action.
After developing a standardization proposal, the Agency will publish a notice in the
Federal Register
describing new or changes to existing standards or to suspend or terminate existing standards. AMS will simultaneously issue a news release about these actions. AMS will also distribute copies of the full text of the proposals to anyone requesting a copy or to anyone the Agency believes may be interested, including other Federal, State, or local government agencies, and on the Internet. For other than minor editorial or technical changes, the notice will provide at least 60 days for interested parties to submit comments to the Agency.
(a) All comments received within the comment period will be part of the public record maintained by the Agency, will be available to the public for review, and will be considered by the Agency before final action is taken on the proposal.
(1) Based on the comments received, the Agency's knowledge of standards, grading, marketing, and other technical factors, and any other relevant information AMS will decide whether the proposed actions should be implemented.
(2) If AMS concludes that the actions as proposed or with minor modifications should be adopted, AMS will publish a description of the changes or actions in a
Federal Register
notice. The Agency, through the appropriate AMS Divisions, will make the grade standards and related information available in printed form and electronic media.
(3) If the Agency determines that proposed changes are not warranted, or otherwise are not in the public interest, the Agency will either publish in the
Federal Register
a notice withdrawing the proposal, or will revise the proposal and again seek public input.

§ 42.102
Definitions, general.
For the purpose of this part, unless the context otherwise requires, the following terms shall be construed, respectively, to mean:
Acceptable Quality Level (AQL).
The maximum number of defects per hundred units (DHU) which is acceptable as a process average. Lots, or portions of production, having a quality level equal to a specified AQL will be accepted approximately 95 percent of the time when using the sampling plans prescribed for the AQL.
Acceptance Number
(Ac). The number in a sampling plan that indicates the maximum number of defects permitted in a sample in order to consider a lot as meeting a specific requirement.
Administrator.
The Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service
(AMS) of the Department or any other officer or employee of the Agency who is delegated, or who may be delegated the authority to act in the Administrator's stead.
Basic Inspection Period.
A specified period of consecutive production designated for on-line inspection (e.g., one shift's production, one day's production, etc.).
Condition.
The degree of acceptability of the container with respect to freedom from defects which affect the serviceability, including appearance as well as usability, of the container for its intended purpose.
Cumulative Sum Sampling (CuSum) Plan.
An on-line sampling plan that accumulates the number of defects which exceed the subgroup tolerance (“T”) in a series of consecutive subgroups. Terms specified to the CuSum sampling plans are:
(a)
Acceptance Limit (“L”).
The maximum accumulation of defects allowed to exceed the subgroup tolerance (“T”) in any subgroup or consecutive subgroups.
(b)
CuSum value.
The accumulated number of defects that exceed the subgroup tolerance (“T”).
(c)
Subgroup tolerance (“T”).
The allowable number of defects in any subgroup.
(d)
Starting value (“S”).
The initial CuSum value used to begin a CuSum sampling plan.
Defect.
Any nonconformance of a container from specified requirements.
Defect classifications.
The terms used to denote the severity of a defect. The terms are as follows:
(a)
Critical defect.
A defect that seriously affects, or is likely to seriously affect, the usability of the container for its intended purpose.
(b)
Major defect.
A defect that materially affects, or is likely to materially affect, the usability of the container for its intended purpose.
(c)
Minor defect.
A defect that materially affects the appearance of the container but is not likely to affect the usability of the container for its intended purpose.
(d)
Insignificant defect.
A flaw in the container that does not materially affect the appearance and does not affect usability of the container for its intended purpose. When performing examinations, insignificant defects shall not be recorded.
Defective.
A container which has one or more defects.
Department.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture.
Double sampling.
A sampling scheme which involves use of two independently drawn but related samples, a first sample and a second sample which is added to the first to form a total sample size. A double sampling plan consists of first and total sample sizes with associated acceptance and rejection criteria. The first sample must be inspected first, and if possible, a decision as to acceptance or rejection of the lot made before a second sample is inspected. When the decision cannot be made on the first sample, a second sample is inspected; the decision to accept or reject is based on the total sample size.
Lot or inspection lot.
A collection of filled food containers of the same size, type, and style. The term shall mean “inspection lot,” i.e., a collection of units of product from which a sample is to be drawn and inspected to determine conformance with the applicable acceptance criteria. An inspection lot may differ from a collection of units designated as a lot for other purposes (e.g., production lot, shipping lot, etc.).
On-line sampling.
The random selection of samples from a production line.
Origin inspection.
An inspection made at any location where the filled containers are examined prior to shipment or transfer to the purchaser.
Primary container.
The immediate container in which the product is packaged and which serves to protect, preserve, and maintain the condition of the product. It may be metal, glass, fiber, wood, textile, plastic, paper, or any other suitable type of material and may be supplemented by liners, overwraps, or other protective materials.
(b)
For On-line Sampling.
The chance that a portion of production with a given level of quality will be accepted. Probability of acceptance is synonymous with “Percent of Production Expected to be Accepted.” The probability of acceptance is normally designated as “Pa.” In on-line sampling
inspection, the probability of acceptance of any portion of production depends on the sample results obtained from the preceding portions. The probability of acceptance values associated with these procedures are the values which would be expected if a large number of samples are to be inspected. For the CuSum plans referenced in this standard, the probability of acceptance at the Acceptable Quality Level (AQL) is approximately 95 percent. The starting value (“S”) associated with each CuSum plan helps to make the probability of acceptance of the first portions of production of a basic inspection period as close as possible to 95 percent.
Random sampling.
A process of selecting a sample from a lot, or portion of production, whereby each unit in the lot of portion of production, has an equal chance of being chosen.
Rejection number
(Re). The number in a sampling plan that indicates the minimum number of defects in a sample that will cause a lot to fail a specific requirement.
Sample.
Any number of sample units which are to be used for inspection.
Sample size (n).
The number of sample units included in the sample.
Sample unit.
The individual container including any component parts.
Sampling plan.
Any plan stating the number of sample units to be included in the sample as well as the corresponding plan parameters used to make acceptance and rejection decisions.
Secondary container.
The container in which one or more primary containers are packed. For example, a shipping case containing canned product.
Shipping case.
The container in which the product or primary containers of the product are placed to protect, preserve, and maintain the condition of the product during transit or storage. The shipping case may include strapping, liners or other protective material.
Single sampling.
A sampling scheme where the decision to accept or reject an inspection lot with respect to a specified requirement is made after the inspection of a single sample. A single sampling plan consists of a single sample size with associated acceptance and rejection criteria.
Stationary lot sampling.
The process of randomly selecting sample units from a lot whose production has been completed. This type of lot is usually stored in a warehouse or in some other storage facility and is offered in its entirety for inspection.
Subgroup.
A group of sample units representing a portion of production.
Total defects.
The sum of critical, major, and minor defects.
User.
The person or agency at whose request inspection is conducted.

# Subpart B—Procedures for Stationary Lot Sampling and Inspection
§ 42.103
Purpose and scope.
(a) This subpart outlines the procedure to be used to establish the condition of containers in stationary lots of packaged foods. This subpart shall be used to determine the acceptability of a lot based on specified acceptable quality levels and defects referenced in § 42.104 or any alternative plan which is approved by the Administrator. In addition, any other sampling plan in the tables with a larger first sample size than that indicated by the lot size range may be specified when approved by the Administrator. This subpart or approved alternative plan will be applied when a Government agency or private user of the inspection or grading services requests that filled primary containers or shipping cases, or both, be certified for condition. Unless the request for certification specifically asks that only the primary container or only the shipping case be examined, both containers will be examined.
(b) Unless otherwise specified by the user of service, this subpart will not apply to inspection lots of less than 50 shipping cases or to inspection lots of less than 300 primary containers. When the primary container is the shipping case, the shipping case limit will apply.
When the lot size exceeds either the 50 shipping case limit or the 300 primary container limit or both, the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section will apply.
(c) Under certain conditions, special procedures (Skip Lot Sampling and Inspection) may be used to determine the condition of containers in stationary lots of packaged foods. Subpart C sets forth the requirements and procedures for Skip Lot Sampling and Inspection.
[31 FR 4687, Mar. 19, 1966, as amended at 36 FR 18456, Sept. 15, 1971; 41 FR 42639, Sept. 28, 1976. Redesignated at 42 FR 32514, June 27, 1977, and further amended at 45 FR 69424, Oct. 21, 1980. Redesignated at 46 FR 63203, Dec. 31, 1981]
§ 42.104
Sampling plans and defects.
(a)
Sampling plans.
Sections 42.109 through 42.111 show the number of containers to examine for condition in relation to lot size ranges. The tables provide acceptance (Ac) and rejection (Re) numbers for lot acceptance (or rejection) based on the number, class, and type of defects present in the sample.
(b)
Defects.
The tables in § 42.112 enumerate and classify defects according to the degree to which the individual defect affects the serviceability, including appearance as well as usability, of the container for its intended purpose. The table in § 42.113 enumerates and classifies defects of the label, marking, or code.
[31 FR 4687, Mar. 19, 1966, as amended at 36 FR 18456, Sept. 15, 1971. Redesignated at 42 FR 32514, June 27, 1977 and 46 FR 63203, Dec. 31, 1981]
§ 42.105
Basis for selection of sample.
(a)
Identification of lot.
Selection of proper samples requires sufficient information to identify the lot; such information includes, but is not limited to:
(1) The lot size (see § 42.103 for restriction on small lots);
(2) The type and size of container;
(3) The code marks or other identification marks and the number of containers represented by each mark.
(4) The history of the lot regarding previous inspections; and
(5) The inspection status (normal, tightened, or reduced).
(b)
Preliminary scanning.
Prior to drawing the sample, the lot should be scanned to determine if any segments or portions are abnormal with respect to wet cases, blown cans, top layer rust, leaking bags, etc. If such segments or portions noted are of any consequence, the lot may be rejected for condition of containers without sampling.
(c)
Sample size.
Determination of the number of containers to check for condition:
(1) Refer to the table in §§ 42.109 through 42.111 (sampling plans) and find where the lot size (number of individual containers) fits into the column headed “Lot Size Ranges.”
(i) Tables I-A (normal), II-A (tightened), or III-A (reduced), as applicable, will apply to origin inspections, unless the contractor requests that corresponding single sampling plans be used.
(ii) The appropriate double sampling plans in Table I will apply to other than origin inspections, unless the contractor requests that corresponding single sampling plans be used.
(2) Select the appropriate sample size for the corresponding lot size range as indicated in the appropriate column headed “Sample Size.”
(3) Lots rejected for unsatisfactory condition of containers may be subsequently sampled after being reconditioned or reworked. Such lots or resulting portion of a lot may be sampled as a reoffered lot providing the reoffered portion is separately identifiable. When making such inspections, the appropriate sampling plan for tightened inspection shall be used. Except in the case of an appeal inspection, it is not permissible to reinspect a previously rejected lot until it has been reconditioned or reworked.
(d)
Sample selection.
Select samples from the lot presented in accordance with either of the following two procedures as may be applicable. (A lot offered for inspection will be accepted or rejected in its entirety with either sampling procedure used to select the sample.)
(1)
Proportional random sampling.
When the number of codes or other identifying marks within the lot and the approximate number of cases or
containers per code are known, select sample units at random within each mark and in a number proportionate to the number of containers represented by such mark.
(2)
Simple random sampling.
When there are no code or other identifying marks, or when the number of codes or identifying marks within the lot and/or approximate number of cases or containers per mark are not known, select sample units at random from the entire lot.
(e)
Maximum sample units per case.
If the lot is cased, predetermine the number of containers to draw from each sampled case as well as the position within the case. Do not restrict the sampling to the top or bottom layers or to the corners. The best sample is one selected from all the various positions in the shipping case. It is desirable but not mandatory to limit the number of sample units to a single container from any one case. Multiple sample units may be taken from a single case but not in excess of the following plan:
(1) When containers are packed 12 or less to a case, draw a maximum of 6 sample units from any one case; and
(2) When containers are packed more than 12 to a case but not more than 60, draw a maximum of 12 sample units from any one case; and
(3) When containers are packed more than 60 to a case but not more than 250, draw a maximum of 16 sample units from any one case; and
(4) When containers are packed more than 250 in a case, draw a maximum of 24 sample units from any one case.

§ 42.106
Classifying and recording defects.
(a)
Classifying defects.
Examine each sample unit for the applicable type of defects listed in the table covering the container being inspected in §§ 42.112 and 42.113. Other defects, not specifically listed, shall be classified according to their effect on the intended use of the container.
(1) Related defects are defects on a single container that are related to a single cause. If the initial incident causing one of the defects had not occurred, none of the other related defects on the container would be present. As an example of related defects, a can may be a leaker and the exterior may also be seriously rusted due to the leakage of the contents. In this case, the container is scored only once for these two defects since the rust condition can be attributed to the leak. Score the container according to whichever condition is the most serious. In this example, score as a “leaker” (a critical defect) and not as “pitted rust” (a major defect).
(2) Unrelated defects are defects on a single container that result from separate causes. If the incident that caused one of the defects had not occurred, the other unrelated defects on the container would still be present. As an example of unrelated defects, a can may be seriously rusted, may have a bad dent along the seam, and the label may also be detached from the can because of improper gluing. In this case it is unlikely that any of the three defects exist because of a common cause. Therefore, they are considered unrelated defects and should be scored as three defects.
(3) The lot acceptance portion of this procedure is based on the number of defects per 100 containers. It is necessary to determine if the defects on any one container are “related” defects or “unrelated” defects. A container is scored for the most serious of related defects, and is also scored for each unrelated defect.
(b)
Recording defects.
Record on a worksheet the number, type, and class (critical, major, or minor) of defects on each sample unit.
(c)
Totaling defects.
Add the number of defects in each class, then add the number of minor, major, and critical defects to obtain the total defects.

§ 42.107
Lot acceptance criteria.
(a) The acceptability of the lot is determined by relating the number and class of defects enumerated on the
worksheet to the acceptance and rejection numbers shown in §§ 42.109 through 42.111 for the respective sample size and Acceptable Quality Level (AQL).
(b) Unless otherwise specified, use the following AQL's for the respective class of defects:
Defect class
AQL at origin inspection
AQL at other than origin inspection
Critical
0.25
0.25
Major
1.5
2.5
Total
6.5
10.0
(c) Refer to the appropriate sample size and AQL and compare the number of defects found in the sample with the acceptance (Ac) and rejection (Re) numbers in the sampling plan.
(1) Accept the lot after examining the single sample or first sample of a double sampling plan when all of the following conditions are met:
(i) The number of critical defects does not exceed the applicable acceptance number (Ac) for critical defects, and
(ii) The number of major defects does not exceed the applicable acceptance number (Ac) for major defects, and
(iii) The total number of critical, major, and minor defects does not exceed the applicable acceptance number (Ac) for total defects.
(2) Reject the lot after examining the single sample or first sample of a double sampling plan when any one or more of the following conditions occur:
(i) The number of critical defects equals or exceeds the applicable rejection number (Re) for critical defects, or
(ii) The number of major defects equals or exceeds the applicable rejection number (Re) for major defects, or

§ 42.108
Normal, tightened, or reduced inspection.
(a)
Normal inspection.
Sampling plans for normal inspection are those in Tables I and I-A. These plans shall be used except when the history of inspection permits reduced inspection or requires tightened inspection.
(b)
Tightened inspection.
Sampling plans for tightened inspection are those in Tables II and II-A.
(c)
Reduced inspection.
Sampling plans for reduced inspection are those in Tables III and III-A.
(d)
Switching rules.
The normal inspection procedure shall be followed except when conditions in paragraph (d) (1) or (3) of this section are applicable or unless otherwise specified. Application of the following switching rules will be restricted to the inspection of lots for one applicant at a single location (plant, warehouse, etc.), and will be based upon records of original inspections of lots (excluding resubmitted lots) at that same location.
(1)
Normal inspection to reduced inspection.
When normal inspection is in effect, reduced inspection shall be instituted providing that reduced inspection is considered desirable by the Administrator and further provided that all of the following conditions are satisfied for each class of defect:
(i) The preceding 10 inspection lots (or more, as indicated by the note to Table III-B) which have been inspected within the preceding 6 months have been on normal inspection and none has been rejected on original inspection; and
(ii) The total number of defects in the samples from the preceding 10 inspection lots (or such other number of lots used for condition in paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section) is equal to or less than the applicable number given in Table III-B. If a double sampling plan is used, all samples inspected should be included, not “first” samples only; and
(2)
Reduced inspection to normal inspection.
When reduced inspection is in effect, normal inspection shall be reinstituted if any of the following occur:
(i) An inspection lot is rejected on original inspection; or
(ii) Production becomes irregular (delayed or accelerated); or
(iii) Other valid conditions warrant that normal inspection shall be reinstituted.
(3)
Normal inspection to tightened inspection.
When normal inspection is in effect, tightened inspection shall be instituted when 2 out of 5 consecutive inspection lots have been rejected on original inspection.
(4)
Tightened inspection to normal inspection.
When tightened inspection is in effect, normal inspection shall be reinstituted when five consecutive inspection lots have been considered acceptable on original inspection.
(e) When the rules require a switch in the inspection status because of one or more classes of defects, all classes of defects shall be inspected under the new inspection criteria. At the option of the user of the service and when approved by the Administrator, such user may elect to remain on normal inspection when qualified for reduced inspection, or on tightened inspection when qualified for normal inspection.
(f)
Appeal inspection
—(1)
Appeal request.
Any interested party who is not satisfied with the results of a condition inspection on packaged food containers, as stated on an official certificate, may request an appeal inspection.
(2)
How to file an appeal.
A request for an appeal inspection may be made orally or in writing. If made orally, written confirmation may be required. The applicant shall clearly state the reasons for requesting the appeal service and a description of the product to be appealed.
(3)
When an application for an appeal inspection may be refused.
When it appears that: (i) The reasons given in the request are frivolous or not substantial; or (ii) the condition of the containers has undergone a material change since the original inspection; or (iii) the original lot is no longer intact, the applicant's request for the appeal inspection may be refused. In such case, the applicant shall be promptly notified of the reason(s) for such refusal.
(4)
Who shall perform the appeal.
An appeal inspection shall be performed by a person(s) other than the person who made the inspection being appealed.
(5)
Sampling procedures.
The sampling plan for an appeal inspection shall be the next larger sampling plan from the plan in the table used in the original inspection.
(6)
Appeal certificate.
Immediately after an appeal inspection is completed, an appeal certificate shall be issued to show that the original inspection was sustained or was not sustained. Such certificate shall supersede any previously issued certificate for the inspection involved and shall clearly identify the number and date of the superseded certificate. The issuance of the appeal certificate may be withheld until the previously issued certificate and all copies have been returned when such action is deemed necessary to protect the interest of the Government.

§ 42.114
Procedures for evaluating interior container defects.
(a) Sections 42.101-42.136 provide procedures for determining lot conformance with the U.S. Standards for Condition of Food Containers. This determination is based on the examination of the external characteristics of the food containers.
(b) As an option, if a user of the inspection service requests to have the interior characteristics of containers examined, and apply these results in the determination of lot acceptability, the defects listed in Table XII may be used.
(c) The determination of lot acceptability based on internal container defects shall be independent of the determination of lot acceptability for U.S. Standards for Condition of Food Containers. A user of the inspection service may choose to require inspection for internal can defects as well as inspection for U.S. Standards for Condition of Food Containers.
(d) If a user of the inspection service requests an examination for internal container defects in addition to an official USDA/USDC inspection for product quality and/or U.S. grade, the containers opened by the official inspection service for inspection of product quality and/or U.S. grade will be used for examination of interior container defects. The minimum sample size for evaluation of interior container defects
will be 13 containers. As a result, additional containers will be required if the inspection for quality or U.S. grade calls for fewer than 13 containers. Table XIII provides acceptance numbers for internal container defects for selected sample sizes.

# Subpart C—Skip Lot Sampling and Inspection Procedures

# Source:
41 FR 42639, Sept. 28, 1976, unless otherwise noted. Redesignated at 42 FR 32514, June 27, 1977, and further redesignated at 46 FR 63203, Dec. 31, 1981.
§ 42.120
Description and qualification.
Skip lot sampling and inspection are special procedures for inspecting stationary lots in which only one-half or one-fourth of the lots offered for inspection are formally inspected. Skip lot sampling and inspection procedures may be instituted only when all of the following conditions are met:
(a) When authorized by the Administrator and acceptable to the user and producer, if different from the user.
(b) When inspection is origin inspection (see § 42.102).
(c) When all lots can be expected to be of essentially the same quality.
(d) When lots from the producer are currently on, or eligible to be on, either normal or reduced inspection.
§ 42.121
Sampling and inspection procedures.
(a) Following skip lot procedure authorization, inspect every lot consecutively offered for inspection using normal inspection procedures as set forth in Subpart B of this part. When 10 consecutive lots are acceptable, inspect only one-half of the lots offered for inspection using normal inspection procedures. While on the one-half inspection rate, when 10 consecutively inspected lots are acceptable, inspect only one-fourth of the lots offered for
inspection using normal inspection procedures. While on the one-half or one-fourth inspection rate, if any formally inspected lot is unacceptable, revert immediately to the inspection of every lot using normal inspection procedures and recommence the above procedure. See § 42.123 for a flow diagram of the skip lot sampling plan.
(b) Two exceptions to the procedures in paragraph (a) of this section are as follows:
(1) The skip lot sampling and inspection rate of one-half can be instituted immediately if the lots from the producer are currently on, or eligible to be on, reduced inspection and all other conditions in § 42.120 are met. After skip lot sampling and inspection begins, however, only normal inspection is permitted.
(2) While inspecting every lot consecutively as offered for inspection, i.e., while not on the one-half or one-fourth sampling and inspection rate, if requirements for switching from normal to tightened inspection are met as specified in § 42.108 then skip lot procedures terminate, tightened inspection is initiated, and stationary lot sampling and inspection procedures in Subpart B are instituted. Skip lot procedures may be instituted again only when all conditions of § 42.120 are met.
(c) All lot selections for the one-half and one-fourth inspection rates must be strictly random (for example, not every other lot or every fourth lot). Use of random number tables, coin flipping, or numbered cards is encouraged.
(d) Preliminary scanning procedures (see § 42.105) shall be used on all lots scheduled for formal inspection and also shall be used on lots not scheduled for inspection (“skipped” lots) whenever the inspector feels such action is prudent to further insure the acceptability of such lots.
§ 42.122
Applicability of other procedures.
Whenever appropriate, the procedures for classifying and recording defects in § 42.106 and for appeal inspections in § 42.108 also apply to skip lot sampling and inspection.

EC02SE91.000

# Notes:
1. Only normal inspection is permitted.
2. All lot selections for the one-half and one-fourth sampling rates must be strictly random (for example, not every other lot or every fourth lot).
3. Two exceptions to the procedures shown above are as follows:
(a) The skip lot sampling and inspection rate of one-half can be instituted immediately if the lots from the producer are currently on, or eligible to be on, reduced inspection and all other conditions in § 42.120 are met. When skip lot inspection begins, however, only normal inspection is permitted.
(b) While inspecting every lot consecutively as offered for inspection, i.e., while not on the one-half or one-fourth rate, if requirements for switching from normal to tightened inspection are met as specified in § 42.108 then skip lot procedures terminate, tightened inspection is initiated, and stationary lot sampling and inspection procedures in Subpart B are instituted. Skip lot procedures may be instituted again only when all conditions of § 42.120 are met.

§ 42.130
Description and qualifications.
(a) In many instances, food containers are loaded directly into carriers immediately after final packaging. This situation makes stationary lot sampling and inspection impractical. For such circumstances, the optional procedure for on-line sampling and inspection using cumulative sum sampling plans is provided. On-line sampling and inspection is a procedure in which subgroups of sampling units are selected randomly from predesignated portions of production. The acceptability of the portions of production is determined by inspecting, at the time of the sampling, the subgroups which represent these portions. On-line sampling and inspection contrasts with stationary lot procedures in which sample units are selected randomly and inspected and lot acceptability determinations are made only after lot production is completed.
(b) On-line sampling and inspection procedures may be instituted only when all of the following conditions are met:
(1) When authorized by the Administrator and acceptable to the user and producer, if different from the user.
(2) When inspection is origin inspection (see § 42.102).
(3) When previous production lots from the producer are currently on, or eligible to be on, either normal or reduced inspection. (When shifting from stationary lot sampling and inspection to on-line sampling and inspection, normal on-line inspection shall be initially used.)
(4) When inspection of the containers is performed at a point after which all condition of container related characteristics are fixed and will not be subject to change during final handling.
§ 42.131
Selection of samples.
(a) Prior to commencement of on-line sampling and inspection, the total amount of production for a given day or shift is predicted and is then subdivided into conveniently designated portions of production approximately equal in size. Portions may be designated by sequential numbers (e.g., containers 1 through 500 are portion 1, containers 501 through 1000 are portion 2, etc.) or by time intervals (e.g., the first half hour of production is portion 1, the second half hour of production is portion 2, etc.) during which the containers are identified by individual production codes for each time interval.
(b) Determine the number of sample units in a subgroup as follows:

# Type of Inspection and Number of Sample Units
Normal—25
Tightened—50
Reduced—13
(c) Subgroups are drawn randomly from portions of production throughout the production process and are inspected for defects. The drawing of sampling units may be done in either of two ways: (1) The number of sample units (13, 25 or 50) comprising a subgroup may be drawn at the same time from a randomly chosen point in the production of each portion, or (2) sample units may be drawn individually, but in a random manner, throughout the production of each portion. At least 6 subgroups must be obtained during each basic inspection period regardless of the system used to designate portions of production.
(d) A shift to on-line sampling plans from stationary lot sampling plans (or vice versa) during a basic inspection period is not permitted.
§ 42.132
Determining cumulative sum values.
(a) The parameters for the on-line cumulative sum sampling plans for AQL's applicable to origin inspection are as follows:

(b) At the beginning of the basic inspection period, the CuSum value is set equal to the starting value (“S”) for the specified CuSum plan. The CuSum value is then determined for each consecutive subgroup as follows:
(1) Add the number of defects for the present subgroup to the CuSum value of the previous subgroup.
(2) Subtract the subgroup tolerance (“T”).
(3) The CuSum value is reset in the following situations; however, determine portion of production acceptability (see § 42.133) prior to resetting the CuSum value:
(i) Reset the CuSum value to zero (0) if the CuSum value is less than zero (0).
(ii) Reset the CuSum value to the acceptance limit (“L”) if the CuSum value exceeds the acceptance limit (“L”).
§ 42.133
Portion of production acceptance criteria.
(a) The acceptability of a portion of production is determined by comparing the calculated CuSum value with the acceptance limit (“L”) for the specified AQL.
(b) A portion of production is acceptable if the CuSum value, calculated from the subgroup representing that portion, is equal to or less than the acceptance limit (“L”) for all classes of defects.
(c) A portion of production is rejected if the CuSum value, calculated from the subgroup representing that portion, exceeds the acceptance limit (“L”) for one or more classes of defects.
§ 42.134
Disposition of rejected portions of production.
Rejected portions of production from the same basic inspection period may be reworked, combined together to form a lot, and resubmitted for inspection under the criteria for tightened inspection using stationary lot sampling procedures described in subpart B of this part.
§ 42.135
Normal, tightened or reduced on-line inspection.
(a) Normal, tightened and reduced on-line sampling plans are specified in § 42.132 (Determining cumulative sum values). Normal plans shall be used except when the history of inspection permits reduced inspection or requires tightened inspection.
(b) Switching rules: Normal on-line inspection procedures shall be followed except when conditions in paragraph (b) (1) or (3) of this section are applicable or unless otherwise specified. Application of the following switching rules will be restricted to the inspection of production for one applicant at a single production location and will be based upon records of original inspections of production (excluding resubmitted portions previously rejected and reworked) at that same location.
(1)
Normal inspection to reduced inspection.
When normal inspection is in effect, reduced inspection shall be instituted provided that reduced inspection is considered desirable by the Administrator and further provided that all of the following conditions are satisfied for each class of defect:
(i) The preceding 40 consecutive portions of production have been on normal inspection and no more than one of these portions has been rejected on original inspection; and
(ii) The total number of defects in the subgroups (1000 sample units) from these preceding 40 consecutive portions of production is less than or equal to the following limit numbers for the specified AQL's:
Acceptable quality levels
Limit No.
0.25
0
1.5
9
6.5
54
(2)
Reduced inspection to normal inspection.
When reduced inspection is in effect, normal inspection shall be reinstituted if any of the following occurs:
(i) More than one portion of production in any 40 consecutive portions of production is rejected on original inspection; or
(ii) Production becomes irregular (delayed or accelerated); or
(iii) Other valid conditions warrant that normal inspection shall be reinstituted.
(3)
Normal inspection to tightened inspection.
When normal inspection is in
effect, tightened inspection shall be instituted when two out of five consecutive portions of production have been rejected.
(4)
Tightened inspection to normal inspection.
When tightened inspection is in effect, normal inspection shall be reinstituted when five consecutive portions of production have been considered acceptable.
(c) When the rules require a switch in the inspection status because of one or more classes of defects, all classes of defects shall be inspected under the new inspection criteria. At the option of the user of the service, and when approved by the Administrator, such user may elect to remain on normal inspection when qualified for reduced inspection, or on tightened inspection when qualified for normal inspection.
§ 42.136
Applicability of other procedures.
When appropriate, the procedures for classifying and recording defects in § 42.106 and for appeal inspections in § 42.108 also apply to on-line sampling and inspection.

# Authority:
Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946, as amended (7 U.S.C. 1621
et seq.
).
§ 42.140
Operating Characteristic (OC) curves for on-line sampling and inspection.
(a) This section contains the Operating Characteristic (OC) curve for each of the sampling plans given in Tables I, I-A, II, II-A, III, and III-A. The OC curve and the corresponding sampling plans are listed by AQL.
(b) Different acceptance and rejection criteria are provided for each AQL. The criteria for each AQL must be obtained from the applicable sampling plan tables.
(c) The curves show the ability of the various sampling plans to distinguish between good and bad lots. This can be illustrated by examining OC curve 6 for an AQL of 0.25 defects per hundred units in the Reduced and Normal Inspection Plans. If the quality of the lots submitted for inspection is poorer than the AQL of 0.25 defects per hundred units, fewer lots will be accepted. For example, OC curve 6 shows that when the quality of lots submitted for inspection is 1.0 defects per hundred units, only 26 percent of the lots are expected to be accepted. Conversely when the quality of the lots submitted for inspection is better than the AQL of 0.25 defects per hundred units, most lots are expected to be accepted. For example, the same OC curve 6 shows that when the quality of lots submitted for inspection is 0.10 defects per hundred units, about 99 percent of the lots are expected to be accepted.
(d) The table of sampling plans that correspond to OC curve 6 can be found over the curves for an AQL of 0.25 defects per hundred units in the Reduced and Normal Inspection Plan. An examination of this table reveals that there is one single and one double sampling plan that have OC curves comparable to OC curve 6. The first plan listed is a single plan requiring the inspection of 500 individual containers. Under this plan the lot is accepted as meeting the requirements for an AQL of 0.25 if there are 3 or less defects in the sample or rejected if there are 4 or more defects in the sample.
(e) The next plan that is listed in the column headed 6 for an AQL of 0.25 is a double sampling plan that requires the initial inspection of 228 individual containers. The lot will be accepted as meeting the requirements of an AQL of 0.25 if there are no defects in the sample, and rejected if there are 3 or more defects in the sample. In the event that the number of defects is between the acceptance (0) and rejection (3) numbers, additional containers must be inspected. In this case, the table indicates that a total of 516 containers must be inspected before a decision can be made to either accept or reject the lot. This will require the inspection of 288 more containers (516 − 228 = 288).
If there are 3 or less defects in the total sample, the lot will be accepted. If there are 4 or more defects in the total sample, the lot will be rejected. The other double sampling plans operate in a similar manner with the only differences being the sample sizes and acceptance and rejection numbers.

§ 42.141
Obtaining Operating Characteristic (OC) curve information for skip lot sampling and inspection.
The Operating Characteristic (OC) curve information (probability of acceptance) for skip lot sampling and inspection procedures described in § 42.121 is easily obtained from the single curve in § 42.142. The procedure for using the curve in § 42.142 is as follows:
(a) Select any sampling plan for normal condition of container inspection from Table I or Table I-A of § 42.109.
(b) For a given Quality of Submitted Lots, 100
p
, find the Percent of Lots Expected to be Accepted, Pa from the respective OC curve in § 42.140.
(c) Refer to § 42.142 with this Percent of Lots Expected to be Accepted, Pa, and read the new Percent of Lots Expected to be Accepted, Pas, which results when using these skip lot procedures.
For example, let's assume the lot size is 6,001 to 12,000 containers, and we use the single sampling plan of size 168 for normal inspection (Table I of § 42.109) along with an AQL for total defects of 6.5. The OC curve for this sampling plan is curve N and R3. Also, assume that the quality of the lot is 6.5 defects per hundred units. From curve N and R3, then, the Pa is determined to be 95 percent. Then refer to the graph in § 42.142 and locate Pa of 95 percent along the horizontal axis. From this point, proceed vertically to the curve and then horizontally to the left to the vertical axis. From this point on the vertical axis, Pas is determined to be approximately 98
1
percent for skip lot sampling and inspection.
1
This slight increase of Pas over Pa results because all the lots offered for inspection are no longer being inspected. Some lots are being “skipped”, and thereby accepted, which would have been rejected if inspected. The largest increase in Pa which will occur using skip lot sampling is approximately 4 percent. It is for this reason that skip lot sampling procedures are applied only in instances where past production quality has been consistently high—as evidenced by the requirement to have 10 consecutively acceptable lots prior to a reduction in sampling rate—and where all requirements in § 42.120 also have been met.

# Notes:
1. This curve applies only to the specific skip lot sampling and inspection plan described in §§ 42.121 and 42.123.
2. Pa and Pas are essentially equal for values under 50 percent.

§ 42.143
Operating Characteristic (OC) curves for on-line sampling and inspection.
(a) This section contains the Operating Characteristic (OC) curve for each of the on-line cumulative sum sampling plans provided in subpart D. The OC curve and the corresponding cumulative sum sampling plans are listed by AQL.
(b) Different plan parameters used to make acceptance and rejection decisions are provided for each AQL.
(c) The curves show the ability of the various cumulative sum sampling plans to distinguish between good and bad portions of production. The interpretation of these curves for portions of production is similar to the interpretation of the OC curves for stationary lots as illustrated in § 42.140(c).

# Definitions
§ 43.101
Meaning of words.
Words used in this subpart in the singular form shall be considered to impart the plural, or vice versa, as the case may demand.
§ 43.102
Definitions.
Statistical and inspection or sampling terms and their respective definitions that are used in the sampling plans and operating characteristic curves of which are pertinent to the understanding of inspection by attributes follow:
Acceptable quality level
(
AQL
). The AQL is expressed in terms of percent defective or defects per 100 units. Lots having a quality level equal to a specified AQL will be accepted approximately 95 percent of the time when using the sampling plans prescribed for that AQL.
Acceptance number
(
Ac
). The number in a sampling plan that indicates the maximum number of defects or defectives permitted in a sample in order to consider a lot as meeting a specific requirement.
Acceptance sampling.
The art or science that deals with procedures in which decisions to accept or reject lots or processes are based on the examination of samples.
Attributes.
Refers to the measurement of a given factor noting and recording the presence or absence of some characteristic (attribute) in each of the units in the group under consideration.
Consumer's risk.
The risk a consumer takes that a lot will be accepted by a sampling plan even though the lot does not conform to requirements. In the standards of this subpart this risk is nominally set at ten percent.
Consumer protection.
The ability of a sampling plan to reject unacceptable supplies. This is measured as the complement of the probability of acceptance (Pa) for the Limited Quality (LQ) lots. The consumer protection is 90 percent in these standards.
Defect.
A failure to meet a requirement imposed on a unit with respect to a single quality characteristic. A unit may contain more than one defect.
Defective.
A defective unit; one containing one or more defects with respect to the quality characteristic(s) under consideration.
Inspection.
The examination (including testing) of supplies (including, when appropriate, raw materials, components and intermediate assemblies).
(a)
Acceptance inspection.
An inspection to determine conformance of supplies to specified requirements in order to accept or reject the supplies.
(b)
Estimation inspection.
In dealing with attributes, an inspection to determine the amount of the supplies conforming to a specified requirement—usually expressed as a percentage.
Inspection by attributes.
Inspection whereby either the sample unit is classified as defective or non-defective with respect to a requirement or set of requirements (when on a “defective” basis); or, inspection whereby the number of defects in each sample unit is counted with respect to a requirement or set of requirements (when on a “defect” basis).
Limiting quality
(
LQ
). The LQ is expressed in terms of percent defective or defects per 100 units. Lots inspected under the standards of this subpart that have a ten percent probability of acceptance are referred to as a lot having a quality level equal to LQ.
Lot.
A collection of units of the same size, type and style which has been
manufactured or processed under essentially the same conditions. The term shall mean “inspection lot,” i.e., a collection of units of product from which a sample is to be drawn and inspected to determine conformance with the acceptability criteria. An inspection lot may differ from a collection of units designated as a lot for other purposes (e.g., production lot, shipping lot, etc.).
Lot size.
The number of units in the lot.
Operating characteristic curve
(
OC curve
). A curve that gives the probability of acceptance as a function of a specific lot quality level.
Probability of acceptance
(
Pa
). For a given sampling plan and a given quality of inspection lots, is that percentage of inspection lots expected to be accepted.
Process capability.
Performance of a process under normal operating conditions. The performance is measured with respect to specific characteristics.
Producer's risk.
The risk that a producer takes that a lot will be rejected by a sampling plan even though the lot conforms to requirements. In the standards of this subpart this risk is nominally set at five percent.
Random sampling.
A process of selecting a sample from a lot whereby each unit in the lot has an equal chance of being chosen. Ordinary haphazard choice is generally insufficient to guarantee randomness. Devices such as tables of random numbers are used to remove subjective biases inherent in personal choice.
Rejection number
(
Re
). The number in a sampling plan that indicates the minimum number of defects or defectives permitted in a sample that will cause a lot to fail a specific requirement.
Sample.
Any number of sample units which are to be used for inspection.
Sample size.
The number of sample units which are to be included in the sample.
Sample unit.
A container, the entire contents of a container, a portion of the contents of a container, a composite mixture of a product, or any other unit of container or commodity to be used for inspection.
Sampling.
The act of drawing or selecting sample units from a given lot.
Sampling plan.
A specific plan which states the sample size(s), acceptance number(s) and rejection number(s). In the standards of this subpart two types of sampling plans are provided:
(a)
Single sampling plan.
A sampling inspection scheme in which a decision to accept or reject an inspection lot is based on the inspection of a single sample. A single sampling plan consists of a single sample size with associated acceptance and rejection number(s).
(b)
Double sampling plan.
A sampling inspection scheme which involves use of two independently drawn but related samples, a first sample (n
1
) and a second sample which is added to the first to form a total sample size (n
t
). A double sampling plan consists of a first and total sample size with associated acceptance and rejection number(s). Inspection of the first sample leads to a decision to accept, to reject, or to take a second sample and the examination of a second sample, when required, always leads to a decision to accept or reject.

# Sampling Plans
§ 43.103
Purpose and scope.
(a) This subpart contains selected single and double sampling plans for inspection by attributes. They are to serve as a source of plans for developing sound specifications, standards, or sampling and inspection procedures.
(b) The sampling plans of this subpart and corresponding operating characteristic curves are indexed by acceptable quality level, AQL. The AQL's expressed in percent defectives or defects per hundred units are:
0.065
0.40
2.5
8.5
0.10
0.65
4.0
10.0
0.15
1.0
5.0
12.5
0.25
1.5
6.5
15.0
§ 43.104
Master table of single and double sampling plans.
(a) In the master table, a sampling plan is selected by first determining the sample size or sizes and AQL to be used. Then find the applicable acceptance (Ac) and rejection (Re) numbers at the intersection of the sample size(s) row and AQL column. These numbers together with the sample size or sizes constitute a sampling plan.
(b) Single sampling plans having a sample size of 66 or greater and an acceptance number of 1 are not included in the Master Table. These plans are listed in the tables which supplement the Master Table and accompany the OC curves as indexes to the comparable double sampling plans. The use of these single sampling plans do not facilitate the practice of using two or more AQL's simultaneously with the same sample size.
§ 43.105
Operating characteristics (OC) curves.
The OC curves shows the ability of the various sampling plans, presented for each AQL, to distinguish between lots of different quality.
§ 43.106
Choosing AQL's and sampling plans.
(a) The selection of AQL's and sampling plans for given lot sizes depends on too many factors to permit the issuance of a “pre-selected” standard set of plans for specified lot sizes. Each user of the standards of this subpart should select AQL's and sampling plans that are tailored to best meet his needs.
(b) Some of the factors that must be considered prior to selecting the AQL's are:
(1) Class of defects such as major and minor: Major defects would generally require lower AQL's than those for minor defects;
(2) Process capabilities under good commercial practice with respect to the defects in question: For example, if under normal production processes, the defect level cannot be kept below 2.0 percent defective, the selection of an AQL of 0.15 percent defective, although desirable for the defects in question, may not be practical;
(3) Consumer preferences: These may require higher AQL's or permit lower AQL's than process capabilities would indicate; and
(4) Time and cost required to sample and inspect a lot under various AQL's: The smaller the AQL the more time and cost of inspection.
(c) Some of the factors that may be considered prior to selecting the sampling plans for given lot sizes are:
(1) The applicable AQL(s): The AQL dictates, among other things, the smallest sample size that can be used and the size of the “jumps” from one sample size to the next larger one;
(2) The relative ability of the plans to discriminate between “good” and “bad” lots: Although several plans in these standards have the same AQL, they differ in their ability to reject lots worse than the AQL's. The OC curve in the standards of this subpart provide the basis for determining the discriminating ability of each plan;
(3) The amount, time, and cost of sampling required;
(4) The size and value of the lots relative to the producer and consumer protection a sampling plan affords: One may be willing to take larger risks of passing “bad” lots that are small or of lesser value than they would for larger more valuable lots;
(5) The knowledge about the lot(s) to be submitted for inspection: Lots consisting of product produced under essentially the same conditions may require smaller sample sizes than those consisting of product produced by different shifts and different raw stock for example; and
(6) The record of the quality level of previously submitted lots: The sample size can be smaller for lots submitted from a supplier with a consistent record of quality levels significantly better than the specified AQL(s) than sample sizes for the supplier whose records show considerable variability in quality, “borderline” supplies or product worse than the AQL.

Branch or additional business facility,
as used in section 3(b) of the Act, means an office or outlet in a location other than that of the principal or main office of a firm, out of which or through which the firm purchases, sells, negotiates contracts, solicits, or handles consignments, or otherwise contracts in perishable agricultural commodities including seasonal, part-time and full-time operations. As used in this paragraph, “branch or additional business facility” includes, but is not limited to, the following:

Good faith
means honesty in fact and the observance of reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing in the trade.

(ii)
Grocery wholesaler
is a dealer primarily engaged in the full-line wholesale distribution and resale of grocery and related nonfood items (such as perishable agricultural commodities, dry groceries, general merchandise, meat, poultry, and seafood, and health and beauty care items) to retailers. This term does not include persons primarily engaged in the wholesale distribution and resale of perishable agricultural commodities rather than other grocery and related nonfood items. Specifically, for an entity to be considered a grocery wholesaler, 50 percent or more of its annual gross sales must be from the full-line distribution and resale of grocery and related nonfood items, and it cannot have
more than 50 percent of its sales in perishable agricultural commodities. “Full line” means that an entity must be supplying the retailer with a wide range of products such as the grocery and related nonfood items specified.

If the applicant, in response to the Director's request, submits additional or corrected information for consideration in connection with his original application, the original application plus such information shall be considered as constituting a new application.
(g) Fees shall be refunded whenever an application is withdrawn without the filing of a new application.

If the renewal application is not filed and/or the renewal fee (if required) is not paid by the anniversary date, the licensee may obtain a renewal of that license at any time within 30 days by submitting the required renewal application and/or paying the renewal fee (if required), plus $50.

# Accounts and Records (General)
§ 46.14
General.
(a) Every commission merchant, dealer, and broker shall prepare and preserve for a period of two years from the closing date of the transaction the accounts, records, and memoranda required by the Act, which shall fully and correctly disclose all transactions involved in his business. Licensees shall keep records which are adapted to the particular business that the licensee is conducting and in each case such records shall fully disclose all transactions in the business in sufficient detail as to be readily understood and audited. It is impracticable to specify in detail every class of records which may be found essential since many different types of business are conducted in the produce industry and many different types of contracts are made covering a wide range of services by agents and others. The responsibility is placed on every licensee to maintain records which will disclose all essential facts regarding the transactions in his business.
(b) Every commission merchant, dealer, and broker shall prepare and
preserve records and memoranda required by the Act which shall fully and correctly disclose the true ownership and management of such business during the preceding four years. Such records shall include the number and location of all branches or additional business facilities operated by or for the commission merchant, dealer or broker. In the case of a corporation, such records shall include the corporate charter, record of stock subscription and stock issued, the amounts paid in for stock and minutes of stockholders' and directors' meetings showing the election of directors and officers, resignations and other pertinent corporate actions. In the case of a partnership, the records shall contain a copy of the partnership agreement showing the type of partnership, the full names and addresses of all partners including general, special or limited partners, the partnership interest of each individual and any other pertinent records of the partnership.
[28 FR 7067, July 11, 1963; 28 FR 7287, July 17, 1963, as amended at 44 FR 50576, Aug. 29, 1979]

§ 46.16
Method of preservation or storage of records.
All records required to be preserved under the Act shall be stored in an orderly manner and in keeping with sound business practices. The records being currently used shall be filed in order of dates, by serial numbers, alphabetically or by any other proper method which will enable the licensee to promptly locate and produce the records. Records in dead storage should be arranged in an orderly fashion, be packaged or wrapped to insure proper preservation, be adequately marked or identified, and stored in a safe, dry location. When part of the records are forwarded to others (such as accountants, traffic agencies, attorneys, etc.), proper notations should be filed in appropriate places in the records identifying the missing records and stating where they can be located.
§ 46.17
Inspection of records.
(a) Each licensee shall, during ordinary business hours, promptly upon request, permit any duly authorized representative of USDA to enter its place of business and inspect such accounts, records, and memoranda as may be material:
(1) In the investigation of complaints under the Act, including any petition, written notification, or complaint under section 6 of the Act,
(2) To the determination of ownership, control, packer, or State, country, or region of origin in connection with commodity inspections,
(3) To ascertain whether there is compliance with section 9 of the Act,

(b) Any necessary facilities for such inspection shall be extended to such representative by the licensee, its agents, and employees.
[62 FR 15087, Mar. 31, 1997]

# Records of Market Receivers
§ 46.18
Record of produce received.
Market receivers shall keep in the order of receipt a record of all produce received and this record shall be in the form of a book (preferably a bound
book) with numbered pages or comparable business record. This record shall clearly show for each lot the date of arrival and unloading; whether received by freight, express, truck, or otherwise; the car initials and number; the truck license number and the driver's name or the name of the trucking firm; the number of packages or the quantity received; the kind of produce; the name and address of the consignor or seller; whether the produce was purchased; consigned or received on joint account; and the disposition of the produce, whether jobbed or sold in carlots or trucklots, and the lot number assigned to the shipment by the receiver (as required by § 46.20).
§ 46.19
Sales tickets.
Sales tickets shall bear printed serial numbers running consecutively and shall be used in numerical order so far as practicable. No serial number shall be repeated within a 90-day period. The sales tickets shall be prepared and all the details of the sale shall be entered on the tickets in a legible manner in order that an audit can be readily made. Erasures, strike-outs, changes, etc., should be held to the minimum. When errors are made in preparing sales tickets, the tickets should be voided. Each sales ticket shall show the date of sale, the purchaser's name (so far as practicable), the kind, quantity, the unit price, and the total selling price of the produce. Each sales ticket shall show the lot number of the shipment if the produce is being handled on consignment or on joint account. Sales tickets on all other lots of the same commodity which are on hand at the same time shall also show a lot number. The original or a legible carbon copy of each sales ticket, including those voided or unused, shall be accounted for and shall be filed or stored either by dates of sales or in the order of the serial numbers for a period of two years.
§ 46.20
Lot numbers.
An identifying lot number shall be assigned to each shipment of produce to be sold on consignment or joint account or for the account of another person or firm. A lot number should be assigned to any purchased shipment in dispute between the parties to assist in proving damages. A lot number shall be assigned to each purchased shipment of similar produce on hand at that time or received later while the consigned or joint account or disputed lot is being sold. A lot number shall be assigned to each purchased shipment which is reconditioned if the seller is to be charged with the shrinkage or loss. The lot number shall be entered on the receiving record in connection with each shipment and entered on all sales tickets identifying and segregating the sales from the various shipments on hand. The lot number shall be entered on the sales tickets by the salesmen at the time of sale or by the produce dispatcher, and not by bookkeepers or others after the sales have been made. No lot number shall be repeated within a period of 30 days after the last sale from the preceding lot to which such number was assigned.
§ 46.21
Returns, rejections, or credit memorandums on sales.
In the event of the rejection and return of any produce sold for or on behalf of another, on consignment, or on joint account, or of any necessary allowance or adjustment being made to the buyers thereof, a credit memorandum showing the buyer's name, sales ticket number, lot number, date of the granting of the allowance, and amount of the credit or adjustment, with reasons therefor, shall be made or a notation shall be made on the original sales ticket referring to the adjustment and showing where the credit memorandum is filed. The credit memorandum shall be on a regular form, in a ledger book, or on a sales ticket or invoice properly completed to show the facts and shall be approved by a duly authorized person. Credits granted shall be entered in the same records as the original sales tickets.
§ 46.22
Accounting for dumped produce.
A clear and complete record shall be maintained showing justification for dumping of produce received on joint account, on consignment, or handled for or on behalf of another person if any portion of such produce regardless of percentage cannot be sold due to
poor condition or is lost through re-sorting or reconditioning. In addition to the foregoing, if five percent or more of a shipment is dumped, an official certificate, or other adequate evidence, shall be obtained to prove the produce was actually without commercial value, unless there is a specific agreement to the contrary between the parties. The original certificate or other adequate evidence justifying dumping shall be forwarded to the consignor or joint account partner with the accounting and a copy shall be retained by the receiver.
§ 46.23
Evidence of dumping.
Reasonable cause for destroying any produce exists when the commodity has no commercial value or when it is dumped by order of a local health officer or other authorized official or when the shipper has specifically consented to such disposition. The term “commercial value” means any value that a commodity may have for any purpose that can be ascertained by the exercise of due diligence without unreasonable expense or loss of time. When produce is being handled for or on behalf of another person, proof as to the quantities of produce destroyed or dumped in excess of five percent of the shipment shall be provided by procuring an official certificate showing that the produce has no commercial value from any person authorized by the Department to inspect fruits and vegetables. Where such inspection service is not available certification may be obtained from (a) any health officer or food inspector of any State, county, parish, city or municipality or of the District of Columbia; (b) any established commercial agency or service making inspections for the fruit and vegetable industry; or (c) when no inspector or health officer designated above is available consideration will be given to other evidence such as inspection and certification made by any two persons having no financial interest in the produce involved or in the business of any person financially interested therein, and who are unrelated by blood or marriage to any such financially interested person, and who, at the time of the inspection and certification, and for a period of at least one year immediately prior thereto, have been engaged in the handling of the same general kind or class of produce with respect to which the inspections and certification are to be made. Any certificate issued by any persons designated in paragraph (c) of this section shall include a statement that each of them possesses the requisite qualifications. Any such certificate shall properly identify the produce by showing the commodity, lot number, brand or principal identifying marks on the containers, quantity dumped, name and address of shipper, name and address of applicant, condition of the produce, time, place, and date of inspection and a statement that the produce possesses no commercial value.

# Records of Retailers
§ 46.24
Records of retailers.
Notwithstanding the specific records and documents prescribed in the foregoing sections, licensees who purchase produce solely for sale at retail shall establish and maintain accounts and records, adapted to their type of operations, which will fully and correctly disclose all transactions relating to the purchase of produce. Such accounts and records should include the date of receipt of each lot, kind of produce, number of packages and quantity, price paid, evidence of agreement, or contract of purchase, bills of lading, paid bills, and any other documents relating to the purchase of produce.

# Auction Sales
§ 46.25
Auction sales.
Commission merchants, dealers and brokers who offer produce for sale through auction companies which publish catalogs of offerings will be responsible for furnishing the auction company for publication true and correct information concerning the ownership of the produce. When the produce is offered for sale by an owner, his name shall be shown in the catalog listing as owner. When a joint account partner makes an offering, his name as well as that of his joint partner, or partners, shall be shown. When any person offers produce for sale at auction for the account of another, the
name, or names of the owner, if known, and of his principal shall be shown. In addition to listing such name or names he may show that he is acting in the capacity of agent. If a person instructs an auction company to catalog a shipment without disclosing true ownership, if known, or the name of an agent's principal, he shall be deemed to have made a false or misleading statement within the meaning of the Act. Since sales at auctions normally involve additional expenses, a broker, grower's agent or commission merchant shall have prior consent from his principal before such disposition is accomplished. Where a dispute exists regarding the ownership of produce, it may be listed in the auction catalog as being offered for sale “for the account of whom concerned” with the name of the party making the offering shown as agent.

# Duties of Licensees
§ 46.26
Duties of licensees.
It is impracticable to specify in detail all of the duties of brokers, commission merchants, joint account partners, growers' agents and shippers because of the many types of businesses conducted. Therefore, the duties described in these regulations are not to be considered as a complete description of all of the duties required but is merely a description of their principal duties. The responsibility is placed on each licensee to fully perform any specification or duty, express or implied, in connection with any transaction handled subject to the Act.

# Brokers
§ 46.27
Types of broker operations.
(a) Brokers carry on their business operations in several different ways and are generally classified by their method of operation. The following are some of the broad groupings by method of operation. The usual operation of brokers consists of the negotiation of the purchase and sale of produce either of one commodity or of several commodities. A broker is usually engaged by only one of the parties, but in negotiating a contract the broker acts as a special agent of first one and then the other party in conveying offers, counter offers, and acceptances between the parties. Once the contract is formed, and the confirmation issued, the broker's duties are usually ended, and the broker is not the proper party to whom notice of breach or of rejection should be directed. However, a broker receiving notice has a duty to promptly convey the notice to the proper party. Frequently, brokers never see the produce they are quoting for sale or negotiating for purchase by the buyer, and they carry out their duties by conveying information received from the parties between the buyer and seller until a contract is effected. Generally, the seller of the produce invoices the buyer, however, when there is a specific agreement between the broker and its principal, the seller invoices the broker who, in turn, invoices the buyer, collects, and remits to the seller. Under other types of agreements, the seller ships the produce to pool buyers, and the broker as an accommodation to the seller invoices the buyers, collects, and remits to the seller. Also, there are times when the broker is authorized by the seller to act much like a commission merchant, being given blanket authority to dispose of the produce for the seller's account either by negotiation of sales to buyers not known to the seller or by placing the produce for sale on consignment with receivers in the terminal markets.
(b) There is a second general grouping of brokers which are commonly referred to as buying brokers. Their operations are typified by the fact that they act as the buyer's representative in negotiating purchases at shipping points, terminal markets, or intermediate points. Their typical type of operation is to negotiate a purchase on the buyer's instructions and authorization. Sometimes the broker negotiates the purchase without seeing the produce. In other instances he may select the merchandise after forming an appraisal of the quality of the produce being offered for sale on the market. Generally, a purchase is made in the buyer's name and the seller invoices the buyer direct. On the other hand, acting on authority given him by the
buyer, the broker may negotiate purchases in his own name, pay the seller for the produce, make arrangements for its loading and shipment, and bill the buyer direct for the cost price plus the brokerage fee and the cost of any agreed upon accessorial service charges such as ice, loading, etc.
[28 FR 7067, July 11, 1963; 28 FR 7287, July 17, 1963, as amended at 62 FR 15087, Mar. 31, 1997]
§ 46.28
Duties of brokers.
(a)
General.
The function of a broker is to facilitate good faith negotiations between parties which lead to valid and binding contracts. A broker who fails to perform any specification or duty, express or implied, in connection with any transaction is in violation of the Act, is subject to the penalties specified in the Act, and may be held liable for damages which accrue as a result of the violation. It shall be the duty of the broker to fully inform the parties concerning all proposed terms and conditions of the proposed contract. After all parties agree on the terms and the contract is effected, the broker shall prepare in writing and deliver promptly to all parties a properly executed confirmation or memorandum of sale setting forth truly and correctly all of the essential details of the agreement between the parties, including any express agreement as to the time when payment is due. The confirmation or memorandum of sale shall also identify the party who engaged the broker to act in the negotiations. If the confirmation or memorandum of sale does not contain such information, the broker shall be presumed to have been engaged by the buyer. Brokers do not normally act as general agents of either party, and will not be presumed to have so acted. Unless otherwise agreed and confirmed, the broker will be entitled to payment of brokerage fees from the party by whom it was engaged to act as broker. The broker shall retain a copy of such confirmations or memoranda as part of its accounts and records. The broker who does not prepare these documents and retain copies in its files is failing to prepare and maintain complete and correct records as required by the Act. The broker who does not deliver copies of these documents to all parties involved in the transaction is failing to perform its duties as a broker. A broker who issues a confirmation or memorandum of sale containing false or misleading statements shall be deemed to have committed a violation of section 2 of the Act. If the broker's records do not support its contentions that a binding contract was made with proper notice to the parties, the broker may be held liable for any loss or damage resulting from such negligence, or for other penalties provided by the Act for failing to perform its express or implied duties. The broker shall take into consideration the time of delivery of the shipment involved in the contract, and all other circumstances of the transaction, in selecting the proper method for transmitting the written confirmation or memorandum of sale to the parties. A buying broker is required to truly and correctly account to its principal in accordance with § 46.2(y)(3). The broker should advise the appropriate party promptly when any notice of rejection or breach is received, or of any other unforeseen development of which it is informed.
(b)
Brokerage fees.
A broker is not considered to be entitled to a brokerage fee unless he effects a sale or makes a valid and binding contract, fully performing his duties as a broker. Unless otherwise specifically agreed, the broker does not guarantee the performance of the contracting parties and is entitled to receive prompt payment of the brokerage fee whenever a valid and binding contract is negotiated. Brokerage fees may be charged to only one of the parties to the contract unless by prior agreement the parties agree to split the brokerage fee. If the brokerage fee is charged to both parties without a specific prior agreement, such action by the broker is a violation of the Act. A broker employed to negotiate the sale of produce may not employ another broker or selling agent, including auction companies, without the specific prior approval of his principal. When the broker is authorized to sell, invoice the buyer, collect and remit to his principal, he shall render an itemized accounting to the principal promptly on receipt of payment, showing the true gross selling price, all brokerage fees
deducted, any auction charges and any other expenses incurred in connection with the sale of the shipment. The failure to account truly and correctly and make full payment promptly is a violation of the Act.
(c)
Broker's responsibility for payment.
In the absence of a specific agreement, a broker is not responsible for payment to the seller by the buyer. Agreement to collect from the buyer and remit to the seller is not a guarantee by the broker that the buyer will pay for the produce purchased, unless there is a specific agreement by the broker that he will pay if the buyer does not pay. A broker who agrees to collect funds from the buyer for his principal shall render an itemized accounting to the principal promptly on receipt of payment showing the true gross selling price, all brokerage fees deducted and all expenses including auction charges, incurred in connection with the sale of the shipment. The failure to account truly and correctly and make full payment promptly is a violation of the Act. While the broker is not obliged to furnish his principal information regarding the financial condition of the buyer, if the broker furnishes such information, he must truthfully report the information available to him, and any false or misleading statements for a fraudulent purpose to the principal to encourage the sale will be a violation of the Act. A buying broker who negotiates a purchase in his own name under an agreement with his principal, is responsible for payment of the purchase price to the seller. A broker has no authority to grant allowances or adjust the seller's invoice price to the buyer without the specific prior approval of his principal.
(d)
Purchases and sales by brokers.
A person who operates in a dual capacity, both as a broker and a dealer, shall clearly disclose his status in each transaction to all parties with whom he is dealing. If such a person misrepresents himself as a broker to the buyer or the seller when he is acting as a dealer purchasing produce or selling produce he has purchased, he shall be considered to have violated the Act. When a person purchases or sells produce as a dealer, he shall not request or receive a brokerage fee from the buyer or the seller. A broker shall not negotiate a transaction where the broker is subject to the direct or indirect control of any party to the transaction other than his principal, or where the other party is subject to the direct or indirect control of the broker without fully disclosing the circumstances to his principal and obtaining his specific prior approval.
(e)
Filing carrier claims by brokers.
Without prior consent of the owner, a broker has no authority to file claims with carriers in his own name or any other name. A broker has no obligation to file carrier claims for the owners of the shipments. However, when a broker in a transaction receives information valuable to the owner in connection with carrier claim rights, the broker should promptly advise the owner. A broker who agrees to protect the carrier claims of owners shall at all times exercise reasonable care to fulfill such obligation. If a broker makes an agreement with a seller or a buyer to file and handle such a claim for the benefit of the owner of the produce, the claim shall be filed promptly with the carrier, supported by adequate evidence, and he shall take the necessary action to bring the matter to a conclusion. A copy of the claim shall be forwarded to the owner of the shipment when the claim is filed. When settlement of the claim is effected, the broker shall promptly remit the net amount due the owner, after deducting the agreed or customary charges for handling the claim. Adequate information shall be furnished the owner regarding the claim while the matter is being handled with the carrier. If the owner files the claim, the broker shall promptly furnish any necessary information available in his records which is requested by the owner.

# Receiving Market Commission Merchants and Joint Account Partners
§ 46.29
Duties.
(a)
General.
All licensees who accept produce for sale on consignment or on joint account are required to exercise
reasonable care and diligence in disposing of the produce promptly and in a fair and reasonable manner. A commission merchant engaged to sell consigned produce may not employ another person or firm, including auction companies, to dispose of all or part of such produce without the specific prior authority of the consignor. A commission merchant is not authorized to sell consigned produce outside the market area where he is located without obtaining the permission of the consignor. Averaging or pooling of sales is not permissible unless the receiver obtains the specific written permission of the consignor prior to rendering the accounting. Complete and detailed records shall be prepared and maintained by all commission merchants and joint account partners covering produce received, sales, quantities lost, dates and cost of repacking or reconditioning, unloading, handling, freight, demurrage or auction charges, and any other expenses which are deducted on the accounting, in accordance with the provisions of § 46.18 through § 46.23. When rendering account sales for produce handled for or on behalf of another, an accurate and itemized report of sales and expenses charged against the shipment shall be made. It is a violation of section 2 of the Act to fail to render true and correct accountings in connection with consignments or produce handled on joint account. Charges which cannot be supported by proper evidence in the records of the commission merchant or joint account partner shall not be deducted. The commission merchant or joint account partner may be held liable for any financial loss and for other penalties provided by the Act, due to his negligence or failure to perform any specification or duty, express or implied, arising out of any transaction subject to the Act.
(b)
Commission charges.
Before accepting produce on consignment, the parties should reach a definite agreement on the amount of the commission and other charges which will be assessed by the commission merchant. In the absence of such an agreement, only the usual and customary commission and other charges shall be permitted. The receiver may not reconsign produce to another person or firm, including auction companies, and incur additional commissions, charges or expenses without the specific prior authority of the consignor. Unless otherwise agreed upon by the parties, joint account partners shall not charge a commission fee or other selling charges against the joint account for disposing of the produce. When a portion of a consigned shipment is purchased by the commission merchant he shall not charge or receive a commission fee for such sales.
(c)
Purchasing consigned produce.
A commission merchant or joint account partner may not purchase produce received on consignment or joint account or sell such produce to any person or firm over whose business he has direct or indirect control, or to any person or firm having direct or indirect control over his business, without specific prior authority of the consignor or the joint account partner. However, produce may be purchased by the commission merchant or joint account partner at reasonable market value to clean up remnants of shipments so accountings will not be unduly delayed, provided the accounting shows the quantity and price of the goods bought by the commission merchant or joint account partner. “Remnants,” as used here, mean small quantities remaining after the bulk of the shipment has been sold but shall not exceed 5 percent of the shipment. When consigned produce is purchased by a commission merchant he shall not charge or receive a commission fee for such sales.
(d)
Filing carrier claims.
Without the prior consent of the owner of the produce, a commission merchant has no authority to file claims with carriers in his own name or any other name:
Provided,
That the commission merchant may file a claim for breakage where the owner has been paid for the full value of the produce without any deduction for damage. Commission merchants have no obligation to file carrier claims on shipments for the owners. However, when a commission merchant in a transaction receives information valuable to the consignor in connection with carrier claim rights, the commission merchant should promptly advise the consignor. Before a commission merchant files a carrier
claim on a consigned shipment, a specific agreement shall be reached with the consignor. If a commission merchant is authorized and agrees to file the claim, he shall forward a copy of the claim filed with the carrier to the consignor and shall exercise reasonable care to protect the interests of the consignor by filing the claim promptly and in the proper amount, supported by adequate evidence, and shall take the necessary action to bring the matter to a conclusion. When settlement of the claim is effected, he shall promptly remit the net amount due the consignor, after deducting the agreed handling charges. Full and complete information shall be furnished the consignor while the claim is being handled. If the consignor is to file the claim, the commission merchant shall exercise reasonable care to protect the claim rights of the consignor and shall promptly furnish all necessary information and evidence from his records to enable the consignor to file a proper claim. A joint account partner who files a carrier claim on behalf of the partnership shall forward a copy of the claim filed with the carrier to his partner, keep him advised of its status, and remit promptly his share of the net proceeds realized from such claim.

# Growers' Agents and Shippers
§ 46.30
Types of operations by growers' agents and shippers.
(a) The usual operations of shippers consist of purchasing produce from growers in their own names. They distribute the produce in commerce by selling, consigning, or jointing the shipments, assuming any loss or profits that result from these operations. In addition, shippers may handle produce on joint account with growers or others.
(b) Growers' agents sell and distribute produce for or on behalf of growers and others and, in addition, may perform a wide variety of services, such as financing, planting, harvesting, grading, packing, furnishing labor, seed, containers, and other supplies or services. They usually distribute the produce in their own names and collect payment direct from the consignees. They render accountings to their principals, paying the net proceeds after deducting their expenses and fees. Some agents are limited by contract to making only sales and cannot joint or consign produce without obtaining the prior consent of the growers. Other agents are granted blanket authority by the growers to market and distribute the produce, using their discretion as to the best methods, depending on market conditions and the quality of the produce available. They can sell, consign or ship on joint account, use the services of brokers or sell through terminal market auctions. They are authorized to grant credits, make adjustments in the invoice price, handle claims with the carriers, or even abandon shipments, when circumstances justify such action, without consulting the growers. Some agents have an agreement with the growers to pool the produce and render accountings on the basis of the average or prorated selling prices after deducting the prorated expenses incurred for the various operations performed and the agents' selling fees. Some agents's contracts require an accounting on the basis of actual selling prices after deducting the actual expenses incurred for services performed and the selling fees. Some agents' contracts specify a fixed charge for harvesting, grading, packing, furnishing the container or other services, plus a selling fee, and thereby substantially reduce the record requirements necessary to prove the cost of the various operations.
§ 46.31
Duties of shippers.
(a)
General.
The responsibilities of shippers vary with their contracts with growers to purchase produce or to handle produce on joint account. Similarly, their responsibilities to their customers depend upon their contracts to sell, consign or joint account produce with dealers on terminal markets. Shippers shall pay promptly for produce purchased and any deficits incurred on consigned shipments. They shall fully comply with their obligations in connection with joint account transactions. A shipper who fails to perform any express or implied duty is in violation of the Act and may be held liable for any damages resulting therefrom. The shipper shall prepare and
maintain records which fully and correctly disclose the details of his transactions.
(b)
Receiving records.
Each shipper shall prepare and maintain a record of all produce handled including his own production. This record shall be in the form of a book (preferably a bound book), with numbered pages or comparable business records. This receiving record shall show for each lot the date received, whether purchased or received on joint account, the quantity, quality, and kind of produce, the purchase price or joint account cost, and the name and address of the supplier. Shippers shall issue receipts to growers and others for all produce received.
(c)
Disposition records.
When a shipper purchases produce from growers or others, his records shall also show the disposition of the produce, whether sold or consigned, date of shipment, car number, or if shipped by truck, the license number, name and address of the carrier, name and address of the buyer, commission merchant or auction, and other pertinent details of the transaction, such as the terms of sale, selling price, and date of payment.
(d)
Joint accounts with growers.
When a shipper enters into a joint account transaction with growers or others, the agreement between the parties should be reduced to a written contract clearly defining the duties and responsibilities of both parties and the extent of the shipper's authority in distributing the produce. The shipper shall prepare and maintain records to show in detail the actual expenses incurred for the services he furnishes, such as harvesting, grading, packing and selling the produce (unless a fixed charge is agreed upon by the parties to cover the cost of these services), methods of distribution and proceeds received for the produce. If a shipper is at the same time handling similar produce not involved in the joint account transaction, a lot number or other positive means of identification shall be assigned to each lot of produce received in order to segregate and identify the various lots of produce. If a shipper consigns all or part of the produce or employs the services of brokers or terminal market auctions, his records shall show the results of these transactions, including the expenses involved and the names and addresses of the commission merchants, brokers, and the auctions. The shipper shall render a detailed and accurate accounting and pay promptly the net proceeds due the joint partner, in accordance with § 46.2(y), (z), and (aa). The accounting shall disclose the status of all claims collected or filed with the carriers.
(e)
Joint accounts with receivers.
When a shipper enters into a joint account agreement with a terminal market dealer, the agreement should be reduced to writing clearly defining the terms of the agreement. The shipper's records shall show the expenses which may be properly charged in accordance with the joint agreement, purchase price or joint account cost of the produce, and cost of harvesting, packing, grading, or other expenses. His records shall show the quantity and quality of the produce packed and shipped, the dates and methods of shipment, and all other pertinent details of his operation. At the conclusion of the transaction, a detailed and accurate accounting shall be furnished promptly to the joint partner, in accordance with § 46.2(z). If a deficit results, the shipper shall pay promptly his share of the deficit.
§ 46.32
Duties of growers' agents.
(a)
General.
The duties, responsibilities, and extent of the authority of a growers' agent depend on the type of contract made with the growers. Agreements between growers and agents should be reduced to a written contract clearly defining the duties and responsibilities of both parties and the extent of the agent's authority in distributing the produce. When such agreements between the parties are not reduced to written contracts, the agent shall have available a written statement describing the terms and conditions under which he will handle the produce of the grower during the current season and shall mail or deliver this statement to the grower on or before receipt of the first lot. A grower will be considered to have agreed to these terms if, after receiving such statement, he delivers his produce to the agent for handling in the usual
manner. In the event an unsolicited lot of produce is accepted by an agent for handling in his usual manner, he shall promptly deliver or mail a copy of such statement to the grower. A copy of this statement, showing the name of the grower and the date the statement was delivered to the grower, shall be retained in the agent's files. An agent who does not have in his files either written contracts or a written statement as required herein is failing to prepare and maintain full and complete records as required by the Act.
Provided,
That regulations or bylaws of cooperative marketing associations may be used in lieu of individual agreements or contracts to determine the methods of accounting and settlement with their grower members. An agent who fails to perform any specification or duty, express or implied, is in violation of the Act and may be held liable for any damages resulting therefrom and for other penalties provided under the Act for such failure.
(b)
Accounting for charges.
A growers' agent whose operations include such services as the planting, harvesting, grading, packing, furnishing of containers or other supplies, storing, selling or distributing produce for or on behalf of growers shall prepare and maintain complete records on all transactions in sufficient detail as to be readily understood and audited. Agents must be in a position to render to the growers accurate and detailed accountings covering all aspects of their handling of the produce. Agents shall maintain a record of all produce received in the form of a book (preferably a bound book) with numbered pages or comparable business records, showing for each lot the date received, quantity, the kind of produce and the name and address of the grower. Agents shall issue receipts to growers and others for all produce received. A lot number or other positive means of identification shall be assigned to each lot in order to segregate the various lots of produce received from different growers from similar produce being handled at the same time. Each lot shall be so identified and segregated throughout all operations conducted by the agent, including the sale or other disposition of the produce. The records shall show the result of all packing and grading operations, including the quantity lost through packing and grading and the quantity and quality packed out. If the culls are sold, they shall be included in the accounting. Unless there is a specific agreement with the growers to pool all various growers' produce, the accounting to each of the growers shall itemize the actual expenses incurred for the various operations conducted by the agent and all the details of the disposition of the produce received from each grower including all sales, adjustments, rejections, details of consigned or jointed shipments and sales through brokers, auctions, and status of all claims filed with or collected from the carriers. The agent shall prepare and maintain full and complete records on all details of such distribution to provide supporting evidence for the accounting. If an agent is working under a pool agreement with growers, the accounting shall show how the pool cost and pool sales prices are computed. If the agent and the growers have agreed on a fixed charge to cover the various operations conducted by the agent, actual expenses incurred for these services covered by the agreement are not required to be shown in the accounting. The failure of the agent to render prompt, accurate and detailed accountings in accordance with § 46.2 (z) and (aa), is a violation of the Act.
(c)
Sales through brokers or auctions.
Unless a growers' agent is specifically authorized in his contract with the growers to use the services of brokers, commission merchants, joint partners, or auctions, he is not entitled to use these methods of marketing the growers' produce. Any expense incurred for such services, without the growers' permission, cannot be charged to the growers.
(d)
Filing of carrier claims.
Without the prior consent of the growers, an agent has no authority to file claims with the carriers in his own name or any other name. An agent has no obligation to file carrier claims on shipments for growers in the absence of a specific agreement to perform these duties. All information which an agent has received in handling the shipment which is essential for the growers to
file such claims shall be made available to the growers. If an agent has an agreement with the growers to file and handle carrier claims, he shall exercise reasonable care in handling the claims with the carriers by filing the claim promptly in the proper amount, supported by adequate evidence, and take any necessary action to bring the matter to a conclusion.
(e)
Purchases and sales by growers' agents.
A person who operates in a dual capacity, both as a growers' agent and as a shipper, shall clearly disclose his status in each transaction to all parties with whom he is dealing. If such a person misrepresents himself as an agent, when he is acting as a shipper selling produce he has purchased, he shall be considered to have violated the Act. A growers' agent shall not charge or receive a fee from the seller or the buyer when he purchases or sells produce as a shipper. A growers' agent shall not negotiate a transaction where he is subject to the direct or indirect control of any party to such transactions, other than his principal, or where the other party is subject to the agent's direct or indirect control, without fully disclosing the circumstances to his principal and obtaining his specific prior approval.
(f)
Negligence of agent.
A growers' agent may be held liable for any loss or damage resulting to the growers due to his negligence or failure to perform any specification or duty, express or implied, arising out of any undertaking in connection with transactions subject to the Act.
(g)
Responsibility for payment.
An agent is not responsible for the payment by the buyer who has purchased the growers' produce on credit, unless he guarantees payment or is negligent in extending credit. Agreement to collect from the buyer and remit to his principal is not a guarantee by the agent that the agent will pay if the buyer does not pay.
(h)
Responsibility for payment of selling fees and expenses to the growers' agent.
In the absence of a specific agreement to the contrary, the agent does not guarantee the performance of the contracting parties and he is entitled to the payment of his selling fees and expenses incurred in handling the produce of growers or others, providing he fully performs his duties as agent.
(i)
Agent's financial responsibility to buyers for failure to comply with contracts.
If a growers' agent contracts in his own name to deliver produce to a buyer and subsequently cannot deliver produce complying with the contract because the growers cannot or will not deliver such produce to him, he may be liable to the buyer for damages resulting from the breach of the contract.

# Conversion of Funds
§ 46.33
Conversion of funds.
Any licensee who collects or receives funds for or on behalf of another person or firm in connection with produce shall not make any use or disposition of such funds in his possession or control that will endanger or impair faithful and prompt payment to the owner or consignor of the produce or to any other person having a financial interest therein.

# Disclosure of Business
§ 46.34

(b) Except in the case of any license automatically suspended by the Act, a reasonable time shall be allowed, which shall not be less than 10 days between the date of issuance of the order of suspension or revocation and the date upon which such order becomes effective, during which period the licensee may make all necessary arrangements with some other person, who has a valid and effective license to safeguard the interests of consignors or other innocent parties whose property or business may be affected by such suspension or revocation and during which the licensee may terminate his affairs and business relating to the handling of produce.
(c) After the revocation of his license or during the effective period of any suspension thereof, no person shall, either directly or indirectly, through any agent, employee, or otherwise, carry on the business of a commission merchant, dealer, or broker until his status as a licensee has been restored.
(d) The suspension or revocation of a license shall not prevent the licensee from collecting amounts due on contracts entered into prior to the date of suspension or revocation or from remitting promptly to his principals and obligees.

# Publication of Facts
§ 46.36
Publicity.
Upon the issuance by the Secretary of an order revoking or suspending a license, or in case of automatic suspension of a license for failure to pay a reparation award, the Director shall cause general publicity to be given to such fact, in order that those doing business with the licensee whose license has been revoked or suspended may take due notice thereof.

# Sundays and Holidays
§ 46.37

means that the produce has left the shipping point under a bill of lading issued prior to the day on which the quotation is made and has moved or is moving over a route out of line of haul with the market in which it is to be delivered or in which it is being offered or quoted, or has been moving over a route in line of haul between the point of origin and the market in which it is to be delivered or in which it is being offered or quoted, but has been delayed in transit by the seller, or has been held by the transportation company at diversion or other points en route awaiting instructions from the shipper and by such holding or delay has missed scheduled movement between points of shipment and the market in which it is to be delivered as the result of the transaction in question. Unless otherwise specifically agreed, if a “tramp car” is sold f.o.b. shipping point or a “tramp car sale” is made f.o.b. shipping point, the buyer shall be deemed to assume only the lowest authorized all-rail freight charges applicable for the shipment between the point of origin and the contract destination agreed upon between the parties, together with such other charges which would have accrued if the car had been originally shipped direct to the contract destination:
Provided,
That the buyer is not liable for payment for protective services if the seller does not inform him of the kind and extent of such services ordered from the carrier.
(s)
Rolling acceptance
means that the buyer accepts at time of purchase produce which is in the custody of the transportation company and under movement from shipping point, under the terms and conditions described in paragraphs (q) and (r) of this section, except that the buyer assumes full responsibility for transportation of the goods from time of purchase, has no recourse against the seller because of any change in condition after time of purchase unless the goods at the time of sale were not in suitable shipping condition, and has no right of rejection on arrival. The buyer's remedy under this method of purchase is by recovery of damages from the shipper and not by rejection of the shipment. By agreement between the parties, however, the purchase may be made subject to inspection at any specified point while the car is rolling or in transit and the point at which the buyer will assume transportation charges may be specified without affecting the time of acceptance of the commodity.
(t)
Rolling acceptance final
means the same as
Rolling acceptance
except that the buyer has no recourse against the seller because of any change in condition of the produce in transit. The buyer has recourse against the seller for any material breach of the contract providing the shipment is not rejected. The buyer's remedy under this type of contract is recovery of damages from the seller and not by rejection.
(u)(1)
Track sale
or
sale on track
means a sale of produce on track after transit and after inspection or opportunity for inspection by the buyer, or his agent, who shall be considered to have waived any right to reject the commodity so purchased upon receipt by him or his duly authorized representative from the seller or his duly authorized representative of the bill of
lading, delivery order, or other document enabling him to obtain the goods from the carrier.
(2) The above definition shall not be construed as depriving the buyer of a right to reparation when the unloading of the car demonstrates that a part of the lading which was not accessible to inspection was of a quality or condition materially inferior to that portion which was accessible to inspection; but notice of intention to file a claim for reparation must be given the seller within 24 hours after receipt by the buyer of the delivery order or bill of lading.
(3) If the seller gives the date of arrival when quoting price, the buyer shall, in the absence of any written memorandum of sale to the contrary, assume all charges that accrue on the shipment from the date of its arrival. If the seller fails to furnish the date of arrival when quoting price the buyer may, in the absence of any written memorandum of sale which includes the date of arrival or specific written statement as to who shall assume such charges as have accrued after arrival, assume that the shipment arrived at point of sale on the day and date upon which the purchase was made, and shall be liable only for such charges as would properly attach to a shipment arriving on the date the purchase was made.
(v)
C.a.f., c.a.c.,
and
c.i.f.
mean
cost and freight, cost and charges,
and
cost, insurance, and freight,
respectively. C.a.f. sales shall be deemed to be the same as f.o.b. sales, except that the selling price shall include the correct freight charges to destination. C.a.c. sales shall be deemed to be the same as f.o.b. sales, except that the selling price includes the correct freight and refrigeration or heater charges to destination. C.i.f. sales shall be deemed to be the same as f.o.b. sales, except that the selling price includes insurance and the correct freight and refrigeration or heater charges to destination.
(w)
Carload, carlot,
or
car
when used in offers, quotations, or contracts in which the quantity is not more definitely specified, and in the absence of well-established trade custom or standard as to size of a “carload,” “carlot,” or “car” of the produce in question, means not less than the minimum quantity required by the carrier's tariff applicable to the movement, and not more than 10 percent in excess of such minimum tariff requirements, except that, where the carrier's tariffs provide alternative rates and minimum, the buyer shall state which tariff minimum must be observed, and, in event of failure so to do, the shipper may exercise his discretion, in no case, however, exceeding the higher alternative minimum quantity provided by the tariff, with only such variations therefrom as are permitted by this paragraph.
(x)
Shipping-point inspection
means that the seller is required to obtain Federal or Federal-State inspection, or such private inspection as has been mutually agreed upon, to show the compliance of the lot sold with the quality, condition, and grade specifications of the contract, and that the seller assumes the risk incident to incorrect certification.
(y)
Shipping-point inspection final,
or
inspection final
following the name of the State or point, as
California inspection final,
means that the seller is required to obtain Federal or Federal-State inspection, or such private inspection as has been mutually agreed upon, to show the compliance of the lot sold with the quality, condition, and grade specifications of the contract, and that the buyer assumes the risk incident to incorrect certification and is without recourse against the seller on account of quality, condition, and grade.
(z)
Subject approval Government inspection
means that the seller is required to obtain Federal or Federal-State inspection, or such private inspection as has been mutually agreed upon, and to correctly communicate, by wire or other agreed means, the statements on the certificate as to quality, condition and grade, and other essential information, whereupon the buyer, upon approval thereof, will be deemed to have accepted the produce without recourse against the seller on account of quality, condition, and grade.
(aa)
Guaranteed advance
used in connection with an advance payment on consigned produce means that the person making the advance guarantees that the net proceeds to the consignor
shall at least equal the amount so advanced, and that the consignor cannot be held liable for any deficit resulting from the sale of the produce, if such deficit is not occasioned by or contributed to by an act of the consignor.
(bb)
Accommodation advance
or
regular advance,
used in connection with an advance of money or credit against anticipated net proceeds to be realized from the sale of consigned produce, means that the consignor has received an advance of money or credit and that, if the consigned produce does not sell for enough to cover the cost of transportation and handling, including customary or agreed commission and the advance made to him, the consignor must return to the person making the advance a sum equal to the deficit sustained.
(cc)
Price arrival,
in the absence of a contrary specific understanding, means that the produce is shipped either direct to the customer or to an agent of the consignor, for the benefit of the customer, the price to be subject to agreement between the customer and the consignor upon the arrival of the produce at the customer's destination, with sufficient time being permitted for inspection.
(dd)
F.o.b. inspection and acceptance arrival
means that the produce quoted or sold is to be placed by the seller free on board car or other agency of through transportation at shipping point, the cost of transportation to be borne by the buyer, but the seller to assume all risks of loss and damage in transit not caused by the buyer, who has the right to inspect the goods upon arrival and to reject them if, upon such inspection, they are found not to meet the specifications of the contract of sale at destination. The buyer may not reject without reasonable cause. Such a sale is f.o.b. only as to price and is on a delivered basis as to grade, quality, and condition.
(ee)
F.o.b. sale at delivered price
means the same as f.o.b., except that transportation charges from shipping point to destination shall be borne by the seller; that is, the sale is f.o.b. as to grade, quality, and condition, and delivered as to price.
(ff)
Purchase after inspection
means a purchase of produce after inspection or opportunity for inspection by the buyer or his agent. Under this term the buyer has no right of rejection and waives all warranties as to quality or condition, except warranties expressly made by the seller.
(gg)
Cash sale
means that the buyer is required to pay the seller within 24 hours after his acceptance of the shipment.
(hh)
Joint Account—Split Above
means that the receiving joint partner will pay promptly the agreed cost of the shipment to his joint partner. After disposition of the produce, the parties will divide equally the profits on the shipment after deduction of the cost of the shipment and proper expenses from the gross proceeds. The receiving joint partner will pay all expenses and cannot recover any loss resulting from the joint venture.
(ii)
Commercial Unit
means a single shipment of one or more perishable agricultural commodities tendered for delivery on a single contract, such commercial unit must be accepted or rejected in its entirety. Acceptance of a commercial unit does not modify the parties' existing contractual rights and responsibilities.

# Good Delivery Standards
§ 46.44
Good delivery.
Unless otherwise agreed to between the contracting parties, “Good Delivery” in connection with f.o.b. contracts of purchase and sale means that the commodity meets the requirements of the contract at time of loading or sale and, if the shipment is handled under normal transportation service and conditions, will meet the following additional requirements on delivery at the contract destination:
(a)
Lettuce.
(1) If the contract specifies a U.S. grade, the lettuce may contain an average of not more than 3 percent condition defects, including not more than 2 percent decay affecting any portion of the head exclusive of wrapper leaves in excess of the destination tolerances provided for the applicable grade in the U.S. Standards for
Grades of Lettuce. (For example, the U.S. No. 1 grade provides a 12 percent tolerance for damage at destination. If a lot contains 5 percent damage by permanent grade factors, 7 percent of the tolerance can be applied to damage by condition factors. The additional 3 percent Good Delivery tolerance would then allow a total of 10 percent damage by condition factors in this shipment at destination.)
(2) If the contract does not specify a U.S. grade or percentage of condition defects, the lettuce at destination may contain a maximum of 15 percent, by count, of the heads in any lot which are damaged by condition defects, including therein not more than 9 percent serious damage of which not more than 5 percent may be decay affecting any portion of the head exclusive of wrapper leaves. Sales made on a percentage of a U.S. grade, without specifying the percentage of condition defects separately from the permanent defects, fall under this provision, and the lettuce may not contain more than a total of 15 percent condition defects at destination. However, if the condition defects are specified, provision No. 3 will apply.
(3) If the contract specifies a percentage of individual or combined condition defects, the lettuce at destination may contain either of the following, whichever is greater:
(i) One and one-half times the specified percentage of damage or serious damage by condition defects:
Provided,
That, if serious damage is not specified, one-half of the allowance at destination may be serious damage, including therein not more than one-quarter of the total allowance may be decay affecting any portion of the head exclusive of wrapper leaves. (For example, a lot sold as “16 percent tipburn” could have a total of 24 percent damage by tipburn at destination, including not more than 12 percent serious damage of which not more than 6 percent may be decay affecting any portion of the head exclusive of wrapper leaves.) or
(ii) Up to 15 percent, by count, of the heads in any lot which are damaged by condition defects, including therein not more than 9 percent serious damage of which not more than 5 percent may be decay affecting any portion of the head exclusive of wrapper leaves.
Unless otherwise agreed to by the parties, condition defects will be considered to be damage as defined in the U.S. Standards for Lettuce.
(4) If the contract clearly indicates by descriptive terms that the lettuce is of inferior quality, larger allowances for damage by condition defects than those specified above will be applied.
(5) If the buyer and the seller agree to percentages for defects at destination, higher or lower than those specified above, such percentages will determine whether good delivery is made.

# Misrepresentation or Misbranding
§ 46.45
Procedure in administering section 2(5) of the Act.
It is a violation of section 2(5) for a commission merchant, dealer, or broker to misrepresent by word, act, mark, stencil, label, statement, or deed, the character, kind, grade, quality, quantity, size, pack, weight, condition, degree, or maturity, or State, country, region of origin of any perishable agricultural commodity received, shipped, sold, or offered to be sold in interstate or foreign commerce. However, a person other than the first licensee handling misbranded perishable agricultural commodities shall not be held liable for a violation of section 2(5) of the Act by reason of the conduct of another if the person did not have knowledge of the violation or lacked the ability to correct the violation.
(a)
Violations.
Violations are considered to be serious, very serious, or repeated and/or flagrant, depending upon the circumstances of the misrepresentation.
(1)
Serious violations.
Include the following:
(i) Any lot of a perishable agricultural commodity shown by official inspection to contain scorable defects, off-size, off-count, exceeding the tolerance(s) in an amount up to and including double the tolerance provided in the applicable grades, standards or inspection procedures;
(ii) Any lot of perishable agricultural commodity officially certified as failing to meet the declared weight;
(iii) Any lot of a perishable agricultural commodity in which the State, country, or region of origin of the produce is misrepresentated because the lot is made up of containers with various labels or markings that reflect more than one incorrect State, country or region of origin. Example: A lot with containers individually marked to show the origin as Idaho or Maine or Colorado when the produce was grown in Wisconsin; or
(iv) Any other physical act, verbal or written declaration, or record entry that misrepresents a lot of a perishable agricultural commodity to the same extent as the examples listed.
(2)
Very serious violations.
Include the following:
(i) Any lot of a perishable agricultural commodity shown by official inspection to contain scorable defects, off-size, off-count, in excess of double the tolerance(s) provided in the applicable grades, standards or inspection procedures;
(ii) Any lot of a perishable agricultural commodity packed in containers showing a single point of origin, which is other than that in which the produce was grown, such as containers marked “California” when the produce was grown in Arizona;
(iii) Any lot of a perishable agricultural commodity officially certified as having an average net weight more than four percent below the declared weight;
(iv) Multiple sales or shipments of a misrepresented perishable agricultural commodity within a seven day period that can be attributed to one cause; or
(v) Any other physical act, verbal or written declaration, or record entry that misrepresents a lot of a perishable agricultural commodity to the same extent as the examples listed.
(3)
Flagrant violations.
Include, but are not necessarily limited to, the following examples:
(i) Shipment or sale of a lot of a perishable agricultural commodity from shipping point after notification by official inspection that the inspected commodity fails to comply with any marking on the container without first correcting the misbranding;
(ii) To offer for resale or consignment, a lot of a perishable agricultural commodity that has been officially inspected at destination and found to be misbranded without advising a prospective receiver that the lot is misbranded and that the misbranding must be corrected before resale. When a resale or consignment is finalized,
written
notice must be given that the lot is misbranded and must be corrected before resale; or
(iii) To withhold or fail to disclose known material facts with respect to a misrepresentation or misbranding.
(b)
Evidence.
(1) Evidence concerning a misrepresentation or misbranding includes official certificates of an inspection made by any person authorized by the Department to inspect fruits and vegetables or other public certifiers, and includes investigations and audit findings and any business records, testimony or other evidence bearing on the subject.
(2) When a lot of a perishable agricultural commodity has been officially inspected, and certification is made that the descriptive container markings are correct, but a subsequent inspection reverses the original findings, both inspection certificates will be accepted as evidence to show that the shipper/seller has
not
misrepresented the lot. The receiver of the commodity will be in violation if the misrepresentation is not corrected before the commodity is shipped, sold or offered for resale.
(c)
Sanctions
—(1)
Informal.
When liability for a violation of section 2(5) of the Act is to be settled informally, the violator may:
(i) Be given written warnings; or
(ii) Be given notice that liability for a violation may be settled by admitting the violation in writing and paying a penalty in an amount satisfactory to the Secretary in lieu of formal disciplinary action. In the event of a formal proceeding to suspend or revoke the license of such person because he has committed other violation(s), the admitted violation(s) will not be used to support the formal complaint but may be admitted to show a course of conduct prior to the filing of the formal complaint;
(iii) (A) The schedule for informal disposition is as follows:

(B) Informal disposition of misrepresentation violations is not limited to seven occurrences and will be considered for further violations.
(2)
Formal.
Formal proceedings to suspend or revoke a license may be instituted at any time against a person who has committed repeated and/or flagrant violations.
(d)
Cumulative record.
A cumulative record of licensee's misrepresentation violations will be maintained with the following limitations:
(1) Two years after the date it was committed or after payment of a monetary penalty, the violation will not be used as a basis for instituting formal disciplinary action. However, it may be cited as a part of the pattern of violations if formal proceedings are instituted and will be used in determining the level of monetary penalty for informal settlements.
(2) The record of violations
not
involved in formal proceedings will be expunged if there are no violations during a twenty-four (24) month period from the date of the most recent violation, or after thirty-six (36) months from the date of said violation, unless it was made a part of a formal disciplinary complaint.
(e)
Summary of procedure
—(1)
Compilation of authority.
The rules defining misrepresentation, including misbranding, and for determining liability and disposition of violations are contained in the Act (7 U.S.C. 499
et seq.),
in particular sections 2(5) and 8 (7 U.S.C. 449b(5) and 499h), § 46.45 of the Regulations (7 CFR 46.45), the Rules of Practice Governing Formal Adjudicatory Administrative Proceedings Instituted By the Secretary (7 CFR 1.130
et seq.
), and in the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 551
et seq.
).
(2)
Evidence of misrepresentation.
Evidence of misrepresentation or misbranding violations includes results of official inspections, audit findings, business records, or other documentation or testimony bearing on the subject. When a lot of fruits and vegetables has been officially inspected, and certification made that the descriptive markings on the container do not misrepresent the produce, but a subsequent inspection reverses the original finding (such as to grade, size, weight, etc.), the shipper/seller will
not
be charged with violation of the Act. However, the misrepresentation must be corrected before the lot is shipped, sold, or offered for resale.
(3)
Warning letters.
When informal settlement of liability is appropriate, violators are given two written warnings and an opportunity to take preventive action before formal action is considered. Warning letters include an explanation of the requirements of the Act and recommendations of actions which the violator can take to avoid future violations.
(4)
Informal sanctions.
Violations subsquent to the sending of the warning letters referred to above, other than flagrant violations, may be settled informally pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section. This procedure permits the violator to resolve the matter by payment of a monetary penalty pursuant to a schedule set out in lieu of a formal proceeding.
(5)
Formal sanctions.
In cases involving repeated or flagrant violations of the Act, formal proceedings seeking the suspension or revocation of the violator's license may be instituted pursuant to the Rules of Practice governing such matters (7 CFR 1.130
et seq.
). Except in cases of willfulness or where the public health, interest, or safety requires otherwise, a violator must be given written warning and opportunity to demonstrate or achieve compliance with the Act before its license can be suspended or revoked (5 U.S.C. 551
et seq.
). The warning letters referred to above serve this purpose. If formal proceedings are instituted, the violator is afforded an oral hearing, if requested, before an Administrative Law Judge,
an opportunity to appeal an adverse decision to the Department's Judicial Officer, and a further opportunity to appeal an adverse final decision to the appropriate United States Circuit Court of Appeals.
(6)
Use of record of misrepresentation.
A cumulative record of misrepresentation is maintained. It is used as a basis for determining whether a warning letter should be considered, and, if so, the amount of monetary penalty which is appropriate, or whether there is cause for instituting a formal disciplinary proceeding seeking suspension or revocation of the violator's license. But after payment of a monetary penalty or after two years from the date of the last violation, no formal disciplinary use can be made of the previous record of violation. The record of misrepresentation shall be erased if there are no further violations in the twenty-four (24) month period immediately following the most recent violation, or after 36 months from the date of each individual violation unless it is involved in formal disciplinary proceedings.
[43 FR 4964, Feb. 7, 1978, as amended at 46 FR 22746, Apr. 21, 1981; 47 FR 21234, May 18, 1982; 62 FR 15088, Mar. 31, 1997; 70 FR 29578, May 24, 2005]

# Statutory Trust
§ 46.46
Statutory trust.
(a)
Definitions.
(1) “Received” means the time when the buyer, receiver, or agent gains ownership, control, or possession of the perishable agricultural commodities:
Provided,
That when perishable agricultural commodities have not been received as described above, and where there is a rejection without reasonable cause as provided in § 46.2(bb) and (cc), the goods will be considered to have been received when proffered.
(2) “Dissipation” means any act or failure to act which could result in the diversion of trust assets or which could prejudice or impair the ability of unpaid suppliers, sellers, or agents to recover money owed in connection with produce transactions.
(3) “Default” means the failure to pay promptly money owed in connection with transactions in perishable agricultural commodities;
i.e.,
within the period of time applicable to the type of transaction as established by the provisions of the regulations (§ 46.2(aa)), or as otherwise agreed upon by the parties.
(4) “Calendar days” as used in section 5(c) 3 of the Act means every day of the week, including Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays, except that if the thirtieth calendar day falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or holiday, the final day with respect to the time for filing a written notice of intent to preserve the benefit of the trust shall be the next day upon which there is postal delivery service.
(5) “Ordinary and usual billing or invoice statements” as used in section 5(c)(4) of the Act, and “invoice or other billing statement” as used in § 46.46(f)(3), mean communications customarily used between parties to a transaction in perishable agricultural commodities in whatever form, documentary or electronic, for billing or invoicing purposes.
(b)
Trust assets.
The trust is made up of perishable agricultural commodities received in all transactions, all inventories of food or other products derived from such perishable agricultural commodities, and all receivables or proceeds from the sale of such commodities and food or products derived therefrom. Trust assets are to be preserved as a nonsegregated “floating” trust. Commingling of trust assets is contemplated.
(c)
Trust benefits.
(1) When a seller, supplier or agent who has met the eligibility requirements of paragraphs (e) (1) and (2) of this section, transfers ownership, possession, or control of goods to a commission merchant, dealer, or broker, it automatically becomes eligible to participate in the trust. Participants who preserve their rights to benefits in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section remain beneficiaries until they are paid in full.
(2) Any licensee, or person subject to license, who has a fiduciary duty to collect funds resulting from the sale or consignment of produce, and remit such funds to its principal, also has the duty to preserve its principal's rights to trust benefits in accordance with
paragraph (f) of this section. The responsibility for filing the notice to preserve the principal's rights is obligatory and cannot be avoided by the agent by means of a contract provision. Persons acting as agents also have the responsibility to negotiate contracts which entitle their principals to the protection of the trust provisions:
Provided,
That a principal may elect to waive its right to trust protection. To be effective, the waiver must be in writing and separate and distinct from any agency contract, must be signed by the principal prior to the time affected transactions occur, must clearly state the principal's intent to waive its right to become a trust beneficiary on a given transaction, or a series of transactions, and must include the date the agent's authority to act on the principal's behalf expires. In the event an agent having a fiduciary duty to collect funds resulting from the sale or consignment of produce and remit such funds to its principal fails to perform the duty of preserving its principal's rights to trust benefits, it may be held liable to the principal for damages. A principal employing a collect and remit agent must preserve its rights to trust benefits against such agent by filing appropriate notices with the agent.
(d)
Trust maintenance.
(1) Licensees and persons subject to license are required to maintain trust assets in a manner so that the trust assets are freely available to satisfy outstanding obligations to sellers of perishable agricultural commodities. Any act or omission which is inconsistent with this responsibility, including dissipation of trust assets, is unlawful and in violation of section 2 of the Act (7 U.S.C. 499b). Growers, licensees, and persons subject to license may file trust actions against licensees and persons operating subject to license. Licensees and persons subject to license are bound by the trust provisions of the Act (7 U.S.C. 499(e)).
(2) Principals, including growers, who employ agents to sell perishable agricultural commodities on their behalf are “suppliers” and/or “sellers” as those words are used in section 5(c)(2) and (3) of the Act (7 U.S.C. 499e(c)(2) and (3)), and therefore must preserve their trust rights against their agents by filing a notice of intent to preserve trust rights with their agents as set forth in paragraph (f) of this section.
(3) Agents who sell perishable agricultural commodities on behalf of their principals must preserve their principals' trust benefits against the buyers by filing a notice of intent to preserve trust rights with the buyers. Any act or omission which is inconsistent with this responsibility, including failure to give timely notice of intent to preserve trust benefits, is unlawful and in violation of section 2 of the Act (7 U.S.C. 499b).
(e)
Prompt payment and eligibility for trust benefits.
(1) The times for prompt accounting and prompt payment are set out in § 46.2(z) and (aa). Parties who elect to use different times for payment must reduce their agreement to writing before entering into the transaction and maintain a copy of their agreement in their records, and the times of payment must be disclosed on invoices, accountings, and other documents relating to the transaction.
(2) The maximum time for payment for a shipment to which a seller, supplier, or agent can agree, prior to the transaction, and still be eligible for benefits under the trust is 30 days after receipt and acceptance of the commodities as defined in § 46.2(dd) and paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
(3) If there is a default in payment as defined in § 46.46(a)(3), the seller, supplier, or agent who has met the eligibility requirements of paragraphs (e)(1) and (2) of this section will not forfeit eligibility under the trust by agreeing in any manner to a schedule for payment of the past due amount or by accepting a partial payment.
(4) The trust provisions do not apply to transactions between a cooperative association (as defined in section 15(a) of the Agricultural Marketing Act (12 U.S.C. 1141j(a)), and its members.
(5) The amount claimable against the trust by a beneficiary or grower will be the net amount due after allowable deductions of contemplated expenses or advances made in connection with the transaction by the commission merchant, dealer, or broker.
(f)
Filing notice of intent to preserve trust benefits.
(1) Notice of intent to preserve benefits under the trust must
be in writing, must include the statement that it is a notice of intent to preserve trust benefits and must include information which establishes for each shipment:
(i) The names and addresses of the trust beneficiary, seller-supplier, commission merchant, or agent and the debtor, as applicable,
(ii) The date of the transaction, commodity, invoice price, and terms of payment (if appropriate),
(iii) The date of receipt of notice that a payment instrument has been dishonored (if appropriate), and
(iv) The amount past due and unpaid; except that if a supplier, seller or agent engages a commission merchant or growers' agent to sell or market their produce, the supplier, seller or agent that has not received a final accounting from the commission merchant or growers' agent shall only be required to provide information in sufficient detail to identify the transaction subject to the trust.
(2) Timely filing of a notice of intent to preserve benefits under the trust will be considered to have been made if written notice is given to the debtor within 30 calendar days:
(i) After expiration of the time prescribed by which payment must be made pursuant to regulation,
(ii) After expiration of such other time by which payment must be made as the parties have expressly agreed to in writing before entering into the transaction, but not longer than the time prescribed in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, or
(iii) After the time the supplier, seller or agent has received notice that a payment instrument promptly presented for payment has been dishonored. Failures to pay within the time periods set forth in paragraphs (f)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section constitute defaults.
(3) Licensees may choose an alternate method of preserving trust benefits from the requirements described in paragraphs (f)(1) and (2) of this section. Licensees may use their invoice or other billing statement as defined in paragraph (a)(5) of this section, whether in documentary or electronic form, to preserve trust benefits. Alternately, the licensee's invoice or other billing statement, given to the buyer, must contain:
(i) The statement: “The perishable agricultural commodities listed on this invoice are sold subject to the statutory trust authorized by section 5(c) of the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act, 1930 (7 U.S.C. 499e(c)). The seller of these commodities retains a trust claim over these commodities, all inventories of food or other products derived from these commodities, and any receivables or proceeds from the sale of these commodities until full payment is received.”; and
(ii) The terms of payment if they differ from prompt payment set out in section 46.2(z) and (aa) of this part, and the parties have expressly agreed to such terms in writing before the affected transactions occur.
(4) If the invoice or other billing statement is in electronic form, the licensee has met its requirement of giving the buyer notice of intent to preserve trust benefits on the face of the invoice or other billing statement if the electronic invoice or other billing statement containing the statement set forth in paragraph (f)(3)(i) is sent to the buyer and the electronic transmission can be verified. The licensee will be deemed to have given notice to the buyer of its intent to preserve trust benefits if the licensee can verify that the electronic invoice or other billing statement was sent to a third party electronic transaction vendor designated by the buyer. The licensee will have met the requirement of giving the buyer written notice of intent to preserve trust benefits using electronic means if it can verify that the electronic data invoice or other billing statement was transmitted to the buyer, or its designated electronic transaction vendor, irrespective of whether or not the buyer or third party vendor downloads or accepts the trust statement.
(5) If a buyer conducts its transactions in perishable agricultural commodities using an electronic system, the buyer or its third party electronic vendor must allow sufficient space for the seller to include the required trust statement of intent to preserve trust benefits in the buyer's electronic invoices or other billing statement
forms. A buyer or its designated third party electronic vendor must accept a seller's notice of intent to preserve benefits under the trust using the required trust statement, whether in documentary or electronic form, as set forth in paragraphs (d) and (f) of this section. Any act or omission which is inconsistent with this responsibility is unlawful and in violation of Section 2 of the Act (7 U.S.C. 499b).

(2) If the Director finds reasonable cause for further investigation, the complaining person shall be duly notified of the findings.

(c) Upon becoming aware of a complaint under section 6(a) or written notification under 6(b) of the Act (7 U.S.C. 499f (a) or (b)) by means described in paragraph (a) and (b) of this section, the Secretary will determine if reasonable grounds exist to conduct an investigation of such complaint or written notification for disciplinary action.

Provided,
That the 2-year limitation herein prescribed shall not apply to complaints charging flagrant or repeated violations of the act.

# Provisions Applicable to Reparation Proceedings
§ 47.6
Formal complaints.
(a)
Filing; contents; number of copies.
(1) If the procedure provided in § 47.3(b) fails to effect an amicable or informal settlement, the person who filed the informal complaint may, if further proceedings are desired, file a formal complaint with the Fruit and Vegetable Programs. The formal complaint shall be filed within ninety days of notification of the opportunity to proceed formally. Failure to file a formal reparation complaint within the time prescribed shall result in the waiver of further proceedings on the claim alleged in the informal complaint.
(2) The formal complaint shall set forth the information and be accompanied by the papers indicated in § 47.3(a)(2) and (3), including a statement of the amount of damages claimed, with the basis therefor, and the method of determination. The original and three copies shall be furnished for filing, and service on the respondent. If there is more than one respondent, a further copy shall be furnished for each additional respondent.
(b)
Bond required if complainant is nonresident.
If formal complaint for reparation is filed by a nonresident of the United States, complainant shall first file a bond in double the amount of the claim either with a surety company approved by the Treasury Department of the United States as surety or with two personal sureties, each of whom shall be a citizen of the United States and shall qualify as financially
responsible for the entire amount of the bond. The bond shall run to the respondent and be conditioned upon the payment of costs, including reasonable attorney's fees, for the respondent if the respondent shall prevail, and of any reparation award that may be issued by the Secretary against the complainant on any counterclaim asserted by respondent:
Provided,
That the furnishing of a bond may be waived at the discretion of the Secretary if the complainant is a resident of a country which permits the filing of a complaint in an administrative forum or its equivalent which is substantially similar to that provided under the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act by a resident of the United States against a citizen of that country without the furnishing of a bond. Nothing in this section shall limit the discretion of the Secretary to deny such a waiver in order to effectuate the purposes of the Act or to protect the interests of the businesses concerned.
(c) Service upon respondent; proof of service. Upon receipt by the Fruit and Vegetable Programs of the formal complaint, the accompanying papers and the $500 handling fee authorized by the Act, a copy thereof shall be served by the Fruit and Vegetable Programs upon the respondent in accordance with § 47.4 of this part. If the complaint is not in the proper form, the Fruit and Vegetable Programs shall return it and inform the complainant of the deficiencies therein.
(d)
Amendments.
At any time prior to the close of the hearing, the complaint may be amended; but, in case of an amendment adding new provisions, the hearing shall, if the respondent so requests, be adjourned for a reasonable time to be determined by the examiner:
Provided,
That, if the amendment introduces a new or different cause of action, it must be filed within 9 months after the cause of action accrued. Amendments subsequent to the first amendment or subsequent to the filing of an answer by the respondent may be made only with leave of the examiner or with the written consent of the adverse party.
[10 FR 2209, Feb. 27, 1945, as amended at 56 FR 176, Jan. 3, 1991; 64 FR 38106, July 15, 1999; 73 FR 31017, May 30, 2008]
§ 47.7
Report of investigation.
Where the facts and circumstances are deemed by the Deputy Administrator to warrant such action, the Fruit and Vegetable Programs shall serve upon each of the parties a copy of the report made by the Fruit and Vegetable Programs in connection with its investigation of the informal or formal complaint. Whenever the Secretary, or the Deputy Administrator, or the examiner deems it necessary, a supplemental investigation shall be made by the Fruit and Vegetable Programs and a copy of the report thereon shall be served upon the parties. If an answer is filed by respondent, a copy of any report or reports of investigation served upon the parties shall be filed with the Hearing Clerk and shall be considered as part of the evidence in the proceeding:
Provided,
That either party shall be permitted to submit evidence in rebuttal in the same manner as is provided in the regulations in this part for the submission of other evidence in the proceeding.
[24 FR 10055, Dec. 12, 1959]
§ 47.8
The answer.
(a)

[10 FR 2209, Feb. 27, 1945; 11 FR 224, Jan. 4, 1946, as amended at 38 FR 30445, Nov. 5, 1973; 60 FR 8459, Feb. 14, 1995]
§ 47.14
Prehearing conferences.
(a) In any proceeding in which it appears that a conference will expedite the proceeding, the examiner, at any time prior to or during the course of the oral hearing, may request the parties or their counsel to appear at a conference before the examiner to consider:
(1) The simplification of the issues;
(2) The necessity or the desirability of amendments to the pleadings;
(3) The possibility of obtaining stipulations of fact and of documents which will avoid unnecessary proof;
(4) The limitation of the number of expert or other witnesses; or
(5) Such other matters as may expedite and aid in the disposition of the proceeding.
(b) No transcript or recording of the conference shall be made. If the conference is conducted by correspondence, the examiner shall forward copies of letters and documents to the parties as circumstances require. The correspondence in connection with a conference shall not be part of the record. The examiner shall prepare and file for the record a written summary of the action agreed upon or taken at the conference, which shall incorporate any written stipulations or agreements made by the parties at the conference or as a result of the conference.
(c)
Manner of the Conference.
(1) The conference shall be conducted by telephone or correspondence unless the examiner determines that conducting the conference by audio-visual telecommunication:
(i) Is necessary to prevent prejudice to a party;
(ii) Is necessary because of a disability of any individual expected to participate in the conference; or
(iii) Would cost less than conducting the conference by telephone or correspondence. If the examiner determines that a conference conducted by audio-visual telecommunication would measurably increase the United States Department of Agriculture's cost of conducting the conference, the conference shall be conducted by personal attendance of any individual who is expected to participate in the conference, by telephone, or by correspondence.
(2) If the conference is not conducted by telephone or correspondence, the conference shall be conducted by audio-visual telecommunication unless the examiner determines that conducting the conference by personal attendance of any individual who is expected to participate in the conference:
(i) Is necessary to prevent prejudice to a party;
(ii) Is necessary because of a disability of any individual expected to participate in the conference; or
(iii) Would cost less than conducting the conference by audio-visual telecommunication.
[60 FR 8460, Feb. 14, 1995]
§ 47.15
Oral hearing before the examiner.
(a)
When permissible.
(1) Where the amount of the damages claimed, either in the complaint or in the counterclaim, does not exceed $30,000 (excluding interest), an oral hearing shall not be held, unless deemed necessary or desirable by the Fruit and Vegetable Programs or unless granted by the examiner as defined in § 47.2(i)(1), upon application of complainant or respondent setting forth the peculiar circumstances making an oral hearing necessary for a proper presentation of the case.
(2) Where the amount of damages claimed, either in the complaint or in the counterclaim, is in excess of $30,000 (excluding interest), the procedure provided in this section (except as provided in § 47.20(b)(2)) shall be applicable.
(b)
Request for hearing.
Any party may request an oral hearing on the facts by including such request in the complaint. Failure to request an oral hearing within the time allowed for filing of the reply, or within 10 days after the expiration of the time allowed for filing an answer, shall constitute a waiver of such hearing, and any party so failing to request an oral hearing will be deemed to have agreed that the proceeding may be decided upon a record formed under the documentary procedure provided in § 47.20.
(c)
Time, place, and manner.
(1) If and when the proceeding has reached the stage of oral hearing, the examiner,
giving careful consideration to the convenience of the parties, shall set a time for hearing and shall file with the Hearing Clerk a notice stating the time and place of hearing. Unless the parties otherwise agree, the place of the hearing shall be the place in which the respondent is engaged in business. This notice shall state whether the hearing will be conducted by telephone, audio-visual telecommunication, or personal attendance of any individual expected to participate in the hearing and the examiner's determination regarding the manner of the hearing shall be made in accordance with paragraphs (c)(3) and (c)(4) of this section. If any change in the time, place, or manner of the hearing is made, the examiner shall file with the Hearing Clerk a notice of the change. The notice of any change in the time, place, or manner of the hearing shall be served on the parties, unless it is made during the course of an oral hearing and made part of the transcript or recording, or actual notice is given to the parties.
(2)(i) If and when the proceeding has reached the stage of oral hearing, any party may move that the hearing be conducted by telephone or personal attendance of any individual expected to attend the hearing rather than by audio-visual telecommunication. Any motion that the hearing be conducted by telephone or personal attendance of any individual expected to attend the hearing must be accompanied by a memorandum in support of the motion stating the basis for the motion and the circumstances that require the hearing to be conducted other than by audio-visual telecommunication.
(ii) Within 10 days after the examiner issues a notice stating the manner in which the hearing is to be conducted, any party may move that the examiner reconsider the manner in which the hearing is to be conducted. Any motion for reconsideration must be accompanied by a memorandum in support of the motion stating the basis for the motion and the circumstances that require the hearing to be conducted other than in accordance with the examiner's notice.
(3) The hearing shall be conducted by audio-visual telecommunication unless the examiner determines that conducting the hearing by personal attendance of any individual expected to attend the hearing:
(i) Is necessary to prevent prejudice to a party;
(ii) Is necessary because of a disability of any individual expected to participate in the hearing; or
(iii) Would cost less than conducting the hearing by audio-visual telecommunication. If the examiner determines that a hearing conducted by audio-visual telecommunication would measurably increase the United States Department of Agriculture's cost of conducting the hearing, the hearing shall be conducted by personal attendance of any individual who is expected to participate in the hearing or by telephone.
(4) The examiner may, in his or her sole discretion or in response to a motion by a party to the proceeding, conduct the hearing by telephone if the examiner finds that a hearing conducted by telephone:
(i) Would provide a full and fair evidentiary hearing;
(ii) Would not prejudice any party; and
(iii) Would cost less than conducting the hearing by audio-visual telecommunication or personal attendance of any individual who is expected to participate in the hearing.
(d)
Appearances
—(1)
Representation.
In any proceeding under the Act, the parties may appear in person or by counsel or other representative.
(2)
Failure to appear.
If any party to the proceeding, after being duly notified, fails to appear at the hearing, the party shall be deemed to have waived the right to an oral hearing in the proceeding. In the event that a party appears at the hearing and no party appears for the opposing side, the examiner may determine whether the party who is present shall present his or her evidence, in whole or in part, in the form of affidavits or by oral testimony.
(3)
Debarment of counsel or representative.
(i) Whenever, while a proceeding is pending before him or her, the examiner finds that a person acting as counsel or representative for any party to the proceeding is guilty of unethical or unprofessional conduct, the examiner
may order that such person be precluded from further acting as counsel or representative in such proceeding. An appeal to the Secretary may be taken from any such order, but the proceeding shall not be delayed or suspended pending disposition of the appeal:
Provided,
That the examiner may suspend the proceedings for a reasonable time for the purpose of enabling the party to obtain other counsel or representative.
(ii) In case the examiner has issued an order precluding a person from further acting as counsel or representative in the proceeding, the examiner, within a reasonable time thereafter, shall submit to the Secretary a report of the facts and circumstances surrounding the issuance of the order and shall recommend what action the Secretary should take respecting the appearance of such person as counsel or representative in other proceedings before the Secretary. Thereafter, the Secretary may, after notice and an opportunity for hearing, issue such order respecting the appearance of such person as counsel or representative in proceedings before the Secretary as the Secretary finds to be appropriate.
(e)
Order of proceeding.
The complainant shall proceed first at the hearing and shall have the burden of proof, except that a party asserting a set-off or counterclaim shall have the burden of proof on such issue.
(f)
Written statements of direct testimony.
(1) Except as provided in paragraph (f)(2) of this section, each party must exchange with all other parties a written narrative verified statement of the oral direct testimony that the party will provide at any hearing to be conducted by telephone; the direct testimony of each employee or agent of the party that the party will call to provide oral direct testimony at any hearing to be conducted by telephone; and the direct testimony of each expert witness that the party will call to provide oral direct testimony at any hearing to be conducted by telephone. The written direct testimony of witnesses shall be exchanged by the parties at least 10 days prior to the hearing. The oral direct testimony provided by a witness at a hearing conducted by telephone will be limited to the presentation of the written direct testimony, unless the examiner finds that oral direct testimony which is supplemental to the written direct testimony would further the public interest and would not constitute surprise.
(2) The parties shall not be required to exchange testimony in accordance with this paragraph if the hearing is scheduled to begin less than 20 days after the examiner's notice stating the time of the hearing.
(g)
Evidence
—(1)
In general.
(i) The testimony of witnesses at a hearing shall be upon oath or affirmation, subject to cross-examination, and shall be reported verbatim.
(ii) Any witness may, in the discretion of the examiner, be examined separately and apart from all other witnesses except those who may be parties to the proceeding.
(iii) The examiner shall exclude, insofar as practicable, evidence which is immaterial, irrelevant, or unduly repetitious, or which is not of the sort upon which responsible persons are accustomed to rely.
(2)
Objections.
(i) If a party objects to the admission or rejection of any evidence or to the limitation of the scope of any examination or cross-examination, the party shall state briefly the grounds of such objections, whereupon an automatic exception will follow if the objection is overruled by the examiner. The transcript or recording shall not include argument or debate thereon except as ordered by the examiner. The ruling of the examiner on any objection shall be a part of the transcript or recording.
(ii) Only objections made before the examiner may subsequently be relied upon in the proceeding.
(3)
Depositions.
The deposition of any witness shall be admitted in the manner provided in and subject to the provisions of § 47.16.
(4)
Affidavits.
Except as is otherwise provided in these rules, affidavits may be admitted only if the evidence is otherwise admissible and the parties agree (which may be determined by their failure to make timely objections) that affidavits may be used.
(5)
Proof and authentication of official records or documents.
An official record
or document, if admissible for any purpose, shall be admissible in evidence without the production of the person who made or prepared the same. Such record or document shall be evidenced by an official publication thereof or by a copy attested by the person having legal authority to make such attestation. The person attesting the copy shall make a certificate showing such authority.
(6)
Exhibits.
(i) All written statements, charts, tabulations, or similar data offered in evidence at the hearing shall, after identification by the proponent and upon a satisfactory showing of the admissibility of the contents thereof, be numbered as exhibits, received in evidence, and made a part of the record. Unless the examiner finds that the furnishing of copies is impracticable, a copy of each exhibit shall be filed with the examiner for the use of each other party to the proceeding. The examiner shall advise the parties as to the exact number of copies which will be required to be filed.
(ii) If the testimony of a witness refers to a statute, a report, document, recording, or transcript, the examiner, after inquiry relating to the identification of such statute, report, document, recording, or transcript, shall determine whether the same shall be produced at the hearing and physically be made a part of the evidence as an exhibit, or whether it shall be incorporated into the evidence by reference. If relevant and material matter offered in evidence is embraced in a report, document, recording, or transcript containing immaterial or irrelevant matter, such immaterial or irrelevant matter shall, insofar as practicable, be designated by the party and segregated and excluded.
(7) [Reserved]
(8)
Offer of proof.
Whenever evidence is excluded from the record, the party offering such evidence may make an offer of proof, which shall be included in the transcript or recording. The offer of proof shall consist of a brief statement describing the evidence to be offered. If the evidence consists of a brief oral statement or of an exhibit, it shall be inserted into the transcript or recording in toto. In such event, it shall be considered a part of the transcript or recording if the Secretary decides that the examiner's ruling in excluding the evidence was erroneous. The examiner shall not allow the insertion of such evidence in toto if the taking of such evidence will consume a considerable length of time at the hearing. In the latter event, if the Secretary decides that the examiner erred in excluding the evidence, and that such error was substantial, the hearing shall be reopened to permit the taking of such evidence.
(h)
Oral argument before examiner.
The examiner may permit the parties or their counsel to argue orally at the hearing or at some other time prior to the transmittal of the record to the Secretary as provided in this part. Such argument may be limited by the examiner to any extent that the examiner finds necessary for the expeditious or proper disposition of the proceeding.
(i)
Transcript or recording.
(1) Hearings to be conducted by telephone shall be recorded verbatim by electronic recording device. Hearings conducted by audio-visual telecommunication or the personal attendance of any individual who is expected to participate in the hearing shall be transcribed, unless the examiner finds that recording the hearing verbatim would expedite the proceeding and the examiner orders the hearing to be recorded verbatim.
(2) If a hearing is recorded verbatim, a party requests the transcript of a hearing or part of a hearing, and the examiner determines that the disposition of the proceeding would be expedited by a transcript of the hearing or part of a hearing, the examiner shall order the verbatim transcription of the recording as requested by the party.
(3) If a reporter transcribes or records the testimony at a hearing, the reporter shall deliver the original transcript or recording, with exhibits thereto attached, to the examiner, who will retain such copy for the official file and for use in preparing his or her report. The reporter will also deliver to the examiner such other copy or copies as may be ordered by the Department, which copy or copies the examiner will forward to the Hearing Clerk.
(4) Parties to the proceeding, or others, who desire a copy of the transcript or recording of the hearing may place
orders at the hearing with the reporter, who will furnish and deliver such copies direct to the purchaser upon payment of the applicable rate.

§ 47.20
Documentary procedure.
(a)
In general.
The documentary procedure described in this section shall, whenever it is applicable as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, take the place and serve in lieu of the oral hearing procedure hereinbefore provided. Under the documentary procedure, the pleadings of the parties, if verified in accordance with paragraph (h) of this section, and any report of investigation filed with the Hearing Clerk pursuant to § 47.7 will be considered as evidence in the proceeding. Under the shortened procedure, the pleadings of the parties, if verified in accordance with paragraph (h) of this section, and any report of investigation filed with the Hearing Clerk pursuant to § 47.7, will be considered as evidence in the proceeding. In addition, the parties may submit written proof in support of the complaint, answer, or reply, as the case may be, in the form of verified statements or depositions. After the close of the evidence, the parties may file briefs.
(b)
When applicable
—(1)
Where damages claimed do not exceed $30,000.
The documentary procedure provided for in this section shall (except as provided in § 47.15(a)) be used in all reparation proceedings in which the amount of damages claimed, either in the complaint or in the counterclaim, does not exceed $30,000 (excluding interest).
(2)
Where damages claimed exceed $30,000.
In any proceeding in which the amount of damages claimed, either in the complaint or in the counterclaim, is greater than $30,000 (excluding interest), the examiner, whenever he or she is of the opinion that proof may be fairly and adequately presented by use of the documentary procedure provided for in this section, shall suggest to the parties that they consent to the use of such procedure. Parties are free to consent to such procedure if they choose, and declination of consent will not affect or prejudice the rights or interests of any party. A party, if he or she has not waived oral hearing, may consent to the use of the documentary procedure on the condition that depositions rather than affidavits be used. In such case, if the other party agrees, depositions shall be required to be filed in lieu of verified statements. If any party who has not waived oral hearing does not consent to the use of the documentary procedure, the proceeding will be set for oral hearing. The suggestion
that the documentary procedure be used need not originate with the examiner. Any party may address a request to the examiner asking that the documentary procedure be used.

Reopening after default.
The party in default in the filing of an answer or reply required or authorized under this part may petition to reopen the proceeding at any time prior to the expiration of 20 days from the date of service of the default order.
