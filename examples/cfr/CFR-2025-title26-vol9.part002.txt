Production in excess of depletable quantity
—(1)
Primary production.
(i) If the taxpayer's average daily production of domestic crude oil exceeds his depletable oil quantity, the allowance for depletion pursuant to section 613A(c)(1)(A) and paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section with respect to oil produced during the taxable year from each property in the United States shall be that amount which bears the same ratio to the amount of depletion which would have been allowable under section 613(a) for all of the taxpayer's oil produced from the property during the taxable year (computed as if section 613 applied to all of the production at the rate specified in paragraph (c) of this section) as the amount of his depletable oil quantity bears to the aggregate number of barrels representing the average daily production of domestic crude oil of the taxpayer for such year.
(ii) If the taxpayer's average daily production of domestic natural gas exceeds his depletable natural gas quantity, the allowance for depletion pursuant to section 613A(c)(1)(B) and paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section with respect to natural gas produced during the taxable year from each property in the United States shall be that amount which bears the same ratio to the amount of depletion which would have been allowable pursuant to section 613(a) for all of the taxpayer's natural gas produced from the property during the taxable year (computed as if section 613 applied to all of the production at the rate specified in paragraph (c) of this section) as the amount of his depletable natural gas quantity in cubic feet bears to the aggregate number of cubic feet representing the average daily production of domestic natural gas of the taxpayer for such year.
(2)
Secondary or tertiary production.
(i) If the taxpayer's average daily secondary or tertiary production of domestic crude oil exceeds his depletable oil quantity (determined without regard to section 613A(c)(3)(A)(ii), as in effect prior to the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1990), the allowance for depletion pursuant to section 613A(c)(6)(A)(i), as in effect prior to the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1990, and paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section with respect to oil produced during the taxable year from each property in the United States shall be that amount which bears the same ratio to the amount of depletion which would have been allowable pursuant to section 613(a) for all of the taxpayer's secondary or tertiary production of oil from the property during the taxable year (computed as if section 613 applied to all of the production at the rate specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section) as the amount of his depletable oil quantity (determined without regard to section 613A(c)(3)(A)(ii), as in
effect prior to the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1990) bears to the aggregate number of barrels representing the average daily secondary or tertiary production of domestic crude oil of the taxpayer for such year.
(ii) If the taxpayer's average daily secondary or tertiary production of domestic natural gas exceeds his depletable natural gas quantity (determined without regard to section 613A(c)(3)(A)(ii), as in effect prior to the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1990), the allowance for depletion pursuant to section 613A(c)(6)(A)(ii), as in effect prior to the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1990, and paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section with respect to natural gas produced during the taxable year from each property in the United States shall be that amount which bears the same ratio to the amount of depletion which would have been allowable pursuant to section 613(a) for all of the taxpayer's secondary or tertiary production of natural gas from the property during the taxable year (computed as if section 613 applied to all of the production at the rate specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section) as the amount of his depletable natural gas quantity in cubic feet (determined without regard to section 613A(c)(3)(A)(ii), as in effect prior to the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1990) bears to the aggregate number of cubic feet representing the average daily secondary or tertiary production of domestic natural gas of the taxpayer for such year.
(iii) This paragraph (d)(2) shall not apply after December 31, 1983.
(3)
Taxable income from the property.
If both oil and gas are produced from the property during the taxable year, then for purposes of section 613A(c)(7) (A) and (B) and paragraph (d) of this section the taxable income from the property, in applying the taxable income limitation in section 613(a), shall be allocated between the oil production and the gas production in proportion to the gross income from the property during the taxable year from each. If both gas with respect to which section 613A(b) and § 1.613A-2 apply and oil or gas with respect to which section 613A(c) and this section apply are produced from the property during the taxable year, then for purposes of section 613A(d)(1) and paragraph (a) of § 1.613A-4 the taxable income from the property, in applying the taxable income limitation in section 613(a), shall also be so allocated. In addition, if both primary production and secondary or tertiary production (to which gross income from the property is attributable before January 1, 1984) are produced from the property during the taxable year and the total amount of production is in excess of the depletable quantity, then for purposes of paragraph (d) of this section the taxable income from the property, in applying the taxable income limitation in section 613(a), shall also be so allocated.
(4)
Examples.
The application of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
A owns Y and Z oil producing properties. With respect to properties Y and Z, the percentage depletion allowable pursuant to section 613(a) (computed as if section 613 applied to all of the production at the rate specified in section 613A(c)(5)) for 1975 was $100x and $200x, respectively. A's average daily production for 1975 was 4,000 barrels. A's allowable depletion pursuant to section 613A(c) with respect to property Y was $50x ($100x depletion × 2,000 depletable oil quantity/ 4,000 average daily production). A's allowable depletion pursuant to section 613A(c) with respect to property Z was $100x ($200x depletion × 2,000 depletable oil quantity/ 4,000 average daily production).

# Example 2.
B owns gas producing properties which had secondary gas production for 1975 of 3,285,000,000 cubic feet, which under section 613A(c)(4) is equivalent to 547,500 barrels of oil. B's average daily secondary production of gas for 1975 was equivalent to 1,500 barrels (547,500 barrels ÷ 365). B elected to have section 613A(c)(4) apply to the gas production. With respect to the production, the percentage depletion allowable pursuant to section 613(a) (computed at the rate specified in section 613A(c)(6)(A), as in effect prior to the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1990) was $150x. B also owns an oil producing property which had primary oil production for 1975 of 365,000 barrels. B's average daily production of oil for 1975 was 1,000 barrels (365,000 ÷ 365). With respect to the oil property, the percentage depletion allowable pursuant to section 613(a) (computed as if section 613 applied to all of the production at the rate specified in section 613A(c)(5), as in effect prior to the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1990) was $100x. B's depletable oil quantity for 1975 was 500 barrels (2,000 barrels tentative quantity
−1,500 barrels average daily secondary production). B's allowable depletion pursuant to section 613A(c) with respect to the oil property was $50x ($100x depletion × 500 depletable oil quantity/ 1,000 average daily production).

# Example 3.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 2
except that B's primary production was 6,000,000 cubic feet of natural gas daily rather than its equivalent under section 613A(c)(4) of 1,000 barrels of oil and that B elected to have that section apply to such gas. B's allowable depletion pursuant to section 613A(c) with respect to B's primary production is $50x, the same as in example 2.

# Example 4.
C is a partner with a one-third interest in Partnerships CDE and CFG with each partnership owning a single oil property. C's percentage depletion allowable under section 613(a) (computed as if section 613 applied to all of the production at the rate specified in section 613A(c)(5), as in effect prior to the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1990) for 1975 was $20x with respect to 495,000 barrels (his allocable share of Partnership CDE production) and $40x with respect to 600,000 barrels (his allocable share of Partnership CFG production). C's average daily production is 3,000 barrels (1,095,000 total production ÷ 365 days). C's allowable depletion pursuant to section 613A(c) with respect to C's share of the production of Partnership CDE is $13.33x ($20x depletion × 2,000 depletable oil quantity/ 3,000 average daily production). C's allowable depletion pursuant to section 613A(c) with respect to C's share of the production of Partnership CFG is $26.67x ($40x depletion × 2,000 depletable oil quantity/ 3,000 average daily production). See § 1.613A-3(e) for the rules on computing depletion in the case of a partnership.

# Example 5.
H owns a property which, during H's fiscal year which began on June 1, 1975, and ended on May 31, 1976, produced gas qualifying under section 613A(b) and oil qualifying under section 613A(c). For the fiscal year H's gross income from the property was $400x, of which $100x was from gas and $300x was from oil. For the oil his gross income from the property for the period beginning June 1, 1975, and ending December 31, 1975, was $100x and for the 1976 portion of the fiscal year was $200x. The percentage depletion allowance (before applying the 50 percent limitation of section 613(a) or the 65 percent limitation of section 613A(d)(1)) was $22x for the gas, $22x for the oil in 1975, and $44x for the oil in 1976. H's taxable income from the property for the fiscal year was $100x. In accordance with paragraph (d)(3) of this section, the taxable income from the property is allocated $25x to the gas:
EC08OC91.004
$25x to the 1975 oil:
EC08OC91.005
and $50x to the 1976 oil:
EC08OC91.006
With the application of the 50 percent of taxable income from the property limitation, the allowable percentage depletion (computed without reference to section 613A) is limited to $12.50x for the gas, $12.50x for the oil in 1975, and $25x for the oil in 1976.
(e)
Partnerships
—(1)
General rule.
In the case of a partnership, the depletion allowance under section 611 with respect to production from domestic oil and gas properties shall be computed
separately by the partners and not by the partnership. The determination of whether cost or percentage depletion is applicable is to be made at the partner level. The partnership must allocate to each partner the partner's proportionate share of the adjusted basis of each partnership oil or gas property in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs (e)(2) through (e)(6) of this section. This allocation of the adjusted basis of oil or gas property does not affect a partner's adjusted basis in his or her partnership interest.
(2)
Initial allocation of adjusted basis of oil or gas property among partners
—(i)
General rule.
Each partner shall be allocated his or her proportionate share of the adjusted basis of each partnership domestic oil or gas property. The initial allocation of adjusted basis is to be made as of the later of the date of acquisition of the oil or gas property by the partnership or January 1, 1975.
(ii)
Allocation methods.
Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (e)(5) of this section, the provisions of this paragraph (e)(2)(ii) govern the determination under paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section of a partner's proportionate share of the adjusted basis of oil or gas property. Each partner's proportionate share is determined in accordance with the partner's proportionate interest in partnership capital at the time of the allocation unless both—
(A) The partnership agreement provides that a partner's share of the adjusted basis of one or more properties is determined in accordance with his or her proportionate interest in partnership income; and
(B) At the time of allocation under the partnership agreement the share of each partner in partnership income is reasonably expected to be substantially unchanged throughout the life of the partnership, other than changes merely to reflect the admission of a new partner, an increase in a partners' interest in consideration for money, property, or services, or a partial or complete withdrawal of an existing partner
If the requirements of paragraph (e)(2)(ii) (A) and (B) of this section are met, a partner's proportionate share is determined in accordance with his or her proportionate interest in partnership income. The partners' shares of adjusted basis are determined on a property-by-property basis. Accordingly, the basis of one property may be allocated in proportion to capital and the basis of another property may be allocated in proportion to income. See §§ 1.613A-3(e)(5) and 1.704-1(b)(4)(v) for special rules concerning allocation of the adjusted basis of oil and gas properties.
(3)
Adjustments by partnership to allocated adjusted bases
—(i)
Capital expenditures by partnership.
Appropriate adjustments shall be made to the partners' adjusted bases in any domestic oil and gas property for any partnership capital expenditures relating to such property that are made after the initial allocation. These adjustments shall be allocated among the partners in accordance with the principles set forth in paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section.
(ii)
Admission of a new partner or increase in partner's interest
—(A)
In general.
Upon a contribution of money, other property, or services to the partnership by a new or existing partner (“contributing partner”) as consideration for an interest in the partnership, the partnership shall allocate, in accordance with paragraph (e)(3)(ii)(B) of this section, a share of the partnership's basis in each existing oil and gas property to the contributing partner, and each existing partner shall reduce, in accordance with paragraph (e)(3)(ii)(C) of this section, his or her share of the partnership's basis in such property.
(B)
Allocation of basis to contributing partner.
The partnership shall allocate to a contributing partner his or her proportionate share (determined under paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section in accordance with the partner's proportionate interest in partnership capital or income) of the partnership's adjusted basis in each existing partnership oil or gas property. For purposes of this allocation, the partnership's adjusted basis in such property equals the aggregate of its partner's adjusted bases in the property, as determined under paragraph (e)(3)(iii) of this section.
(C)
Reduction of existing partners' bases.
Each existing partner's basis in each existing partnership oil or gas
property is reduced by the percentage of the partnership's aggregate basis in the property that is allocated to the contributing partner. Thus, if one-third of the partnership's aggregate basis in a property is allocated to a contributing partner because the contributing partner has a one-third interest in partnership capital, after the admission of the contributing partner each existing partner's basis (including the contributing partner's pre-existing basis if such partner is also an existing partner) in each property equals the partner's basis (prior to the admission) reduced by one-third.
(iii)
Determination of aggregate of partners' adjusted bases in the property
—(A)
In general.
To determine the aggregate of its partners' adjusted bases for purposes of this paragraph (e)(3), the partnership must determine each partner's adjusted basis under either paragraph (e)(3)(iii)(B) (written data) or paragraph (e)(3)(iii)(C) (assumptions) of this section. The partnership is permitted to determine the bases of some partners under paragraph (e)(3)(iii)(B) of this section and of others under paragraph (e)(3)(iii)(C) of this section. For this purpose, a partner's basis in an oil or gas property does not include any basis adjustment under section 743(b).
(B)
Written data.
A partnership may determine a partners' basis in an oil or gas property by using written data provided by a partner stating the amount of the partner's adjusted basis or depletion deductions with respect to the property unless the partnership knows or has reason to know that the written data is inaccurate. In determining depletion deductions, a partner must treat as actually deducted any amount disallowed and carried over as a result of the 65 percent-of-income limitation of section 613A(d)(1). If a partnership does not receive written data upon which it may rely, the partnership must use the assumptions provided in paragraph (e)(3)(iii)(C) of this section in determining a partner's adjusted basis in an oil or gas property.
(C)
Assumptions.
Except as provided in paragraph (e)(3)(iv)(B) of this section, a partnership that does not use written data pursuant to paragraph (e)(3)(iii)(B) of this section to determine a partner's basis must use the following assumptions to determine the partner's adjusted basis in an oil and gas property:
(
1
) The partner deducted his or her share of deductions under section 263(c) in the first year in which the partner could claim a deduction for such amounts, unless the partnership elected to capitalize such amounts;
(
2
) The partner was not subject to the 65 percent-of-income limitation of section 613A(d)(1) with respect to the partner's depletion allowance under section 611; and
(
3
) The partner was not subject to the following limitations, with respect to the partner's depletion allowance under section 611, except to the extent a limitation applied at the partnership level: the taxable income limitation of section 613(a); the depletable quantity limitations of section 613A(c); the prohibition against claiming percentage depletion on transferred proven property under section 613A(c)(9), prior to its repeal; or the limitations of section 613A(d) (2), (3), and (4) (exclusion of retailers and refiners).
(iv)
Withdrawal of partner or decrease in partner's interest
—(A)
In general.
Upon a distribution of money or other property to a withdrawing partner as consideration for an interest in the partnership, the withdrawing partner's adjusted basis in each domestic oil or gas property that continues to be held by the partnership is allocated to the remaining partners in proportion to their proportionate interest in partnership capital or income after taking into account any increase or decrease as a result of the event giving rise to the reallocation. A similar rule shall apply in the case of a diminution of a continuing partner's interest in the partnership.
(B)
Special rule for determining a withdrawing partner's basis in the property.
If a partnership is required to determine a withdrawing partner's adjusted basis using the assumptions under paragraph (e)(3)(iii)(C) of this section, the partnership may rebut the assumption in paragraph (e)(3)(iii)(C)(
3
) of this section that the withdrawing partner was not subject to the limitations of sections 613A(d) (2), (3), and (4) exclusion of retailers and refiners) by demonstrating
that the withdrawing partner was subject to the limitations of sections 613A(d) (2), (3), or (4).
(v)
Effective date.
The provisions of § 1.613A-3(e)(3) (i) through (iv) are effective for taxable years beginning after May 13, 1991. However, a partnership may elect to apply these provisions to taxable years beginning on or before May 13, 1991.
(4)
Determination of a partner's interest in partnership capital or income.
For purposes of this paragraph (e), a partner's interest in partnership capital or income is determined by taking into account all facts and circumstances relating to the economic arrangement of the partners. See the factors listed in § 1.704-1(b)(3)(ii).
(5)
Special rules on allocation of adjusted basis to partners.
An allocation or reallocation of the adjusted basis of oil or gas property is pursuant to this paragraph (e) of this section deemed to be in accordance with the partner's proportionate interest in partnership capital or income for purposes of this paragraph (e) where so provided in § 1.704-1(b)(4)(v). In addition, in connection with a revaluation described in § 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(
f
), the basis of an oil or gas property is allocated among the partners based on the principles used under § 1.704-1(b)(4)(i) of allocating tax items to take into account variations between the adjusted basis of the property and its fair market value. In the case of an oil or gas property contributed to a partnership by a partner, section 704(c) is taken into account in determining the partner's share of the adjusted basis.
(6)
Miscellaneous rules.
(i) Each partner must separately keep records of his or her share of the adjusted basis in each domestic oil or gas property of the partnership, adjust his or her share of such basis pursuant to section 1016 (including adjustments for any depletion allowed or allowable with respect to such property), and use that adjusted basis each year in the computation of his or her cost depletion or in the computation of his or her gain or loss on the disposition (including abandonment) of the property by the partnership.
(ii) The adjusted basis of a partner's interest in a partnership is decreased (but not below zero) pursuant to section 705(a)(3) by the amount of the depletion deduction allowed or allowable to the partner with respect to a domestic oil or gas property to the extent such deduction does not exceed the proportionate share of the adjusted basis of such property allocated to the partner under section 613A(c)(7)(D), as adjusted by the partner after the initial allocation. Section 705(a)(1)(C) does not apply to depletion deductions that are not included in a partner's distributive share under section 702. Accordingly, the adjusted basis of a partner's interest in a partnership is not increased under section 705(a)(1)(C) with respect to depletion of oil or gas properties. See § 1.705-1(a)(2)(iii).
(iii) Upon the disposition of an oil or gas property by the partnership, each partner must subtract the partner's adjusted basis in the property from his or her allocable portion of the amount realized from the sale of the property to determine gain or loss. The partner's allocable portion of amount realized must, except to the extent governed by section 704(c) (or related principles under § 1.704-1(b)(4)(i)), be determined in accordance with § 1.704-1(b)(4)(v). Except as otherwise provided (e.g., section 751), the sale of a partnership interest is not treated as a sale of an oil and gas property.
(iv) In the case of a transfer of an interest in a partnership, the transferor partner's adjusted basis in each partnership oil or gas property carries over to the transferee partner. If an election under section 754 (relating to optional adjustment to the basis of partnership property) is in effect, such basis is adjusted in accordance with section 743.
(v) For purposes of section 732 (relating to basis of distributed property other than money) and section 734(b) (relating to optional adjustment to basis of partnership property), the partnership's adjusted basis in oil and gas property is an amount equal to the aggregate of its partners' adjusted bases in the property as determined under the rules provided in paragraph (e)(3) of this section.
(7)
Examples.
The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
A, B, and C have equal interests in capital in Partnership ABC. On January 1, 1992, the partnership acquired a producing domestic oil property. The partnership's basis in the property was $90x. The partnership allocated the adjusted basis of the property to each partner in proportion to the partner's interest in partnership capital. Accordingly, each partner was allocated an adjusted basis of $30x. Each partner must separately compute his or her depletion allowance. The amount of percentage depletion allowable for each partner for 1992 was $10x. On January 1, 1993, each partner's adjusted basis in the property was $20x ($30x minus $10x). On January 1, 1993, the oil property was sold for $150x. Each partner's gain was $30x ($50x allocable share of amount realized minus the partner's adjusted basis of $20x). Each partner must adjust the partner's adjusted basis in his or her partnership interest to reflect the gain.

# Example 2.
The facts are the same as in
Example 1
except that on January 1, 1993, the property was not sold but transferred by the partnership to partner A. A's basis in the property was $60x (the sum of A's, B's, and C's adjusted bases in the property).

# Example 3.
The facts are the same as in
Example 1
with the exception that in 1992 C was a retailer of oil and gas and was only entitled to a cost depletion deduction of $5x. C's gain from the sale of the mineral property on January 1, 1993, was $25x ($50x allocable share of amount realized minus C's adjusted basis of $25x ($30x minus $5x)).

# Example 4.
D, a calendar year taxpayer, is a partner in Partnership DEF which owns a domestic producing oil property. On January 1, 1993, the partnership's adjusted basis in the property was $900x. On January 1, 1993, D's adjusted basis in D's partnership interest was $300x and D's adjusted basis in the partnership's oil property was $300x. D's allowable percentage depletion for 1993 with respect to production from the oil property was $50x. On January 1, 1994, D's adjusted basis in D's partnership interest was $250x and D's adjusted basis in the partnership's oil property was $250x ($300x minus $50x).

# Example 5.
On January 1, 1990, G has an adjusted basis of $5x in partnership GH's proven domestic oil property, which is the sole asset of the partnership. On January 1, 1990 G sells G's partnership interest to I for $100x when the election under section 754 is in effect. I has a special basis adjustment for the oil property of $95x (the difference between I's basis, $100x, and I's share of the basis of the partnership property, $5x). I is not entitled to percentage depletion with respect to I's distributive share of the oil property income because I is a transferee of an interest in a proven oil property. However, I is entitled to cost depletion and for this purpose I's interest in the oil property has an adjusted basis to I of $100x ($5x, plus I's special basis adjustment of $95x).

# Example 6.
On January 1, 1960, Partnership JK acquired a domestic producing oil property. On January 1, 1990, the partnership's adjusted basis in the property was zero. On January 1, 1990, L is admitted as a partner to the partnership. Since the partnership's adjusted basis in the oil property is zero, L's proportionate share of the basis in the property is also zero. L is not entitled to percentage depletion because L is a transferee of a proven oil property (see paragraph (g) of this section). Since the property's basis is zero, L is also not entitled to any cost depletion with respect to production from the property.

# Example 7.
(i) O and P have equal interests in capital in Partnership OP. On January 1, 1991, the partnership acquired an unproven domestic oil property X the basis of which is $200x to the partnership. The partnership allocates $100x of the basis of the property to each partner in accordance with each partner's proportionate interest in partnership capital. For the 1991 taxable year, O has a $10x cost depletion allowance and P has a $25x percentage depletion allowance. Accordingly, at the end of the 1991 taxable year, O's adjusted basis in the property is $90x, and P's adjusted basis in the property is $75x. On January 1, 1992, Q is admitted as an equal partner. The partnership does not use written data from the partners and must therefore assume that each partner was entitled to $25x depletion based on the assumptions provided in § 1.613A-3(e)(3)(iii). This would result in a $50x combined depletion allowance for the partners and an aggregate adjusted basis in the oil property of $150x. Accordingly, the partnership allocates $50x of the basis of the property to Q, one-third of the aggregate adjusted basis determined by the partnership. O and P must each reduce their basis in the property by one-third. Accordingly, after the admission of Q, O's adjusted basis in the property is $60x ($90x minus $30x), and P's adjusted basis in the property is $50x ($75x minus $25x).
(ii) Assume the same facts as in paragraph (i) of this
Example 7
except that O informs the partnership that its adjusted basis in the property is $90x (determined without regard to section 613A(d)(1)). The partnership uses the written data provided by O and determines the aggregate adjusted basis in the property to be $165x ($90x + $75x). Accordingly, the partnership allocates $55x (
1/3
of $165x) of the basis of the property to Q, and O and P must each reduce their adjusted basis in the property by one-third, as in paragraph (i) of this
Example 7.
Thus, after the admission of Q, O's adjusted basis in the property is $60x and P's adjusted basis in the property is $50x.
(f)
S corporations.
For purposes of section 613A(c)(13), adjustments to shareholders' adjusted bases in any domestic oil or gas property to reflect capital expenditures by S corporations, the addition of a new shareholder or an increase in a shareholder's interest by reason of a contribution to the S corporation, the redemption of a shareholder's interest, or other appropriate transaction shall be made in accordance with principles similar to the principles under § 1.613A-3(e) applicable to the entry or withdrawal of a partner.
(g)
Trusts and estates.
(1) In the case of production from domestic oil and gas properties held by a trust or estate, the depletion allowance under section 611 shall be computed initially by the trust or estate. The determination of whether cost or percentage depletion is applicable shall be made at the trust or estate level, but such determination shall not result in the disallowance of cost depletion to a beneficiary of a trust or estate for whom cost depletion exceeds percentage depletion. The limitations contained in section 613A (c) and (d), other than section 613A(d)(1), shall be applied at the trust or estate level in its computation of percentage depletion pursuant to section 613A and shall also be applied by a beneficiary with respect to any percentage depletion apportioned to the beneficiary by the trust or estate. The limitation of section 613A(d)(1) shall be applied by each taxpayer (
i.e.,
trust, estate or beneficiary) only with respect to its allocable share of percentage depletion under section 611(b) (3) or (4). For purposes of adjustments to the basis of oil or gas properties held by a trust or estate, in the absence of clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, it shall be presumed that no beneficiary is affected by any section 613A (d) limitations or by the rules contained in section 613A(c)(8) and (9) (relating to businesses under common control and members of the same family and to transfers, respectively), as in effect prior to the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1990, or has any oil or gas production from sources other than the trust or estate.
(2) The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples.

# Example 1.
A is the income beneficiary of a trust the only asset of which is a domestic producing oil property. The trust instrument requires that an amount which equals 10 percent of the gross income from the property be set aside annually as a reserve for depletion. In 1975 the property a had production of 1,095,000 barrels of oil. The trust's gross income from the property in 1975 was $30,000x. In that year, after setting aside $3,000x of income for the reserve for depletion, the trustee distributed the remaining income to A which represented 80 percent of the trust's net income. The percentage depletion computed by the trust with respect to the production (computed as if section 613 applied to all of the production at the rate specified in section 613A(c)(5), as in effect prior to the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1990) for 1975 was $6,600x. The trust's average daily production for 1975 was 3,000 barrels (1,095,000 ÷ 365 days). The trust's allowable depletion pursuant to section 613A(c) with respect to the production was $4,400x:
EC08OC91.007
Pursuant to § 1.611-1(c)(4)(ii), the percentage depletion of $4,400x was apportioned between the trustee and A so that the trustee received $3,000x (an amount equal to the amount of income set aside for the reserve for depletion) and A received $1,400x of the depletion deduction. The $1,400x depletion received by A is attributable to 80 percent of the trust's depletable oil quantity,
i.e.,
1,600 barrels per day.

# Example 2.
B, a retailer of oil and gas, is the income beneficiary of a trust the only asset of which is a domestic producing oil property. In 1975 the trustee distributed one-half of the trust's net income and accumulated the other one-half for the benefit of the remainderman. One-half of the percentage depletion computed by the trust with respect to the production from the property was apportioned to B. Since B is a retailer of oil and gas, B is not entitled to deduct any of
the percentage depletion apportioned to B. However, B is entitled to take cost depletion with respect to one-half of the production from the oil property, notwithstanding the fact that depletion was computed at the trust level on the basis of percentage depletion.
(h)
Businesses under common control; members of the same family
—(1)
Component members of a controlled group.
For purposes of only the depletable quantity limitations contained in section 613A (c) and this section, component members of a controlled group of corporations (as defined in paragraph (1) of § 1.613A-7) shall be treated as one taxpayer. Accordingly, the group shares the depletable oil (or natural gas) quantity prescribed for a taxpayer for the taxable year and the secondary production (to which gross income from the property is attributable before January 1, 1984) of a member of the group will reduce the other members' share of the group's depletable quantity.
(2)
Aggregation of business entities under common control.
If 50 percent or more of the beneficial interest in any two or more entities (
i.e.,
corporations, trust, or estates) is owned by the same or related persons (taking into account only each person who owns at least 5 percent of the beneficial interest in an entity and with respect to such person his or her entire interest) as defined in paragraph (m) (2) of § 1.613A-7, the tentative quantity determined under the table in section 613A(c)(3)(B) (as in effect prior to the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1990) for a taxpayer for the taxable year shall be allocated among all such entities in proportion to their respective production. This paragraph (h)(2) shall not apply to component members of a controlled group of corporations (as defined in § 1.613A-7 (1)). For purposes of determining ownership interest, an interest owned by or for a corporation, partnership, trust, or estate shall be considered as owned directly both by itself and proportionately by its shareholders, partners, or beneficiaries, as the case may be.
(3)
Allocation among members of the same family.
In the case of individuals who are members of the same family, the tentative quantity determined under the table in section 613A (c)(3)(B) (as in effect prior to the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1990) for a taxpayer for the taxable year shall be allocated among such individuals in proportion to the respective production of barrels of domestic crude oil (and the equivalent in barrels to the cubic feet of natural gas determined under paragraph (h)(4)(ii) of this section) during the period in question by such individuals.
(4)
Special rules.
For purposes of section 613A (c)(8) and this section—
(i) The family of an individual includes only his spouse and minor children, and
(ii) Each 6,000 cubic feet of domestic natural gas shall be treated as 1 barrel of domestic crude oil.
(5)
Examples.
The application of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
A owns 50 percent of the stock of Corporation M and 50 percent of the stock of Corporation N. Both corporations are calendar year taxpayers. For 1975 Corporation M's production of domestic crude oil was 8,000,000 barrels (365,000 of which was secondary production) and Corporation N's was 2,000,000 barrels (all of which was primary production). The tentative quantity (2,000 barrels per day) determined under the table in section 613A (c)(3)(B) (as in effect prior to the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1990) must be allocated between the two corporations in proportion to their respective barrels of production of domestic crude oil during the taxable year. Corporation M's allocable share of the tentative quantity is 1,600 barrels:
EC08OC91.008
and Corporation N's allocable share is 400 barrels:
EC08OC91.009
With respect to M's primary production, M's depletable oil quantity is 600 barrels (1,600 barrels − 1,000 barrels [365,000 secondary production ÷ 365 days]). N's depletable oil quantity, unaffected by M's secondary production, is 400 barrels.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 1
except that Corporation M is a retailer and Corporation N is not selling its oil through Corporation M. Because Corporation M is a retailer, no portion of the tentative quantity is allocated to Corporation M. Accordingly, Corporation N's depletable oil quantity is the entire 2,000 barrels per day because section 613A (c), which contains the
allocation requirements, is inapplicable to retailers.

# Example 3.
Corporations O and P are members of a controlled group and are treated as one taxpayer as provided in paragraph (h)(1) of this section. Corporation O owns oil properties A and B. Property A had primary production for 1975 of 800,000 barrels of oil. Property B had secondary production for 1975 of 365,000 barrels of oil. Corporation P owns oil property C which had primary production of 660,000 barrels for 1975. The allowable percentage depletion with respect to property B's secondary production was $360x. The controlled group's average daily production was 4,000 barrels [(800,000 + 660,000) ÷ 365]. The controlled group's depletable oil quantity was 1,000 barrels [2,000 tentative quantity − 1,000 average daily secondary production (365,000 ÷ 365)]. The allowable percentage depletion pursuant to section 613 (a) (computed as if section 613 applied to all of the production at the rate specified in section 613A (c)(5), as in effect prior to the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1990) was $800x with respect to production from property A and $660x with respect to production from property C.
Corporation O's allowable depletion pursuant to section 613A (c) with respect to property B's secondary production (for which depletion is allowable before primary production) for 1975 was $360x. Corporation O's allowable depletion pursuant to section 613A (c) with respect to property A was $200x:
EC08OC91.010
Therefore, Corporation O's allowable depletion pursuant to section 613A (c) was $560x ($360x relating to property B plus $200x relating to property A). Corporation P's allowable depletion pursuant to section 613A (c) with respect to property C was $165x:
EC08OC91.011
(i)
Transfer of oil or gas property
—(1)
General rule
—(i)
In general.
Except as provided in paragraph (i)(2) of this section, in the case of a transfer (as defined in paragraph (n) of § 1.613A-7) of an interest in any proven oil or gas property (as defined in paragraph (p) of § 1.613A-7), paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall not apply to a transferee (as defined in paragraph (o) of § 1.613A-7) with respect to production of crude oil or natural gas attributable to such interest, and such production shall not be taken into account for any computation by the transferee under this section.
(ii)
Examples.
The provisions of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
On January 1, 1975, Individual A transfers proven oil properties to Corporation M in an exchange to which section 351 applies for shares of its stock. Since there is no allocation requirement pursuant to section 613A(c)(8) between A (the transferor) and Corporation M (the transferee), the transfer of the proven properties by A is a transfer for purposes of section 613A(c)(9) (as in effect prior to the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1990) and percentage depletion is not allowable to Corporation M with respect to such properties.

# Example 2.
On January 1, 1975, Corporation N sells proven oil property to Corporation O, its wholly-owned subsidiary. Because the transfer was made between corporations which are members of the same controlled group of corporations, Corporation O is entitled to percentage depletion with respect to production from the property so long as the tentative oil quantity is allocated between the two corporations. If Corporation N were a retailer, the tentative oil quantity would not be required to be allocated between the two corporations (see example 2 of § 1.613A-3(h)(5)), and Corporation O would not be entitled to percentage depletion on the production from the property.

# Example 3.
B, owner of a proven oil property, died on January 1, 1975. Pursuant to the provisions of B's will, B's estate transferred
the oil property on April 1, 1975, into a trust. On July 1, 1976, pursuant to a requirement in B's will, the trustee distributed the oil property to C. The transfer of the oil property by the estate to the trust and the later distribution of the property by the trust to C are transfers at death. Therefore, the trust was entitled to compute percentage depletion with respect to the production from the oil property when the property was owned by the trust and C is entitled to percentage depletion with respect to production from the oil property after the trust distributes the property to C.

# Example 4.
On January 1, 1975, property which produces oil resulting from secondary processes was transferred to D. The exemption under section 613A(c) applies to D because section 613A(c)(9) (relating to transfers of oil or gas property), as in effect in 1975, does not apply with respect to secondary production. In addition, even if at the time of the transfer the production from the property was primary and D applied secondary processes to the property transferred and obtained secondary production, D would be entitled to percentage depletion with respect to the secondary production.

# Example 5.
On July 1, 1975, E and F entered into a contract whereby F is given the privilege of drilling a well on E's unproven property, and if F does so F is to own the entire working interest in the property until F has recoverd all the costs of drilling, equipping, and operating the well. Thereafter, 50 percent of the working interest would revert to E. In accordance with the contract, 50 percent of the working interest reverted to E on July 1, 1976. F is entitled to percentage depletion because the transfer of the working interest to F occurred when the property was unproven on July 1, 1975, which is the date of the contract establishing F's right to the working interest. E is entitled to percentage depletion with respect to this working interest since the reversion of such interest with respect to which E was eligible for percentage depletion is not a transfer. However, if on the date of the contract E's property was proven (although not proven when E acquired the property), F would not be entitled to claim percentage depletion with respect to any of the working interest income. Nonetheless, E would still be entitled to percentage depletion with respect to E's working interest since the reversion of the interest is not a transfer.

# Example 6.
On January 1, 1975, G subleased an oil property to H, retaining a
1/8
royalty interest with the option to convert G's royalty into a 50-percent working interest. On July 1, 1975, the property was proven and on July 1, 1976, G exercised G's option. G is entitled to claim percentage depletion with respect to G's working interest since the conversion of the royalty interest which is eligible for percentage depletion pursuant to section 613A(c) into an interest which constituted part of an interest previously owned by G is not a transfer pursuant to § 1.613A-7(n)(8).

# Example 7.
I and J (both of whom are minors) are beneficiaries of a trust which owned a proven oil property. The oil property was transferred to the trust on January 1, 1975, by the father of I and J. For 1975, the trustee allocated all the income from the oil property to I. For 1976, the trustee allocated all the income from such property to J. On January 1, 1977, the trustee distributed the property to I and J as equal tenants in common. Since I, J, and their father are members of the same family within the meaning of section 613A(c)(8)(C), the transfer of the property to the trust by the father, the shifting of income between I and J, and the distribution of the oil property by the trust to I and J are not transfers for purposes of section 613A(c)(9) (as in effect prior to the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1990). However, the distribution of the oil property will constitute a transfer to each distributee on the date on which the distributee reaches majority under state law.

# Example 8.
In 1975, K transferred a proven oil property productive at 5,000 feet to L. Subsequent to the transfer, L drilled new wells on the property finding another reservoir at 10,000 feet. The two zones were combined under section 614 as a single property. L is not entitled to percentage depletion on the gross income attributable to the production from the productive zone at 5,000 feet, but is entitled to percentage depletion on the gross income attributable to the production from the productive zone at 10,000 feet because that zone was not part of the proven property until the date of development expenses by L, which is after the date of the transfer. Accordingly, L's maximum allowable percentage depletion deduction for 1975 would be zero percent of gross income from the property with respect to the production from 5,000 feet, plus 22 percent of gross income from the property with respect to the production from 10,000 feet. This maximum deduction would be subject to the limitation provided for in section 613(a),
i.e.,
50 percent of “taxable income from the property (computed without allowance for depletion),” such taxable income being the overall taxable income resulting from the sale of production from both zones, and would also be subject to the limitations provided in section 613A. The production from the productive zone at 5,000 feet is not taken into account in determining K's depletable oil quantity for the year.

# Example 9.
On July 1, 1975, M transferred an oil property with a fair market value of $100x to N. On February 1, 1976, N commenced production of oil from the property. The fair market value of the property on February 1, 1976, as reduced by actual costs incurred by
N for equipment and intangible drilling and development costs, was $300x. Because the value of the property on transfer was not 50 percent or more of the value on February 1, 1976, the property transferred to N was not a proven property (see § 1.613A-7(p)). However, if there had been only marginal production from the property so that the fair market value of the property on February 1, 1976, was $40x rather than $300x, the property transferred to N would have been a proven property provided the other requirements of a proven property were met.

# Example 10.
O is the owner of a remainder interest in a trust created January 1, 1970. On that date, the trust held oil and gas properties. On January 1, 1976, O's interest for the first time entitled O to the trust's income from oil and gas production from the properties. The reversion of the remainder interest to O is not a transfer (see § 1.613A-7(n)(7)). Accordingly, the transfer of the interest in oil and gas property to O is deemed to have occurred on January 1, 1970, the date O's interest was created.

# Example 11.
On January 1, 1976, P, Q, and R entered into a partnership for the acquisition of oil and gas leases. It was agreed that the sharing of income will be divided equally among P, Q, and R. However, it was further agreed that with respect to the first production obtained from each property acquired P will receive 80 percent thereof and Q and R each will receive 10 percent thereof until $100x has been received by P. Assume these allocations have substantial economic effect under section 704 of the Code and the regulations thereunder. On February 1, 1976, Partnership PQR acquired an unproven property and production therefrom was shared pursuant to the partnership agreement. P is entitled to percentage depletion with respect to the production allocated to him since the transfer of right to the production is deemed to have been made on the date the partnership agreement became applicable to the specific property, at which time the property was unproven. See § 1.613A-7(n) for rules relating to the definition of transfer. Similarly, when $100x has been obtained and Q and R each commence receiving 33
1/3
percent of the revenue, Q and R are entitled to percentage depletion with respect to their entire interests. However, if the property had been proven when acquired by the partnership, P, Q, and R would not be entitled to claim any percentage depletion with respect to production from the property.

# Example 12.
On December 30, 1960, S placed producing oil property in trust for the benefit of S's nephew, T, and executed a trust agreement which required the trustee of the trust to transfer the oil property to T on January 1, 1975. The trustee's transfer of the oil property to T on January 1, 1975, is deemed to have occurred on December 30, 1960 (see § 1.613A-7(n)). Since the transfer is deemed to have occurred before January 1, 1975, section 613A(c) applies with respect to the production from the oil property. Moreover, if the trustee was not required to transfer the oil property on a specific date but was given discretion to select the date of transfer, the transfer of such property would still be deemed to have occurred on December 30, 1960. However, the result would be different if the trust agreement had provided that the trustee, at the trustee's discretion, may transfer the oil property to T on January 1, 1975, but is not under any obligation to transfer the property to T on January 1, 1975, or on any other date. Since the transfer was discretionary, the date of the actual transfer governs.

# Example 13.
On January 1, 1974, U acquired an oil property. On February 1, 1974, U granted V an option to purchase the oil property. V exercised V's option on March 2, 1975, and subsequently the oil property was conveyed to V. The date of the transfer was March 2, 1975, the day V exercised V's option (on which date both parties were bound).

# Example 14.
On July 1, 1974, W executed a deed conveying oil and gas property to X. W delivered the deed to X on January 1, 1975. Under state law, the mere execution of the deed without delivery did not give X any rights in the property. Title to the oil property passed to X on the date of delivery. Therefore, the date of transfer was January 1, 1975.

# Example 15.
Y, owner of a proven oil property, transferred Y's interest therein on July 25, 1975, to a revocable trust of which Y is treated as the owner under section 676. Y is not deemed a transferee and section 613A(c) applies to Y because immediately preceding the transfer Y was entitled to percentage depletion on the production from the property.

# Example 16.
On January 1, 1975, a proven oil property was transferred to Z; therefore, section 613A(c)(1) did not apply with respect to the production from such property. After Z's death, neither Z's estate nor its beneficiaries are entitled to percentage depletion with respect to the decedent's oil property since Z was a transferee of proven property.

# Example 17.
Partnership ABC, owner of proven oil and gas properties, admitted D as a partner in 1975 in consideration of cash. The shares of Partners A, B, and C of the partnership income were proportionately reduced so that D had a 25 percent interest in the income. D is not entitled to percentage depletion with respect to D's share of partnership oil and gas income because D is a transferee for purposes of section 613A(c)(9) (as in effect prior to the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1990). See § 1.613A-7(n).

# Example 18.
On January 1, 1975, E and F formed Partnership EF to which E contributed proven oil property. For 1975, pursuant to the partnership agreement 70 percent of the mineral income from the property was
allocated to E and 30 percent of the mineral income from the property was allocated F. F is not entitled to percentage depletion with respect to production from the property because F is a transferee of an interest in proven property. However, E is not a transferee of an interest in proven property because E was entitled to percentage depletion on the oil produced with respect to the property immediately before the transfer. Therefore, E is entitled to percentage depletion with respect to the income allocated to E. However, if in 1976 the partnership agreement were revised so that E's interest in the income was increased by 10 percent, E would not be entitled to percentage depletion with respect to the additional 10 percent interest because E is a transferee with respect thereto.

# Example 19.
G is the owner of a
1/3
interest in a partnership owning a proven oil property, and as such is entitled to
1/3
of the income from the property. G received a distribution on July 1, 1975, from the partnership of a
1/3
interest in the proven oil property. Although the transfer of such interest is a transfer for purposes of section 613A(c)(9) (as in effect prior to the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1990), G is still entitled to percentage depletion with respect to the
1/3
interest in the oil production from the property since G was entitled to percentage depletion on such production with respect to such property immediately before the transfer. If the entire property were distributed to G, G's percentage depletion allowance would still be based on only
1/3
of the oil produced.

# Example 20.
H and I contributed property X and property Y respectively to Partnership HI. The partnership agreement provides that all the gross income from property X is to be allocated to H and all the gross income from property Y is to be allocated to I. Assume these allocations have substantial economic effect under section 704 of the Code and the regulations thereunder. For 1975 H and I each received $100x gross income. Although the contributions of the properties by H and I are transfers for purposes of section 613A(c)(9) (as in effect prior to the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1990), both H and I are entitled to percentage depletion with respect to the $100x income received since each was entitled to a percentage depletion allowance with respect to the property contributed immediately before the transfer. However, if no special allocation of income were made but H and I are to share equally in the income from both properties, each would be entitled to a depletion allowance based on only one-half of the production with respect to the property he had contributed. If property X produces $100x of gross income from the property and property Y produces $200x of gross income from the property, H would be entitled to percentage depletion but only with respect to $50x (50 percent of $100x) of gross income from the property and I would be entitled to percentage depletion with respect to $100x (50 percent of $200x) of gross income from the property.
(2)
Transfers after October 11, 1990
—(i)
General rule.
Section 613A(c) (9) and (10), as in effect prior to the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1990 (relating to prohibition of percentage depletion on transferred proven properties) has been repealed effective for transfers after October 11, 1990. Accordingly, a transferee of a proven oil or gas property transferred after October 11, 1990 is permitted to claim percentage depletion with respect to production from the property. For purposes of transfers of property occurring before October 12, 1990 under section 613A(c)(10), prior to its repeal, the disposition of stock after October 11, 1990 by a transferor will not result in a reduction in the depletable quantity of the transferee corporation under section 613A(c)(10)(F).
(ii)
Transfer.
The term “transfer” has the same meaning as under § 1.613A-7(n).
(iii)
Transferee.
A person shall not be treated as a transferee with respect to a transferred property to the extent that such person held an interest in the property but was not entitled to a percentage depletion allowance on mineral produced with respect to the property immediately before the transfer. Thus, for example, if a taxpayer who is not entitled to claim percentage depletion on a proven property transfers the property to a partnership for an interest in the partnership, the taxpayer is not a transferee with respect to the property in the hands of the partnership.
(iv)
Effective date.
The provisions of paragraph (i)(2) of § 1.613A-3 are effective for transfers occurring after May 13, 1991. However, a taxpayer may elect to apply these provisions to transfers occurring after October 11, 1990 and on or before May 13, 1991.
(v)
Examples.
The examples below illustrate the provisions of this subparagraph. The examples ignore the application of any restriction on percentage depletion other than the proven property transfer rule.

# Example 1.
On December 31, 1991, A transfers a proven oil property to B. B may claim percentage depletion with respect to production from the property regardless of whether
production from the property was eligible for percentage depletion in A's hands (even if A were a retailer or refiner of oil or gas).

# Example 2.
On October 10, 1990, A transfers a proven oil property to B. B may not claim percentage depletion with respect to production from the property.

# Example 3.
On January 1, 1990, C purchases a proven oil property. Because C is a transferee of a proven property, production from the property is not eligible for percentage depletion in C's hands. On December 31, 1991, C contributes the property to Corporation M, an S corporation in which C owns 100 percent of the stock. The contribution of the property is a transfer, but C is not a transferee with respect to the property in the hands of the corporation. Accordingly, C may not claim percentage depletion with respect to production from the property. However, if prior to the contribution C had been entitled to claim percentage depletion with respect to production from the property, C would be entitled to claim percentage depletion with respect to production from the property after the contribution.

# Example 4.
On December 31, 1991, C contributes a proven oil property (with respect to which C is not entitled to claim percentage depletion) to Corporation N, an S corporation in which C owns 30 percent and D owns 70 percent of the stock. The contribution of the property is a transfer, but C is not a transferee with respect to the property in the hands of the corporation. Accordingly, C may not claim percentage depletion with respect to C's share of the production from the property. D is a transferee with respect to the property in the hands of Corporation N, and may claim percentage depletion with respect to D's share of production from the property.

# Example 5.
On December 31, 1991, D transfers a proven oil property (with respect to which D is not entitled to claim percentage depletion) to DE, an equal partnership between D and E. E is a transferee with respect to the property and may claim percentage depletion with respect to production from the property allocated to E under the DE partnership agreement. D is not a transferee with respect to the property, and may not claim percentage depletion with respect to production from the property allocated to D under the DE partnership agreement. However, if D had been entitled to claim percentage depletion with respect to production from the property, then D would be entitled to claim percentage depletion with respect to production from the property in the hands of DE.

# Example 6.
On January 1, 1990, Corporation P contributes a proven property to Corporation O, its wholly owned subsidiary. Under § 1.613A-7(n)(4), the contribution is not treated as a transfer, but only for so long as the tentative quantity is required under section 613A(c)(8) to be allocated between P and O. On December 31, 1991, P sells 90% of the O stock to an unrelated person; accordingly, the tentative quantity is no longer required under section 613A(c)(8) to be allocated between P and O. After the sale of O stock, production from the property in O's hands is eligible for percentage depletion because a transfer of a proven property is deemed to occur upon the transfer of the stock.

# Example 7.
On October 10, 1990, G transfers a proven oil property to his minor son, H. G had been entitled to claim percentage depletion with respect to production from the property. Under § 1.613A-7(n)(5), H is permitted to claim percentage depletion for so long as G and H are related persons under section 613A(c)(8)(C). On December 31, 1991, H reaches majority and is no longer related to G under section 613A(c)(8)(C). H is entitled to continue to claim percentage depletion on production from the property because the property is treated as being transferred to H on December 31, 1991.

# Example 8.
On December 31, 1991, I sells a proven property to J, her husband. I had not been entitled to claim percentage depletion with respect to production from the property. Under § 1.613A-7(n)(5), the sale is not a transfer because it is made between persons related under section 613A(c)(8). Accordingly, J may not claim percentage depletion with respect to production from the property. If, however, I had been entitled to claim percentage depletion with respect to production from the property, J would be entitled to claim percentage depletion with respect to production from the property.

# Example 9.
On December 31, 1991, L inherits a proven property from K. K had not been entitled to claim percentage depletion with respect to production from the property. Under § 1.613A-7(n)(1), the inheritance is not a transfer. Accordingly, L may not claim percentage depletion with respect to production from the property. If, however, K had been entitled to claim percentage depletion with respect to production from the property, L would be entitled to claim percentage depletion with respect to production from the property.

# Example 10.
On December 31, 1991, Corporation R, a calendar year taxpayer, made an S election effective for the taxable year beginning January 1, 1992 and succeeding taxable years. Since Corporation R is deemed to have transferred its oil and gas properties on January 1, 1992, the shareholders of Corporation R are eligible to claim percentage depletion with respect to the production from the properties.

# Example 11.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 10
except that Corporation R makes the S election on December 31, 1989, effective for the taxable year beginning January 1, 1990 and succeeding taxable years. Since Corporation R is deemed to have transferred its
oil and gas properties on January 1, 1990, the shareholders of Corporation R are not eligible to claim percentage depletion with respect to the production from the properties.
(j)
Percentage depletion with respect to bonuses and advanced royalties
—(1)
Amounts received or accrued after August 16, 1986.
In computing the percentage depletion allowance pursuant to section 613A(c) with respect to amounts received or accrued after August 16, 1986, there shall not be taken into account any advance royalty (to the extent that actual production during the taxable year is insufficient to earn such royalty), lease bonus, or other amount payable without regard to production, even though the amount may be taken into account for purposes of sections 61 and 612 (relating to definitions of gross income and cost depletion, respectively).
(2)
Amounts received or accrued before August 17, 1986.
(i) A lease bonus or advanced royalty received or accrued before August 17, 1986, with respect to oil or gas property shall be taken into account for purposes of percentage depletion in the taxable year such payment is includible in income. Percentage depletion shall be determined according to the depletion rate and depletable oil and natural gas limitations of section 613A(c)(1) and § 1.613A-3(a) applicable on the date of such inclusion. The payee of the bonus or advanced royalty shall apply the depletable oil and natural gas quantity limitations by attributing a specific number of barrels of oil or cubic feet of natural gas to the lease bonus or advanced royalty. The determination of the number of barrels of oil or cubic feet of natural gas shall be based on the average price of oil or gas produced from the property during the taxable year. If oil or gas is not produced from the property during that year, or if the oil or gas is not sold before conversion or transportation from the premises, the number of barrels of oil or cubic feet of gas shall be based on a price (as of the date of the bonus or advanced royalty) determined under the constructive pricing principles applicable under section 613(a), generally the representative market or field price. In the case where no oil or gas has been produced in such year, the constructive price applicable to the type of production expected to be produced from the property shall apply. However, if the first actual production from the property in a later year is different from the type of production upon which the conversion of the bonus or advanced royalty into barrels of oil or cubic feet of gas was based and the period of limitations on assessment has not expired (see section 6501) for the year in which the lease bonus or advanced royalty is includible in income, the taxpayer should promptly file an amended return, if necessary. In the amended return the conversion shall be recomputed taking into account the pricing applicable to the actual production. For purposes of paragraph (f) of § 1.613A-7, the number of barrels of oil or cubic feet of natural gas attributed to a lease bonus or advanced royalty is deemed to have been extracted on the date the bonus or advanced royalty is includible in the payee's income.
(ii) For purposes of applying the depletable oil and natural gas quantity limitations in taxable years after the year in which the advanced royalty payment is included in income, the payee of an advanced royalty which is recouped out of future production shall not include production which recoups the advanced royalty in such later years. The payor of a bonus or advanced royalty that is not recouped from future production may reduce the production to be taken into account for purposes of applying the depletable quantity limitations in each year in which the payor's gross income from the property is adjusted under § 1.613-2(c)(5)(ii) to reflect the bonus paid by an amount determined by dividing the portion of the bonus required to be excluded from the payor's gross income from the property by the price of oil or gas applicable to the payee for converting the bonus into barrels of oil or cubic feet of gas.
(iii) See § 1.612-3 (a)(2) and (b)(2) for rules relating to the requirement that certain depletion deductions allowed with respect to lease bonuses and advanced royalties be restored to income.
(k)
Special rules for fiscal year taxpayers.
In applying this section to a taxable year which is not a calendar year, each portion of such taxable year which occurs during a single calendar
year shall be treated as if it were a short taxable year.
(l)
Information furnished by partnerships, trusts, estates, and operators.
Each partnership, trust, or estate producing domestic crude oil or natural gas, and each operator of a well from which domestic crude oil or natural gas was produced, shall provide each partner, beneficiary, or person holding a nonoperating interest, as the case may be, with all information in its possession necessary to determine the amount of his depletion deduction allowable with respect to such crude oil or natural gas. For example, for each property a partnership is required to provide each partner with partnership information relating to the partner's allocable share of gross income from the property, the partner's allocable share of operating expenses, the partner's allocable share of depreciation, the partner's share of allocated overhead, the partner's share of estimated reserves, the partner's share of production in barrels or cubic feet for the taxable year, the partner's original share of the partnership adjusted basis of properties producing domestic crude oil or domestic natural gas, the partner's allocable share of any adjustments made to the basis of such properties by the partnership, and the percentage by which existing partners must reduce their bases in a partnership oil or gas property upon entry of a partner by contribution. In addition, upon the disposition of an oil or gas property by the partnership, the partnership shall inform each partner of his allocable portion of the amount realized from the sale of the property.

§ 1.613A-4
Limitations on application of § 1.613A-3 exemption.
(a)
Limitation based on taxable income.
(1) The aggregate amount of a taxpayer's deductions allowed pursuant to section 613A(c) for the taxable year shall not exceed 65 percent of the taxpayer's taxable income (reduced in the case of an individual by the zero bracket amount for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1976, and before January 1, 1987) for the year, adjusted to eliminate the effects of:
(i) Any depletion with respect to an oil or gas property (other than a gas property with respect to which the depletion allowance for all production is determined pursuant to section 613A(b)) for which percentage depletion would exceed cost depletion in the absence of the depletable quantity limitations contained in section 613A(c) (1) and (6) (as in effect prior to the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1990) or the taxable income limitation contained in section 613A(d)(1);
(ii) Any net operating loss carryback to the taxable year under section 172;
(iii) Any capital loss carryback to the taxable year under section 1212; and
(iv) In the case of a trust, any distributions to its beneficiaries, except in the case of any trust where any beneficiary of such trust is a member of the family (as defined in section 267(c)(4)) of a settlor who created inter vivos and testamentary trusts for members of the family and such settlor died within the last 6 days of the 5th month in 1970, and the law in the jurisdiction in which such trust was created requires all or a portion of the gross or net proceeds of any royalty or other interest in oil, gas, or other mineral representing any percentage depletion allowance to be allocated to the principal of the trust.
The amount disallowed (as defined in paragraph (q) of § 1.613A-7) shall be carried over to the succeeding year and treated as an amount allowable as a deduction pursuant to section 613A(c) for such succeeding year, subject to the 65-percent limitation of section 613A(d)(1). For rules relating to corporations filing a consolidated return, see the regulations under section 1502. With respect to fiscal year taxpayers, except as provided in § 1.613A-1 for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1975, and ending after that date, the limitation shall be calculated on the entire fiscal year and not applied with respect to each short period included in a fiscal year. For purposes of basis adjustments and
determining whether cost depletion exceeds percentage depletion with respect to the production from a property, any amount disallowed as a deduction after the application of this paragraph shall be allocated to the respective properties from which the oil or gas was produced in proportion to the percentage depletion otherwise allowable to such properties pursuant to section 613A(c). Accordingly, the maximum amount which may be allowable as a deduction pursuant to section 613A(c) after application of this paragraph (65 percent × adjusted taxable income) shall be allocated to properties for which percentage depletion pursuant to section 613A(c) would be allowed in the absence of the limitation contained in section 613A(d)(1) by application of the same proportion. However, once it is determined that after application of this paragraph cost depletion exceeds percentage depletion with respect to a property, the maximum amount determined under the preceding sentence shall be reallocated among the remaining properties, and the portion of the amount disallowed which is allocable to such property shall be the amount by which percentage depletion pursuant to section 613A(c) before application of this paragraph exceeds cost depletion. See example 1 of paragraph (a)(2) of this section. If the taxpayer becomes entitled to the deduction in a later year (
i.e.,
because the disallowed depletion does not exceed 65 percent of the taxpayer's taxable income for that year after taking account of any percentage depletion deduction otherwise allowable for that year), then the basis of the taxpayer's properties must be adjusted downward (but not below zero) by the amount of the deduction in proportion to the portion of the amount disallowed to the respective properties in the year of the disallowance. However, if the property in question was disposed of by the taxpayer prior to the beginning of such later year, the amount of the deduction in such later year shall be reduced by the difference between the taxpayer's adjusted basis in the property at the time it is disposed of and the adjusted basis which the taxpayer would have had in the property in the absence of the 65-percent limitation.
(2) The application of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
A owns producing oil properties M, N, and O. With respect to property M, the depletion allowable pursuant to section 613A(c) for 1975 without regard to section 613A(d)(1) was $60 × (cost depletion would have been $40 × ). With respect to property N, the depletion allowable pursuant to section 613A(c) for 1975 without regard to section 613A(d)(1) was $90 × (cost depletion would have been zero). With respect to property O, the depletion pursuant to section 613A(c) for 1975 without regard to section 613A(d)(1) was $50 × (cost depletion would have been $10X). A's taxable income (as adjusted under § 1.613A-4(a)(1)) for 1975 was $100 × ; accordingly, A's percentage depletion pursuant to section 613A(c) for 1975 must be reduced from $200 × to $65 × (65 percent × $100 × taxable income). Of that amount, $19.5 × :
EC08OC91.012
is tentatively allocated to property M, $29.25 × :
EC08OC91.013
is tentatively allocated to property N, and $16.25 × :
EC08OC91.014
is tentatively allocated to property O.
Since cost depletion of $40 × with respect to property M exceeded the percentage depletion of $19.5 × allowable on such property, A claimed the cost depletion. Accordingly, the only percentage depletion deduction allowable to A pursuant to section 613A(c) for 1975 is with respect to properties N and O. Therefore, the $65 × ceiling applies to the percentage depletion allowable on properties N and O. Of that amount, $41.79 × :
EC08OC91.015
is allocated to property N, and $23.21 × :
EC08OC91.016
is allocated to property O.
Accordingly, A is allowed a total depletion deduction of $105 × ($40 × cost depletion on property M + $41.79 × percentage depletion on property N + $23.21 × percentage depletion on property O). The amount disallowed to A under section 613A(d)(1) is $95 × ($200 × aggregate depletion allowable before application of section 613A(d)(1) − $105 × [$40 × cost depletion allowable on property M + $41.79 × percentage depletion allowable on property N after application of section 613A(d)(1) + $23.21 × depletion allowable on property O after application of section 613A(d)(1)]). For purposes of basis adjustments, $20 × ($60 × percentage depletion before limitation − $40 × cost depletion allowed) of the amount disallowed is allocated to property M. The balance of the amount disallowed of $75 × is allocated $48.21 × :
EC08OC91.017
to property N, and
EC08OC91.018
to property O.

# Example 2.
The amount disallowed to B as a deduction under this paragraph is $50x for 1975 and $125x for 1976 (including the $50x carried over from 1975). B may carry forward the $125x as a deduction to 1977 and subsequent years.

# Example 3.
C is a fiscal year taxpayer whose fiscal year ended on May 31, 1975. For purposes of applying the 65 percent of taxable income limitation, the period beginning January 1, 1975, and ending May 31, 1975, is treated as a short taxable year. The depletion allowable pursuant to section 613A(c) without regard to section 613A(d)(1) for such short taxable year was $80x and A's taxable income (as adjusted under § 1.613A-4(a)(1)) during such short taxable year was $100x. Only $65x (65 percent × $100x adjusted taxable income) of the deduction pursuant to section 613A(c) was deductible for such portion of 1975, in addition to any percentage depletion allowable for June 1, 1974, through December 31, 1974. With respect to the taxable year commencing June 1, 1975, and ending May 31, 1976, the 65 percent limitation is applied to the taxable income for the entire taxable year.

# Example 4.
Under the trust law of State X, a trustee is required to allocate 22 percent of gross mineral income to the principal of a trust for purposes of maintaining a reserve for depletion and the depletion deduction is entirely allocated to the trustee. In 1975 the gross income of a trust in State X the only assets of which were oil properties was $1,000. The trust's allowable percentage depletion pursuant to section 613A(c) without regard to section 613A(d)(1) was $220. The trust incurred expenses of $150 for the taxable year and made distributions to beneficiaries (who are not described in the exception for family members set forth in paragraph (a)(1)(iv) of this section) of $630 ($1,000 gross income −$220 allocated to principal −$150 expenses). The trust's deduction for personal exemption under section 642(b) is $300. For purposes of applying the 65 percent limitation, the trust's taxable income was $550 ($1,000 gross income −$150 expenses −$300 exemption). The limitation under section 613A(d)(1) was $357.50 (65% × $550 taxable income). Accordingly, the trust's percentage depletion allowance was unaffected by the 65 percent limitation.

# Example 5.
In 1980 the gross income of the estate of D was $1,000. The only assets of the estate were oil properties. The estate's adjusted basis in the oil properties was $0. The estate's allowable percentage depletion pursuant to section 613A(c) without regard to section 613A(d)(1) was $220. The estate incurred expenses of $150 for the taxable year and made distributions to beneficiaries of $425. The distributions thus equaled one half of the net income of the estate (ignoring depletion). Under section 611(b)(4), the percentage depletion is apportioned equally between the estate and its beneficiary. The distribution amount of $425 is deductible under section 661(a) in computing the taxable income of the estate. For purposes of applying the 65 percent limitation to the percentage depletion apportioned to the estate, the estate's taxable income was $0 ($1,000 gross income −$150 expenses −$425 distribution −$600 exemption). The limitation under section 613A(d)(1) was therefore also $0 (65% × $0 taxable income). Accordingly, the $110 amount is disallowed to the estate for the taxable year but may be carried forward by the estate as a deduction to 1981 and subsequent years. The beneficiaries shall apply the 65 percent limitation to the $110 percentage depletion apportioned to them based on their respective taxable incomes.

# Example 6.
In 1975 E sold an oil property for which E's adjusted basis was $20x. The amount disallowed for 1975 to E under section 613A(d) was $10x. The amount of the carryover under that section to 1976 was $0 ($10x disallowed amount −$10x [$20x adjusted basis of property on sale −$10x adjusted basis which taxpayer would have had in the property in the absence of the 65-percent limitation]). However, if the adjusted basis of the property on disposition had been $0, the amount of the carryover to 1976 would have been $10x ($10x disallowed amount −$0 adjusted basis of property on sale).

# Example 7.
In 1975 F owned producing properties M, N, O, P, Q, and R. With respect to
property M, the allowable cost depletion was $100x (the allowable percentage depletion pursuant to section 613A(c) without regard to the depletable quantity and taxable income limitations contained in section 613A(c)(1), (6) and (d)(1) would have been $90x). With respect to property N, the allowable percentage depletion pursuant to section 613A(c) before applying section 613A(d)(1) was $80x (cost depletion would have been $0). With respect to property O, the allowable cost depletion was $60x (the allowable percentage depletion pursuant to section 613A(c) would have been $70x, except that the application of section 613A(d)(1) reduced allowable percentage depletion to less than $60x). With respect to property P, the allowable percentage depletion pursuant to section 613A(b) was $55x (cost depletion would have been $40x). With respect to property Q, which produces both gas subject to section 613A(b)(1)(B) and oil subject to section 613A(c), the allowable percentage depletion was $45x (cost depletion would have been $40x). With respect to property R, the allowable cost depletion was $40x (the allowable percentage depletion pursuant to section 613A(c) would have been $50x, except that the application of section 613A(c)(7)(A) reduced allowable percentage depletion to less than $40x). Under paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, for purposes of applying the 65 percent limitation under section 613A(d)(1), F's taxable income must be reduced by the allowable depletion with respect to property M (for which cost depletion exceeded percentage depletion even in the absence of section 613A(c)(1), (6), and (d)) and property P (for which all depletion is determined pursuant to section 613A(b)), but shall not be reduced by the allowable depletion with respect to properties N, O, Q, and R.
(b)
Retailers excluded.
(1) Section 613A(c) and § 1.613A-3 shall not apply in the case of any taxpayer who is a retailer as defined in paragraph (r) of § 1.613A-7.
(2) The application of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples (those that involve sales through retail outlets assume, unless otherwise stated, that the $5,000,000 gross receipts requirement section 613A(d)(2) is met):

# Example 1.
A, owner of producing oil and gas properties, also owns 5 percent in value of the stock of Corporation M, a retailer of oil and gas. None of A's production is sold through Corporation M. Since A may benefit from Corporation M's sales of oil and gas through A's ownership interest in Corporation M, A is considered to be selling oil or natural gas through Corporation M, a related person. Accordingly, the exemption under section 613A(c) does not apply to A, even though none of A's production is sold through Corporation M.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 1
except that A has gross receipts of $2 million from sales of oil for the taxable year from A's retail outlets and Corporation M has gross receipts of $4 million from sales of oil for the taxable year from its retail outlets. For purposes of the $5 million gross receipts requirement of section 613A(d)(2), A is treated as having gross receipts of $6 million. Accordingly, the exemption under section 613A(c) does not apply to A.

# Example 3.
Corporation N, a retailer of oil and gas, owns 5 percent in value of the stock of Corporation O, owner of producing oil and gas properties. None of Corporation O's production is sold through Corporation N. Since Corporation O has no direct or indirect ownership interest in Corporation N, and therefore does not benefit from Corporation N's sales of oil and gas, and since none of Corporation O's production is sold through Corporation N, the exemption under section 613A(c) applies to Corporation O.

# Example 4.
Corporation P, a producer of oil, owns 70 percent in value of the stock of Corporation Q. Corporation Q owns 30 percent in value of the stock of Corporation R. Corporation R owns 30 percent in value of the stock of Corporation S, a retailer of oil and gas. P indirectly owns 6.3 percent (70 percent × 30 percent × 30 percent) in value of the stock of Corporation S. Since P may benefit from Corporation S's sales of oil and gas through P's indirect ownership interest in Corporation S, P is not entitled to percentage depletion.

# Example 5.
B is the owner of certain oil and gas properties in Texas and is also the owner of a service station in Washington, DC, which B leases to Corporation T. None of B's production is sold to Corporation T. The exemption under section 613A(c) applies to B. However, if sales of B's production were made to Corporation T and the gross receipts from such sales of B's production to Corporation T exceed 5 million dollars, the exemption under section 613A(c) would not apply to B because B is selling oil or natural gas to a person given authority to occupy a retail outlet leased by the taxpayer, B.

# Example 6.
C has a
1/8
royalty interest and Corporation U has a
7/8
working interest in an oil property. Corporation V, a retailer of oil, owns 5 percent in value of the stock of Corporation U. C has no interest in either corporation. All of the production from the property is sold through Corporation V, C receiving from Corporation U
1/8
of its receipts therefrom. The exemption under section 613A(c) does not apply to Corporation U because Corporation U is selling oil of natural gas through Corporation V, a related person that is a retailer. However, the exemption
applies to C because C, as owner of a nonoperating mineral interest, is not treated as an operator of a retail outlet merely because C's oil and gas is sold on C's behalf through a retail outlet operated by an unrelated person.

# Example 7.
D owns and operates retail grocery stores where refined oil may be purchased. D also owns oil and gas producing properties. If the sales of refined oil at each store location constitute less than 5 percent of the gross receipts from all sales made at that store, D is not considered a retailer by reason of such sales.

# Example 8.
Lessee E sells natural gas to lessor F directly from a wellhead gathering pipelines system for F's local agricultural use, in transactions incidental to the acquisition of a natural gas lease. The sales of natural gas to F are not sales through a retail outlet.

# Example 9.
Corporation W produces natural gas, some of which it sells at retail. For purposes of determining whether Corporation W is a retailer selling gas through a retail outlet within the meaning of § 1.613A-7(r), the business office of Corporation W where a purchaser would normally contact the corporation with respect to its sales to the purchaser is considered the place at which those sales of natural gas are made.

# Example 10.
G, husband, is the sole owner and operator of a retail outlet which sells oil and gas. H, wife, owns producing oil and gas properties. G is not related to H for purposes of section 613A(d).

# Example 11.
I, husband, and J, wife, are community property owners of 10 percent in value of the stock of Corporation X which is a retailer of oil and gas. I and J are each treated as owning 5 percent of Corporation X. Therefore, neither I nor J qualify for the exemption under section 613A(c).

# Example 12.
Corporation Y, an electing small business corporation as defined in section 1371 (as in effect prior to the enactment of the subchapter S Revision Act of 1982), owns producing oil and gas properties. K, a retailer of oil and gas, is a 50 percent interest shareholder of Corporation Y. None of Corporation Y's production is sold through K. Corporation Y is eligible for percentage depletion.

# Example 13.
Corporation Z, a producer of natural gas, makes bulk sales of natural gas to industrial users. For purposes of determining whether Corporation Z is a retailer under § 1.613A-7(r), the bulk sales are disregarded.

# Example 14.
L, a calendar year taxpayer, is the owner of a producing oil property. On September 1, 1976, L purchased a chain of gasoline service stations. Therefore, L was a retailer of oil and gas for the last 122 days of 1976. L's gross income from the oil property for the taxable year was $150x and L's taxable income from the property was $30x. L is treated as a retailer with respect to $50x of gross income from the property ($150x × 122/366) and $10x of taxable income from the property ($30x × 122/366). Therefore, L is entitled to percentage depletion with respect to $100x of gross income from the property ($150x minus $50x). However, the allowable percentage depletion is limited by the 50 percent of taxable income from the property limitation to $10x (50 percent times $20x taxable income ($30x minus $10x)).

# Example 15.
Corporation M is a partner in Partnership MNO which is the owner of an operating interest in a producing oil property. Corporation P, a retailer of oil and gas, owns 5 percent in value of the stock of Corporation M. Partnership MNO sells its production to Corporation P. Corporation M is retailing oil through Corporation P, a related person, because its share of the oil is being sold on its behalf by the partnership through a retail outlet operated by a person related to Corporation M. Therefore, the exemption under section 613A(c) does not apply to Corporation M.

# Example 16.
AA and BB are beneficiaries of a trust which is a retailer of oil and gas. AA has an interest in the income of the trust for AA's lifetime which, actuarially determined, represents more than 5 percent of the beneficial interests in the trust. BB's interest in the trust, which entitles BB to 5 percent of the corpus of the trust 5 years after AA's death, represents less than 5 percent of the beneficial interests in the trust prior to AA's death and represents more than 5 percent after AA's death. The trust is a related person of AA but not BB while AA is alive. Accordingly, during AA's lifetime BB is not disqualified from the exemption provided by section 613A(c), but AA is.

# Example 17.
Assume the same facts as in
Example 16,
except that AA's interest in the income of the trust represents 4 percent of the beneficial interests in the trust. AA is disqualified from the exemption provided by section 613A(c) with respect to the income from the trust but not with respect to income from other sources.
(c)
Certain refiners excluded.
(1) Section 613A(c) and § 1.613A-3 shall not apply in the case of any taxpayer who is a refiner as defined in paragraph (s) of § 1.613A-7.
(2) The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
Corporation M owns a refinery which has refinery runs in excess of 50,000 barrels on at least one day during the taxable year. Corporation M also owns a 5 percent interest in Corporation N, owner of producing oil and gas properties. None of Corporation N's production is sold to Corporation M. The exemption under section 613A(c)
does not apply to Corporation N because Corporation M, a related person of Corporation N, engages in the refining of crude oil.

# Example 2.
A and B are equal partners in Partnership AB, which owns oil and gas producing properties. A owns a refinery which has refinery runs in excess of 50,000 barrels on at least one day during the taxable year and which buys all of Partnership AB's production. B has no ownership interest in any refinery. B is not a refiner.

§ 1.613A-5
Election under section 613A(c)(4).
The election under section 613A(c)(4) is an annual election which the taxpayer may make by claiming percentage depletion deductions for the taxable year based upon such election. The election may be made, on an original or amended tax return or a claim for credit or refund, at any time prior to the expiration of the statutory period (including any extensions thereof) for the filing of a claim for credit or refund by the taxpayer. The election may be changed by the taxpayer by filing an amended return or a claim for credit or refund. The election allows the taxpayer to treat as his depletable natural gas quantity an amount equal to 6,000 cubic feet multiplied by the number of barrels of the taxpayer's depletable oil quantity to which the election applies. The election applies to secondary or tertiary production, as well as primary production, but in determining the taxpayer's depletable natural gas quantity with respect to secondary or tertiary production the taxpayer's depletable oil quantity shall be determined without regard to section 613A(c)(3)(A)(ii) with respect to production from secondary or tertiary processes.

§ 1.613A-6
Recordkeeping requirements.
(a)
Principal value of property demonstrated.
In the case of a transfer (as defined in § 1.613A-7(n)) after December 31, 1974, of an interest in an oil or gas property (as defined in § 1.613A-7(p)), the transferee (as defined in section 1.613A-7(o)) shall keep records showing the terms of the transfer, any geological and geophysical data in the possession of the transferee or other exploratory data with respect to the property transferred, and any other information which bears upon the question of whether at the time of the transfer the principal value of the property transferred had been demonstrated by prospecting, exploration, and discovery work.
(b)
Production from secondary or tertiary processes.
Every taxpayer who claims depletion with respect to oil or gas produced by secondary or tertiary processes (as defined in § 1.613A-7(k)) shall keep records of the secondary and tertiary processes applied and maintain records of the amount of production so resulting.
(c)
Retention of records.
The records required by this section shall be kept at all times available for inspection by authorized Internal Revenue officers or employees, and shall be retained so long as the contents may become material in the administration of any Internal Revenue law.
[T.D. 7487, 42 FR 24264, May 13, 1977]
§ 1.613A-7
Definitions.
For purposes of section 613A and the regulations thereunder—
(a)
Domestic.
The term
domestic,
as applied to oil and gas wells (or to production from such wells), refers to wells located in the United States or in a possession of the United States, as defined in section 638 and the regulations thereunder.
(b)
Natural gas.
The term
natural gas
means any product (other than crude oil as defined in paragraph (g) of this section) of an oil or gas well if a deduction for depletion is allowable under section 611 with respect to such product.
(c)
Regulated natural gas.
Natural gas is considered to be “regulated” only if all of the following requirements are met:
(1) The gas must be domestic gas produced and sold by the producer (whether for himself or on behalf of another person) before July 1, 1976,
(2) The price for which the gas is sold by the producer must not be adjusted to reflect to any extent the increase in liability of the seller for tax under chapter 1 of the Code by reason of the repeal of percentage depletion for gas,
(3) The sale of the gas must have been subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Power Commission for regulatory purposes,
(4) An order or certificate of the Federal Power Commission must be in effect (or a proceeding to obtain such an order or certificate must have been instituted), and
(5) The price at which the gas is sold must be taken into account, directly or indirectly, in the issuance of the order or certificate by the Federal Power Commission. Price increases after February 1, 1975, are presumed to take increases in tax liabilities into account unless the taxpayer demonstrates to the contrary by clear and convincing evidence that the increases are wholly attributable to a purpose or purposes unrelated to the repeal of percentage depletion for gas (
e.g.,
where the record of the Federal Power Commission clearly establishes that the Commission did not take the repeal into account). Increases to reflect additional State and local real property or severance taxes, increases for additional operating costs (such as costs of secondary or tertiary processes), adjustments for inflation, increases for additional drilling and related costs, or increases to reflect changes in the quality of gas sold, are some examples of increases that are not attributable to the repeal of percentage depletion for gas. In the absence of a statement in writing by the Federal Power Commission that the price of the gas in question was not in fact regulated, the requirement of paragraph (c)(5) of this section is deemed to have been met in any case in which the Federal Power Commission issued an order or certificate approving the sale to an interstate pipeline company or, in a case in which it is established by the taxpayer that the Federal Power Commission has influenced the price of such gas, an order or certificate permitting the interstate transportation of such gas. In addition, an “emergency” sale of natural gas to an interstate pipeline, which, pursuant to the authority contained in 18 CFR 2.68, 2.70, 157.22, and 157.29, may be made without prior order approving the sale, is deemed to have met the requirements of paragraph (c) (3), (4), and (5) of this section. For purposes of meeting the requirements under this paragraph, it is not necessary that the total gas production from a property qualify as “regulated natural gas.” The determination of whether mineral production is “regulated natural gas” shall be made with respect to each sale of the mineral or minerals produced.
(d)
Natural gas sold under a fixed contract.
The term
natural gas sold under a fixed contract
means domestic natural gas sold by the producer (whether for himself or on behalf of another person) under a contract, in effect on February 1, 1975, and at all times thereafter before such sale, under which the price for the gas during such period cannot be adjusted to reflect to any extent the increase in liabilities of the seller for tax under chapter 1 of the Code by reason of the repeal of percentage depletion for gas. The term may include gas sold under a fixed contract even though production sold under the contract had previously been treated as regulated natural gas. Price increases after February 1, 1975, are presumed to take increases in tax liabilities into account unless the taxpayer demonstrates to the contrary by clear and convincing evidence. Paragraph (c) of this section provides examples of increases which do not take increases in tax liabilities into account. However, if an adjustment provided for in the contract permits the possible increase in federal income tax liability of the seller to be taken into account to any extent, the gas sold under the contract after such an increase becomes permissible is not gas sold under a fixed contract. If the adjustment provided for in the contract provides for an increase in the price of the contract to the highest price paid to a producer for natural gas in the area, or if the price may be renegotiated, then gas sold under the contract after such an increase becomes permissible is presumed not to be sold under a fixed contract unless the taxpayer demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that the price increase in no event takes increases in tax liabilities into account. For purposes of meeting the requirements of this paragraph, it is not necessary that the total gas production from a property qualify as “natural gas sold under
a fixed contract,” for the determination of “natural gas sold under a fixed contract” is to be made with respect to each sale of each type of natural gas sold pursuant to each contract.
(e)
Qualified natural gas from geopressured brine.
The term “qualified natural gas from geopressured brine” means any natural gas which is determined in accordance with section 503 of the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 to be produced from geopressured brine and which is produced from any well the drilling of which began after September 30, 1978, and before January 1, 1984.
(f)
Average daily production.
(1) The term
average daily production
means the taxpayer's aggregate production of domestic crude oil or natural gas, as the case may be, which is extracted after December 31, 1974, and to which gross income from the property is attributable during the taxable year divided by the number of days in such year. As used in the preceding sentence the term
taxpayer
includes a small business corporation as defined in section 1371 (as in effect prior to the enactment of the subchapter S Revision Act of 1982) and the regulations thereunder. Notwithstanding the provisions of § 1.612-3 and except as provided in § 1.613A-3(j)(2), in computing the average daily production for a taxable year only oil or gas which has been actually produced by the close of such taxable year is taken into account. Average daily production does not include production resulting from secondary or tertiary processes to which gross income from the property is attributable before January 1, 1984.
(2) In the case of a fiscal-year taxpayer, paragraph (f)(1) of this section shall be applied separately to each short taxable year under section 613A(c)(11), as in effect prior to the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1990.
(3) In the case of a taxpayer holding a partial interest in the production from any property (including an interest of a partner in property of a partnership or a net profit interest) such taxpayer's production shall be considered to be that amount of such production determined by multiplying the total production (which is produced after December 31, 1974, and to which gross income from the property is attributable during the taxable year) of the property by the taxpayer's percentage participation in the gross revenues from the property during the year. However, the portion of trust (or estate) production allocable to a beneficiary shall not exceed that amount of the trust's (or estate's) depletable oil quantity determined by multiplying such quantity by the beneficiary's percentage interest in the trust's (or estate's) gross income from the property.
(g)
Crude oil.
For purposes of section 613A and the regulations thereunder, the term
crude oil
means—
(1) A mixture of hydrocarbons which existed in the liquid phase in natural underground reservoirs and which remains liquid at atmospheric pressure after passing through surface separating facilities,
(2) Hydrocarbons which existed in the gaseous phase in natural underground reservoirs but which are liquid at atmospheric pressure after being recovered from oil well (casinghead) gas in lease separators, and
(3) Natural gas liquid recovered from gas well effluent in lease separators or field facilities before any conversion process has been applied to such production.
(h)
Depletable oil quantity.
The taxpayer's depletable oil quantity, within the meaning of section 613A(c)(1)(A), shall be equal to the tentative quantity determined under the table contained in section 613A(c)(3)(B) and paragraph (b) of § 1.613A-3 (except that, in the case of determinations with respect to days prior to January 1, 1984, such quantity shall be reduced (but not below zero) by the taxpayer's average daily secondary or tertiary production for the taxable year).
(i)
Depletable natural gas quantity.
The taxpayer's depletable natural gas quantity, within the meaning of section 613A(c)(1)(B), shall be equal to 6,000 cubic feet multiplied by the number of barrels of the taxpayer's depletable oil quantity to which the taxpayer elects to have section 613A(c)(4) apply. The taxpayer's depletable oil quantity for any taxable year shall be reduced (in addition to any reduction required to be made under paragraph (h) of this section) by the number of barrels with
respect to which an election under section 613A(c)(4) for natural gas has been made. See § 1.613A-5.
(j)
Barrel.
The term
barrel
means 42 United States gallons.
(k)
Secondary or tertiary production.
For purposes of section 613A the term
secondary or tertiary production
means the increased production of domestic crude oil or natural gas from a property at any time after the application of a secondary or tertiary process. The increased production is the excess of actual production over the maximum primary production which would have resulted during the taxable year if the secondary or tertiary process had not been applied. The increased production may be due to an increase in either the rate or the duration of recovery. A secondary or tertiary process is a process applied for the recovery of hydrocarbons in which liquids, gases, or other matter is injected into the reservoir to supplement or augment the natural forces required to move the hydrocarbons through the reservoir. However, no process which must be introduced early in the productive life of the mineral property in order to be reasonably effective (such as cycling of gas in the case of a gas-condensate reservoir) is a secondary or tertiary process. A process (such as fire flooding or miscible fluid injection) introduced early in the productive life of the mineral property will not be disqualified as a secondary or tertiary process if a later introduction of the process in the property would still have been reasonably effective.
(l)
Controlled group of corporations.
The term
controlled group of corporations
has the meaning given to such term by section 1563(a), except that section 1563(b)(2) shall not apply and except that “more than 50 percent” shall be substituted for “ at least 80 percent” each place it appears in section 1563(a).
(m)
Related person.
(1) A person is a
related person
to another person, within the meaning of section 613A(d) (2) and (4), paragraphs (b) and (c) of § 1.613A-4, and paragraphs (r) and (s) of this section, if either a significant ownership interest in such person is held by the other, or a third person has a significant ownership interest in both such persons. For purposes of determining a significant ownership interest, an interest owned by or for a corporation, partnership, trust, or estate shall be considered as owned directly both by itself and proportionately by its shareholders, partners, or beneficiaries, as the case may be. The term
significant ownership
means—
(i) With respect to any corporation, direct or indirect ownership of 5 percent or more in value of the outstanding stock of such corporation,
(ii) With respect to a partnership, direct or indirect ownership of 5 percent or more interest in the profits or capital of such partnership, and
(iii) With respect to an estate or trust, direct or indirect ownership of 5 percent or more of the beneficial interests in such estate or trust. The relative percentage ownership of beneficiaries of an estate or trust in the beneficial interests therein shall be determined under actuarial principles.
(2) A person is a “related person” to another person, within the meaning of section 613A(c)(8)(B) and paragraph (h)(2) of § 1.613A-3, if such persons are members of the same controlled group of corporations or if the relationship between such persons would result in a disallowance of losses under section 267 or 707(b), except that for this purpose the family of an individual includes only the individual's spouse and minor children.
(n)
Transfer.
The term
transfer
means any change in ownership for federal tax purposes after December 31, 1974, by sale, exchange, gift, lease, sublease, assignment, contract, or other disposition (including any contribution to or any distribution by a corporation, partnership, or trust), any change in the membership of a partnership or the beneficiaries of a trust, or any other change by which a taxpayer's proportionate share of the income subject to depletion of an oil or gas property is increased. For taxable years beginning after 1982, the term “transfer” includes an election by a C corporation to be an S corporation (properties deemed transferred by the C corporation on the day the election first becomes effective) and a termination of an S election (each shareholder's pro rata share of
assets of S corporation deemed transferred to C corporation on the day that the termination first becomes effective). However, the term does not include—
(1) A transfer of property at death (including a distribution by an estate, whether or not a pro rata distribution),
(2) An exchange to which section 351 applies,
(3) A change of beneficiaries of a trust by reason of the death, birth, or adoption of any vested beneficiary if the transferee was a beneficiary of the trust or is a lineal descendant of the settlor or any other vested beneficiary of the trust, except in the case of any trust where any beneficiary of the trust is a member of the family (as defined in section 267(c)(4)) of a settlor who created inter vivos and testamentary trusts for members of the family and the settlor died within the last six days of the fifth month in 1970, and the law in the jurisdiction in which the trust was created requires all or a portion of the gross or net proceeds of any royalty or other interest in oil, gas, or other mineral representing any percentage depletion allowance to be allocated to the principal of the trust,
(4) A transfer of property between corporations which are members of the same controlled group of corporations (as defined in section 613A(c)(8)(D)(i)),
(5) A transfer of property between business entities which are under common control (within the meaning of section 613A(c)(8)(B)) or between related persons in the same family (within the meaning of section 613A(c)(8)(C)),
(6) A transfer of property between a trust and members of the same family (within the meaning of section 613A(c)(8)(C)) to the extent that both (i) the beneficiaries of the trust are and continue to be members of the family that transferred the property, and (ii) the tentative oil quantity is allocated among the members of such family,
(7) A reversion of all or part of an interest with respect to which the taxpayer was eligible for percentage depletion pursuant to section 613A(c), or
(8) A conversion of a retained interest which is eligible for such depletion into an interest which constituted all or part of an interest previously owned by the taxpayer also eligible for such depletion.
However, paragraph (n) (2), (4), and (5) of this section shall apply only so long as the tentative quantity determined under the table contained in section 613A(c)(3)(B) (as in effect prior to the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1990) is required to be allocated under section 613A(c)(8) between the transferor and transferee, or among members of a controlled group of corporations. In the case of an individual transferor, the allocation test of the preceding sentence shall not be failed merely because of the death of the transferor. For purposes of paragraph (n) (3) and (6), an individual adopted by a beneficiary is a lineal descendant of that beneficiary. For purposes of paragraph (n) (7) and (8), a taxpayer previously ineligible for percentage depletion solely by reason of section 613A(d) (2) or (4) will be considered to have been eligible for such depletion. A transfer is deemed to occur on the day on which a contract or other commitment to transfer the property becomes binding upon both the transferor and transferee, or, if no such contract or commitment is made, on the day on which ownership of the interest in oil or gas property passes to the transferee.
(o)
Transferee.
The term “transferee”, as used in section 613A(c)(9), paragraph (i)(1) of § 1.613A-3, and this section includes the original transferee of proven property and his or her successors in interest (excluding successors in interest of proven property transferred after October 11, 1990). A person shall not be treated as a transferee of an interest in a proven oil or gas property to the extent that such person was entitled to a percentage depletion allowance on mineral produced with respect to the property immediately before the transfer. However, a person shall be treated as a transferee of an interest in a proven property to the extent that the interest such person receives is greater than the interest in the property the person held immediately before the transfer. For example, where the owner of a proven oil property transfers his or her entire interest therein to a partnership of which he or she is a member and, as a consequence, becomes entitled to a depletion allowance based on
only one-third of the oil produced with respect to that property, the owner (the transferor) is not denied percentage depletion with respect to the one-third interest in oil production which the owner still possesses. If the partnership agreement had made an effective allocation (under section 704 and § 1.704.1) of all the income in respect of such property to the transferor partner, that partner would be entitled to percentage depletion on the entire oil production from that property. For this purpose, a person who has transferred oil or gas property pursuant to a unitization or pooling agreement shall be treated as having been entitled to a depletion allowance immediately before the transfer to that person of the interest in the unit or pool with respect to all of the mineral in respect of which the person receives gross income from the property pursuant to the unitization or pooling agreement, except to the extent such income is attributable to consideration paid by that person for such interest in addition to that person's contribution of the oil or gas property and equipment affixed thereto.
(p)
Interest in proven oil or gas property.
The term
interest in an oil or gas property
means an economic interest in oil or gas property. An economic interest includes working or operating interests, royalties, overriding royalties, net profits interests, and, to the extent not treated as loans under section 636, production payments from oil or gas properties. The term also includes an interest in a partnership, S corporation, small business corporation, or trust holding an economic interest in oil or gas property but does not include shares of stock in a corporation (other than an S corporation and small business corporation) owning such an interest. An oil or gas property is “proven” if its principal value has been demonstrated by prospecting, exploration, or discovery work. The principal value of the property has been demonstrated by prospecting, exploration, or discovery work only if at the time of the transfer—
(1) Any oil or gas has been produced from a deposit, whether or not produced by the taxpayer or from the property transferred;
(2) Prospecting, exploration, or discovery work indicate that it is probable that the property will have gross income from oil or gas from the deposit sufficient to justify development of the property; and
(3) The fair market value of the property is 50 percent or more of the fair market value of the property, minus actual expenses of the transferee for equipment and intangible drilling and development costs, at the time of the first production from the property subsequent to the transfer and before the tansferee transfers his or her interest.
For purposes of this paragraph, the property is to be determined by applying section 614 and the regulations thereunder to the transferee at the time of the transfer. If the transfer is of an interest in a partnership, S corporation, small business corporation, or trust, the determination shall be made with respect to each property owned by the partnership, S corporation, small business corporation, or trust. The term
prospecting, exploration, or discovery work
includes activities which produce information relating to the existence, location, extent, or quality of any deposit of oil or gas, such as seismograph surveys and drilling activities (whether for exploration or for the production of oil or gas).
(q)
Amount disallowed.
The amount disallowed, within the meaning of section 613A(d)(1) and paragraph (a) of § 1.613A-4, is the excess of the amount of the aggregate of the taxpayer's allowable depletion deductions (whether based upon cost or percentage depletion) computed without regard to section 613A(d)(1) over the amount of the aggregate of such deductions computed with regard to such section. The disallowed amount shall be carried over to the succeeding year and treated as an amount allowable as a deduction pursuant to section 613A(c) for the succeeding year, subject to the 65-percent limitation of section 613A(d)(1) and the rules contained in § 1.613A-4(a).
(r)
Retailer.
(1) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (r)(2) of this section, the term
retailer
means any taxpayer who directly, or through a related person (as defined in paragraph
(m)(1) of this section), sells oil or natural gas, or any product derived from oil or natural gas—
(i) Through any retail outlet operated by the taxpayer or a related person, or
(ii) To any person—
(A) Obligated under an agreement or contract with the taxpayer or a related person to use a trademark, trade name, or service mark or name owned by such taxpayer or a related person, in marketing or distributing oil or natural gas or any product derived from oil or natural gas, or
(B) Given authority, pursuant to an agreement or contract with the taxpayer or a related person, to occupy any retail outlet owned, leased, or in any way controlled by the taxpayer or a related person.
For purposes of the preceding sentence, bulk sales (
i.e.,
sales in very large quantities) of oil or natural gas (but not bulk sales of any product derived from oil or natural gas) to commercial or industrial users shall be disregarded. Bulk sales made after September 18, 1982, of aviation fuels to the Department of Defense shall be also disregarded. In addition, sales of oil or natural gas (whether or not produced by the taxpayer), or of any product derived from oil or natural gas, which are made outside the United States shall be disregarded if no domestic production of oil, natural gas (or products derived therefrom) of the taxpayer or a related person is exported during the taxable year or the immediately preceding taxable year.
(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (r)(1) of this section, the taxpayer shall not be considered a retailer in any case where, during the taxable year of the taxpayer, the combined gross receipts from sales (excluding sales for resale) of oil or natural gas, or products derived therefrom, of all retail outlets taken into account under paragraph (r)(1) of this section (including sales through a retail outlet of oil, natural gas, or a product derived from oil or natural gas which had previously been the subject of a sale described in paragraph (r)(1)(ii) of this section) do not exceed $5 million. If the taxpayer's combined gross receipts for the taxable year exceed $5 million, the taxpayer will be treated as a retailer as of the first day in which a retail sale was made. For purposes of paragraph (r)(1) of this section, a taxpayer shall be deemed to be selling oil or natural gas (or a product derived therefrom) through a related person in any case in which any sale of oil or natural gas (or a derivative product) by the related person produces gross income from which the taxpayer may benefit by reason of the taxpayer's direct or indirect ownership interest in the related person. In such cases (and in any other case in which the taxpayer is selling through a retail outlet referred to in section 613A(d)(2)(A) or is selling such items to a person described in section 613A(d)(2)(B)), it is immaterial whether the oil or natural gas which is sold, or from which is derived a product which is sold, was produced by the taxpayer. A taxpayer shall be deemed to be selling oil or natural gas (or a derivative product) through a retail outlet operated by a related person in any case in which a related person who operates a retail outlet acquires for resale oil or natural gas (or a derivative product) which the taxpayer produced or caused to be made available for acquisition by the related person pursuant to an arrangement whereby some or all of the taxpayer's production is marketed. An owner of a nonoperating mineral interest (such as a royalty) shall not be treated as an operator of a retail outlet merely because the owner's oil or gas is sold on the owner's behalf through a retail outlet operated by an unrelated person. In addition, the mere fact that a member of a partnership is a retailer shall not result in characterization of the remaining partners as retailers. However, any partner of a partnership who has a 5 percent or more interest in any entity actually engaging in retail activities (including the partnership or another entity to which the partnership is related) is treated as a retailer. See paragraph (m)(1) of this section for rules on the ownership interest by partners in an entity related to a partnership. Similarly, if a trust or estate is a retailer, only its beneficiaries having a 5 percent or more current income interest from the trust or estate are treated as retailers. A person who is a retailer during a portion of the taxable
year shall be treated as a retailer with respect to a fraction of that person's gross and taxable income from oil or gas properties for the taxable year, the numerator of which is the number of days during the taxable year in which the taxpayer is a retailer and the denominator of which is the total number of days during the taxable year; except that a person who ceases to be a retailer during the taxable year before the first production of oil or gas during such year shall not be treated as a retailer for any portion of such year.
(3) For purposes of this paragraph (r), the term
any product derived from oil or natural gas
means gasoline, kerosene, Number 2 fuel oil, refined lubricating oils, diesel fuel, butane, propane, and similar products which are recovered from petroleum refineries or extracted from natural gas in field facilities or natural gas processing plants. The term
retail outlet
means any place where sales of oil or natural gas (excluding bulk sales of such items to commercial or industrial users), or a product of oil or natural gas (excluding bulk sales of aviation fuels to the Department of Defense), accounting for more than 5 percent of the gross receipts from all sales made at such place during the taxpayer's taxable year, are systematically made for any purpose other than for resale. For this purpose, sales of oil or natural gas, or any product derived from oil or natural gas, to a person for refining are considered as sales made for resale.
(s)
Refiner.
A person is a refiner if such person or a related person (as defined in paragraph (m)(1) of this section) engages in the refining of crude oil (whether or not owned by such person or related person) and if the total refinery runs of such person and any related persons exceed 50,000 barrels on any day during the taxable year. A refinery run is the volume of inputs of crude oil (excluding any product derived from oil) into the refining stream. For purposes of this paragraph, crude oil refined outside the United States shall be taken into account. Refining is any operation by which the physical or chemical characteristics of crude oil are changed, exclusive of such operations as passing crude oil through separators to remove gas, placing crude oil in settling tanks to recover basic sediment and water, dehydrating crude oil, and blending of crude oil products.
[T.D. 8348, 56 FR 21949, May 13, 1991; 57 FR 4913, Feb. 10, 1992, as amended by T.D. 8437, 57 FR 43903, Sept. 23, 1992; 58 FR 6678, Feb. 1, 1993]
§ 1.614-0
Introduction.
Section 614 relates to the definition of property and to the various special rules by means of which taxpayers are permitted to aggregate or combine separate properties or to treat such properties as separate. These rules are set forth in detail in §§ 1.614-1 through 1.614-8. Section 1.614-1 sets forth rules under section 614(a) relating to the definition of the term
property.
Section 1.614-2 contains the rules relating to the election under section 614(b), as it existed prior to its amendment by section 226(a) of the Revenue Act of 1964, to aggregate operating mineral interests. In the case of mines, the rules contained in § 1.614-2 are applicable only to taxable years beginning before January 1, 1958, to which the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 applies. In the case of oil and gas wells, the rules contained in § 1.614-2 are applicable only to taxable years beginning before January 1, 1964, to which the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 applies. In the case of oil and gas wells, the taxpayer may, however, for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1964, treat any operating mineral interests as if section 614 (a) and (b) (as it existed prior to its amendment by section 226(a) of the Revenue Act of 1964) had not been enacted. If any operating mineral interests are so treated, the rules contained in § 1.614-2 are not applicable to such interests and such interests are, in respect of taxable years beginning before January 1, 1964, subject to the rules set forth in § 1.614-4 relating to the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 treatment of separate operating mineral interests in the case of oil and gas wells. Section 1.614-3 prescribes the rules relating to the election under section 614(c)(1) permitting the aggregation of operating mineral interests in the cases of mines for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1957. Section 1.614-3 also sets forth rules relating to the election under section 614(c)(2) in the case of
mines by means of which a taxpayer is permitted to treat a single operating mineral interest as more than one such interest for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1957. At the election of the taxpayer with respect to an operating unit, the rules contained in § 1.614-3 are also applicable to taxable years beginning before January 1, 1958, to which the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 applies. If the taxpayer makes such an election, the rules contained in § 1.614-2 are not applicable to any of the operating mineral interests which are part of the operating unit with respect to which the election described in § 1.614-3 is made. Section 1.614-5 sets forth the rules relating to the aggregation of nonoperating mineral interests. Section 1.614-6 contains the rules relating to basis, holding period, and abandonment and casualty losses where properties have been aggregated or combined. Section 1.614-7 relates to the extension of time for performing certain acts. Section 1.614-8 contains the rules relating to the elections under section 614(b) as amended by section 226(a) of the Revenue Act of 1964 to treat separate operating mineral interests in the case of oil and gas wells as separate properties or in combination for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1963.
[T.D. 6859, 30 FR 13699, Oct. 28, 1965]
§ 1.614-1
Definition of property.
(a)
General rule.
(1) For purposes of subtitle A of the Code, in the case of mines, wells, and other natural deposits, the term
property
means each separate interest owned by the taxpayer in each mineral deposit in each separate tract or parcel of land.
(2) The term
interest
means an economic interest in a mineral deposit. See paragraph (b) of § 1.611-1. The term includes working or operating interests, royalties, overriding royalties, net profits interests, and, to the extent not treated as loans under section 636, production payments.
(3) The term
tract or parcel of land
is merely descriptive of the physical scope of the land to which the taxpayer's interest relates. It is not descriptive of the nature of his rights or interests in the land. All contiguous areas (even though separately described) included in a single conveyance or grant or in separate conveyances or grants at the same time from the same owner constitute a single separate tract or parcel of land. Areas included in separate conveyances or grants (whether or not at the same time) from separate owners are separate tracts or parcels of land even though the areas described may be contiguous. If the taxpayer's rights or interests within the same tract or parcel of land are dissimilar, then each such dissimilar interest constitutes a separate property. If the taxpayer's rights or interests (whether or not dissimilar) within the same tract or parcel of land relate to more than one separate mineral deposit, then his interest with respect to each such separate deposit is a separate property.
(4) Upon the transfer of a
property
in any transaction in which the basis of such property in the hands of the transferee is determined by reference to the basis of such property in the hands of the transferor, such property shall, notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraph (3) of this paragraph, retain the same status and identity in the hands of the transferee as it had in the hands of the transferor. See paragraph (c) of § 1.614-6 if the transferor has made a binding election to treat a separate mineral interest as a separate property, to treat a separate mineral interest as more than one property under section 614(c), or to treat two or more separate mineral interests as an aggregated or combined property under section 614(b) (as it existed either before or after its amendment by section 226(a) of the Revenue Act of 1964), (c), or (e).
(5) The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
A taxpayer owns one tract of land under which lie three separate and distinct seams of coal. Therefore, the taxpayer owns three separate mineral interests each of which constitutes a separate property.

# Example 2.
A taxpayer conducts mining operations on eight tracts of land as a single unit. He acquired his interests in each of the eight tracts from separate owners. Even if each tract of land contains part of the same mineral deposit, the taxpayer owns eight separate mineral interests each of which constitutes a separate property.

# Example 3.
A taxpayer owns a tract of land under which lies one mineral deposit. The taxpayer operates a well on part of the tract and leases to another operator the mineral rights in the remainder retaining a royalty interest therein. The taxpayer thereafter owns two separate mineral interests each of which constitutes a separate property.

# Example 4.
In 1954, a taxpayer acquires from a single owner, in a single deed, three noncontiguous tracts of mineral land for a single consideration. Even if each tract contains part of the same mineral deposit, the taxpayer owns three separate mineral interests each of which constitutes a separate property.

# Example 5.
In 1954, taxpayer A simultaneously acquires in fee two contiguous tracts of mineral land from two separate owners. The same mineral deposit underlies both tracts. Thereafter, taxpayer A owns two separate mineral interests each of which constitutes a separate property.

# Example 6.
Assume that in 1955, taxpayer A, in example 5, leases the two contiguous tracts of mineral land that he acquired in 1954 to taxpayer B by means of a single lease. Thereafter, taxpayer B owns one mineral interest which constitutes a separate property for such time as the lease continues in existence.

# Example 7.
Assume that in 1955, taxpayer A, in example 5, sells at the same time all the mineral land he acquired in 1954 to taxpayer B. Thereafter, taxpayer B owns one mineral interest which constitutes a separate property. If taxpayer B acquires the mineral land in a transaction in which the basis of such mineral land in his hands is determined by reference to the basis of such mineral land in the hands of taxpayer A, then taxpayer B owns two separate mineral interests each of which constitutes a separate property.

# Example 8.
In 1954, taxpayer A simultaneously acquires two contiguous leasehold interests from two separate owners. The same mineral deposit underlies both tracts. Thereafter, taxpayer A owns two separate mineral interests each of which constitutes a separate property.

# Example 9.
In 1955, taxpayer A, in example 8, simultaneously assigns the two leases to taxpayer B. Thereafter, taxpayer B owns two separate mineral interests each of which constitutes a separate property.
(b)
Separation of interests treated as single property
under prior regulations. Each separate mineral interest which, in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, is a separate property shall be so treated, notwithstanding the fact that the taxpayer under paragraph (i) of § 39.23(m)-1 of this chapter (Regulations 118) and corresponding provisions of prior regulations may have treated more than one of such interests as a
single property.
The basis of each such separate property must be established by a reasonable method. See, however, section 614 (b) and (d) (as they existed prior to amendment by section 226 of the Revenue Act of 1964), section 614 (c) and (e), and §§ 1.614-2, 1.614-3, 1.614-4, and 1.614-5 for special rules relating to the treatment of two or more separate mineral interests as a single property.
(c)
Treatment of a waste bank or residue.
A waste bank or residue of prior mining, the extraction of ores or minerals from which is treated as mining under section 613(c)(3), shall not be considered to be a separate mineral deposit but is a part of the mineral deposit from which it was extracted. However, if the owner of such waste bank or residue has disposed of the deposit from which the waste bank or residue was accumulated, or if the waste bank or residue cannot practicably be attributed to a particular deposit of the owner, the waste bank or residue will be regarded as a separate deposit.
[T.D. 6524, 26 FR 147, Jan. 10, 1961, as amended by T.D. 6859, 30 FR 13699, Oct. 28, 1965; T.D. 7261, 38 FR 5467, Mar. 1, 1973]
§ 1.614-2
Election to aggregate separate operating mineral interests under section 614(b) prior to its amendment by Revenue Act of 1964.
(a)
General rule.
(1) The provisions of this section relate to the election, under section 614(b) prior to its amendment by section 226(a) of the Revenue Act of 1964, to aggregate separate operating mineral interests, and, unless otherwise indicated, all references in this section to section 614(b) or any paragraph or subparagraph thereof are references to section 614(b) or a paragraph or subparagraph thereof as it existed prior to such amendment. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the definitions contained in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section shall apply both before and after such amendment. All references in this section to section 614(d) are references to section 614(d) as it existed prior to its amendment by section 226(b)(3) of the Revenue Act of 1964.
(2) A taxpayer who owns two or more separate operating mineral interests, which constitute part or all of an operating unit, may elect under section 614(b) and this section to form one aggregation of any two or more of such operating mineral interests and to treat such aggregation as one property. Any operating mineral interest which the taxpayer does not elect to include within the aggregation within the time prescribed in paragraph (d) of this section shall be treated as a separate property. The aggregation of separate properties which results from exercising the election shall be considered as one property for all purposes of subtitle A of the Code. The preceding sentence does not preclude the use of more than one account under a single method of computing depreciation or the use of more than one method of computing depreciation under section 167, if otherwise proper. Any reasonable and consistently applied method or methods of computing depreciation of the improvements made with respect to the separate properties aggregated may be continued in accordance with section 167 and the regulations thereunder. Operating interests in different minerals which comprise part or all of the same operating unit may be included in the aggregation. It is not necessary for purposes of the aggregation that the separate operating mineral interests be included in a single tract or parcel of land or in contiguous tracts or parcels of land so long as such interests are a part of the same operating unit. Under section 614(b), a taxpayer cannot elect to form more than one aggregation of separate operating mineral interests within one operating unit. For definitions of
operating mineral interest
and
operating unit
see respectively paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.
(b)
Operating mineral interest defined.
The term
operating mineral interest
means a separate mineral interest as described in section 614(a), in respect of which the costs of production are required to be taken into account by the taxpayer for purposes of computing the limitation of 50 percent of the taxable income from the property in determining the deduction for percentage depletion computed under section 613, or such costs would be so required to be taken into account if the mine, well, or other natural deposit were in the production stage. The term does not include royalty interests or similar interests, such as production payments or net profits interests. For the purpose of determining whether a mineral interest is an operating mineral interest,
costs of production
do not include intangible drilling and development costs, exploration expenditures under section 615, or development expenditures under section 616. Taxes, such as production taxes, payable by holders of nonoperating interests are not considered costs of production for this purpose. A taxpayer may not aggregate operating mineral interests and nonoperating mineral interests such as royalty interests.
(c)
Operating unit defined.
(1) The term
operating unit
refers to the operating mineral interests which are operated together for the purpose of producing minerals. An
operating unit
of a particular taxpayer must be determined on the basis of his own operations. It is recognized that operating units may not be uniform in the various natural resources industries or in any one of the natural resources industries, such as coal, oil and gas, and the like. As to a particular taxpayer, business reasons may require the formation of operating units that vary in size and content. The term
operating unit
refers to a producing unit, and not to an administrative or sales organization. Among the factors which indicate that mineral interests are operated together as a unit are:
(i) Common field or operating personnel,
(ii) Common supply and maintenance facilities,
(iii) Common processing or treatment plants, and
(iv) Common storage facilities
However, operating mineral interests which are geographically widespread may not be treated as parts of the same operating unit merely because a single set of accounting records, a single executive organization, or a single sales force is maintained by the taxpayer with respect to such interests, or
merely because the products of such interests are processed at the same treatment plant.
(2) If aggregated, an undeveloped operating mineral interest shall be aggregated only with those interests with which it will be operated as a unit when it reaches the production stage.
(3) While a taxpayer may operate an operating mineral interest through an agent, a coowner may aggregate only his operating mineral interests that are actually operated as a unit. For example, if A owned and actually operated the entire working interest in lease X and also owned an undivided fraction of lease Y in which B owned the remaining interest and which B actually operated as a unit with lease Z, A may not aggregate his interest in lease X with his undivided interest in lease Y, since they are not actually operated as a unit.
(4) The determination of the taxpayer as to what constitutes an operating unit is to be accepted unless there is a clear and convincing basis for a change in such determination.
(d)
Manner and scope of election
—(1)
Election; when made.
(i) Except as provided in subparagraph (2)(ii) of this paragraph, the election under section 614(b) and paragraph (a) of this section to treat a mineral interest as part of an aggregation shall be made not later than the time prescribed by law for filing the taxpayer's income tax return (including extensions thereof), for whichever of the following taxable years is the later:
(
a
) The first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1953, and ending after August 16, 1954, or
(
b
) The first taxable year in which any expenditure for exploration, development, or operation in respect of the separate operating mineral interest is made by the taxpayer after the acquisition of such interest
See, however, paragraph (c) of § 1.614-6 as to the binding effect of an election where the basis of a separate operating mineral interest in the hands of the taxpayer is determined by reference to the basis in the hands of a transferor. The election under section 614(b) may not be made with respect to any taxable year beginning after December 31, 1957, except in the case of oil and gas wells. See paragraph (e) of this section for rules with respect to the termination of the election under section 614(b) except in the case of oil and gas wells. If an expenditure has been made in respect of a separate operating mineral interest, it is immaterial whether or not any proven deposit has been discovered with respect to such interest when such expenditure has been made. The provisions of this subdivision may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
Taxpayer A is producing from an oil and gas horizon and in 1958 he drills for the purpose of locating a deeper horizon which will be operated in the same operating unit as the upper producing horizon. At the end of the taxable year 1958 he has expended $50,000 drilling for the purpose of locating a deeper horizon although at such time there is no assurance that such a horizon will be found. If taxpayer A desires to aggregate the deeper horizon, if found, with the upper horizon under section 614(b), he must elect to do so in his return for 1958. If the election to aggregate the upper and lower horizons as one property is made, the drilling expenditures with respect to the prospective lower horizon must be taken into account along with the income and expenses with respect to the upper producing horizon in computing the depletion allowance on the aggregated property.
However, where expenditures for development of, or production from, a particular mineral deposit result in the discovery of another mineral deposit, the election with respect to such other deposit shall be made for the taxable year in which it is discovered and not for the taxable year in which the expenditures were first made which resulted in such discovery.
(ii) Except in the case of oil and gas wells, if a taxpayer fails to make an election under section 614(b) to aggregate a particular operating mineral interest on or before the time prescribed for the making of such election, such interest will be treated as if an election had been made under section 614(b) to treat it as a separate property and it cannot be included in any aggregation within the operating unit of which it is a part unless the taxpayer obtains the consent of the Commissioner. However, where the taxpayer owns more than one property within an operating unit, but has elected to treat such properties
separately and one or more additional operating mineral interests are subsequently acquired, any one or more of the latter may be aggregated with one of the existing separate properties within the operating unit but not with more than one of them since they cannot be validly aggregated with each other.
(iii) In the case of oil and gas wells, if the taxpayer fails to make an election under section 614(b) with respect to a particular operating mineral interest on or before the time prescribed for the making of such election, the taxpayer shall be deemed to have treated such interest under the provisions of section 614(d). See section 614(d) and § 1.614-4.
(iv) For purposes of section 614(b), the acquisition of an option to acquire an economic interest in minerals in place does not constitute the acquisition of a mineral interest. Thus, a taxpayer who makes expenditures for the exploration of minerals on a particular tract under an option to acquire an economic interest in minerals in place is not required to make an election with respect to such interest at that time. Furthermore, the election need not be made in the taxable year in which payments are made for the acquisition of a lease, such as the payment of a bonus, unless exploratory, development, or operation expenditures are made thereafter with respect to the property in that year.
(2)
Election; how made.
(i) The election under section 614(b) must be made by a statement attached to the income tax return of the taxpayer for the first taxable year for which the election is made. This statement shall indicate that the taxpayer is making an aggregation of separate operating mineral interests within an operating unit under section 614(b) and shall contain a description of the aggregation and describe the operating mineral interests within the operating unit which are to be treated as separate properties apart from the aggregation. A general description, accompanied by maps appropriately marked, which accurately circumscribes the scope of the aggregation and identifies the properties which are to be treated separately will be sufficient. The statement shall also contain a description of the operating unit in sufficient detail to show that the aggregated operating mineral interests are properly within a single operating unit. See paragraph (c) of this section. The taxpayer shall maintain adequate records and maps in support of the above information. In the event expenditures are first made on an operating mineral interest within an operating unit after an election with respect to the aggregation of interests in that operating unit has been made, the taxpayer shall furnish only information describing such operating mineral interest, its location in the operating unit, and whether it is to be included within the aggregation.
(ii) If the taxpayer made or did not make the election under section 614(b) with respect to a particular operating mineral interest and the last day prescribed by law for filing the return (including extensions of time therefor) on which the election was required to be made falls on or before May 1, 1961, consent is hereby given to the taxpayer to make or change the election not later than May 1, 1961. Any such election or change of such election shall be effective with respect to the earliest taxable year to which the election is applicable in respect of which assessment of a deficiency or credit or refund of an overpayment, as the case may be, resulting from such election or change is not prevented by any law or rule of law on the date such election or change is made. An election or change of election made pursuant to this subdivision shall be binding upon the taxpayer for the first taxable year for which it is effective and for all subsequent taxable years unless consent to a different treatment is obtained from the Commissioner. (See, however, paragraph (e) of this section for rules relating to the termination and nonapplicability of the election under section 614(b) except in the case of oil and gas wells.) Such election or change shall be made in the form of a statement setting forth the nature of the election or change, including information substantially the same as that required by subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, and shall be accompanied by an amended return or returns if necessary or, if appropriate, a
claim for refund or credit. The appropriate documents must be filed on or before May 1, 1961 with the district director for the district in which the original return was filed.
(3)
Election; when effective.
If a taxpayer has elected to aggregate an operating mineral interest, the date on which the aggregation becomes effective is the earliest date within the taxable year affected, on which the taxpayer incurred any expenditure for exploration, development, or operation of such interest. The application of this rule may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
In 1953, a taxpayer owned and operated mineral interests Nos. 1, 2, and 3. All three interests form one operating unit. The taxpayer, who files his return on a calendar year basis, continued to own and operate these interests during the year 1954, and in his return for that year, filed on April 15, 1955, elected to aggregate these three interests. As the result of this election, the aggregation was effective for all purposes of subtitle A of the Code as of January 1, 1954.

# Example 2.
Assume that, on March 1, 1955, the taxpayer described in example 1 acquired operating mineral interest No. 4 which was also a part of the operating unit composed of operating mineral interests Nos. 1, 2, and 3, that he made his first expenditure for exploration with respect to operating mineral interest No. 4 on September 1, 1955, and that, in his return filed on April 15, 1956, he elected to aggregate operating mineral interest No. 4 with the aggregation consisting of Nos. 1, 2, and 3. As the result of that election, operating mineral interest No. 4 became a part of the aggregation for all purposes of subtitle of the Code on September 1, 1955.
(4)
Election; binding effect.
A valid election made under section 614(b) and this section shall be binding upon the taxpayer for the taxable year for which made and all subsequent taxable years unless consent to make a change is obtained from the Commissioner. However, see paragraph (e) of this section for rules with respect to the termination of the election under section 614(b) except in the case of oil and gas wells. For rules relating to the binding effect of an election where the basis of a separate or an aggregated property in the hands of the transferee is determined by reference to the basis in the hands of the transferor, see paragraph (c) of § 1.614-6. A taxpayer can neither include within the aggregation a separate operating mineral interest which he had previously elected to treat separately, nor exclude from the aggregation a separate operating mineral interest previously included therein unless consent to do so is obtained from the Commissioner. A change in tax consequences alone is not sufficient to obtain consent to change the treatment of an operating mineral interest. However, consent may be appropriate where, for example, there has been a substantial change in the taxpayer's operations so that a major part of an aggregation becomes a part of another operating unit. Applications for consent shall be made in writing to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, Washington, DC 20224. The application must be accompanied by a statement indicating the reason or reasons for the change and furnishing the information required under subdivision (i) of subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, unless such information has been previously filed and is current.
(5)
Invalid aggregations
—(i)
In general.
In addition to aggregations which are invalid under section 614(b) because of the failure to make timely elections, aggregations may be invalid under such section in situations which may be divided into two general categories. The first category involves basic aggregations which were timely but otherwise initially invalid. The second category involves invalid additions of operating mineral interests to basic aggregations which additions became subject to the election in years subsequent to the year in which the initial basic aggregation or aggregations were formed.
(ii)
Invalid basic aggregations.
The term
invalid basic aggregations
refers to those aggregations which are initially invalid. Generally, such basic aggregations will be invalid because more than one aggregation has been formed within an operating unit or because operating mineral interests in two or more operating units have been improperly aggregated. For any year in which an invalid basic aggregation exists, each operating mineral interest included in such aggregation shall be treated for all purposes as a separate property unless consent is obtained from the Commissioner to treat any such interest in
a different manner. Consent will be granted in appropriate cases as, for example, where the taxpayer demonstrates that he inadvertently formed an invalid basic aggregation. The provisions of this subdivision may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
In 1953, taxpayer A owned six operating mineral interests, designated No. 1 through No. 6, and he continued to own and operate such interests during 1954. He acquired no other operating mineral interests during such year. All six of these operating mineral interests form one operating unit. Assume that A elected under section 614(b) to aggregate operating mineral interests Nos. 1 through 3 into one aggregation and Nos. 4 through 6 into another aggregation. Since A has formed two aggregations in one operating unit, they are invalid basic aggregations. Therefore, interests Nos. 1 through 6 must be treated as separate properties for 1954 and all subsequent taxable years unless consent is obtained from the Commissioner to treat any of such interests in a different manner.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in example 1 and assume also that, in his return for 1954, A correctly elected to aggregate all six operating mineral interests into one aggregation under section 614(b). Assume further that all these operating mineral interests continued to be in one operating unit for the years 1954, 1955, and 1956 but that, because of changes in the facts and circumstances of A's operations, in 1957 operating mineral interests Nos. 1, 2, and 3 became a part of one operating unit and Nos. 4, 5, and 6 became a part of another operating unit. Notwithstanding the change in operations, the election made by A shall continue to be binding unless consent to change such election is obtained from the Commissioner.
(iii)
Invalid additions.
The term
additions
refers to the additions that a taxpayer makes by electing to aggregate an operating mineral interest with an aggregation formed in a previous year. Such additions will be invalid where the taxpayer either elected to aggregate an operating mineral interest with an invalid basic aggregation or elected to aggregate an operating mineral interest which is part of one operating unit with an aggregation of operating mineral interests which is a part of another operating unit. An operating mineral interest which is invalidly added to either a valid basic aggregation or to an invalid basic aggregation shall be considered as a separate property unless consent is obtained from the Commissioner to treat such interest in a different manner. The following are examples of invalid additions:

# Example 1.
In 1953, taxpayer A owned six operating mineral interests designated No. 1 through No. 6 and he continued to own and operate such interests during 1954. He acquired no other operating mineral interests during that year. Nos. 1 through 3 formed one operating unit and Nos. 4 through 6 formed another operating unit. In his return for 1954, A incorrectly elected to aggregate all six operating mineral interests into one aggregation under section 614(b). In 1955, A acquired and commenced development of operating mineral interest No. 7 which is correctly a part of the operating unit of which operating mineral interests Nos. 1, 2, and 3 are a part. A elected under section 614(b), for the year 1955, to aggregate operating mineral interest No. 7 with the invalid basic aggregation composed of Nos. 1 through 6. Since operating mineral interest No. 7 was aggregated with an invalid basic aggregation, it is an invalid addition and must be treated as a separate property unless consent is obtained from the Commissioner to treat it in a different manner.

# Example 2.
In 1953, taxpayer A owned nine operating mineral interests designated No. 1 through No. 9. During 1954, he continued to own and operate such interests and acquired no other operating mineral interest. Interests No. 1 through No. 3 form one operating unit, Nos. 4 through 6 form another operating unit, and Nos. 7 through 9 form a third operating unit. For the year 1954, A elected under section 614(b) to aggregate operating mineral interests Nos. 1, 2, 3, and 4 into one aggregation, to treat Nos. 5 and 6 as separate properties, and to aggregate Nos. 7, 8, and 9 into another aggregation. Assume that in 1955 A acquired and commenced development of operating mineral interest No. 10 which was a part of the operating unit composed of Nos. 1, 2, and 3. Assume further that he elected under section 614(b) to aggregate No. 10 with the aggregation composed of Nos. 7, 8, and 9. This would be an invalid addition to a valid basic aggregation since operating mineral interest No. 10 was not properly a part of the operating unit formed by Nos. 7, 8, and 9. Therefore, interest No. 10 must be treated as a separate property for 1955 and all subsequent taxable years unless consent is obtained from the Commissioner to treat it in a different manner. However, the valid basic aggregation composed of interests Nos. 7 through 9 is not affected by the invalid addition of interest No. 10.

# Example 3.
Assume the same facts as in example 2 except that A elected under section
614(b) in 1955 to aggregate No. 10 with the aggregation of Nos. 1 through 4. This would also be an invalid addition because the aggregation composed of Nos. 1 through 4 is an invalid basic aggregation since operating mineral interest No. 4 is not a part of the operating unit consisting of Nos. 1, 2, and 3. Therefore, interest No. 10 must be treated as a separate property for 1955 and all subsequent taxable years unless consent is obtained from the Commissioner to treat such interest in a different manner.
(e)
Termination of election
—(1)
Taxable years beginning after December 31, 1963, in the case of oil and gas wells.
In the case of oil and gas wells, the election provided for under section 614(b) and paragraph (a) of this section to form an aggregation of separate operating mineral interests shall not apply with respect to any taxable year beginning after December 31, 1963. In addition, if a taxpayer treated certain separate operating mineral interests in a single tract or parcel of land as separate rather than as an aggregation and decides to continue such treatment for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1963, he must make an appropriate election under section 614(b) as amended by the Revenue Act of 1964. See § 1.614-8.
(2)
Taxable years beginning after December 31, 1957, in the case of mines.
Except in the case of oil and gas wells, the election provided for under section 614(b) and paragraph (a) of this section to form an aggregation of separate operating mineral interests shall not apply with respect to any taxable year beginning after December 31, 1957. Thus, if a taxpayer makes a binding election under section 614(b) to form an aggregation of separate operating mineral interests within an operating unit for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1958, he must make a new election for the first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1957, under section 614(c) within the time prescribed in § 1.614-3 if he wishes to aggregate any separate operating mineral interests within such operating unit. A new election must be made under section 614(c) notwithstanding the fact that the aggregation formed under section 614(b) would constitute a valid aggregation under section 614(c). Failure to make such an election within the time prescribed shall constitute an election to treat each separate operating mineral interest within the operating unit as a separate property for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1957.
(3)
Taxable years beginning before January 1, 1958, in the case of mines.
An election made under section 614(b) and paragraph (a) of this section to form an aggregation of separate operating mineral interests within a particular operating unit shall not apply with respect to any taxable year beginning prior to January 1, 1958, for which the taxpayer makes an election under section 614(c)(3)(B) and paragraph (f)(2) of § 1.614-3 which is applicable to any separate operating mineral interest within the same operating unit. The provisions of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
In 1953, taxpayer A owned six separate operating mineral interests, designated No. 1 through No. 6, which he operated as a unit. Operating mineral interests Nos. 1 through 5 comprise a mine, and operating mineral interest No. 6 represents one mineral deposit in a single tract of land which is being extracted by means of two mines. Taxpayer A previously made a binding election under section 614(b) to aggregate operating mineral interests Nos. 1 through 5 and to treat operating mineral interest No. 6 as a separate property. Under section 614(c)(2) and (3)(B) taxpayer A makes an election which is applicable for the taxable year 1954 and all subsequent taxable years to treat operating mineral interest No. 6 as two separate operating mineral interests. Therefore, the previous election of taxpayer A to aggregate operating mineral interests Nos. 1 through 5 under section 614(b) does not apply. Unless taxpayer A also makes an election to aggregate operating mineral interests Nos. 1 through 5 as one property under section 614(c)(1) and (3)(B) within the time prescribed in paragraph (f)(2) of § 1.614-3, he shall be deemed to have made an election to treat each of such interests as a separate property for 1954 and all subsequent taxable years.

# Example 2.
In 1953, taxpayer B owned six separate operating mineral interests, designated No. 1 through No. 6, which he operated as a unit. Operating mineral interests Nos. 1 through 3 comprise a mine and Nos. 4 through 6 comprise a second mine. Taxpayer B previously made a binding election under section 614(b) to aggregate operating mineral interests Nos. 1 through 8 and to treat Nos. 4 through 6 as separate properties. Under section 614(c) (1) and (3)(B) taxpayer B makes
an election which is applicable for the taxable year 1954 and all subsequent taxable years to aggregate operating mineral interests Nos. 4 through 6 as one property. The previous election of the taxpayer under section 614(b) to aggregate operating mineral interests Nos. 1 through 3 does not apply even though such aggregation would constitute a valid aggregation if formed under section 614(c)(1). Therefore, if taxpayer B wishes to continue to treat operating mineral interests Nos. 1 through 3 as one property, he must also make an election to do so under section 614(c) (1) and (3)(B) within the time prescribed in paragraph (f)(2) of § 1.614-3.
(4)
Bases of separate operating mineral interests.
If an aggregation formed under section 614(b) is terminated by reason of the provisions of section 614(b)(4)(A), is terminated under section 614(b)(4)(B) for any taxable year after the first taxable year to which the election under section 614(b) applies, or is terminated by reason of the provisions of section 614(b) as amended by the Revenue Act of 1964, the bases of the separate operating mineral interests (and combinations thereof) included in such aggregation shall be determined in accordance with the rules contained in paragraph (a)(2) of § 1.614-6 as of the first day of the first taxable year for which the termination is effective. However, if by reason of the provisions of section 614(b)(4)(B), an election to aggregate under section 614(b) does not apply for any taxable year for which such election was made, the bases of the separate operating mineral interests included in the aggregation formed under section 614(b) shall be determined without regard to the election under section 614(b).
(f)
Alternative treatment of separate operating mineral interests in the case of oil and gas wells.
For rules relating to an alternative treatment of separate operating mineral interests in the case of oil and gas wells, see § 1.614-4.
[T.D. 6524, 26 FR 147, Jan. 10, 1961, as amended by T.D. 6859, 30 FR 13700, Oct. 28, 1965]
§ 1.614-3
Rules relating to separate operating mineral interests in the case of mines.
(a)
Election to aggregate separate operating mineral interests
—(1)
General rule.
Except in the case of oil and gas wells, a taxpayer who owns two or more separate operating mineral interests, which constitute part or all of the same operating unit, may elect under section 614(c)(1) and this paragraph to form an aggregation of all such operating mineral interests which comprise any one mine or any two or more mines and to treat such aggregation as one property. The aggregated property which results from the exercise of such election shall be considered as one property for all purposes of subtitle A of the Code. The preceding sentence does not preclude the use of more than one account under a single method of computing depreciation or the use of more than one method of computing depreciation under section 167, if otherwise proper. Any reasonable and consistently applied method or methods of computing depreciation of the improvements made with respect to the separate properties aggregated may be continued in accordance with section 167 and the regulations thereunder. It is not necessary for purposes of the aggregation that the separate operating mineral interests be included in a single tract or parcel of land or in contiguous tracts or parcels of land so long as such interests constitute part or all of the same operating unit. A taxpayer may elect to form more than one aggregation of separate operating mineral interests within one operating unit so long as each aggregation consists of all the separate operating mineral interests which comprise any one mine or any two or more mines. Thus, no aggregation may include any separate operating mineral interest which is a part of a mine without including all of the separate operating mineral interests which comprise such mine in the first taxable year for which the election to aggregate is effective. Any separate operating mineral interest which becomes a part of such mine in a subsequent taxable year must also be included in such aggregation as of the taxable year that such interest becomes a part of such mine. The taxable year in which such interest becomes a part of such mine shall be determined upon the basis of the facts and circumstances of the particular case. If a taxpayer fails to make an election under this paragraph to aggregate a particular operating mineral interest
(other than an interest which becomes a part of a mine with respect to which the interests have been aggregated in a prior taxable year) on or before the last day prescribed for making such an election, such interest shall be treated as if an election had been made to treat it as a separate property. A taxpayer may not aggregate operating mineral interests and nonoperating mineral interests such as royalty interests. For definitions of the terms
operating mineral interest, operating unit,
and
mine,
see respectively paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) of this section.
(2)
Aggregation in subsequent taxable years.
If the taxpayer has made an election under section 614(c)(1) for a particular taxable year with respect to any operating mineral interest or interests within a particular operating unit, and if, for a subsequent taxable year, the taxpayer desires to make an election with respect to an additional operating mineral interest within the same operating unit, then whether or not the taxpayer may elect to include such additional interest in an aggregation or treat it as a separate property depends upon the nature of such additional interest and of the taxpayer's previous elections. If the additional interest is a part of a mine with respect to which the other interests have been aggregated, the additional interest must be included in such aggregation. If the additional interest is a part of a mine with respect to which the other interests have been treated as separate properties, the additional interest must be treated as a separate property. If the additional interest is part of a mine which previously consisted of only a single interest which has not been aggregated with any other mine, such additional interest may be aggregated or treated as a separate property. If the additional interest is an entire mine, it may, at the election of the taxpayer, (i) be added to any aggregation within the same operating unit, (ii) be aggregated with any other single interest which is an entire mine provided both interests are within the same operating unit even though such single interest has previously been treated as a separate property, or (iii) be treated as a separate property.
(b)
Election to treat a single operating mineral interest as more than one property
—(1)
General rule.
Except in the case of oil and gas wells, a taxpayer who owns a separate operating mineral interest in a mineral deposit in a single tract or parcel of land may elect under section 614(c)(2) and this paragraph to treat such interest as two or more separate operating mineral interests if such mineral deposit is being developed or extracted by means of two or more mines. In order for this election to be applicable, there must be at least two mines with respect to each of which an expenditure for development or operation has been made by the taxpayer. The election under section 614(c)(2) may also be made with respect to a separate operating mineral interest formed by a previous election under section 614(c)(2) at such time as the mineral deposit previously allocated to such interest is being developed or extracted by means of two or more mines. If there is more than one mineral deposit in a single tract or parcel of land, an election under section 614(c)(2) with respect to any one of such mineral deposits has no application to the other mineral deposits. The election under section 614(c)(2) may not be made with respect to an aggregated property or with respect to any operating mineral interest which is a part of any aggregation formed by the taxpayer unless the taxpayer obtains consent from the Commissioner. Such consent will not be granted where the principal purpose for the request to make the election is based on tax consequences. Application for such consent shall be made in writing to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, Washington, DC 20224. The application must be accompanied by a statement setting forth in detail the reason or reasons for the request to exercise the election with respect to an aggregated property.
(2)
Allocation of mineral deposit.
If the taxpayer elects to treat a separate operating mineral interest in a mineral deposit in a single tract or parcel of land as more than one separate operating mineral interest, then all of such mineral deposit therein and all of the portion of the tract or parcel of land allocated thereto must be allocated to
the newly formed separate operating mineral interests. A portion of such mineral deposit and such tract or parcel of land must be allocated to each such newly formed separate operating mineral interest. There must be at least one mine, with respect to which an expenditure for development or operation has been made by the taxpayer, with respect to each such portion. The extent of the portion to be allocated to each newly formed separate operating mineral interest is to be determined upon the basis of the facts and circumstances of the particular case.
(3)
Basis of newly formed separate operating mineral interests.
The adjusted basis of each of the separate operating mineral interests formed by the making of the election under section 614(c)(2) shall be determined by apportioning the adjusted basis of the separate operating mineral interest with respect to which such election was made between (or among) the newly formed separate operating mineral interests in the same proportion as the fair market value of each such newly formed interest (as of the date on which the election becomes effective) bears to the total fair market value of the interest with respect to which the election was made as of such date.
(4)
Aggregation of newly formed separate operating mineral interests.
Any separate operating mineral interest formed by the making of the election under section 614(c)(2) may be included as a part of an aggregation subject to the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, provided that the time for making the election under section 614(c)(1) to include such separate operating mineral interest in such aggregation has not expired. See paragraph (f) of this section. The provisions of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
In 1958, taxpayer A acquired two separate operating mineral interests designated No. 1 and No. 2. Each is an interest in a single mineral deposit in a single tract of land. In the same year, taxpayer A made his first development expenditure with respect to a mine on operating mineral interest No. 1 and a mine on operating mineral interest No. 2. Operating mineral interests Nos. 1 and 2 are operated as a unit. Taxpayer A did not elect to aggregate operating mineral interests Nos. 1 and 2 under section 614(c)(1) within the time prescribed for making such an election. In 1960 taxpayer A made his first development expenditure with respect to a second mine on operating mineral interest No. 2. Taxpayer A elected under section 614(c)(2) to treat operating mineral interest No. 2 as two separate operating mineral interests, designated as Nos. 2(a) and 2(b), for the taxable year 1960 and all subsequent taxable years. No. 2(a) contained the mine for which the first development expenditure was made in 1958, and No. 2(b) contained the mine for which the first development expenditure was made in 1960. If taxpayer A wishes to do so, he may elect to aggregate mineral interests Nos. 1 and 2(b) under section 614(c)(1) for the taxable year 1960 and all subsequent taxable years since the first development expenditure with respect to the mine on operating mineral interest No. 2(b) was made during the taxable year 1960. Taxpayer A may not elect to aggregate mineral interests Nos. 1 and 2(a) under such section since the time for making such an election has expired.
(c)
Operating mineral interest defined.
For the definition of the term
operating mineral interest
as used in this section, see paragraph (b) of § 1.614-2.
(d)
Operating unit defined.
For the definition of the term
operating unit
as used in this section, see paragraph (c) of § 1.614-2.
(e)
Mine defined.
For purposes of this section, the term
mine
means any excavation or other workings or series of related excavations or related workings, as the case may be, for the purpose of extracting any known mineral deposit except oil and gas deposits. For the purpose of the preceding sentence, the term
excavations
or
workings
includes quarries, pits, shafts, and wells (except oil and gas wells). The number of excavations or workings that constitute a mine is to be determined upon the basis of the facts and circumstances of the particular case such as the nature and position of the mineral deposit or deposits, the method of mining the mineral, the location of the excavations or other workings in relation to the mineral deposit or deposits, and the topography of the area. The determination of the taxpayer as to the composition of a mine is to be accepted unless there is a clear and convincing basis for a change in such determination.
(f)
Manner and scope of election
—(1)
Election to apply section 614(c) (1) and (2)
for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1957.
Except as provided in subparagraphs (2) and (3) of this paragraph, the election under section 614(c)(1) and paragraph (a) of this section to treat an operating mineral interest as part of an aggregation shall be made under section 614(c)(3)(A) not later than the time prescribed by law for filing the taxpayer's income tax return (including extensions thereof) for whichever of the following taxable years is the later:
(i) The first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1957, or
(ii) The first taxable year in which any expenditure for development or operation in respect of the separate operating mineral interest is made by the taxpayer after the acquisition of such interest
Except as provided in subparagraphs (2) and (3) of this paragraph, the election under section 614(c)(2) and paragraph (b) of this section to treat a single operating mineral interest as more than one operating mineral interest shall be made under section 614(c)(3)(A) not later than the time prescribed by law for filing the taxpayer's income tax return (including extensions thereof) for whichever of the following taxable years is the later:
(iii) The first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1957, or
(iv) The first taxable year in which expenditures for development or operation of more than one mine in respect of the separate operating mineral interest are made by the taxpayer after the acquisition of such interest
However, if the latest time at which an election may be made under this subparagraph falls on or before May 1, 1961, such election may be made or modified at any time on or before May 1, 1961. See paragraph (c) of § 1.614-6 as to the binding effect of an election where the basis of a separate operating mineral interest in the hands of the taxpayer is determined by reference to the basis in the hands of a transferor.
(2)
Election to apply section 614(c) (1) and (2) for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1958.
In accordance with section 614(c)(3)(B), the election under section 614(c) (1) and paragraph (a) of this section to treat an operating mineral interest as part of an aggregation may, at the election of the taxpayer, be made not later than the time prescribed by law for filing the taxpayer's income tax return (including extensions thereof) for whichever of the following taxable years is the later:
(i) The first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1953, and ending after August 16, 1954, for which assessment of a deficiency or credit or refund of an overpayment, as the case may be, resulting from an election under section 614(c)(1), is not prevented on September 2, 1958, by the operation of any law or rule of law, or
(ii) The first taxable year in which any expenditure for development or operation in respect of the separate operating mineral interest is made by the taxpayer after the acquisition of such interest
In accordance with section 614(c) (3)(B), the election under section 614(c)(2) and paragraph (b) of this section to treat an operating mineral interest as more than one operating mineral interest may, at the election of the taxpayer, be made not later than the time prescribed by law for filing the taxpayer's income tax return (including extensions thereof) for whichever of the following taxable years is the later:
(iii) The first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1953, and ending after August 16, 1954, for which assessment of a deficiency or credit or refund of an overpayment, as the case may be, resulting from an election under section 614(c)(2), is not prevented on September 2, 1958, by the operation of any law or rule of law, or
(iv) The first taxable year in which expenditures for development or operation of more than one mine in respect of the separate operating mineral interest are made by the taxpayer after the acquisition of such interest
However, if the latest time at which an election may be made under this subparagraph falls on or before May 1, 1961, such election may be made or modified at any time on or before May 1, 1961. See paragraph (c) of § 1.614-6 as to the binding effect of an election where the basis of a separate operating mineral interest in the hands of the
taxpayer is determined by reference to the basis in the hands of a transferor.
(3)
Limitation.
If the taxpayer makes an election under section 614(c) (1) or (2) in accordance with section 614(c)(3)(B) and subparagraph (2) of this paragraph with respect to any operating mineral interest which constitutes part or all of an operating unit, such taxpayer may not make any election under section 614(c) (1) or (2) in accordance with section 614(c)(3)(A) and subparagraph (1) of this paragraph with respect to any operating mineral interest which constitutes part or all of such operating unit. The provisions of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example:
In 1953, taxpayer A owned six separate operating mineral interests, designated No. 1 through No. 6, which he operated as a unit. Operating mineral interests Nos. 1 through 5 comprise a mine, and operating mineral interest No. 6 represents one mineral deposit in a single tract of land which is being extracted by means of two mines. In accordance with section 614(c)(3)(B) and subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, taxpayer A elects under section 614(c)(2) to treat operating mineral interest No. 6 as two separate operating mineral interests for the taxable year 1954 and all subsequent taxable years. Unless taxpayer A also makes an election under section 614(c)(1) to aggregate operating mineral interests Nos. 1 through 5 for the taxable year 1954 and all subsequent taxable years in accordance with section 614(c)(3)(B) and subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, he shall be deemed to have made an election to treat each of such interests as a separate property. Taxpayer A may not elect, under section 614(c) (1) and (3)(A), to aggregate operating mineral interests Nos. 1 through 5 for the taxable year 1958 or any subsequent taxable year.
(4)
Statute of limitations.
If the taxpayer makes any election in accordance with section 614(c)(3)(B) and subparagraph (2) of this paragraph and if assessment of any deficiency for any taxable year resulting from such election is prevented on May 1, 1961, or at any time within one year after such first day, by the operation of any law or rule of law, such assessment may, nevertheless, be made within one year after May 1, 1961. Any election by a taxpayer in accordance with section 614(c)(3)(B) shall constitute consent to the assessment of any deficiency resulting from any such election. If refund or credit of any overpayment of income tax resulting from any election made in accordance with section 614(c)(3)(B) is prevented on May 1, 1961, or at any time within one year after May 1, 1961, by the operation of any law or rule of law, refund or credit of such overpayment may, nevertheless, be made or allowed but only if claim therefor is filed within one year after May 1, 1961. This subparagraph shall not apply with respect to any taxable year of a taxpayer for which an assessment of a deficiency resulting from an election made in accordance with section 614(c)(3)(B) or a refund or credit of an overpayment resulting from any such election, as the case may be, is prevented by the operation of any law or rule of law on September 2, 1958.
(5)
Elections—how made
—(i)
General rule.
Except as provided in subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph, an election under section 614(c) (1) or (2) and paragraph (a) or (b) of this section must be made by a statement attached to the income tax return of the taxpayer for the first taxable year for which the election is made. The statement shall contain the following information:
(
a
) Whether the taxpayer is making an election or elections with respect to the operating unit in accordance with section 614(c)(3) (A) or (B);
(
b
) A description of the operating unit of the taxpayer in sufficient detail to identify the operating mineral interests which are included within such operating unit;
(
c
) A description of each aggregation to be formed within the operating unit in sufficient detail to show that each aggregation consists of all the separate operating mineral interests which comprise any one mine or any two or more mines;
(
d
) A description of each separate operating mineral interest within the operating unit which is to be treated as a separate property in sufficient detail to show that such interest is not a part of any mine for which an election to aggregate has been made;
(
e
) The taxable year in which the first expenditure for development or operation was made by the taxpayer with respect to each separate operating mineral interest within the operating
unit, but if the first expenditure for development or operation has not been made with respect to a separate operating mineral interest before the close of the taxable year for which the election under this section is made, such information should also be included;
(
f
) A description of each separate operating mineral interest within the operating unit which the taxpayer elects to treat as more than one such interest under section 614(c)(2) in sufficient detail to show that the separate operating mineral interest was not a part of an aggregation formed by the taxpayer under section 614(c)(1) for any taxable year prior to the taxable year for which the election under section 614(c)(2) is made, and to show that the mineral deposit representing the separate operating mineral interest is being developed or extracted by means of two or more mines;
(
g
) The taxable year in which the first expenditure for development or operation was made by the taxpayer with respect to each mine on the separate operating mineral interest that the taxpayer is electing to treat as more than one such interest; and
(
h
) The allocation of the mineral deposit representing the separate operating mineral interest between (or among) the newly formed interests and the method by which such allocation was made
For the purpose of applying subdivisions (
e
) and (
g
) of this subdivision, if the first expenditure for development or operation with respect to a separate operating mineral interest or a mine was made prior to the first taxable year for which the election with respect to such interest or mine is applicable, the taxpayer may state that such is the case in lieu of identifying the exact taxable year in which such first expenditure was made. In any case where part of the information required under this subdivision can be adequately supplied by means of appropriately marked maps, the statement may be accompanied by such maps and may omit the required descriptive material to the extent replaced by the maps. The taxpayer shall maintain adequate records and maps in support of the above information. In the event that the first expenditure for development or operation with respect to a separate operating mineral interest is made by the taxpayer in a taxable year subsequent to the taxable year for which an election under this section has been made with respect to the operating unit of which such interest is a part, the taxpayer shall furnish information describing such interest in sufficient detail to identify it as a part of such operating unit, to show whether it is a part of a mine with respect to which the interests have previously been aggregated or have previously been treated as separate properties, and to indicate whether it is to be included within an aggregation.
(ii)
Special rule.
If the last day prescribed by law for filing the taxpayer's income tax return (including extensions thereof) for the first taxable year for which an election under section 614(c) (1) or (2) is made falls before May 1, 1961, the statement of election or modification thereof for such taxable year must be filed on or before May 1, 1961, with the district director for the district in which such return was filed. The statement must contain the information as required in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, must indicate the first taxable year for which the election contained therein is made, and shall be accompanied by an amended return or returns if necessary or, if appropriate, a claim for refund or credit.
(6)
Elections; when effective.
If the taxpayer has elected to form an aggregation under section 614(c)(1) and this section, the date on which the aggregation becomes effective is the first day of the first taxable year for which the election is made; except that if any separate operating mineral interest included in such aggregation was acquired after such first day, the date on which the inclusion of such interest in such aggregation becomes effective is the date of its acquisition. If the taxpayer elects to add another operating mineral interest to such aggregation for a subsequent taxable year, the date on which aggregation of the additional interest becomes effective is the first day of such subsequent taxable year or the date of acquisition of such interest, whichever is later. If an operating mineral interest is required to be included in the aggregation for a subsequent
taxable year because such interest becomes a part of a mine which the taxpayer has previously elected to aggregate, the date on which the inclusion of such interest in the aggregation becomes effective is the first day of the subsequent taxable year or the date of acquisition of such interest, whichever is later. If the taxpayer has elected to treat a separate operating mineral interest as more than one such interest, the date on which the election becomes effective is the first day of the first taxable year for which the election is made or the earliest date on which the first expenditure for development or operation has been made by the taxpayer with respect to a mine on each newly formed separate operating mineral interest, whichever is later.
(7)
Elections; binding effect.
A valid election under section 614(c) (1) or (2) whether made in accordance with section 614(c)(3) (A) or (B) shall be binding upon the taxpayer for the taxable year for which made and for all subsequent taxable years unless consent to change the treatment of an operating mineral interest with respect to which an election has been made is obtained from the Commissioner. For rules relating to the binding effect of an election where the basis of a separate or an aggregated property in the hands of the transferee is determined by reference to the basis in the hands of the transferor, see paragraph (c) of § 1.614-6. A taxpayer can neither include within an aggregation a separate operating mineral interest which he has previously elected to treat as a separate property, nor exclude from an aggregation a separate operating mineral interest which he has properly elected to include within such aggregation unless consent to do so is obtained from the Commissioner. A change in tax consequences alone is not sufficient to obtain consent to change the treatment of an operating mineral interest. However, consent may be appropriate where, for example, there has been a substantial change in the taxpayer's operations so that a major part of an aggregation becomes a part of another operating unit. Applications for consent shall be made in writing to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, Washington, DC 20224. The application must be accompanied by a statement indicating the reason or reasons for the change and furnishing the information required in subparagraph (5)(i) of this paragraph, unless such information has been previously filed and is current.
(8)
Invalid aggregations
—(i)
General rule.
In addition to aggregations which are invalid under this section because of the failure to make timely elections, aggregations may be invalid under this section in situations which may be divided into two general categories. The first category involves invalid basic aggregations. The second category involves invalid additions to basic aggregations.
(ii)
Invalid basic aggregations.
The term
invalid basic aggregations
refers to aggregations which are initially invalid. Generally, a basic aggregation is initially invalid because it does not include all the separate operating mineral interests which comprise a complete mine or mines or because it includes separate operating mineral interests which are not part of the same operating unit. If the taxpayer makes an invalid basic aggregation, each of the separate operating mineral interests included in such aggregation shall be treated as a separate property for the first taxable year for which the election is made and for all subsequent taxable years unless consent is obtained from the Commissioner to treat any such interest in a different manner. Consent will be granted in appropriate cases. For example, assume that the taxpayer elects to form an aggregation of the operating mineral interests which comprise one or more complete mines. If the taxpayer demonstrates that he inadvertently failed to include a minor part of one of the aggregated mines or inadvertently included a minor part of another mine that is not a part of the aggregation, consent will ordinarily be granted to maintain the aggregation by including the part omitted or by excluding the part included. The provisions of this subdivision may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
In 1958, taxpayer A owned ten operating mineral interests, designated No. 1 through No. 10, which he operated as a unit. Interests Nos. 1 through 5 comprised mine X, and interests Nos. 6 through 10 comprised
mine Y. Taxpayer A had made his first development expenditure with respect to each of the ten interests before January 1, 1958. Taxpayer A elected under section 614(c) (1) and (3)(A) to aggregate interests Nos. 1 through 8 for 1958 and all subsequent taxable years. The aggregation formed by taxpayer A is an invalid basic aggregation because it does not include all the operating mineral interests which comprise a complete mine or mines. Therefore, interests Nos. 1 through 8 must be treated as separate properties for 1958 and all subsequent taxable years unless consent is obtained from the Commissioner to treat any of such interests in a different manner.

# Example 2.
In 1958, taxpayer B owned ten operating mineral interests designated No. 1 through No. 10. Interests Nos. 1 through 5 comprised mine X, and interests Nos. 6 through 10 comprised mine Y. Taxpayer B had made his first development expenditure with respect to each of the ten interests before January 1, 1958. Taxpayer B elected under section 614(c) (1) and (3)(A) to aggregate interests Nos. 1 through 10 for 1958 and all subsequent taxable years. Upon audit, it was determined that mines X and Y were in two separate operating units. Therefore, the aggregation formed by taxpayer B is invalid, and interests Nos. 1 through 10 must be treated as separate properties for 1958 and all subsequent taxable years unless consent is obtained from the Commissioner to treat any of such interests in a different manner.
(iii)
Invalid additions.
The term
invalid addition
refers to an operating mineral interest which is invalidly aggregated with an existing aggregation. Generally, an addition is invalid because it is a part of a mine and is aggregated with an aggregation which does not include other interests which are parts of the same mine, or because it is in one operating unit and is included as part of an aggregation which is in another operating unit. If an invalid addition is properly a part of a mine with respect to which other interests have been validly aggregated for a taxable year prior to the first taxable year for which the election to aggregate the invalid addition is made, then the invalid addition shall be included in the aggregation of which it is properly a part for such first taxable year and all subsequent taxable years. Any other invalid addition shall be treated as a separate property for the first taxable year for which the election to aggregate such addition is made and for all subsequent taxable years unless consent is obtained from the Commissioner to treat any such interest in a different manner. The provisions of this subdivision may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
In 1958, taxpayer A owned six operating mineral interests, designated No. 1 through No. 6, which he operated as a unit. Interests Nos. 1 through 3 comprised mine X, and interests Nos. 4 through 6 comprised mine Y. Taxpayer A had made his first development expenditure with respect to each of the six interests before January 1, 1958. Taxpayer A elected under section 614(c) (1) and (3)(A) to aggregate interests Nos. 1 through 3 for 1958 and all subsequent taxable years. He elected to treat interests Nos. 4 through 6 as separate properties for 1958 and all subsequent taxable years. In 1959, taxpayer A acquired and made his first development expenditure with respect to interest No. 7. Interest No. 7 was a part of the mine composed of interests Nos. 4 through 6. Taxpayer A elected under section 614(c) (1) and (3)(A) to aggregate interest No. 7 with the aggregation of interests Nos. 1 through 3 for 1959 and all subsequent taxable years. Interest No. 7 is an invalid addition and must be treated as a separate property for 1959 and all subsequent taxable years. It cannot be aggregated with interests Nos. 4 through 6 since taxpayer A has previously elected to treat such interests as separate properties. However, the valid basic aggregation composed of interests Nos. 1 through 3 is not affected by the invalid addition of interest No. 7.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in example 1 except that taxpayer A elected under section 614(c) (1) and (3)(A) to aggregate interests Nos. 1 through 3 as one aggregation and interests Nos. 4 through 6 as another aggregation for 1958 and all subsequent taxable years. The aggregation of interest No. 7 with the aggregation consisting of interests Nos. 1 through 3 constitutes an invalid addition. Interest No. 7 must be included in the aggregation consisting of interests Nos. 4 through 6 for 1959 and all subsequent taxable years.

# Example 3.
In 1958, taxpayer B owned three operating mineral interests, designated No. 1 through No. 3, which comprised mine X. Taxpayer B had made his first development expenditure with respect to each of the three interests before January 1, 1958. Taxpayer B elected under section 614(c) (1) and (3)(A) to aggregate interests Nos. 1 through 3 for 1958 and all subsequent taxable years. In 1959, taxpayer B acquired interests Nos. 4 through 7 which comprised mine Y. Taxpayer B made his first development expenditure with respect to each of the four interests during 1959. Taxpayer B elected under section 614(c) (1) and (3)(A) to aggregate interests Nos. 4 through 6 and to aggregate interest No. 7 with the aggregation consisting of interests Nos. 1 through 3 for 1959 and all subsequent taxable years. The aggregation consisting of interests Nos. 4 through 6 is an invalid basic
aggregation, and the aggregation of interest No. 7 is an invalid addition. Interests Nos. 4 through 7 must be treated as separate properties for 1959 and all subsequent taxable years unless consent is obtained from the Commissioner to treat such interests in a different manner.
(g)
Special rule as to deductions under section 615(a) prior to aggregation
—(1)
General rule.
If an aggregation of operating mineral interests under section 614(c)(1) and paragraph (a) of this section includes any interest or interests in respect of which exploration expenditures, paid or incurred after the acquisition of such interest or interests, were deducted by the taxpayer under section 615(a) for any taxable year which precedes the date on which such aggregation becomes effective, then the tax imposed by chapter 1 of the Code for the taxable year or years in which such exploration expenditures were so deducted shall be recomputed in accordance with the rules contained in this paragraph. If an operating mineral interest is added to such aggregation for a subsequent taxable year and exploration expenditures made with respect to such interest after its acquisition were deducted by the taxpayer under section 615(a) for any taxable year which precedes the date on which the aggregation of such additional interest becomes effective, then the tax imposed by chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 for the taxable year or years in which such exploration expenditures were so deducted shall be recomputed. For purposes of this paragraph, such taxable year or years shall be referred to as the taxable year or years for which a recomputation is required to be made. See paragraph (f)(6) of this section for rules relating to the date on which an aggregation becomes effective or the date on which the aggregation of an additional interest to an aggregation becomes effective. See subparagraph (3) of this paragraph for rules relating to the method of recomputation of tax. The provisions of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
In 1954, taxpayer A owned two operating mineral interests designated Nos. 1 and 2. Interest No. 1 was in the production stage prior to 1954. The first exploration expenditures with respect to interest No. 2 were made by taxpayer A in 1954 and were deducted under section 615(a) on his return for that year. In 1955, taxpayer A made his first development expenditure with respect to interest No. 2, and thereafter it was operated with interest No. 1 as a unit. Taxpayer A elected under section 614(c) (1) and (3)(B) to form an aggregation of interests Nos. 1 and 2 for 1955 and all subsequent taxable years. Taxpayer A must recompute his tax for 1954 in accordance with this paragraph.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in example 1 except that, in 1957, taxpayer A acquired another operating mineral interest, designated No. 3, made his first exploration expenditures with respect to such interest in that year, and deducted such expenditures under section 615(a) on his return for that year. In 1958, taxpayer A made his first development expenditure with respect to interest No. 3. Interest No. 3 was part of the same operating unit as interests Nos. 1 and 2. Taxpayer A elected under section 614(c) (1) and (3)(B) to add interest No. 3 to his aggregation of interests Nos. 1 and 2 for 1958 and all subsequent taxable years. Taxpayer A must recompute his tax for 1957 in accordance with this paragraph.
(2)
Exceptions
—(i)
Taxable years beginning before January 1, 1958.
In the case of exploration expenditures deducted by the taxpayer with respect to an operating mineral interest for any taxable year beginning before January 1, 1958, subparagraph (1) of this paragraph shall apply only if the taxpayer has made an election under section 614(c) (1) or (2) with respect to the operating unit of which such interest is a part and such election applies to the taxable year for which such exploration expenditures were deducted. Thus, if the taxpayer does not make an election with respect to the operating unit under section 614(c) (1) or (2) and (3)(B), subparagraph (1) of this paragraph does not apply in the case of exploration expenditures deducted with respect to any operating mineral interest which is a part of such operating unit for any taxable year beginning before January 1, 1958. The provisions of this subdivision may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
In 1956, taxpayer A acquired two operating mineral interests designated Nos. 1 and 2. Interest No. 1 was in the production stage at that time. Taxpayer A made his first exploration expenditures with respect to interest No. 2 in 1956, 1957, and 1958 and deducted such expenditures under section 615(a) on his returns for such years. In 1959,
taxpayer A made his first development expenditure with respect to interest No. 2. Interests Nos. 1 and 2 were operated as a unit. Taxpayer A elected under section 614(c) (1) and (3)(A) to aggregate interests Nos. 1 and 2 for 1959 and all subsequent taxable years. Only the exploration expenditures deducted by the taxpayer for 1958 must be taken into account for purposes of applying subparagraph (1) of this paragraph.

# Example 2.
In 1954, taxpayer B owned two operating mineral interests, designated Nos. 1 and 2, which he operated as a unit. Interest No. 1 was in the production stage at that time, and interest No. 2 represented one mineral deposit in a single tract of land which was being extracted by means of two mines. Under section 614(c) (2) and (3)(B), taxpayer B elects to treat interest No. 2 as two separate operating mineral interests, designated as Nos. 2(a) and 2(b), for 1954 and all subsequent taxable years. In 1955, taxpayer B acquired operating mineral interest No. 3. He made his first exploration expenditures with respect to interest No. 3 in 1955, 1956, and 1957 and deducted such expenditures under section 615(a) on his returns for such years. In 1958, taxpayer B made his first development expenditure with respect to interest No. 3, and thereafter it was operated with interests Nos. 1, 2(a), and 2(b) as a unit. Taxpayer B elects under section 614(c) (1) and (3)(B) to aggregate interests Nos. 1 and 3 for 1958 and all subsequent taxable years. The exploration expenditures deducted by the taxpayer for 1955, 1956, and 1957 must be taken into account for purposes of applying subparagraph (1) of this paragraph since the taxpayer has made an election under section 614(c)(2) with respect to the operating unit of which interest No. 3 is a part and such election applies to the taxable years 1955, 1956, and 1957.
(ii)
Interests formed pursuant to an election under section 614(c)(2).
In the case of exploration expenditures deducted with respect to an operating mineral interest which the taxpayer elects to treat as more than one such interest under section 614(c)(2) and paragraph (b) of this section, subparagraph (1) of this paragraph shall not apply. Thus, if the taxpayer deducts exploration expenditures with respect to an operating mineral interest, subsequently elects to treat such interest as more than one interest under section 614(c)(2), and includes one of the newly formed interests in an aggregation under section 614(c)(1), subparagraph (1) of this paragraph does not apply in the case of the exploration expenditures deducted with respect to the interest which the taxpayer elected to treat as more than one interest. The provisions of this subdivision may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
In 1958, taxpayer A acquired two operating mineral interests, designated Nos. 1 and 2, which he operated as a unit. Each interest was an interest in a single mineral deposit in a single tract or parcel of land. There was a mine in the production stage of each of two interests at that time. Taxpayer A elected under section 614(c)(1)(B) to treat interests Nos. 1 and 2 as separate properties. In 1959 and 1960, taxpayer A made exploration expenditures with respect to interest No. 2 for the purpose of extracting the mineral by means of a second mine, and he deducted such expenditures on his returns for such years. In 1961, taxpayer A made his first development expenditure with respect to a second mine on interest No. 2. Taxpayer A elected under section 614(c)(2) to treat interest No. 2 as two separate operating mineral interests, designated as Nos. 2(a) and 2(b), for 1961 and all subsequent taxable years. Interest No. 2(a) contained the producing mine and interest No. 2(b) contained the subsequently developed mine. In his return for 1961, taxpayer A also elected under section 614(c)(1)(A) to aggregate interests Nos. 1 and 2(b) for 1961 and all subsequent taxable years. The exploration expenditures deducted with respect to interest No. 2 prior to the effective date of the formation of interests Nos. 2(a) and 2(b) need not be taken into account for purposes of applying subparagraph (1) of this paragraph.

# Example 2.
In 1954, taxpayer B owned two operating mineral interests designated Nos. 1 and 2. Interest No. 1 was an interest in a single mineral deposit in a single tract of land which was being extracted by means of two mines. Taxpayer B elected under section 614(c) (2) and (3)(B) to treat interest No. 1 as two separate operating mineral interests, designated as Nos. 1(a) and 1(b), for 1954 and all subsequent taxable years. In 1955, 1956, and 1957, taxpayer B made exploration expenditures with respect to interest No. 2 and deducted such expenditures on his returns for such years. In 1958, taxpayer B made his first development expenditure with respect to interest No. 2, and, on his return for that year, taxpayer B elected to aggregate interests Nos. 1(a) and 2 under section 614(c)(1) for 1958 and all subsequent taxable years. The exploration expenditures deducted with respect to interest No. 2 for 1955, 1956, and 1957 shall be taken into account for purposes of applying subparagraph (1) of this paragraph since such exploration expenditures were deducted with respect to an interest to which this subdivision does not apply.
(3)
Recomputation of tax
—(i)
General rule.
In the case of an aggregation
formed under section 614(c)(1) and paragraph (a) of this section in respect of which a recomputation of tax is required to be made under the provisions of subparagraphs (1) and (2) of this paragraph for any taxable year or years, the tax imposed by chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 shall be recomputed for each such taxable year as if:
(
a
) The taxpayer had elected to form an aggregation for the taxable year for which the recomputation is required to be made, and
(
b
) Such aggregation had included all the interests included in the aggregation formed under section 614(c)(1) except those interests which the taxpayer did not own during the taxable year for which the recomputation is required to be made and those interests in respect of which the taxpayer had made no expenditures for exploration, development, or operation before or during the taxable year for which the recomputation is required to be made
If a recomputation of tax is required to be made for any taxable year in the case of the aggregation of an additional interest to an existing aggregation under section 614(c)(1), such recomputation shall be made as if:
(
c
) The taxpayer had elected to form an aggregation for the taxable year for which the recomputation is required to be made, and
(
d
) Such aggregation had included all the interests included in the aggregation formed under section 614(c)(1) (including any interest which the taxpayer had disposed of prior to the date on which the aggregation of the additional interest becomes effective) except those interests which the taxpayer did not own during the taxable year for which the recomputation is required to be made and those interests in respect of which the taxpayer had made no expenditures for exploration, development, or operation before or during the taxable year for which the recomputation is required to be made
For purposes of this paragraph, any aggregation which is treated as having been formed under subdivisions (
a
) and (
b
) or under subdivisions (
c
) and (
d
) shall be referred to as the
constructed aggregated property.
(ii)
Recomputation of depletion allowance.
The taxpayer shall compute the depletion allowance with respect to the constructed aggregated property for the taxable year for which the recomputation is required to be made. In making this computation, cost depletion for such taxable year shall be computed with reference to the depletion unit for the constructed aggregated property. See paragraph (a) of § 1.611-2. Percentage depletion for such taxable year shall not exceed 50 percent of the taxable income from the constructed aggregated property computed in accordance with § 1.613-5. If a recomputation is required to be made for the same taxable year with respect to any other aggregation or aggregations formed by the taxpayer under section 614(c)(1), the depletion allowance with respect to the other constructed aggregated property or properties shall be similarly computed. If, for a taxable year in respect of which a recomputation is required, the sum of the depletion allowance or allowances as computed under this subdivision is less than the sum of the depletion allowance or allowances actually deducted for such taxable year with respect to all the properties required to be taken into account in making the computation under this subdivision, then the total depletion allowance deducted by the taxpayer for such taxable year shall be reduced by the difference. The taxable income or net operating loss of the taxpayer for such taxable year shall be adjusted to reflect such reduction for purposes of the recomputation of tax. However, if for a taxable year in respect of which a recomputation is required, the sum of the depletion allowance or allowances as computed under this subdivision exceeds the sum of the depletion allowance or allowances actually deducted for such taxable year with respect to all the properties required to be taken into account in making the computation under this subdivision, the recomputation of tax for such taxable year is disregarded for purposes of applying section 614(c)(4) (B), (C), and (D).
(iii)
Effect of recomputation with respect to items based on amount of income.
In making the recomputation of tax
under this subparagraph for any taxable year, any deduction, credit, or other allowance which is based upon the adjusted gross income or taxable income of the taxpayer for such year shall be recomputed taking into account the adjustment required under subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph. For example, if a corporate taxpayer's taxable income is increased under the provisions of such subdivision, then the amount of charitable contributions which may be deducted under the limitation contained in section 170(b)(2) shall be correspondingly increased for purposes of the recomputation. Moreover, the effect that the recomputation of any deduction, credit, or other allowance for a taxable year has on the tax imposed for any other taxable year shall also be taken into account for purposes of the recomputation of tax under this subparagraph. Any change in items of tax preferences (as defined in section 57 and the regulations thereunder) must also be taken into account for purposes of the recomputation under this subparagraph.
(iv)
Effect of recomputation with respect to a net operating loss and a net operating loss deduction.
If the recomputation of tax under this subparagraph for the taxable year for which the recomputation is required to be made results in a reduction of a net operating loss for such year, then the taxpayer shall take into account the effect of such reduction on the tax imposed by chapter I of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (or by corresponding provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939) for any taxable year affected by such reduction. If the recomputation of tax for the taxable year for which the recomputation is required to be made results in an increase in taxable income as defined in section 172(b)(2) for such year, then the taxpayer shall take into account the effect of such increase on the tax imposed by chapter I of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (or by corresponding provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939) for any taxable year affected by such increase. Furthermore, in making the recomputation of tax for any taxable year for which the recomputation is required to be made, the taxpayer shall take into account any change in the net operating loss deduction for such year resulting from the recomputation of tax for any other taxable year for which a recomputation is required to be made. For provisions relating to the net operating loss deduction, see section 172 and the regulations thereunder. For rules relating to the effect of the net operating loss deduction on the minimum tax for tax preferences see section 56 and the regulations thereunder and § 1.58-7.
(v)
Determination of increase in tax.
If the taxpayer elects to form an aggregation or aggregations for a taxable year under section 614(c)(1) and if a recomputation of tax is required to be made under this paragraph for any prior taxable year or years, then the taxpayer shall compute the difference between the tax, including the tax imposed by section 56 (relating to the minimum tax for tax preferences), as recomputed under this subparagraph for such prior taxable year or years (and other taxable years affected by the recomputation) and the tax liability previously determined (computed without regard to section 614(c)(4)) with respect to such prior taxable year or years (and other taxable years affected by the recomputation). If the taxpayer is subsequently required to make a recomputation with respect to any taxable year or years for which he has previously made a recomputation, then the taxpayer shall compute the difference between the tax as subsequently recomputed for such taxable year or years (and other taxable years affected by the subsequent recomputation) and the tax as previously recomputed for such taxable year or years (and other taxable years affected by the subsequent recomputation). For treatment of the increase in tax resulting from the recomputation of tax under this subparagraph, see subparagraph (4) of this paragraph.
(4)
Treatment of increase in tax
—(i)
General rule.
If the taxpayer elects to form an aggregation or aggregations for a taxable year under section 614(c)(1) and if a recomputation of tax is required to be made for any prior taxable year or years, then the total increase in tax resulting from such recomputation determined under subparagraph (3)(v) of this paragraph shall
be taken into account in the first taxable year to which the election to form such aggregation or aggregations is applicable and in each succeeding taxable year until the full amount of such total increase in tax has been taken into account. The number of taxable years over which such total increase shall be taken into account shall be equal to the number of taxable years for which a recomputation of tax is required to be made under subparagraph (1) of this paragraph as limited by subparagraph (2) of this paragraph and for which such recomputation results in a reduction of the taxpayer's depletion allowance under subparagraph (3)(ii) of this paragraph. The amount of the increase in tax which is to be taken into account in a taxable year is determined by dividing the total increase in tax by the number of taxable years over which such total increase is to be taken into account. The tax imposed by chapter I of the Code for each of the taxable years over which the total increase in tax is to be taken into account shall be increased by the amount determined in accordance with the preceding sentence. However, such increase in tax for each of such taxable years shall have no effect upon the determination of the amount of any credit against the tax for any of such taxable years. For example, the amount of such increase shall not affect the computation of the limitation on the foreign tax credit under section 904. The amount of the increase in tax which is required to be taken into account by the taxpayer in a particular taxable year under section 614(c)(4)(C) shall be treated as a tax imposed with respect to such taxable years even though, without regard to section 614(c)(4) and this paragraph, such taxpayer would otherwise have no tax liability for such taxable year.
(ii)
Increase in tax not determinable as of first taxable year of aggregation.
If the recomputation of tax under subparagraph (3) of this paragraph, for any taxable year or years prior to the first taxable year to which the election to form an aggregation or aggregations under section 614(c)(1) applies, results in a reduction of any net operating loss carryover to a taxable year subsequent to such first taxable year, then the total increase in tax resulting from the recomputation is not determinable as of such first taxable year. In such case, the total increase in tax shall be taken into account in equal installments in the first taxable year for which such total increase is determinable and in each succeeding taxable year for which a portion of the increase in tax would have been taken into account under subdivision (i) of this subparagraph if the total increase had been determinable as of the first taxable year to which the election to form the aggregation or aggregations under section 614(c)(1) applies. The provisions of this subdivision may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
Assume that taxpayer A elects under section 614(c)(1) to form an aggregation for 1960 and all subsequent taxable years. Assume further that taxpayer A is required to recompute his tax for four prior taxable years under subparagraphs (1) and (2) of this paragraph and that the recomputation for each of such taxable years results in a reduction of taxpayer A's depletion allowance. Under subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, the total increase in tax resulting from the recomputation is to be taken into account in equal installments in 1960, 1961, 1962, and 1963. However, if the total increase in tax is not determinable until 1961 because the recomputation for the prior taxable years results in the reduction of a net operating loss carryover to 1961, then the total increase shall be taken into account in equal installments in 1961, 1962, and 1963. In like manner, if the total increase in tax is not determinable until 1962, it shall be taken into account in equal installments in 1962 and 1963.
(iii)
Death or cessation of existence of taxpayer.
If the taxpayer dies or ceases to exist, the portion of the increase in tax determined under subparagraph (3)(v) of this paragraph which has not been taken into account under subdivision (i) or (ii) of this subparagraph for taxable years prior to the taxable year of the occurrence of such death or such cessation of existence, as the case may be, shall be taken into account for the taxable year in which such death or such cessation of existence, as the case may be, occurs.
(5)
Adjustments to basis of aggregated property.
If the taxpayer elects to form an aggregated property or properties under section 614(c)(1) for a taxable year and if a recomputation of tax is required to be made for any taxable
year which results in reduction of the depletion allowance previously deducted by the taxpayer for such year, then proper adjustments shall be made with respect to the adjusted basis of such aggregated property or properties. In such a case:
(i) If the sum of the depletion allowances actually deducted with respect to the interests included in a constructed aggregated property exceeds the depletion allowance computed under subparagraph (3)(ii) of this paragraph with respect to such constructed aggregated property, the adjusted basis of the aggregated property formed under section 614(c)(1) shall be increased by such excess, and
(ii) If the depletion allowance computed under subparagraph (3)(ii) of this paragraph with respect to a constructed aggregated property exceeds the sum of the depletion allowances actually deducted with respect to the interests included in such constructed aggregated property, the adjusted basis of the aggregated property formed under section 614(c)(1) shall be reduced (but not below zero) by such excess.
However, the adjusted basis of an aggregated property formed under section 614(c)(1) may be increased only to the extent such excess would have resulted in an increase in such adjusted basis if taken into account under paragraph (a) of § 1.614-6. Thus, if depletion previously allowed with respect to the separate operating mineral interests included in the aggregation formed under section 614(c)(1) exceeds the total of the unadjusted bases of such interests by $5,000, and if the recomputation of tax required to be made under this paragraph results in a depletion allowance which is $7,000 less than the depletion actually deducted with respect to such interests, then the adjusted basis of such aggregation may be increased by only $2,000. If, with respect to the same aggregated property formed under section 614(c)(1), adjustments to adjusted basis are required under this subparagraph as a result of recomputation of tax for two or more taxable years, the total or net amount of such adjustments shall be taken into account. Any adjustment to the adjusted basis of an aggregation required by this subparagraph shall be taken into account as of the effective date of the election to form such aggregation under section 614(c)(1) and shall be effective for all purposes of subtitle A of the Code. For other rules relating to the determination of the adjusted basis of an aggregated property, see paragraph (a) of § 1.614-6.
[T.D. 6524, 26 FR 150, Jan. 10, 1961, as amended by T.D. 7170, 37 FR 5382, Mar. 15, 1972; T.D. 7564, 43 FR 40494, Sept. 12, 1978]
§ 1.614-4
Treatment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 with respect to separate operating mineral interests for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1964, in the case of oil and gas wells.
(a)
General rule.
(1) All references in this section to section 614(b) or any paragraph or subparagraph thereof are references to section 614(b) or a paragraph or subparagraph thereof as it existed prior to its amendment by section 226(a) of the Revenue Act of 1964. All references in this section to section 614(d) are references to section 614(d) as it existed prior to its amendment by section 226(b)(3) of the Revenue Act of 1964.
(2) For taxable years beginning before January 1, 1964, in the case of oil and gas wells, a taxpayer may treat under section 614(d) and this section any property as if section 614 (a) and (b) had not been enacted. For purposes of this section, the term
property
means each separate operating mineral interest owned by the taxpayer in each mineral deposit in each separate tract or parcel of land. Separate tracts or parcels of land exist not only when areas of land are separated geographically, but also when areas of land are separated by means of the execution of conveyances or leases. If the taxpayer treats any property or properties under this section, the taxpayer must treat each such property as a separate property except that the taxpayer may treat any two or more properties that are included within the same tract or parcel of land as a single property provided such treatment is consistently followed. If the taxpayer treats two or more properties as a single property under this section, such properties shall be considered as a single property
for all purposes of subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954. The taxpayer may not make more than one combination of properties within the same tract or parcel of land. Thus, if the taxpayer treats two or more properties that are included within the same tract or parcel of land as a single property, each of the remaining properties included within such tract or parcel of land shall be treated as a separate property. If the taxpayer has treated two or more properties that are included within the same tract or parcel of land as a single property and subsequently discovers or acquires an additional mineral deposit within the same tract or parcel of land, he may include his interest in such deposit with the two or more properties which are being treated as a single property or he may treat his interest in such deposit as a separate property. If the taxpayer has treated each property included within a tract or parcel of land as a separate property and subsequently discovers or acquires an additional mineral deposit within the same tract or parcel of land, he may combine his interest in such deposit with any one of the separate properties included within the tract or parcel of land, but not with more than one of them since they cannot be validly combined with each other. The taxpayer may not combine properties which are included within different tracts or parcels of land under this section irrespective of whether such tracts or parcels of land are contiguous. The treatment of a property as a separate property or the treatment of two or more properties included within a single tract or parcel of land as a single property under this section shall be binding upon the taxpayer for the first taxable year for which such treatment is effective and for all subsequent taxable years beginning before January 1, 1964. For the continuation of such treatment under § 1.614-8 for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1963, see paragraph (d) of § 1.614-8. For provisions relating to the first taxable year for which treatment under this section becomes effective, see paragraph (d) of this section.
(b)
Treatment consistent with treatment for taxable years prior to 1954.
If the taxpayer has treated properties in a manner consistent with the rules contained in paragraph (a) of this section for taxable years to which the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 applies and if the taxpayer desires to treat such properties under section 614(d), then such properties must continue to be treated in the same manner. The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
In 1950, taxpayer A owned two separate tracts of land designated No. 1 and No. 2. Each tract contained three mineral deposits. In the case of tract No. 1, taxpayer A treated the three mineral deposits as a single property. In the case of tract No. 2, taxpayer A treated the first mineral deposit as a separate property and treated the second and third mineral deposits as a single property. This treatment was consistently followed for the taxable years 1950, 1951, 1952, and 1953. Taxpayer A desires, for 1954 and subsequent taxable years, to treat the properties in tracts Nos. 1 and 2 as if section 614 (a) and (b) had not been enacted. For 1954 and subsequent taxable years, the three deposits in tract No. 1 must be treated as a single property; the first deposit in tract No. 2 must be treated as a separate property; and the second and third deposits in tract No. 2 must be treated as a single property.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in example 1 except that, at the time the treatment under this section is adopted, assessment of any deficiency or credit or refund of any overpayment for the taxable years 1954 and 1955 resulting from the treatment of properties under this section is prevented by the operation of the statute of limitations. For 1956 and subsequent taxable years, the three deposits in tract No. 1 must be treated as a single property; the first deposit in tract No. 2 must be treated as a separate property; and the second and third deposits in tract No. 2 must be treated as a single property.
(c)
Bases of separate properties previously included in an aggregation under section 614(b).
If the taxpayer has made an election under section 614(b) to form an aggregation of operating mineral interests and if such taxpayer subsequently revokes such election for all taxable years for which it was made and treats the properties that are included within such aggregation under section 614(d) and this section by filing the statement required by paragraph (e) of this section, then the adjusted basis of each separate property (as defined in paragraph (a) of this section) that is a part of such aggregation shall
be determined as if the taxpayer had made no election under section 614(b). However, if, at the time of the filing of the statement revoking the election under section 614(b), assessment of any deficiency or credit or refund of any overpayment, as the case may be, resulting from such revocation is prevented by the operation of any law or rule of law for any taxable year or years for which the election under section 614(b) was made, then the adjusted basis of each separate property that is a part of the aggregation shall be determined in accordance with the provisions contained in paragraph (a)(2) of § 1.614.6 as of the first day of the first taxable year for which the revocation is effective. After determining the adjusted basis of each separate property included within the aggregation, the taxpayer may treat such properties in any manner which is in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section. See, however, paragraph (b) of this section. The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
Taxpayer A owns two separate tracts of land, designated No. 1 and No. 2, each of which contains three mineral deposits. The interests in the two tracts of land constitute an operating unit as defined in paragraph (c) of § 1.614-2. Taxpayer A elects under section 614(b) to form an aggregation of all the interests in the operating unit for 1954 and all subsequent taxable years. Subsequently, taxpayer A revokes such election by filing a statement in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section. Such revocation is effective for 1956 and subsequent taxable years because, at the time of the filing of the statement of revocation, assessment of any deficiency or credit or refund of any overpayment for the taxable years 1954 and 1955 resulting from such revocation is prevented by the operation of the statute of limitations. The adjusted bases of the six properties that are included within the aggregation shall be determined in accordance with paragraph (a)(2) of § 1.614-6 as of the beginning of the taxable year 1956.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in example 1 and, in addition, assume that for taxable years to which the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 is applicable, taxpayer A treated the three deposits in tract No. 1 as a single property and the three deposits in tract No. 2 as a single property. After determining the adjusted basis of each of the six properties as illustrated in example 1, the adjusted basis of the three properties in tract No. 1 must be combined and the adjusted bases of the three properties in tract No. 2 must be combined since the manner in which such properties were treated for taxable years to which the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 is applicable is consistent with the rules contained in paragraph (a) of this section.
(d)
Treatment; when effective.
If a taxpayer treats any property in accordance with this section, then such treatment shall be effective for whichever of the following taxable years is the later:
(1) The latest taxable year for which an election could have been made with respect to such property under section 614(b); or
(2) The first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1953, and ending after August 16, 1954, in respect of which assessment of a deficiency or credit or refund of an overpayment, as the case may be, resulting from the treatment of such property under this section, is not prevented by the operation of any law or rule of law on the date such treatment is adopted.
(e)
Manner of adopting the treatment of properties under this section.
If the taxpayer does not make an election under section 614(b) with respect to a property within the time prescribed for making such an election, then the taxpayer shall be deemed to have treated such property under this section. In such case, the manner in which such property is treated in filing the taxpayer's income tax return for the first taxable year for which the treatment of such property is effective under paragraph (d) of this section shall establish the treatment which must be consistently followed with respect to such property for subsequent taxable years. However, if the income tax return for such first taxable year is filed prior to May 1, 1961, then the taxpayer may adopt the treatment provided for under this section with respect to the property by filing a statement at any time on or before May 1, 1961, with the district director for the district in which the taxpayer's income tax return was filed for the first taxable year for which the treatment of such property is effective under paragraph (d) of this section. Such statement shall set forth the first taxable year for which the treatment of the property under this section is effective, shall revoke any previous elections made with respect to
such property under section 614(b), shall state the manner in which such property was treated for taxable years subject to the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, shall state the manner in which such property is to be treated under this section, and shall be accompanied by an amended return or returns if necessary.
(f)
Certain treatment under this section precludes election to aggregate under section 614(b) with respect to the same operating unit.
If the taxpayer's treatment of any properties that are included within an operating unit (as defined in paragraph (c) of § 1.614-2) under section 614(d) and this section would constitute an aggregation under section 614(b) and if such taxpayer elects, or has elected, to form an aggregation within the same operating unit under section 614(b) for any taxable year for which the treatment under section 614(d) is effective, then the election made under section 614(b) shall not apply for any such taxable year.
[T.D. 6524, 26 FR 157, Jan. 10, 1961, as amended by T.D. 6859, 30 FR 13700, Oct. 28, 1965]
§ 1.614-5
Special rules as to aggregating nonoperating mineral interests.
(a)
Aggregating nonoperating mineral interests for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1958.
Upon proper showing to the Commissioner, a taxpayer who owns two or more separate nonoperating mineral interests in a single tract or parcel of land, or in two or more contiguous tracts or parcels of land, shall be permitted to aggregate all such interests in each separate kind of mineral deposit and treat them as one property. Permission will be granted by the Commissioner only if the taxpayer establishes that he will sustain an undue hardship if such nonoperating mineral interests are not treated as one property. Such hardship may exist, for example, if it is impossible for the taxpayer to determine the boundaries, source, or costs of the separate interests, or if a taxpayer who owns a single royalty interest, production payment, or net profits interest cannot determine the separate deposits from which his payments will be derived. In no event shall undue hardship be deemed to exist solely by reason of tax disadvantage. The treatment of such interests as one property shall be applicable for all purposes of subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954. In no event may nonoperating mineral interests in tracts or parcels of land which are not contiguous be treated as one property. The term
two or more contiguous tracts or parcels of land
means tracts or parcels of land which have common boundaries. Common boundaries include survey lines, public roads, or similar easements for the use of land without the existence of an intervening mineral right between the tracts or parcels of land. Tracts or parcels of land which touch only at a common corner are not contiguous. For the definition of
nonoperating mineral interests,
see paragraph (g) of this section.
(b)
Manner and scope of election
—(1)
Time for filing application for permission to aggregate separate nonoperating mineral interests under paragraph (a) of this section.
The application for permission to aggregate separate nonoperating mineral interests under paragraph (a) of this section shall be filed at any time on or before May 1, 1961. Such application shall indicate the first taxable year for which the aggregation is to be formed. If, prior to January 10, 1961, an application has been filed, the taxpayer need file only a supplemental application containing such additional information as is necessary to comply with the requirements of subparagraph (2) of this paragraph.
(2)
Contents of application and returns under permission.
The application for permission to aggregate nonoperating mineral interests under paragraph (a) of this section shall include a complete statement of the facts upon which the taxpayer relies to show the undue hardship which would result if such an aggregation was not permitted. Such application shall also include a description of the nonoperating mineral interests owned by the taxpayer within the tract or tracts of land involved. A general description, accompanied by maps appropriately marked, which accurately circumscribes the scope of the aggregation and shows that the taxpayer is aggregating all the nonoperating mineral interests in a particular kind of mineral deposit within the tract or tracts of land involved will
be sufficient. If the Commissioner grants permission, a copy of the letter granting such permission shall be filed with the district director for the district in which the taxpayer's income tax return was filed for the first taxable year for which such permission applies, and shall be accompanied by an amended return or returns if necessary.
(3)
Election; binding effect.
The election to aggregate separate nonoperating mineral interests under paragraph (a) of this section shall be binding upon the taxpayer for the first taxable year for which made and all subsequent taxable years beginning before January 1, 1958, unless consent to make a change is obtained from the Commissioner. The application for consent to make a change must set forth in detail the reason or reasons for such change. Consent to a different treatment shall not be granted where the principal purpose for such change is due to tax consequences. For rules relating to the binding effect of an election where the basis of an aggregated property in the hands of the transferee is determined by reference to the basis in the hands of the transferor, see paragraph (c) of § 1.614-6.
(4)
Aggregations under the Internal Revenue Code of 1939.
An application for permission to aggregate nonoperating mineral interests under paragraph (a) of this section shall be submitted in accordance with the requirements of this paragraph notwithstanding the fact that the taxpayer may have aggregated such interests for taxable years to which the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 is applicable. If such interests were aggregated for taxable years to which the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 applies and the aggregation was approved by the Internal Revenue Service for such years after full consideration thereof on its merits, such approval will generally be accepted as evidence that undue hardship would result if the aggregation were not permitted.
(c)
Termination of aggregation of nonoperating mineral interests
—(1)
General rule.
Any aggregation of nonoperating mineral interests formed under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section shall not apply with respect to any taxable year beginning after December 31, 1957. Thus, if a taxpayer makes a binding election to form such an aggregation for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1958, then in order to form an aggregation with respect to any taxable year beginning after December 31, 1957, he must obtain permission in accordance with the rules prescribed in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section.
(2)
Bases of separate nonoperating mineral interests.
If a taxpayer forms an aggregation of nonoperating mineral interests under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section which is terminated under subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, the adjusted bases of the separate nonoperating mineral interests included in such aggregation shall be determined in accordance with paragraph (a)(2) of § 1.614-6.
(d)
Aggregating nonoperating mineral interests for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1957, or for earlier taxable years.
Upon proper showing to the Commissioner, a taxpayer who owns two or more separate nonoperating mineral interests in a single tract or parcel of land, or in two or more adjacent tracts or parcels of land, shall be permitted, under section 614(e), to form an aggregation of all of such interests in each separate kind of mineral deposit and treat such aggregation as one property. Permission shall be granted by the Commissioner only if the taxpayer establishes that a principal purpose in forming the aggregation is not the avoidance of tax. The fact that the aggregation of nonoperating mineral interests will result in a substantial reduction in tax is evidence that avoidance of tax is a principal purpose of the taxpayer. An aggregation formed under the provisions of this paragraph shall be considered as one property for all purposes of the Code. In no event may nonoperating mineral interests in tracts or parcels of land which are not adjacent be aggregated and treated as one property. The term
two or more adjacent tracts or parcels of land
means tracts or parcels of land that are in reasonably close proximity to each other depending on the facts and circumstances of each case. Adjacent tracts or parcels of land do not necessarily have any common boundaries, and may be separated by intervening mineral rights. For the definition of
nonoperating mineral interests,
see paragraph (g) of this section.
(e)
Manner and scope of election
—(1)
Time for filing application for permission to aggregate separate nonoperating mineral interests under section 614(e).
The application for permission to aggregate separate nonoperating mineral interests under section 614(e) and paragraph (d) of this section shall be made in writing to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, Washington, DC 20224. Such application shall be filed within 90 days after the beginning of the first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1957, for which aggregation is desired or within 90 days after the acquisition of one of the nonoperating mineral interests which is to be included in the aggregation, whichever is later. However, if the last day on which the application may be filed under this paragraph falls before May 1, 1961, such application may be filed at any time on or before May 1, 1961. If, prior to January 10, 1961, an application has been filed, the taxpayer need file only a supplemental application containing such additional information as is necessary to comply with subparagraph (4) of this paragraph.
(2)
Election to apply section 614(e) retroactively.
The application for permission to aggregate separate nonoperating mineral interests under section 614 (e) and paragraph (d) of this section may be filed, at the election of the taxpayer, for any taxable year beginning before January 1, 1958, to which the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 is applicable. In such case, the application may be filed at any time on or before May 1, 1961. Such application shall designate the first taxable year for which the aggregation is to be formed. If, prior to January 10, 1961, an application has been filed, the taxpayer need file only a supplemental application containing such additional information as is necessary to comply with the requirements of subparagraph (4) of this paragraph.
(3)
Limitation.
If the taxpayer forms any aggregation of nonoperating mineral interests under subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, then any aggregation of nonoperating mineral interests formed under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section shall not apply for any taxable year. The provisions of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
In 1954, taxpayer A owns six separate nonoperating mineral interests designated No. 1 through No. 6. Interests Nos. 1 through 3 are royalty interests in contiguous tracts of land. Interests Nos. 4 through 6, which are located in an entirely different area from interests Nos. 1 through 3, are royalty interests in tracts of land which are not contiguous but which are adjacent to each other. In 1959 taxpayer A obtains permission and elects under section 614(e) and subparagraph (2) of this paragraph to form an aggregation of interests Nos. 4 through 6 for 1956 and all subsequent taxable years. Taxpayer A may not elect to form an aggregation of interests Nos. 1 through 3 under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section for 1954 or any subsequent taxable year. If taxpayer A wishes to form an aggregation of interests Nos. 1 through 3, he must obtain permission under paragraph (d) of this section and this paragraph.
(4)
Contents of application and returns under permission.
The application for permission to aggregate nonoperating mineral interests under section 614(e) and paragraph (d) of this section shall include a complete statement of the facts upon which the taxpayer relies to show that avoidance of tax is not a principal purpose of forming the aggregation. Such application shall also include a description of the nonoperating mineral interests within the tract or tracts of land involved. A general description, accompanied by maps appropriately marked, which accurately circumscribes the scope of the aggregation and shows that the taxpayer is aggregating all the nonoperating mineral interests in a particular kind of mineral deposit within the tract or tracts of land involved will be sufficient. If the Commissioner grants permission, a copy of the letter granting such permission shall be attached to the taxpayer's income tax return for the first taxable year for which such permission applies. If the taxpayer has already filed such return, a copy of the letter of permission shall be filed with the district director for the district in which such return was filed and shall be accompanied by an amended return or returns if necessary or, if appropriate, a claim for credit or refund.
(5)
Election; binding effect.
The election to aggregate separate nonoperating mineral interests under section 614 (e) and paragraph (d) of this section shall be binding upon the taxpayer for the first taxable year for which made and for all subsequent taxable years unless consent to make a change is obtained from the Commissioner. The application for consent to make a change must set forth in detail the reason or reasons for such change. Consent to a different treatment shall not be granted where the principal purpose for such change is due to tax consequences. For rules relating to the binding effect of an election where the basis of an aggregated property in the hands of the transferee is determined by reference to the basis in the hands of the transferor, see paragraph (c) of § 1.614-6.
(6)
Aggregations under the Internal Revenue Code of 1939.
An application for permission to aggregate nonoperating mineral interests under section 614 (e) and paragraph (d) of this section shall be submitted in accordance with the requirements of this paragraph notwithstanding the fact that the taxpayer may have aggregated such interests for taxable years to which the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 is applicable. If such interests were aggregated for taxable years to which the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 applies and the aggregation was approved by the Internal Revenue Service for such years after full consideration thereof on its merits, such approval will generally be accepted as evidence that avoidance of tax is not a principal purpose of forming the aggregation.
(f)
Elections; when effective.
If the taxpayer has elected to form an aggregation under either paragraph (a) or paragraph (d) of this section, the date on which the aggregation becomes effective is the first day of the first taxable year for which the election is made; except that if any separate nonoperating mineral interest included in such aggregation was acquired after such first day, the date on which the inclusion of such interest in such aggregation becomes effective is the date of its acquisition.
(g)
Definition of nonoperating mineral interests.
For purposes of this section,
nonoperating mineral interests
includes only those interests described in section 614(a) which are not operating mineral interests within the meaning of paragraph (b) of § 1.614-2. The taxpayer who holds the operating or working rights in a mineral deposit, but is not actually conducting operations with respect to such deposit, does not have a nonoperating mineral interest in such deposit notwithstanding the fact that he intends to transfer such operating rights at a later time.
[T.D. 6524, 26 FR 158, Jan. 10, 1961]
§ 1.614-6
Rules applicable to basis, holding period, and abandonment losses where mineral interests have been aggregated or combined.
(a)
Basis of property resulting from aggregation or combination
—(1)
General rule.
(i) When a taxpayer has aggregated as one property two or more interests under section 614(b) (prior to its amendment by section 226(a) of the Revenue Act of 1964), (c), or (e), the unadjusted basis of such aggregated property shall be the sum of the unadjusted bases of the various mineral interests aggregated. The adjusted basis of the aggregated property on the effective date of the aggregation shall be the unadjusted basis of the aggregated property, adjusted by the total of all adjustments to the bases of the several mineral interests aggregated as required by section 1016 to the effective date of aggregation. Thereafter, the adjustments to basis required by section 1016 shall apply to the total adjusted basis of the aggregated property for all purposes of subtitle A of the Code.
(ii) When a taxpayer has combined as one property two or more interests under section 614(b) (as amended by section 226(a) of the Revenue Act of 1964), the adjusted basis of such combined property shall be the sum of:
(
a
) The unadjusted bases of all such interests which have never been included in an aggregation; and
(
b
) The adjusted bases of all such interests which at some time have been included in an aggregation, as of the date on which they ceased to participate in an aggregation
adjusted by the total of all adjustments to the bases of the several mineral interests combined, as required by section 1016,
(
c
) In the case of interests described in (
a
), for the entire period of the taxpayer's ownership of such interest; and
(
d
) In the case of interests described in (
b
), for the period, if any, between the time of deaggregation and the time of combination.
Thereafter, the adjustments to basis required by section 1016 shall apply to the total adjusted basis of the combined property for all purposes of subtitle A of the Code.
(2)
Bases upon disposition of part of, or termination of, or change in, an aggregated or combined property
—(i)
In general.
(
a
) When a taxpayer has aggregated or combined two or more separate mineral interests as one property under section 614(b) (either before or after its amendment by section 226(a) of the Revenue Act of 1964), (c), or (e) and thereafter sells, exchanges, or otherwise disposes of part of such property, the total adjusted basis of the property as of the date of sale, exchange, or other disposition shall be apportioned to determine the adjusted basis of the part disposed of and the part retained for purposes of computing gain or loss, depletion and for all other purposes of subtitle A of the Code. Such adjusted basis shall be determined by apportioning the total adjusted basis of the property between the part of the property disposed of and the part retained in the same proportion as the fair market value of each part (as of the date of sale, exchange, or other disposition) bears to the total fair market value of the property as of such date. For determining gain or loss on the sale or exchange of any part of the aggregated or combined property, the adjusted basis of the aggregated or combined property (from which the adjusted basis of the part is determined) shall not be reduced below zero.
(
b
) If, for any taxable year after the first taxable year for which an aggregation under section 614(b) (prior to its amendment by section 226(a) of the Revenue Act of 1964), (c), or (e) is effective:
(
1
) Any such aggregation is terminated for any reason other than the expiration of an aggregation by reason of section 614(b) as amended by section 226(a) of the Revenue Act of 1964 (see subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph), or
(
2
) The treatment of any mineral interests in any such aggregation is changed after obtaining the consent of the Commissioner
then the adjusted basis of the aggregated property as of the first day of the first taxable year for which such termination or change is effective shall be apportioned to determine the adjusted bases of the resultant separate mineral interests, as of such first day, for purposes of computing gain or loss, depletion, and for all other purposes of subtitle A of the Code. The adjusted bases of such separate mineral interests shall be determined by apportioning the adjusted basis of the aggregated property (as of the first day of the first taxable year for which such termination or change is effective) between or among such interests in the same proportion as the fair market value of each such interest (as of such first day) bears to the total fair market value of the aggregated property as of such first day. For the purpose of determining the adjusted bases of the separate mineral interests, the adjusted basis of the aggregated property (from which the adjusted basis of each separate mineral interest is determined) shall not be reduced below zero.
(ii)
Allocation of basis of aggregation of operating mineral interests in oil and gas wells as of the first day of the first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1963—(a) Fair market value method.
Unless the taxpayer elects to use the allocation of adjustments method of determining basis provided in (b) of this subdivision (ii), the adjusted basis as of the first day of the first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1963, of each interest which was participating in an aggregation of operating mineral interests on the day preceding such first day shall be determined by multiplying the adjusted basis of the aggregation by a fraction the numerator of which is the fair market value of such interest and the denominator of which is the fair market value of such aggregation. For purposes of this subdivision (
a
), the adjusted basis and the fair market value of the aggregation, and the fair market value of such interest, shall be determined as of the day preceding the first
day of the first taxable year which begins after December 31, 1963. Unless the taxpayer elects to use the allocation of adjustments method, he shall obtain accurate and reliable information, and keep records with respect thereto, establishing all facts necessary for making the computation prescribed in this subdivision (
a
). See example 5 of subparagraph (3) of this paragraph.
(
b) Allocation of adjustments method. (i
) The taxpayer may elect to determine basis by an allocation of adjustments in lieu of the fair market value method prescribed in (
a
) of this subdivision (ii). In such a case, the adjusted basis (as of the first day of the first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1963) of each interest which was participating in an aggregation of operating mineral interests on the day preceding such first day is the unadjusted basis of such interest immediately after its acquisition by the taxpayer, adjusted by the total of all adjustments to its basis as required by section 1016 to the effective date of aggregation, and by that portion of those section 1016 adjustments to the basis of the aggregation which is reasonably attributable to such interest. For this purpose, two or more interests which are being combined upon deaggregation shall be treated as one interest. An adjustment to the basis of the aggregation is reasonably attributable to such interest to the extent that the adjustment thereto resulted from inclusion of the interest in the aggregation, even though such interest would not have been entitled to the adjustment to the same extent if such interest had been treated separately because of the 50 percent of taxable income limitation or for any other reason. In a case in which the amount of a percentage depletion deduction which was allowed with respect to an aggregation was limited by the 50 percent of taxable income limitation of section 613(a), the portion of such amount which is attributable to each of the interests in the aggregation shall be determined by multiplying such amount by a fraction, the numerator of which is the gross income from such interest and the denominator of which is the gross income from the aggregation. The determination as to which property a particular adjustment is attributable may be based upon records of production or any other facts which establish the reasonableness of the determination. See example 6 of subparagraph (3) of this paragraph.
(
ii
) If, under the adjustment described in (
i
) of this subdivision (
b
), the total of the adjusted bases of the interests which were included in the aggregation exceeds the adjusted basis of the aggregation, the adjusted bases of the interests shall be further adjusted so that the total of the adjusted bases of the interests equals the adjusted basis of the aggregation. This further adjustment shall be made by reducing the basis of each interest (other than an interest having a basis of zero) by an amount which is determined by multiplying such excess by a fraction, the numerator of which is the adjusted basis of such interest after making the adjustment described in (
i
) of this subdivision (
b
) and the denominator of which is the total of the adjusted bases of all such interests after making the adjustment described in (
i
) of this subdivision (
b
). See example 6 of subparagraph (3) of this paragraph.
(
iii
) The election provided for in this subdivision (
b
) shall be made not later than the time prescribed by law for filing the taxpayer's income tax return (including extensions thereof) for the first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1963, and shall be made in a statement attached to such return.
(3) The application of subparagraphs (1) and (2) of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
A taxpayer owning three operating mineral interests, designated Nos. 1, 2, and 3, within a single operating unit, properly elects to aggregate such properties under section 614(b) for the calendar year 1954 in his income tax return filed on April 15, 1955. The unadjusted bases and adjustments under section 1016 for depletion through December 31, 1953, in respect of such properties are as follows:
Unadjusted basis
Adjustments under Section 1016
No. 1
$25,000
$27,000
No. 2
18,000
10,000
No. 3
15,000
4,000
Total
58,000
41,000
The adjusted basis of the aggregated property as of January 1, 1954, is $17,000 ($58,000-$41,000).

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in example 1, except that a portion of the aggregated property is sold on June 1, 1956, for $15,000 which is also the fair market value of such portion on the date of sale. In order to determine the gain or loss from this sale as well as the adjusted basis of the retained property, an apportionment must be made. The aggregated property had a fair market value of $25,000 on the date of sale. From January 1, 1954, through May 31, 1956, $10,000 of depletion has been allowed with respect to the aggregated property. The adjusted basis of the portion sold is determined as follows:
EC08OC91.019
Therefore, the gain on this sale of the portion sold is $10,800 ($15,000-$4,200). The adjusted basis of the property retained is $2,800 ($7,000-$4,200).

# Example 3.
Assume the same facts as in example 2, except that instead of selling, the taxpayer subleases one of the leases making up the aggregated property, retaining a one-eighth royalty interest therein. The fair market value of such lease is $15,000 on the date of the sublease. The adjusted basis of such royalty interest is $4,200 which is computed as follows:
EC08OC91.020

# Example 4.
In 1953, a taxpayer owned mineral interests Nos. 1, 2, and 3 which he operated as a unit. He owned no other operating interests during that year. The unadjusted bases of these properties were $10,000, $15,000, and $20,000, respectively, and depletion allowed through December 31, 1953, was $5,000 with respect to each property. The taxpayer operated these properties during the year 1954 and, in addition, operated as part of the unit mineral interest No. 4 which he acquired on July 1, 1954, on which date he made the first exploration expenditure with respect thereto. He paid $20,000 for No. 4. In his return for the calendar year 1954, the taxpayer elected under section 614(b) to aggregate all of these mineral interests. The taxpayer must compute cost depletion for the calendar year 1954 on the basis of an aggregated property with an adjusted basis of $30,000 ($45,000-$15,000) for the period from January 1 to June 30, and with an adjusted basis of $50,000 (less depletion for the first six months) for the period from July 1 to December 31. If applicable, the taxpayer must compute percentage depletion on the basis of gross income and taxable income from the aggregated property for the entire year, including the gross income and deductions with respect to operating mineral interest No. 4 for the period from July 1 to December 31. If a portion of the aggregated property is sold during the first six months, its adjusted basis must be determined at the time of sale with an adjustment for depletion to the date of sale. If percentage depletion is applicable, it must be allocated on an equitable basis to the periods prior and subsequent to the date of sale in order to determine the adjustment for depletion to the date of sale.

# Example 5.
A taxpayer owns two operating mineral interests in oil wells, designated Nos. 1 and 2, in tract A, and another such interest, designated No. 3, in tract B. All three interests are in the same operating unit (as defined in paragraph (c) of § 1.614-2). The taxpayer, who is on a calendar year basis, has properly elected under § 1.614-2 to aggregate such interests for the calendar years 1954 through 1963. The unadjusted bases and adjustments under section 1016 for depletion through December 31, 1953, in respect of such interests are as follows:
Unadjusted basis
Adjustments under section 1016
No. 1
$42,000
$11,000
No. 2
37,000
4,000
No. 3
19,000
23,000
Total
98,000
38,000
The adjusted basis of the aggregated property as of January 1, 1954, is therefore $60,000
($98,000 minus $38,000). The taxpayer properly elects under section 614(b) and § 1.614-8 to treat Nos. 1 and 2 as separate properties for the calendar year 1964 and thereafter and does not elect to use the allocation of adjustments method of determining basis provided in subparagraph (2) (ii) (
b
) of this paragraph. No. 3 will be treated as a separate property, also, because it is in a different tract than the taxpayer's other interests. From January 1, 1954, through December 31, 1963, $50,000 of depletion has been allowed with respect to the aggregated property, leaving an adjusted basis of $10,000 ($60,000 minus $50,000) on January 1, 1964. On December 31, 1963, the aggregated property has a fair market value of $40,000. Nos. 1, 2, and 3 have fair market values of $16,000, $22,000, and $2,000, respectively. Accordingly, the adjusted bases of Nos. 1, 2, and 3 on January 1, 1964, are $4,000,
EC08OC91.021
$5,500 [$10,000 × (22,000/40,000)], and
$500 [$10,000 × (2,000/40,000)] respectively.

# Example 6.
A taxpayer owns four operating mineral interests in oil wells, designated Nos. 1, 2, 3, and 4. All four interests are in the same operating unit and the same tract or parcel of land. The taxpayer, who is on a calendar year basis, has properly elected under § 1.614-2 to aggregate such interests for the calendar years 1954 through 1963. The taxpayer properly elects under section 614(b) and paragraph (a) of § 1.614-8 to treat Nos. 1 and 2 as separate properties for the calendar year 1964 and thereafter. The taxpayer also properly elects to use the allocation of adjustments method of determining basis as provided in subparagraph (2) (ii) (
b
) of this paragraph. The unadjusted bases of Nos. 1, 2, and combined 3 and 4, the adjustments attributable to each, and the deaggregated basis of each (prior to further adjustment as provided in subparagraph (2) (ii) (
b)(ii
) of this paragraph) are as follows:
Basis upon acquisition
Adjustments to time of aggregation
Attributable adjustments during aggregation
Basis upon deaggregation after first adjustment
No. 1
$35,000
$1,000
$16,000
$18,000
No. 2
30,000
11,000
23,000
0
No. 3
25,000
3,000
5,000
No. 4
10,000
12,000
9,000
6,000
Total
100,000
27,000
53,000
24,000
The total of the adjusted bases (prior to further adjustment) of the interests which were included in the aggregation is $24,000 while the adjusted basis of the aggregation is $20,000 ($100,000 minus the sum of $27,000 and $53,000). Therefore, the adjusted bases of the interests are further reduced by $4,000 ($24,000 minus $20,000). The adjusted basis of No. 1 of $18,000 is further reduced by $3,000 [$4,000 × (18,000 ÷ 24,000)] to $15,000. Similarly, the adjusted basis of combined Nos. 3 and 4 of $6,000 is further reduced by $1,000 [$4,000 × (6,000 ÷ 24,000)] to $5,000. Assume further that the taxpayer also owns interest No. 5 in the same tract or parcel of land, that such interest was not a part of any aggregation, that such interest had a basis of $15,000 upon acquisition and had subsequent adjustments in reduction of basis totalling $17,000, and that the taxpayer does not elect to treat such interest as a separate property. In such case, Nos. 3, 4, and 5 will be combined. The combination will have an adjusted basis of $3,000, determined by adding the unadjusted basis of No. 5 ($15,000) and the adjusted bases of combined Nos. 3 and 4 upon deaggregation ($5,000), and subtracting from the total thereof ($20,000) the adjustments to No. 5 ($17,000).
(4)
Basis for gain and loss where mineral interests acquired before March 1, 1913, are included in an aggregation.
Where mineral interests acquired before March 1, 1913, are included in an aggregation under section 614 (b), (c), or (e), the aggregated property has two bases, one for the determination of gain and another for the determination of loss upon the disposition of the whole or a part of the aggregated property. For the purpose of determining gain, the adjusted basis of the aggregated property on the effective date of aggregation shall be the sum of:
(i) The unadjusted bases of those mineral interests acquired on or after March 1, 1913, plus
(ii) The cost of any interest acquired before March 1, 1913 (adjusted for the period before March 1, 1913), or the fair market value of such interest as of March 1, 1913, whichever is greater
and such sum shall be adjusted by the total of all adjustments to the bases of the several mineral interests aggregated as required by section 1016 to the effective date of aggregation. For the purpose of determining loss, the adjusted basis of the aggregated property on the effective date of aggregation shall be the sum of:
(iii) The unadjusted bases of those mineral interests acquired on or after March 1, 1913, plus
(iv) The cost of those interests acquired before March 1, 1913, adjusted for the period before March 1, 1913
and such sum shall be adjusted by the total of all adjustments to the bases of the several mineral interests aggregated as required by section 1016 to the effective date of aggregation. Thereafter, the adjustments to basis required by section 1016 shall apply to the total adjusted basis of the aggregated property for all purposes of the Code. Upon disposition of a part of the aggregated property, or upon termination of the aggregation for any reason, or upon change in the treatment of any mineral interests in the aggregation with consent of the Commissioner, the adjusted basis for determining gain and the adjusted basis for determining loss with respect to each resultant part of the aggregated property shall be determined in accordance with subparagraph (2) of this paragraph. The provisions of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
At the close of 1953 a taxpayer owned two operating mineral interests designated as Nos. 1 and 2 in the same operating unit. Operating mineral interest No. 1 was acquired by the taxpayer before March 1, 1913, and on such date its basis with reference to its fair market value was $50,000 and its adjusted basis with reference to its cost was $44,000. The unadjusted basis of operating mineral interest No. 2, acquired after March 1, 1913, was $30,000. Adjustments under section 1016 for depletion from March 1, 1913, through December 31, 1953, were $37,000 for operating mineral interest No. 1 and $20,000 for operating mineral interest No. 2. Assume that the taxpayer elected for the taxable year 1954 to aggregate operating mineral interests Nos. 1 and 2. The adjusted basis of the aggregated property as of January 1, 1954, for the purpose of determining gain would be $23,000 ($50,000 plus $30,000) minus ($37,000 plus $20,000). For the purpose of determining loss, the adjusted basis would be $17,000 ($44,000 plus $30,000) minus ($37,000 plus $20,000).

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in example 1 and further assume that for the taxable years 1954 and 1955, the taxpayer was allowed $5,000 of depletion on the aggregated property, that on January 1, 1956, he sold a portion of the aggregated property for $20,000, and that, as of January 1, 1956, the aggregated property had a fair market value of $24,000. At the time of sale, the adjusted basis of the aggregated property for the purpose of determining gain was $18,000 ($23,000-$5,000); and the adjusted basis for the purpose of determining loss was $12,000 ($17,000-$5,000). The adjusted basis of the portion sold would be computed as follows:
EC08OC91.022
Taxpayer's gain would then be computed as follows:
EC08OC91.023
The adjusted basis of the portion retained as of January 1, 1956, for the purpose of determining gain is $3,000 ($18,000-$15,000). For the purpose of determining loss, the adjusted basis is $2,000 ($12,000-$10,000).

# Example 3.
Assume the same facts as in example 2, except that a portion of the aggregated property was sold for $5,000 and that the fair market value of the aggregated property at the time of sale was $10,000. The adjusted basis of the portion sold would be computed as follows:
EC08OC91.024
Taxpayers loss would then be computed as follows:
EC08OC91.025
(5)
Basis for gain and loss where mineral interests acquired before March 1, 1913, are included in a combination and one or more of such interests have not previously been included in an aggregation.
Where mineral interests acquired before March 1, 1913, are included in a combination under section 614(b) and § 1.614-8 and one or more of such interests have not previously been included in an aggregation, the combined property has two bases, one for the determination of gain and another for the determination of loss upon the disposition of the whole or a part of the combined property. For the purpose of determining gain, the adjusted basis of the combined property on the effective date of combination shall be the sum of:
(i) The adjusted bases at the time of deaggregation, as determined under subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, of all interests which have previously been included in an aggregation,
(ii) The unadjusted bases of other mineral interests acquired on or after March 1, 1913, and
(iii) The cost of each other interest acquired before March 1, 1913 (adjusted for the period before March 1, 1913), or the fair market value of such interest as of March 1, 1913, whichever is greater
and such sum shall be adjusted by the total of all adjustments to the bases of the mineral interests as required by section 1016 to the effective date of combination. For the purpose of determining loss, the adjusted basis of the combined property on the effective date of combination shall be the sum of:
(iv) The adjusted bases at the time of deaggregation, as determined under subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, of all interests which have previously been included in an aggregation.
(v) The unadjusted bases of other mineral interests acquired on or after March 1, 1913, and
(vi) The cost of other mineral interests acquired before March 1, 1913, adjusted for the period before March 1, 1913
and such sum shall be adjusted by the total of all adjustments to the bases of the mineral interests as required by section 1016 to the effective date of combination. Thereafter, the adjustments to basis required by section 1016 shall apply to the total adjusted basis of the combined property for all purposes of the Code. Upon disposition of a part of the combined property, the adjusted basis for determining gain and the adjusted basis for determining loss with respect to each resultant part of the combined property shall be determined in accordance with subparagraph (2) of this paragraph.
(b)
Holding period of aggregated or combined properties.
Where a taxpayer sells or exchanges either a part or all of an aggregated or combined property which includes part or all of a mineral interest which the taxpayer has held for (1 year 6 months for taxable years beginning before 1977; 9 months for taxable years beginning in 1977) or less, the
sales price and adjusted basis attributable to the interest sold must be apportioned in proportion to the relative fair market values as of the date of sale to determine the amount of income represented by the sale of property held for (1 year 6 months for taxable years beginning before 1977; 9 months for taxable years beginning in 1977) or less. The application of this rule may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
Taxpayer A owns operating mineral interests Nos. 1, 2, and 3. He acquired interests Nos. 1 and 2 in 1953 but purchased and made development expenditures on interest No. 3 on December 1, 1954. In his return for the taxable year 1954, taxpayer A elects to aggregate interests Nos. 1, 2, and 3 which are operated as a unit. On May 1, 1955, taxpayer A sells the north half of the aggregated property which includes portions of interests Nos. 1, 2, and 3. The sales price of the north half was $80,000; the adjusted basis of the aggregated property as of the date of sale was $20,000; and the fair market value of the aggregated property as of the date of sale was $100,000. The adjusted basis applicable to the north half is computed as follows:
EC08OC91.026
The total gain on the sale is $64,000 ($80,000−$16,000).
The gain attributable to the sale of the portion held for six months or less is computed as follows (assuming that the fair market value of the portion of No. 3 included in the sale as of the date of sale was $30,000):
EC08OC91.027
The gain on the portion of No. 3 sold is $24,000 ($30,000-$6,000).
(c)
Acquisition of property with transferor's basis.
If a separate property or an aggregated or combined property is acquired in a transaction in which the basis of such property in the hands of the taxpayer is determined by reference to the basis of such property in the hands of a transferor, then the election of such transferor as to the treatment of such separate, aggregated, or combined property shall be binding upon the taxpayer for all taxable years ending after the transfer unless, in the case of an aggregation, the aggregation terminates or consent to make a change is obtained under paragraph (d) (4) of § 1.614-2, paragraph (f) (7) of § 1.614-3, or paragraph (b) (3) or (e) (5) of § 1.614-5, whichever is applicable.
(d)
Abandonment and casualty losses.
In the case of mineral interests which are aggregated or combined as one property, no losses resulting from worthlessness or abandonment are allowable until all the mineral rights in the entire aggregated or combined property are proven to be worthless or until the entire aggregated or combined property is disposed of or abandoned. Casualty losses are allowable in accordance with the rules applicable to casualty losses in general. For rules applicable to losses in general, see section 165 and the regulations thereunder.
[T.D. 6524, 26 FR 159, Jan. 10, 1961, as amended by T.D. 6859, 30 FR 13701, Oct. 28, 1965; T.D. 7728, 45 FR 72650, Nov. 3, 1980]
§ 1.614-7
Extension of time for performing certain acts.
Sections 1.614-2 to 1.614-5, inclusive, require certain acts to be performed on or before May 1, 1961 (the first day of the first month which begins more than 90 days after the regulations under section 614 were published in the
Federal Register
as a Treasury decision). The district director may, upon good cause shown, extend for a period not exceeding 6 months the period within which such acts are to be performed, and shall, if the interests of the Government would otherwise be jeopardized thereby, grant such an extension only if the taxpayer and the district director agree in writing to a corresponding or greater extension of the period prescribed for the assessment of the tax, or in the case of taxable years described in section 614(c)(3)(E), the assessment of the tax resulting from the exercise or change in an election.

§ 1.614-8
Elections with respect to separate operating mineral interests for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1963, in the case of oil and gas wells.
(a)
Election to treat separate operating mineral interests as separate properties
—(1)
General rule.
If a taxpayer has more than one operating mineral interest in oil and gas wells in one tract or parcel of land, he may elect to treat one or more of such interests as separate properties for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1963. Any such interests with respect to which the taxpayer does not so elect shall be combined and treated as one property. Nonoperating mineral interests may not be included in such combination. There may be only one such combination in one tract or parcel. Any such combination of interests shall be considered as one property for all purposes of subtitle A of the Code for the period to which the election applies. The preceding sentence does not preclude the use of more than one account under a single method of computing depreciation or the use of more than one method of computing depreciation under section 167, if otherwise proper. Any reasonable and consistently applied method or methods of computing depreciation of the improvements made with respect to the separate interests which are combined may be continued in accordance with section 167 and the regulations thereunder. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, such an interest in one tract or parcel may not be combined with such an interest in another tract or parcel. For rules with respect to the allocation of the basis of an aggregation of separate operating mineral interests under this section among such interests as of the first day of the first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1963, see paragraph (a) (2) (ii) of § 1.614-6. For the definition of
operating mineral interest
see paragraph (b) of § 1.614-2.
(2)
Election in respect of newly discovered or acquired interest or interest ceasing to participate in cooperative or unit plan of operation.
(i) If the taxpayer makes an election under this paragraph in respect of an operating mineral interest in a tract or parcel of land and, after the taxable year for which such election is made, an additional operating mineral interest in the same tract or parcel is discovered or acquired by the taxpayer or is the subject of an election under this paragraph because it ceases to participate in a cooperative or unit plan of operation to which paragraph (b) of this section applies, the additional operating mineral interest shall be treated:
(
a
) If there is no combination of interests in such tract or parcel, as a separate property unless the taxpayer elects to combine it with another interest, or
(
b
) If there is a combination of interests in such tract or parcel, as part of such combination unless the taxpayer elects to treat it as a separate property.
(ii) The application of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
Prior to 1964 a taxpayer acquired, and incurred development expenditures with respect to, three operating mineral interests in oil, designated Nos. 1, 2, and 3. All three interests are in the same tract or parcel of land. For the taxable year 1964, the taxpayer elects to treat such interests as three separate properties. During the taxable year 1965,
the taxpayer discovers and incurs development costs with respect to a fourth operating mineral interest, No. 4, in the same tract of land. During the taxable year 1966, the taxpayer discovers and incurs development costs with respect to a fifth operating mineral interest, No. 5, in the same tract of land. If the taxpayer makes no election relative to No. 4 for 1965, such interest will thereafter be treated as a separate property. Alternatively, the taxpayer may make an election for 1965 to combine No. 4 with any one (and only one) of the three other interests and to treat such combination as one property. If, for example, he elects to combine No. 4 with No. 3, then in 1966, No. 5 will automatically become part of the combination of Nos. 3 and 4 if no election is made to treat it as a separate property. After the combination of Nos. 3 and 4 is formed, Nos. 1 and 2, which were acquired or discovered prior to the formation of the combination and which were not included in such combination within the time prescribed, may not be included in that or any other combination. However, see subparagraph (3) (iv) of this paragraph.
(3)
Manner and scope of election
—(i)
Election; when made.
Except as provided hereafter in this subdivision (i), any election under subparagraph (1) or (2) of this paragraph shall be made for each operating mineral interest not later than the time prescribed by law for filing the income tax return (including extensions thereof) for whichever of the following taxable years is later:
(
a
) The first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1963; or
(
b
) The first taxable year in which any expenditure for development or operation in respect of such operating mineral interest is made by the taxpayer after his acquisition of such interest
Notwithstanding the provisions of (
a
) and (
b
), if it is determined that the operating mineral interest in respect of which the election is to be made was, during what would otherwise be the entire effective period of the election insofar as it would apply to the appropriate taxable year determined under (
a
) and (
b
), participating in a cooperative or unit plan of operation to which section 614(b)(3) applies, the election shall be made not later than the time prescribed by law for filing the income tax return (including extensions thereof) for the taxable year in which the interest ceases to participate in the cooperative or unit plan. See subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph for provisions relating to the effective date of an election and paragraph (b) of this section for provisions relating to certain unitization or pooling arrangements. For purposes of this subparagraph, expenditures for development include any intangible drilling or development costs within the purview of section 263(c). Delay rentals are not considered as expenditures for development. For purposes of this subparagraph, the acquisition of an option to acquire an economic interest in minerals in place does not constitute the acquisition of a mineral interest.
(ii)
Election; how made.
Any election under this paragraph shall be made by a statement attached to the income tax return of the taxpayer for the first taxable year for which the election is made. This statement shall identify by name, code number, or other means the operating mineral interests within the same tract or parcel of land which the taxpayer is electing to treat as separate properties or in combination, as the case may be. The statement shall also identify by name, code number, or other means the tract or parcel and shall set forth the facts upon which its treatment as a single and entire tract or parcel is based. See paragraph (a) (3) of § 1.614-1. However, if the taxpayer is electing to treat all of his operating mineral interests in a tract or parcel as separate properties, a blanket election with respect to all of such interests in that tract or parcel which are owned by the taxpayer at the time the election is made will suffice and only the tract or parcel itself need be so identified. The taxpayer shall maintain and have available records and maps sufficient to clearly define the tract or parcel and all of the taxpayer's operating mineral interests therein.
(iii)
Election; when combination effective. (a
) If, by reason of the exercise or nonexercise of an election under this paragraph, a combination is formed of two or more operating mineral interests, all of which are owned and operated by a taxpayer on the first day of the first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1963, and are not participating in a cooperative or unit plan of
operation to which paragraph (b) of this section applies on such first day, the combination is effective on such first day.
(
b
) If, by reason of the exercise or nonexercise of an election under this paragraph, a combination of operating mineral interests not described in (
a
) of this subdivision (including a combination described in (
a
) to which another operating mineral interest is added) is formed, the date on which each operating mineral interest which is being combined by the taxpayer for the first time enters into the combination is the later of (
1
) the earliest date within the taxable year affected on which the taxpayer incurred any expenditure for development or operation of such interest at a time when such interest was not participating in a cooperative or unit plan of operation to which paragraph (b) of this section applies, or (
2
) the earliest date on which the taxpayer incurred any expenditure for development or operation of any other interest with which such interest is to be combined at a time when such other interest was not participating in a cooperative or unit plan of operation to which paragraph (b) of this section applies.
(
c
) The application of these provisions may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
In 1963, a taxpayer owned and operated mineral interests Nos. 1 and 2, both of which are in the same tract or parcel of land. Neither No. 1 nor No. 2 participates in a cooperative or unit plan of operation. The taxpayer, who is on a calendar year basis, continued to own and operate these interests during the year 1964, and made no election with respect to such interests in his income tax return for that year. As a result, Nos. 1 and 2 are combined as of January 1, 1964.

# Example 2.
Assume that the taxpayer described in example 1 discovered operating mineral interests Nos. 3 and 4 in the same tract or parcel of land as Nos. 1 and 2, that he made his first expenditures for the development of No. 3 on June 1, 1964, and of No. 4 on September 1, 1964, and that, in a timely return for 1964, he elected to treat No. 3 as a separate property and made no election with respect to No. 4. As a result, No. 3 is treated as a separate property and No. 4 joins the combination of Nos. 1 and 2 as of September 1, 1964.

# Example 3.
On March 1, 1964, a taxpayer acquired a tract or parcel of land containing operating mineral interests Nos. 1 and 2. The taxpayer made his first operating expenditures on No. 1 on April 1, 1964. On October 1, 1964, the taxpayer made his first development expenditures with respect to operating mineral interest No. 2. The taxpayer made no election with respect to these interests. As a result, Nos. 1 and 2 enter into a combination as of October 1, 1964.
(iv)
Election; binding effect.
A valid election made under section 614(b) and this subparagraph shall be binding upon the taxpayer for the first taxable year for which made and for all subsequent taxable years. However, notwithstanding the preceding sentence, an election to treat one or more operating mineral interests as separate properties shall not prevent the making of a later election to combine a newly discovered or acquired operating mineral interest with one of such interests, if no other combination exists in the tract or parcel of land on the date when the later election would become effective under subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph. Nor will an election to treat an operating mineral interest as a separate property prevent its treatment with another interest as a single property under paragraph (b) of this section if such interest later participates in a cooperative or unit plan of operation to which paragraph (b) applies. For rules relating to the binding effect of an election in certain cases in which the basis of a separate or combined property in the hands of the transferee is determined by reference to the basis in the hands of the transferor, see paragraph (c) of § 1.614-6.
(b)
Certain unitization or pooling arrangements.
(1) Except as provided in this paragraph, if one or more of the taxpayer's operating mineral interests, or a part or parts thereof, participate, under a voluntary or compulsory unitization or pooling agreement as defined in subparagraph (6) of this paragraph, in a single cooperative or unit plan of operation, then for the period of such participation in taxable years beginning after December 31, 1963, such interest or interests, and part or parts thereof, included in such unit, shall be treated for purposes of subtitle A of the Code as one property, separate from the interest or interests, or part or parts thereof, not included in such unit.
(2) Subparagraph (1) of this paragraph shall apply to a voluntary agreement only if all the operating mineral interests covered by the agreement are in the same deposit or are in two or more deposits, the joint development or production of which is logical, without taking tax benefits into account, from the standpoint of geology, convenience, economy, or conservation, and which are in tracts or parcels of land which are contiguous or in close proximity. Operating mineral interests under a voluntary agreement to which subparagraph (1) does not apply are subject to the rules contained in paragraph (a) of this section. For purposes of this paragraph an agreement is voluntary unless required by the laws or rulings of any State or any agency of any State.
(3) Notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, if the taxpayer, for the last taxable year beginning before January 1, 1964, treated as separate properties two or more operating mineral interests which participate, under a voluntary or compulsory unitization or pooling agreement entered into in any taxable year beginning before January 1, 1964, in a single cooperative or unit plan of operation, and if it is determined that such treatment was proper under the law applicable to such taxable year, the taxpayer may continue to treat all such interests in a consistent manner for the period of such participation. If it is determined that such treatment was not proper under the law applicable to such taxable year, or if the taxpayer does not continue to treat all such interests in a manner consistent with the treatment of them for the last taxable year beginning before January 1, 1964, the treatment of the interests shall be in accordance with the provisions of subparagraph (1).
(4) If only a part of an operating mineral interest, which interest is not being treated under paragraph (a) of this section as part of a combination of interests, participates in a unit or pool, such part shall, for the period of its participation in the unit or pool, be treated for purposes of this section as being separate from the nonparticipating portion of the operating mineral interest of which it is a part. A portion of the adjusted basis and of the units of mineral of such operating mineral interest remaining at the beginning of the period described in the preceding sentence shall be allocated to the participating part in accordance with the principles contained in paragraph (a)(2)(i)(
a
) of § 1.614-6 as if such participating part had been sold. If participation in the unit or pool ends, the separate status of the participating part shall immediately terminate. At such time the adjusted basis of such part and the units of mineral with respect to such part remaining at the time of termination shall be added to the adjusted basis and to the remaining units of mineral of the nonparticipating portion of the operating mineral interest. During the period of participation in the unit or pool such participating part shall not be treated separately from the nonparticipating portion of the operating mineral interest in applying section 165.
(5) Where an operating mineral interest which is being treated under paragraph (a) of this section as part of a combination of interests begins participation in a unit or pool, the combination shall remain in force but the treatment of such participating interest as a part of the combination shall be suspended for the period of its participation in the unit or pool. If, for example, a taxpayer owns operating mineral interests Nos. 1, 2, and 3 in a single tract or parcel of land, elects to treat No. 1 as a separate property (with mineral interests Nos. 2 and 3 thus being combined), is later required by an agency of a State to place No. 2 in a unit, and subsequently discovers operating mineral interest No. 4 in the same tract or parcel of land, then under paragraph (a)(2)(i)(
b
) of this section No. 4 will automatically be combined with No. 3 unless the taxpayer elects to treat it as a separate property. Under this subparagraph, an interest may be treated as part of a combination for a portion of a taxable year and as part of a unit or pool for a portion of a taxable year. At the commencement of participation in the unit or pool, a portion of the adjusted basis of the combination and a portion of the units of mineral with respect to the combination remaining at that time
shall be allocated to such participating interest in accordance with the principles contained in paragraph (a)(2)(i)(
a
) of § 1.614-6 as if such interest had been sold. During the period of participation in the unit or pool such participating interest is nevertheless treated as a part of the combination for purposes of paragraph (d) of § 1.614-6. If participation in the unit or pool ends, the treatment of such interest as participating in the unit or pool shall immediately terminate. At such time, the adjusted basis of the participating interest and the units of mineral with respect to such interest remaining at the time of termination shall be added to the adjusted basis and to the remaining units of mineral of the nonparticipating portion of the combination. In determining the adjusted basis of the participating interest at the time of termination there shall be taken into account any section 1016 adjustments attributable to such interest for the period of its participation in the unit or pool. If two or more operating mineral interests of the taxpayer participate in a unit or pool and are treated as one property under subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, and if participation by such interests in the unit or pool terminates, the adjusted basis of each such interest at the time of termination shall be separately determined. If the total of the adjusted bases of such interests upon termination of their participation in the unit or pool exceeds the adjusted basis of such one property, then the adjusted bases of such interests shall be further adjusted by applying the principles contained in paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(
b)(ii
) of § 1.614-6 so that the total of the adjusted bases of such interests equals the adjusted basis of such one property. In addition, the units of oil and gas estimated to be attributable to a participating interest at the time of termination of participation shall be restored to the units of oil and gas of the combination of which it is a part. The rules stated in this subparagraph with respect to an operating mineral interest which is being treated under paragraph (a) of this section as part of a combination and which begins participation in a unit or pool shall also apply to a portion of an operating mineral interest which is being treated under paragraph (a) as part of a combination if such portion begins participation in a unit or pool.
(6) As used in this paragraph, the term
unitization or pooling agreement
means an agreement under which two or more persons owning operating mineral interests agree to have the interests operated on a unified basis and further agree to share in production on a stipulated percentage or fractional basis regardless of from which interest or interests the oil or gas is produced. In addition, in a situation in which one person owns operating mineral interests in several leases, an agreement of such person with his several royalty owners to determine the royalties payable to each on a stipulated percentage basis regardless of from which lease or leases oil or gas is obtained is also considered to be a unitization or pooling agreement. No formal cross-conveyance of properties is necessary. An agreement between co-owners of a tract or parcel of land or a part thereof for the development of the property by one of such co-owners for the account of all is not a unitization or pooling agreement, provided that the agreement does not affect ownership of minerals or entitle any such co-owner to share in production from any operating mineral interests other than his own.
(c)
Operating mineral interest defined.
For the definition of the term
operating mineral interest
as used in this section, see paragraph (b) of § 1.614-2.
(d)
Alternative treatment under Internal Revenue Code of 1939.
If, on the day preceding the first day of the first taxable year beginning after December 31, 1963, the taxpayer has any operating mineral interests which he treats under section 614(d) (as in effect before the amendments made by the Revenue Act of 1964) and § 1.614-4, such treatment shall be continued and shall be deemed to have been adopted pursuant to the provisions of section 614(b) and paragraph (a) of this section. Accordingly, a taxpayer, who has four operating mineral interests in a single tract or parcel of land, and who has treated two of such interests as one property and two of such interests as separate properties under section 614(d) prior to the first day of the first taxable year beginning
after December 31, 1963, is deemed to have adopted such treatment pursuant to the provisions of section 614(b) and paragraph (a) of this section. Hence, in the absence of an election to the contrary, a fifth operating mineral interest in the same tract or parcel acquired by the taxpayer in a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1963, will, after an expenditure for development or operation, be combined with the combination of two interests made under section 614(d). Furthermore, an election which was made for a taxable year beginning before January 1, 1964, under section 614(d) as then in effect will be binding for all taxable years beginning after December 31, 1963, even though the time for making an election under section 614(b) and paragraph (a) of this section has not elapsed.
[T.D. 6859, 30 FR 13703, Oct. 28, 1965]
§ 1.615-1
Pre-1970 exploration expenditures.
(a)
General rule.
Section 615 prescribes rules for the treatment of expenditures (paid or incurred before January 1, 1970) for ascertaining the existence, location, extent, or quality of any deposit of ore or other mineral (other than oil or gas) paid or incurred by the taxpayer before the beginning of the development stage of the mine or other natural deposit. Such expenditures hereinafter in the regulations under section 615 will be referred to as exploration expenditures. The development stage of the mine or other natural deposit will be deemed to begin at the time when, in consideration of all the facts and circumstances (including the actions of the taxpayer), deposits of ore or other mineral are shown to exist in sufficient quantity and quality to reasonably justify commercial exploitation by the taxpayer. A taxpayer who elects under section (e) may treat exploration expenditures under either section 615(a) or section 615(b). See § 1.615-6 for the method of making the election to treat exploration expenditures under section 615. Under section 615(a), a taxpayer may, at his option, deduct exploration expenditures paid or incurred in an amount not to exceed $100,000 for any taxable year. Under section 615(b) and § 1.615-2, he may elect to defer any part of such amount and deduct such part on a ratable basis as the units of produced minerals benefited by such expenditures are sold. If the taxpayer does not treat exploration expenditures under either section 615 (a) or (b) in any year for which his election under section 615(e) is effective, the expenditures for such year will be charged to depletable capital account. The option to deduct under section 615(a) and the election to defer under section 615(b), however, are subject to the limitation provided in section 615(c) and § 1.615-4. In the case of certain corporations which are members of an affiliated group which has elected the 100 percent dividends received deduction under section 243(b), see section 243(b) (3) and § 1.243-5 for limitations on the option to deduct under section 615(a) and the election to defer under section 615(b).
(b)
Expenditures to which section 615 is not applicable.
(1) Section 615 is not applicable to expenditures which would be allowed as a deduction for the taxable year without regard to such section.
(2) Section 615 is not applicable to expenditures which are reflected in improvements subject to allowances for depreciation under sections 167 and 611. However, allowances for depreciation of such improvements which are used in the exploration of ores or minerals are considered exploration expenditures under section 615. If such improvements are used only in part for exploration during a taxable year, an allocable portion of the allowance for depreciation shall be treated as an exploration expenditure.
(3) Section 615 is applicable to exploration expenditures paid or incurred by a taxpayer in connection with the acquisition of a fractional share of the working or operating interest to the extent of the fractional interest so acquired by the taxpayer. The expenditures attributable to the remaining fractional share shall be considered as the cost of his acquired interest and shall be recovered through depletion allowances. For example, taxpayer A owns mineral leases on unexplored mineral lands and agrees to convey an undivided three-fourths (
3/4
) interest in such leases to taxpayer B provided B
will pay all of the exploration expenditures for ascertaining the existence, location, extent, or quality of any deposit of ore or other mineral which will be incurred before the beginning of the development stage. B shall treat three-fourths of such amount under section 615, and shall treat one-fourth of such amount as part of the cost of his interest, recoverable through depletion.
(4) The provisions of section 615 do not apply to costs of exploration which are reflected in the amount which the taxpayer paid or incurred to acquire the property. Such provisions apply only to costs paid or incurred by the taxpayer for exploration undertaken directly or through a contract by the taxpayer. See, however, sections 381(a) and 381(c) (10) for special rules with respect to deferred exploration expenditures in certain corporate acquisitions.
[T.D. 6500, 25 FR 11737, Nov. 26, 1960, as amended by T.D. 7192, 37 FR 12938, June 30, 1972]
§ 1.615-2
Deduction of pre-1970 exploration expenditures in the year paid or incurred.
(a)
In general.
(1) If the election to treat exploration expenditures under section 615 has been made or is deemed made under § 1.615-6(b) subject to the total limitation of $100,000, a taxpayer who has made exploration expenditures prior to January 1, 1970, with respect to more than one mine or other natural deposit may deduct for a taxable year for which such election is effective any portion of such expenditures attributable to each mine or deposit. With respect to a particular mine or other natural deposit, a taxpayer who has made the election described in the preceding sentence may deduct under section 615(a) a portion of the exploration expenditures and may defer and deduct under section 615(b) the balance of such expenditures. For any taxable year for which the election to treat exploration expenditures under section 615 is effective, the taxpayer must charge any amount of exploration expenditures in excess of $100,000 to capital account and must charge to capital account whatever amount has not been deducted currently or deferred. For example, taxpayer A who has elected under section 615(e) has three mines, X, Y, and Z. In the taxable year 1967, A makes exploration expenditures of $75,000 with respect to each mine. The total allowable deduction for exploration expenditures is $100,000. A deducts $50,000 and defers $25,000 with respect to X. He deducts $25,000, and charges to capital account $50,000 with respect to Y, and charges to capital account the entire $75,000 paid with respect to Z. Thus, A has deducted or deferred $100,000 and capitalized the excess.
(2) Except as provided in section 615(e) and § 1.615-6, a taxpayer cannot change his treatment of exploration expenditures for a taxable year after the due date (including extensions of time) for filing the return for the taxable year except where it is subsequently determined that any part of such exploration expenditures deducted under section 615(a) or deferred under section 615(b) are not exploration expenditures for the taxable year. Where the taxpayer has made the election to treat exploration expenditures under section 615 and it is subsequently determined that part of the expenditures deducted under section 615(a) or deferred under section 615(b), for a taxable year, were not exploration expenditures for such taxable year, the exploration expenditures required to be charged to capital account for such taxable year by reason of the limitation may be deducted or deferred (to the extent of the subsequent determination) and proper adjustment made to capital account. A taxpayer claiming a deduction under section 615(a) shall indicate clearly on his income tax return the amount of the deduction claimed under such section with respect to each mine or other natural deposit. Such mine or deposit shall be identified by an adequate description.
[T.D. 7192, 37 FR 12938, June 30, 1972]
§ 1.615-3
Election to defer pre-1970 exploration expenditures.
(a)
General rule.
A taxpayer who makes the election provided in section 615(e) may defer any portion of the exploration expenditures made before January 1, 1970, with respect to each mine or other natural deposit, subject to the limitations described in section
615(c) and § 1.615-4. The amounts so deferred shall be deducted ratably as the units of produced ores or minerals discovered or explored by reason of such expenditures are sold.
(b)
Effect and manner of making election.
(1) The election to defer exploration expenditures shall apply only to expenditures for the taxable year for which made. However, once made, the election shall be binding with respect to the expenditures for that taxable year. Thus, a taxpayer cannot revoke his election for any reason whatsoever.
(2) The election shall be made for each mine or other natural deposit by a clear indication on the return or by a statement filed with the district director with whom the return was filed, not later than the time prescribed by law for filing such return (including extensions thereof) for the taxable year to which such election is applicable.
(c)
Expenditures made by the owner who retains a non-operating mineral interest.
(1) A taxpayer who elects to defer exploration expenditures and thereafter transfers his interest in the mine or other natural deposit, retaining an economic interest therein, shall deduct an amount attributable to such interest on a pro rata basis as the interest pays out. For example, a taxpayer who defers exploration expenditures and then leases his deposit, retaining a royalty interest therein, shall deduct the deferred expenditures ratably as he receives royalties. If the taxpayer receives a bonus or advanced royalties in connection with the transfer of his interest, he shall deduct deferred expenditures allocable to such bonus or advanced royalties in an amount which is in the same proportion to the total of such costs as the bonus or advanced royalties bears to the bonus and total royalties expected to be received. Also, in the case of a transfer of a mine or other natural deposit by a taxpayer who retains a production payment therein, he shall deduct the exploration expenditures ratably over the payments expected to be received.
(2) Where a taxpayer receives an amount, in addition to retaining an economic interest, which amount is treated as from the sale or exchange of a capital asset or property treated under section 1231 (except coal or iron ore to which section 631(c) applies), the deferred exploration expenditures shall be allocated between the interest sold and the interest retained in proportion to the fair market values of each interest as of the date of sale. The amount allocated to the interest sold may not be deducted, but shall be a part of the basis of such interest.
(d)
Losses from abandonment.
Section 165 and the regulations thereunder contain general rules relating to the treatment of losses resulting from abandonment.
(e)
Computation of amount of deduction.
The amount of the deduction allowable during the taxable year is an amount A, which bears the same ratio to B (the total deferred exploration expenditures for a particular mine or other natural deposit reduced by the amount of such expenditures deducted in prior taxable years) as C (the number of units of the ore or mineral benefited by such expenditures sold during the taxable year) bears to D (the number of units of ore or mineral benefited by such expenditures remaining as of the taxable year). For the purposes of this proportion, the
number of units of ore or mineral benefited by such expenditures remaining as of the taxable year
is the number of units of ore or mineral benefited by the deferred exploration expenditures remaining at the end of the year to be recovered from the mine or other natural deposit (including units benefited by such expenditures recovered but not sold) plus the number of units benefited by such expenditures sold within the taxable year. The principles outlined in § 1.611-2 are applicable in estimating the number of units remaining as of the taxable year and the number of units sold during the taxable year. The estimate is subject to revision in accordance with that section in the event it is ascertained from any source, such as operations or development work, that the remaining units are materially greater or less than the number of units remaining from a prior estimate.
[T.D. 6500, 25 FR 11737, Nov. 26, 1960, as amended by T.D. 6685, 28 FR 11405, Oct. 24, 1963; T.D. 6841, 30 FR 9306, July 27, 1965; T.D. 7192, 37 FR 12939, June 30, 1972]
§ 1.615-4
Limitation of amount deductible.
(a)
Taxable years beginning before July 7, 1960.
For any taxable year beginning before July 7, 1960 (including taxable years of less than 12 months), a taxpayer may deduct or defer exploration expenditures paid or incurred in the taxable year in an amount not in excess of $100,000. However, for such taxable years, the taxpayer may not avail himself of the provisions of section 615 for more than four taxable years (including taxable years of less than 12 months and taxable years subject to the Internal Revenue Code of 1939). Such four taxable years need not be consecutive. In determining the number of years in which a taxpayer has availed himself of section 615, a year for which he makes an election to defer exploration expenditures shall count as one year. Any subsequent taxable year in which such deferred expenditures are deducted shall not be taken into account as one of the four years. For purposes of the 4-year limitation, a year in which both a deduction and an election to defer are availed of by the taxpayer shall be taken into account as only one year.
(b)
Taxable years beginning after July 6, 1960.
For any taxable year beginning after July 6, 1960 (including taxable years of less than 12 months), a taxpayer who is otherwise eligible may deduct or defer exploration expenditures paid or incurred before January 1, 1970, in the lesser of the following amounts:
(1) The amount paid or incurred in the taxable year,
(2) $100,000, or
(3) $400,000 minus all amounts deducted or deferred for taxable years ending after December 31, 1950
For purposes of this paragraph, the number of taxable years for which the taxpayer availed himself of the provisions of section 615 or the corresponding provisions of prior law is immaterial.
(c)
Special rules for previously deferred expenditures.
In determining whether an election to defer was availed of in applying the limitations of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, there shall be taken into account any year with respect to which amounts were deferred but not fully deducted because of a sale or other disposition of the mineral property, even though the balance of the deferred amounts was treated as part of the basis of the mineral property in determining gain or loss from the sale.
(d)
Example of application of provisions.
The application of the provisions of subparagraphs (a) and (b) of this section may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
A taxpayer on the calendar year basis, who has never claimed the benefits of section 615, or section 23(ff) of the 1939 Code, expended $200,000 for exploration expenditures during the year 1956. For each of the years 1957, 1958, 1959, and 1960 the taxpayer had exploration costs of $80,000. The taxpayer deducted or deferred the maximum amounts allowed for each of the years 1956, 1957, 1958, and 1959. None of the $80,000 expenditures for 1960 could be deducted or deferred by the taxpayer because he had already deducted or deferred exploration expenditures for 4 prior years. In 1961 the taxpayer expended $200,000 for exploration expenditures. The maximum amount the taxpayer may deduct or defer for the taxable year 1961 is $60,000 computed as follows:
(1) Add all yearly amounts deducted or deferred for exploration expenditures by the taxpayer for prior years.

(e)
Transferee of mineral property.
(1) Where an individual or corporation transfers any property to the taxpayer and the transfer is one to which any of the subdivisions of this subparagraph apply, the taxpayer shall take into account for purposes of the 4-year limitation described in paragraph (a) of this section, all years that the transferor
deducted or deferred exploration expenditures, and for purposes of the $400,000 limitation described in paragraph (b) of this section, all amounts that the transferor deducted or deferred.
(i) The taxpayer acquired any mineral property in a transaction described in section 23(ff)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, excluding the reference therein to section 113(a)(13).
(ii) The taxpayer would be entitled under section 381(c)(10) to deduct exploration expenditures if the transferor (or distributor) corporation had elected to defer such expenditures. For example, if the taxpayer acquired any mineral property in a transaction described in section 381(a) (relating to the acquisition of assets through certain corporate liquidations and reorganizations), there shall be taken into account in applying the limitations of paragraph (a) of this section the years in which the transferor exercised the election to defer or deduct exploration expenditures, and there shall be taken into account in applying the limitations of paragraph (b) of this section any amount so deducted or deferred. See also section 381(c)(10) and the regulations thereunder.
(iii) The taxpayer acquired any mineral property under circumstances which make applicable the following sections of the Internal Revenue Code:
(
a
) Section 334(b)(1), relating to the liquidation of a subsidiary where the basis of the property in the hands of the distributee is the same as it would be in the hands of the transferor.
(
b
) Section 362 (a) and (b), relating to property acquired by a corporation as paid-in surplus or as a contribution to capital, or in connection with a transaction to which section 351 applies.
(
c
) Section 372(a), relating to reorganization in certain receiverships and bankruptcy proceedings.
(
d
) Section 373(b)(1), relating to property of a railroad corporation acquired in certain bankruptcy or recivership proceedings.
(
e
) Section 1051, relating to property acquired by a corporation that is a member of an affiliated group.
(
f
) Section 1082, relating to property acquired pursuant to a Securities Exchange Commission order.
(2) For purposes of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, it is immaterial whether a deduction has been allowed or an election has been made by the transferor with respect to the specific mineral property transferred.
(3) Where a mineral property is acquired under any circumstance except those described in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, the taxpayer is not required to take into account the election exercised by or deduction allowed to his transferor.
(4) For purposes of applying the limitations imposed by section 615(c): (i) the partner, and not the partnership, shall be considered as the taxpayer (see paragraph (a)(8)(iii) of § 1.702-1), and (ii) an electing small business corporation, as defined in section 1371(b), and not its shareholders, shall be considered as the taxpayer.
(5) For purposes of subparagraph (1)(iii)(
b
) of this paragraph: (i) if mineral property is acquired from a partnership, the transfer shall be considered as having been made by the individual partners, so that the number of years for which section 615 has been availed of by each partner and the amounts which each partner has deducted or deferred under section 615 shall be taken into account, or (ii) if on interest in a partnership having mineral property is transferred, the transfer shall be considered as a transfer of mineral property by the partner or partners relinquishing an interest, so that the number of years for which section 615 has been availed of by each such partner and the amounts which each such partner has deducted or deferred under section 615 shall be taken into account.
(f)
Examples.
The application of the provisions of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
A calendar year taxpayer who has never claimed the benefits of section 615 received in 1956 a mineral deposit from X Corporation upon a distribution in complete liquidation of the latter under conditions which would make the provisions of section 334(b)(1) applicable in determining the basis of the property in the hands of the taxpayer. During the year 1955 X Corporation expended $60,000 for exploration expenditures which it elected to treat as deferred expenses. Assume further that the taxpayer made similar expenditures of $150,000, $125,000, $100,000,
$60,000, and $180,000 for the years 1956, 1957, 1958, 1959, and 1961, respectively, which the taxpayer elected to deduct for each of those years to the extent allowable. No such expenditures were made for 1960. On the basis of these facts, the taxpayer may deduct or defer $100,000 for each of the years 1956, 1957, and 1958. No deduction or deferral is allowable for 1959 since the 4-year limitation of paragraph (a) of this section applies. The taxpayer may deduct or defer a maximum of $40,000 for 1961 since the $400,000 limitation of paragraph (b) of this section applies, but the 4-year limitation of paragraph (a) does not apply.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts stated in example 1 except that, prior to acquisition by the taxpayer of the deposit from X Corporation in 1956, X Corporation had acquired the deposit in 1954 in a similar distribution from Y Corporation which, in the years 1952 and 1953, deducted exploration costs paid in respect of an entirely different deposit in the amounts of $30,000 and $50,000, respectively. Under these circumstances, the taxpayer may deduct or defer exploration expenditures paid or incurred in the amount of $100,000 for 1956. No deduction or deferral is allowable to the taxpayer for expenditures made in 1957, 1958, and 1959 since the 4-year limitation of paragraph (a) applies. The taxpayer may deduct or defer a maximum of $100,000 for 1961 since the 4-year limitation of paragraph (a) of this section no longer applies. If the taxpayer deducted or deferred $100,000 for each of the years 1956 and 1961 and also made exploration expenditures in 1962, the taxpayer may deduct or defer a maximum of $60,000 for that year under the $400,000 limitation of paragraph (b) of this section.

# Example 3.
In 1957, A and B transfer assets to a corporation under circumstances making section 351 applicable to such a transfer. Among the assets transferred by A is a mineral lease with respect to certain coal lands. A has deducted exploration expenditures under section 615 for the years 1954 and 1956 in the amounts of $50,000 and $100,000, respectively, made with respect to other deposits not included in the transfer to the corporation. The corporation shall be required to take into account the deductions previously made by A for purposes of applying the limitations of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.

# Example 4.
In 1956, A, B, and C form a partnership for the purpose of exploring for, developing, and producing uranium. A contributes a uranium lease to the partnership. A had individually made exploration expenses in the amount of $50,000 and $100,000 with respect to other mineral properties not contributed to the partnership and which he has deducted under section 615(a) for the years 1954 and 1955, respectively. B contributes a uranium lease to the partnership on which he made exploration expenditures in the amount of $100,000 in 1955 which he elected to defer under section 615(b). This is the only year in which B has used section 615. C contributes only cash to the partnership and has not previously used section 615. Subject to the limitations of section 615, for taxable years beginning before July 7, 1960, A may deduct or defer exploration expenses for two more taxable years (either as to expenditures incurred by him individually or with respect to his distributive share of partnership exploration expenses). B may deduct or defer exploration expenditures for three more years, and C may deduct or defer exploration expenditures for four years. For taxable years beginning after July 6, 1960, subject in each case to the $100,000 limitation per year, A may deduct or defer exploration expenditures in an amount not in excess of $250,000 ($400,000-$150,000), either as to expenditures incurred by him individually or with respect to his distributive share of partnership exploration expenditures. B may similarly deduct or defer exploration expenditures in an amount not in excess of $300,000 ($400,000-$100,000), and C may deduct or defer exploration expenditures in an amount not in excess of $400,000.
[T.D. 6685, 28 FR 11405, Oct. 24, 1963, as amended by T.D. 7192, 37 FR 12939, June 30, 1972]
§ 1.615-5
Time for making election with respect to returns due on or before May 2, 1960.
In the case of any taxable year beginning after December 31, 1953, and ending after August 16, 1954, the income tax return for which is due not later than May 2, 1960, the time for exercising any option or making any election under section 615 shall expire on May 2, 1960.
§ 1.615-6
Election to deduct under section 615.
(a)
General rule.
The election to deduct or defer exploration expenditures under section 615 shall be made in a statement filed with the director of the Internal Revenue service center with whom the taxpayer's income tax return is required to be filed. If the election is made within the time period prescribed for filing an income tax return (including extensions thereof) for the first taxable year ending after September 12, 1966, during which the taxpayer pays or incurs expenditures which are within the scope of section 615 and which are
paid or incurred by him after September 12, 1966, this statement shall be attached to the taxpayer's income tax return for such taxable year. If the election is made after the time prescribed for filing such return but before the expiration of the period (described in paragraph (e) of this section) for making the election under section 615(e), the statement must be signed by the taxpayer or his authorized representative. The statement shall be filed even though the taxpayer charges to capital account all such expenditures paid or incurred by him during such taxable year after such date. The statement shall clearly indicate that the taxpayer elects to have section 615 apply to all amounts deducted or deferred by him with respect to exploration expenditures paid or incurred after September 12, 1966, and before January 1, 1970. If the taxpayer desires, he may file this statement by attaching it to his return for a taxable year prior to the first taxable year ending after September 12, 1966, in which he pays or incurs exploration expenditures. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, if the taxpayer does not file such a statement within the period prescribed by section 615(e) and paragraph (e) of this section, any amounts deducted by him with respect to exploration expenditures paid or incurred after September 12, 1966, will be deemed to have been deducted pursuant to an election under section 617(a).
(b)
Exception.
The last sentence of paragraph (a) of this section shall not apply if all exploration expenditures paid or incurred by the taxpayer after September 12, 1966, and before January 1, 1970, and deducted by him on his income tax return for the first taxable year ending after September 12, 1966, during which he pays or incurs such expenditures are outside the scope of section 617(a) (as it existed before its amendment by section 504(b) of the Tax Reform Act of 1969). For example, assume that, in his return for his taxable year ending December 31, 1966, a calendar-year taxpayer deducts exploration expenditures paid or incurred after September 12, 1966, and does not attach to his return the statement described in paragraph (a) of this section. However, all of the exploration expenditures paid or incurred by the taxpayer after September 12, 1966, and before the end of the taxable year were paid or incurred with respect to minerals located neither in the United States nor on the Outer Continental Shelf. The taxpayer will be deemed to have made an election under section 615(e) by deducting all or part of those expenditures as expenses in his income tax return.
(c)
Information to be furnished.
A taxpayer who makes or has made an election under section 615(e) with respect to expenditures paid or incurred after September 12, 1966, and before January 1, 1970, shall indicate clearly on his income tax return for each taxable year for which he deducts any such expenditures the amount of the deduction claimed under section 615 (a) or (b) with respect to each property or mine. The property or mine shall be identified by a description adequate to permit application of the rules of section 615(g) (relating to effect of transfer of mineral property).
(d)
Effect of election
—(1)
In general.
A taxpayer who has made or is deemed to have made an election under section 615(e) may not make an election under section 617(a) with respect to expenditures made before January 1, 1970, unless, within the period set forth in section 615(e), he revokes his election under section 615(e). Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of § 1.615-2, a taxpayer who makes an election under section 615(e) may not change his treatment of exploration expenditures deducted, deferred, or capitalized pursuant to such election unless he revokes the election made under section 615(e).
(2)
Transfer of mineral property.
The binding effect of a taxpayer's election under section 615(e) shall not be affected by his receiving property with respect to which deductions have been allowed under section 617(a). However, see section 615(g)(2) and § 1.615-7 for rules under which amounts deducted under section 615 by a transferor may be subject to recapture in the hands of a transferee who has made an election under section 617(a). See § 1.617-3(d)(2)(ii) for rules under which amounts deducted under section 617(a) by a transferor may be subject to recapture in the hands of a transferee
who has made an election under section 615(e).
(e)
Time for making election under section 615(e).
A taxpayer may not make an election under section 615(e) after the expiration of the 3-year period beginning with the date prescribed by section 6072 or other provision of law for filing the taxpayer's income tax return for the first taxable year ending after September 12, 1966, in which the taxpayer pays or incurs expenditures to which section 615(a) would apply if an election were made under section 615(e). This 3-year period shall be determined without regard to any extension of time for filing the taxpayer's income tax return for such year. An election under section 615(e) may not be made after the expiration of the 3-year period even though the taxpayer charged to capital account, or erroneously deducted as development expenditures under section 616, all exploration expenditures paid or incurred by him after September 12, 1966, and before the end of his first taxable year ending after September 12, 1966, in which he paid or incurred such expenditures.
(f)
Revocation of section 615(e) election
—(1)
Manner of revoking election.
A taxpayer may revoke an election made by him under section 615(e) by filing with the director of the Internal Revenue service center with whom the taxpayer's income tax return is required to be filed, within the period set forth in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, a statement, signed by the taxpayer or his authorized representative, which sets forth that the taxpayer is revoking the election previously made by him with respect to exploration expenditures paid or incurred after September 12, 1966, and states with whom and where the document making the election was filed. Such revocation shall be a revocation for all taxable years for which the taxpayer's election was in effect and the taxpayer revoking such an election shall file amended income tax returns, reflecting any increase or decrease in tax attributable to the revocation of election. In applying the revocation of election to the years affected there shall be taken into account the effect that any adjustments resulting from the revocation of election shall have on other items affected thereby (such as the deduction for charitable contributions, the foreign tax credit, net operating loss, and other deductions or credits the amount of which is limited by the taxpayer's income) and the effect that adjustments of any such items have on items in other taxable years.
(2)
Time for revoking election under section 615(e).
An election under section 615(e) may be revoked at any time before the expiration of the 3-year period described in paragraph (e) of this section. Such an election may not be revoked after the expiration of the 3-year period.
(3)
Additional information to be furnished by a transferor of mineral property.
If, before revoking his election, the taxpayer has transferred any mineral property with respect to which he deducted exploration expenditures paid or incurred after September 12, 1966, and before January 1, 1970, to another person in a transaction as a result of which the basis of such property in the hands of the transferee is determined by reference to the basis in the hands of the transferor, the statement submitted pursuant to subparagraph (1) of this paragraph shall state that such property has been so transferred and shall identify the transferee, the property transferred, and the date of the transfer. The preceding sentence shall not apply in the case of any mineral property transferred after December 31, 1969.
(g)
Taxable years beginning before September 13, 1966, and ending after September 12, 1966
—(1)
In general.
An election made under section 615(e) applies only to expenditures paid or incurred after September 12, 1966. The income tax treatment of exploration expenditures paid or incurred before September 13, 1966, will be determined in accordance with the provisions of section 615 prior to its amendment by the Act of September 12, 1966 (Public Law 89-570, 80 Stat. 759). If a taxpayer makes an election under section 615(e) in his income tax return for a taxable year which begins before September 13, 1966, and which ends after September 12, 1966, amounts deducted and amounts deferred under section 615
with respect to expenditures paid or incurred during such taxable year but before September 13, 1966, will be taken into account in determining whether the $100,000 limitation set forth in section 615(a) is reached during the taxable year. Similarly, a taxpayer who makes an election under section 615(e) shall take into account expenditures deducted or deferred under section 615 for the period prior to September 13, 1966, in determining when the $400,000 overall limitation set forth in section 615(c) is reached. The fact that a taxpayer deducts or defers under section 615 exploration expenditures paid or incurred prior to September 13, 1966, shall not affect his right to make an election under section 617(a) to deduct under section 617 expenditures paid or incurred after September 12, 1966.
(2)
Allocation in case of inadequate records.
If a taxpayer pays or incurs exploration expenditures during a taxable year beginning before September 13, 1966, and ending after September 12, 1966, but his records as to any mine or property are inadequate to permit a determination of the amount paid or incurred during the portion of the year ending after September 12, 1966, and the amount paid or incurred on or before such date, the exploration expenditures, as to which the records are inadequate, paid or incurred with respect to the mine or property during the taxable year shall be allocated to each part year (that is, the part occurring before September 13, 1966, and the part occurring after September 12, 1966) in the same ratio which the number of days in each such part year bears to the number of days in the entire taxable year. For example, if the records of a calendar year taxpayer for 1966 are inadequate to permit a determination of the amount of exploration expenditures paid or incurred with respect to a certain mine or property after September 12, 1966, and the amount paid or incurred before September 13, 1966, 255/365 of the total exploration expenditures paid or incurred by the taxpayer with respect to the mine or property during 1966 shall be allocated to the period beginning January 1, 1966, and ending September 12, 1966, and 110/365 of the total exploration expenditures paid or incurred with respect to the mine or property during 1966 shall be allocated to the period beginning September 13, 1966, and ending December 31, 1966.
(3)
Partnership elections.
With respect to exploration expenditures paid or incurred by a partnership before September 13, 1966, the option to deduct under section 615(a) and the election to defer under section 615(b) shall be made by the partnership, rather than by the individual partners. With respect to exploration expenditures paid or incurred by a partnership after September 12, 1966, all elections under sections 615 and 617 as to the tax treatment of a partner's distributive share of exploration expenditures paid or incurred by a partnership of which he is a member shall be made by the individual partner, rather than by the partnership. See section 703(b) and the regulations thereunder.
[T.D. 7192, 37 FR 12939, June 30, 1972]
§ 1.615-7
Effect of transfer of mineral property.
(a)
Transfer before election by transferor.
(1) If mineral property is transferred in a transaction as a result of which the basis of the property in the hands of the transferee is determined in whole or in part by reference to the basis in the hands of the transferor and the transferor had not made an election under either section 615(e) or 617(a) at the time of the transfer, no election made by the transferor after the transfer shall apply with respect to expenditures properly chargeable to the transferred property which were paid or incurred before the date of the transfer.
(2) For purposes of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, a transferor of mineral property who made an election under section 617(a) or section 615(e) before the transfer but who revokes such election after such transfer and does not make an election under either section before the expiration of the 3-year period prescribed by section 6072 or other provision of law for filing his income tax return for the taxable year in which such transfer occurred shall be treated with respect to such property as not having made an election under either section.
(b)
Transfer after election by transferor.
If a transferee who at the time of the
transfer of a mineral property has not made an election under section 617(a) receives property in a transaction in which the basis of such property in his hands is determined in whole or in part by reference to its basis in the hands of the transferor and with respect to such property the transferor has deducted expenditures under section 617(a), the adjusted exploration expenditures properly chargeable to the property immediately after the transfer shall be treated as expenditures allowed as deductions under section 617(a) to the transferee. See section 617 and the regulations thereunder.
(c)
Transfer after election by transferee.
(1) If a transferee who makes an election under section 617(a) receives before January 1, 1970, mineral property in a transaction in which the basis of such property in his hands is determined in whole or in part by reference to the basis of the property in the hands of the transferor and the transferor had in effect at the time of the transfer an election under section 615(e), an amount equal to the total of the amounts allowed as deductions to the transferor under section 615 with respect to the transferred mineral property shall be treated as expenditures allowed as deductions under section 617(a) to the transferee. The preceding sentence shall not apply to expenditures which would not have been reflected in the basis of the property in the hands of the transferor had the transferor not made the section 615(e) election.
(2) Any expenditures with respect to the transferred property deferred by the transferor under section 615(b) which are not allowed as deductions to him prior to transfer of the property may not be deducted by the transferee and in his hands shall be charged to capital account.
[T.D. 7192, 37 FR 12940, June 30, 1972]
§ 1.615-8
Termination of section 615.
(a)
In general.
The provisions of section 615 shall not apply to exploration expenditures paid or incurred after December 31, 1969. Expenditures paid or incurred before January 1, 1970, which were deferred under section 615(b) will be deductible under such section after such date as the units of ore or mineral discovered or explored by reason of such expenditures are sold. An election under section 615(e) with respect to expenditures paid or incurred prior to January 1, 1970, shall remain in effect with respect to such expenditures unless it is revoked under section 615(e) and § 1.615-6. See § 1.615-9 for treatment of a section 615(e) election with respect to expenditures paid or incurred after December 31, 1969.
(b)
Taxable years beginning before January 1, 1970, and ending after December 31, 1969
—(1)
In general.
The termination of section 615 applies to expenditures paid or incurred after December 31, 1969. The income tax treatment of exploration expenditures paid or incurred before January 1, 1970, will be determined in accordance with the provisions of sections 615 and 617 prior to their amendment by the Tax Reform Act of 1969 (83 Stat. 487). The fact that on his income tax return for a taxable year beginning before January 1, 1970, and ending after December 31, 1969, a taxpayer deducts under section 615 expenditures paid or incurred before January 1, 1970, shall not affect his right to deduct under section 617(a) expenditures paid or incurred during such taxable year after December 31, 1969.
(2)
Allocation in case of inadequate records.
If a taxpayer pays or incurs exploration expenditures during a taxable year beginning before January 1, 1970, and ending after December 31, 1969, but his records are inadequate to permit a determination of the amount paid or incurred during the portion of the year ending after December 31, 1969, and the amount paid or incurred on or before such date, the exploration expenditures as to which the records are inadequate paid or incurred with respect to the mine or property during the taxable year shall be allocated to each part of the year (that is, the part before January 1, 1970, and the part occurring after December 31, 1969) in the same ratio which the number of days in each such part year bears to the number of days in the entire taxable year.
[T.D. 7192, 37 FR 12941, June 30, 1972]
§ 1.615-9
Notification under Tax Reform Act of 1969.
(a)
In general.
An election under section 615(e) with respect to exploration
expenditures paid or incurred prior to January 1, 1970, shall be treated as an election under section 617(a) with respect to exploration expenditures paid or incurred after December 31, 1969.
(b)
Exception.
Paragraph (a) of this section shall not apply to an election under section 615(e) if the taxpayer files the notice described in paragraph (c) of this section or the taxpayer revokes his election under section 615(e) before the date prescribed for the filing of notice under paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
(c)
Filing of notice
—(1)
In general.
The notice not to have a section 615(e) election treated as a section 617(a) election shall be made in a statement filed with the Director of the Internal Revenue service center with whom the taxpayer's income tax return is required to be filed. If the election is made within the time period prescribed for filing an income tax return (including extensions thereof) for the first taxable year during which the taxpayer pays or incurs, after December 31, 1969, expenditures which would be deductible by the taxpayer under section 617(a) if he made a valid election to deduct exploration expenditures under such section, the statement shall be attached to the taxpayer's income tax return for such year. If the statement is filed after the time prescribed for filing such return but before the expiration of the period (described in paragraph (e) of this section) for filing the notice, the statement must be signed by the taxpayer or his authorized representative. The statement shall be filed even though the taxpayer charges to capital account all such expenditures paid or incurred by him after December 31, 1969. If the taxpayer desires, he may file this statement by attaching it to his return for a taxable year prior to the first taxable year in which he pays or incurs after December 31, 1969, expenditures which would be deductible by him under section 617(a) if at such time he had in effect a valid election under such section.
(2)
Information to be furnished.
The notice shall clearly state that the taxpayer elects not to have his section 615(e) election treated as an election under section 617(a). The notice shall state the first taxable year for which the section 615(e) election was effective and with whom and where the election was filed.
(d)
Effect of notification.
A taxpayer who has filed notice pursuant to this section may make an election under section 617(a) with respect to exploration expenditures paid or incurred after December 31, 1969, without revoking either his section 615(e) election or his notice under this section.
(e)
Time for filing notice.
A taxpayer may not file the notice described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section after the expiration of the 3-year period beginning with the date prescribed by section 6072 or other provision of law for filing the taxpayer's income tax return for the first taxable year in which the taxpayer pays or incurs after December 31, 1969, expenditures which would be deductible by him if he made the election under section 617(a). This 3-year period shall be determined without regard to any extension of time for filing the taxpayer's income tax return.
[T.D. 7192, 37 FR 12941, June 30, 1972]
§ 1.616-1
Development expenditures.
(a)
General rule.
Section 616 prescribes rules for treating expenditures paid or incurred during the taxable year by the taxpayer for the development of a mine or other natural deposit (other than an oil or gas well). Development expenditures under section 616 are those which are made after such time when, in consideration of all the facts and circumstances (including actions of the taxpayer), deposits of ore or other mineral are shown to exist in sufficient quantity and quality to reasonably justify commercial exploitation by the taxpayer. Under section 616(a), a taxpayer is allowed a deduction for development expenditures whether or not such expenditures are made in the development or production state of the mine or other natural deposit. Under section 616(b), the taxpayer may elect to defer development expenditures made in the development or producing stage and to deduct such expenditures ratably as the minerals or ores benefited are sold. While the mine or other natural deposit is in the development stage, the election applies only
to that portion of the development expenditures which is in excess of net receipts from the mine or other natural deposit. See § 1.616-2 for rules with respect to the election to defer. It is not necessary that the taxpayer incur the development costs directly. He may engage a contractor to make the expenditures on his behalf.
(b)
Expenditures to which section 616 is not applicable.
(1) Section 616 is not applicable to development expenditures which are deductible for the taxable year under any other provision of the internal revenue laws.
(2) Section 616 is not applicable to expenditures which are reflected in improvements subject to allowances for depreciation under sections 167 and 611. However, allowance for depreciation of such improvements which are used in the development of ores or minerals are considered development expenditures under section 616. If such improvements are used only in part for development during a taxable year, an allocable portion of the allowance for depreciation shall be treated as a development expenditure.
(3) Section 616 is applicable to development expenditures paid or incurred by a taxpayer in connection with the acquisition of a fractional share of the working or operating interest to the extent of the fractional interest so acquired. The expenditure attributable to the remaining fractional share shall be considered as part of the cost of his acquired interest and shall be capitalized and recovered through depletion allowances. For example, taxpayer A owns mineral leases on undeveloped mineral lands. A agrees to convey an undivided three-fourths (
3/4
) interest in such leases to B, provided B will pay all of the expenditures incurred during the development stage of the deposits on these leases. B may deduct three-fourths (
3/4
) of such amount under section 616, but shall treat one-fourth of such amount as part of the cost of his interest, recoverable through depletion.
(4) The provisions of section 616 do not apply to costs of development paid or incurred by a prior owner which are reflected in the amount which the taxpayer paid or incurred to acquire the property. Such provisions apply only to costs paid or incurred by the taxpayer for development undertaken directly or through contract by the taxpayer. See, however, section 381(a) and 381(c)(10) for special rules with respect to deferred development expenditures in certain corporate acquisitions.
(c)
Mine or other natural deposit.
Section 616 has reference to expenditures made for the development of a mine or other natural deposit. Within an aggregated property, as that term is defined in section 614 (b) and (c), or within a single tract or parcel of land, there may be more than one mine or other natural deposit. Where a property, as determined under section 614, contains more than one mine or other natural deposit, the taxpayer may deduct under section 616(a) the development expenditures made with respect to one of such mines or deposits, and may defer under section 616(b) the development expenditures made with respect to another of such mines or deposits. Where there is more than one mine with respect to a single underlying deposit, the taxpayer may deduct under section 616(a) the development expenditures made with respect to one of such mines, and may defer under section 616(b) the development expenditures made with respect to another of such mines. The taxpayer must treat consistently all development expenditures with respect to each such mine or other natural deposit in a taxable year. The taxpayer must make a separate determination of the units of minerals or ores benefited in a mine or other natural deposit (regardless of the computation of the depletion allowance) in order that deferred expenditures with respect to such mine or deposit may be deducted on a ratable basis. See paragraph (f) of § 1.616-2.
§ 1.616-2
Election to defer.
(a)
General rule.
In lieu of taking a deduction under section 616(a), in the taxable year when the development expenditures are paid or incurred, a taxpayer may elect under section 616(b) to treat such expenditures with respect to each mine or other natural deposit as deferred expenses to be deducted ratably as the units of the produced ore or
minerals benefited by such expenditures are sold. Section 616(b) is applicable to development expenditures paid or incurred both in the development and producing stage of the mine or other natural deposit. However, in the case of such expenditures made in the development stage, this election is applicable only to the excess of the amount of such expenditures over the net receipts from the ore or minerals from such mine or deposit received or accrued during the development stage and in the same taxable year as the expenditures were paid or incurred. Such development expenditures not in excess of such net receipts shall be subject to the provisions of section 616(a).
(b)
Producing stage; definition of.
The mine or other natural deposit will be considered to be in a producing stage when the major portion of the mineral production is obtained from workings other than those opened for the purpose of development, or when the principal activity of the mine or other natural deposit is the production of developed ores or minerals rather than the development of additional ores or minerals for mining.
(c)
Expenditures made by the owner who retains a nonoperating interest.
(1) A taxpayer who elects to defer development expenditures and thereafter transfers his interest in the mine or other natural deposit, retaining an economic interest therein, shall deduct an amount attributable to such interest on a pro rata basis as the interest pays out. For example, a taxpayer who defers development expenditures and then leases his deposit, retaining a royalty interest therein, shall deduct the deferred expenditures ratably as he receives the royalties. If the taxpayer receives a bonus or advanced royalties in connection with the transfer of his interest, he shall deduct the deferred expenditures allocable to such bonus or advanced royalties in an amount which is in the same proportion to the total of such costs as the bonus or advanced royalties bears to the bonus and total royalties expected to be received. Also, in the case of a transfer of a mine or other natural deposit by a taxpayer who retains a production payment therein, he may deduct the development expenditures ratably over the payments expected to be received.
(2) Where a taxpayer receives an amount, in addition to retaining an economic interest, which amount is treated as from the sale or exchange of a capital asset or property treated under section 1231 (except coal or iron ore to which section 631(c) applies), the deferred development expenditures shall be allocated between the interest sold and the interest retained in proportion to the fair market value of each interest as of the date of sale. The amount allocated to the interest sold may not be deducted, but shall be a part of the basis of such interest for the purpose of determining gain or loss upon the sale thereof.
(d)
Losses from abandonment.
Section 165 and the regulations thereunder contain general rules relating to the treatment of losses resulting from abandonment.
(e)
Effect of election.
(1) The election to defer development expenditures shall apply only to expenditures for the taxable year for which made. However, once made, the election shall be binding with respect to the expenditures for that taxable year. Thus, a taxpayer cannot revoke his election for any reason whatsoever.
(2) The election shall be made for each mine or other natural deposit by a clear indication on the return or by a statement filed with the district director with whom the return was filed, not later than the time prescribed by law for filing such return (including extensions thereof) for the taxable year to which such election is applicable.
(f)
Computation of amount of deduction.
The amount of the deduction allowable during the taxable year is an amount A, which bears the same ratio to B (the total deferred development expenditures for a particular mine or other natural deposit reduced by the amount of such expenditures deducted in prior taxable years) as C (the number of units of the ore or mineral benefited by such expenditures sold during the taxable year) bears to D (the number of units of ore or mineral benefited by such expenditures remaining as of the taxable year). For the purposes of this proportion, the
number of units of
ore or mineral benefited by such expenditures remaining as of the taxable year
is the number of units of ore or mineral benefited by the deferred development expenditures remaining at the end of the year to be recovered from the mine or other natural deposit (including units benefited by such expenditures recovered but not sold) plus the number of units benefited by such expenditures sold within the taxable year. The principles outlined in § 1.611-2 are applicable in estimating the number of units remaining as of the taxable year and the number of units sold during the taxable year. The estimate is subject to revision in accordance with that section in the event it is ascertained, from any source, such as operations or development work, that the remaining units are materially greater or less than the number of units remaining from a prior estimate.

In the case of any taxable year beginning after December 31, 1953, and ending after August 16, 1954, the income tax return for which is due not later than May 2, 1960, the time to deduct or defer development expenditures for such a year under section 616 (a) or (b) shall expire on May 2, 1960.
§ 1.617-1
Exploration expenditures.
(a)
General rule.
Section 617 prescribes rules for the treatment of expenditures paid or incurred after September 12, 1966, for ascertaining the existence, location, extent, or quality of any deposit of ore or other mineral for which a deduction for depletion is allowable under section 613 (other than oil or gas) paid or incurred by the taxpayer before the beginning of the development stage of the mine or other natural deposit. Such expenditures hereinafter in the regulations under section 617 will be referred to as exploration expenditures. The development stage of the mine or other natural deposit will be deemed to begin at the time when, in consideration of all the facts and circumstances (including the actions of the taxpayer), deposits of ore or other mineral are disclosed in sufficient quantity and quality to reasonably justify commercial exploitation by the taxpayer. For example, core drilling expenditures paid or incurred by the taxpayer to ascertain the existence of commercially marketable ore are exploration expenditures within the meaning of this section. Also, expenditures for exploratory drilling from within a producing mine to ascertain the existence of what appears (on the basis of all of the facts and circumstances known at the time of the expenditures) to be a different ore deposit are exploration expenditures within the meaning of this section. Expenditures paid or incurred in connection with core drilling to further delineate the extent and location of an existing commercially marketable deposit to facilitate its development are development expenditures. Under section 617(a), a taxpayer may deduct exploration expenditures paid or incurred for the exploration of any deposit of ore or other mineral subject to the limitation of section 617(h). Under section 617(b), a taxpayer shall recapture the exploration expenditures previously deducted under section 617(a) either through including in income an amount equal to the amount of the adjusted exploration expenditures (as defined in section 617(f)) or through disallowance of the deduction for depletion under section 611. Certain rules are provided in section 617(c) for recapture of exploration expenditures made with respect to property for which the taxpayer later receives a bonus or royalty. Under section 617(d), gain from dispositions of mining property, with respect to which exploration expenditures have been previously deducted, is to be recognized notwithstanding certain other provisions of the Code.
(b)
Expenditures to which section 617 is not applicable.
(1) Section 617 is not applicable to expenditures which would be allowed as deductions for the taxable year without regard to section 617.
(2) Section 617 is not applicable to expenditures which are reflected in improvements subject to allowances for depreciation under sections 167 and 611. However, allowances for depreciation of such improvements which are used
in the exploration of ores or minerals are considered exploration expenditures under section 617. If such improvements are used only in part for exploration during the taxable year, an allocable portion of the allowance for depreciation shall be treated as an exploration expenditure.
(3) Section 617 is applicable to exploration expenditures paid or incurred by a taxpayer in connection with the acquisition of a fractional share of the working or operating interest to the extent of the fractional interest so acquired by the taxpayer. The expenditures attributable to the remaining fractional share shall be considered as the cost of his acquired interest and shall be recovered through depletion allowances. For example, taxpayer A owns mineral leases on unexplored mineral lands and agrees to convey an undivided three-fourths (
3/4
) interest in such leases to taxpayer B provided B will pay all of the expenses for ascertaining the existence, location, extent, or quality of any deposit of ore or other mineral which will be incurred before the beginning of the development stage. B may elect to treat three-fourths of such amount under section 617. B must treat one-fourth of such amount as part of the cost of his interest, recoverable through depletion.
(4) Section 617 is not applicable to costs of exploration which are reflected in the amount which the taxpayer paid or incurred to acquire the property. Section 617 applies only to costs paid or incurred by the taxpayer for exploration undertaken directly or through a contract by the taxpayer. See, however, sections 381(a) and 381(c)(10) for special rules with respect to deferred exploration expenditures in certain corporate acquisitions.
(5) Section 617 is not applicable to amounts paid or incurred for the purpose of ascertaining the existence, location, extent, or quality of any deposit of oil or gas or of any mineral with respect to which a deduction for percentage depletion is not allowable under section 613. The purpose of the expenditure shall be determined by reference to the facts and circumstances at the time the expenditure is paid or incurred.
(c)
Elections
—(1)
Election to deduct under section 617(a).
(i) The election to deduct exploration expenditures under section 617(a) may be made by deducting such expenditures in the taxpayer's income tax return for his first taxable year ending after September 12, 1966, for which the taxpayer desires to deduct exploration expenditures which are paid or incurred by him during such taxable year and after September 12, 1966. This election may be exercised by deducting such exploration expenditures either in the taxpayer's return for such taxable year or in an amended return filed before the expiration of the period for filing a claim for credit or refund of income tax for such taxable year. Where the election is made in an amended return for a taxable year prior to the most recent year for which the taxpayer has filed a return, the taxpayer shall file amended income tax returns, reflecting any increase or decrease in tax attributable to the election, for all subsequent taxable years affected by the election for which he has filed income tax returns before making the election. See section 617(a)(2)(C) and subparagraph (4) of this paragraph for provisions relating to extension of the period of limitations for the assessment of any deficiency for any taxable year to the extent the deficiency is attributable to an election or revocation of an election under section 617(a). In applying the election to the years affected, there shall be taken into account the effect that any adjustments resulting from the election shall have on other items affected thereby (such as the deduction for charitable contributions, the foreign tax credit, net operating loss, and other deductions or credits the amount of which is limited by the taxpayer's income) and the effect that adjustments of any such items have on items of other taxable years. Amended returns filed for taxable years subsequent to the taxable year for which the election under section 617(a) is made by amended return shall, where appropriate, apply the recapture rules of subsections (b), (c), and (d) of section 617. See §§ 1.617-3 and 1.617-4.
(ii) A taxpayer who makes or has made an election under section 617(a) shall state clearly on his income tax
return for each taxable year for which he deducts exploration expenditures the amount of the deduction claimed under section 617(a) with respect to each property or mine. Such property or mine shall be identified by a description adequate to permit application of the recapture rules of section 617 (b), (c), and (d).
(iii) A taxpayer who has made an election under section 617(a) may not make an election under section 615(e) unless, within the period set forth in section 615(e), he revokes his election under section 617(a). A taxpayer who has made and has not revoked an election under section 617(a) may not, in his return for the taxable year for which the election is made or for any subsequent taxable year, charge to capital account any exploration expenditures which are deductible by him under section 617(a); and he must deduct all such expenditures as expenses in computing adjusted gross income. Any exploration expenditures paid or incurred after December 31, 1969, which are not deductible by the taxpayer under section 617(a) solely because of the application of section 617(h) shall be charged to capital account.
(2)
Time for making elections.
The election under section 617(a) may be made at any time before the expiration of the period prescribed for filing a claim for credit or refund of the tax imposed by chapter 1 for the first taxable year for which the taxpayer desires to deduct exploration expenditures under section 617(a).
(3)
Revocation of election to deduct.
(i) A taxpayer may revoke an election made by him under section 617(a) by filing with the Internal Revenue service center with which the taxpayer's income tax return is required to be filed, within the period set forth in subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph, a statement, signed by the taxpayer or his authorized representative, which sets forth that the taxpayer is revoking the section 617(a) election previously made by him and states with whom and where the document making the election was filed. A taxpayer revoking a section 617(a) election shall file amended income tax returns which reflect any increase or decrease in tax attributable to the revocation of election for all taxable years affected by the revocation of election for which he has filed income tax returns before revoking the election. See section 617(a)(2)(C) and subparagraph (4) of this paragraph for provisions relating to extension of the period of limitations for the assessment of any deficiency attributable to an election or revocation of an election under section 617(a). In applying the revocation of election to the years affected, there shall be taken into account the effect that any adjustments resulting from the revocation of election shall have on other items affected thereby (such as the deduction for charitable contributions, the foreign tax credit, net operating loss, and other deductions or credits the amount of which is limited by the taxpayer's income) and the effect that adjustments of any such items have on items of other taxable years.
(ii) An election under section 617(a) may be revoked before the expiration of the last day of the third month following the month in which the final regulations under section 617(a) are published in the
Federal Register.
After the expiration of this period, a taxpayer who has made an election under section 617(a) may not revoke that election unless he obtains the prior consent of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue. Consent will not be granted where a principal purpose for the revocation of the election is to circumvent the recapture provisions of section 517 (b), (c), or (d). The request for consent shall be made in writing to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, Attention T:I:E, Washington, DC 20224. The request shall include in detail:
(
a
) The reason or reasons for the revocation of election under section 617(a);
(
b
) An itemization of the taxpayer's deductions under section 617(a);
(
c
) A description of all properties and detailed information of the exploration activities with respect to which the taxpayer has taken deductions under section 617(a);
(
d
) A description of any development or production activities on all properties with respect to which exploration expenditures were deducted under section 617(a); and
(
e
) A recomputation of the tax for each prior taxable year affected by the
revocation. A letter setting forth the Commissioner's determination will be mailed to the taxpayer. If consent is granted, a copy of the letter granting such consent shall be filed with the director of the Internal Revenue service center with which the taxpayer's income tax return is required to be filed and shall be accompanied by an amended return or returns, if necessary.
(iii) If, before revoking his election, the taxpayer has transferred any mineral property with respect to which he deducted exploration expenditures under section 617(a), to another person in a transaction as a result of which the basis of such property in the hands of the transferee is determined in whole or in part by reference to the basis in the hands of the transferor, the statement submitted pursuant to subdivision (i) of this paragraph shall state that such property has been so transferred, shall identify the transferee, the property transferred, the date of the transfer, and shall indicate the amount of the adjusted exploration expenditures with respect to such property on such date.
(4)
Deficiency attributable to election or revocation of election.
The statutory period for the assessment of any deficiency for any taxable year, to the extent such deficiency is attributable to an election or revocation of an election under section 617(a), shall not expire before the last day of the 2-year period which begins on the day after the date on which such election or revocation of election is made; and such deficiency may be assessed at any time before the expiration of such 2-year period, notwithstanding any law or rule which would otherwise prevent such assessment.
[T.D. 7192, 37 FR 12942, June 30, 1972]
§ 1.617-2
Limitation on amount deductible.
(a)
Expenditures paid or incurred before January 1, 1970.
In the case of expenditures paid or incurred before January 1, 1970, a taxpayer may deduct exploration expenditures paid or incurred during the taxable year with respect to any deposit of ore or other mineral for which a deduction for percentage depletion is allowable under section 613 (other than oil or gas) in the United States or on the Outer Continental Shelf (within the meaning of section 2 of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, as amended and supplemented; 43 U.S.C. 1331).
(b)
Expenditures paid or incurred after December 31, 1969.
In the case of exploration expenditures paid or incurred after December 31, 1969, with respect to any deposit of ore or other mineral for which a deduction for percentage depletion is allowable under section 613 (other than oil or gas), a taxpayer may deduct:
(1) The amount of such expenditures paid or incurred during the taxable year with respect to any such deposit in the United States (as defined in section 638 and the regulations thereunder), and
(2) With respect to any such deposit located outside the United States (as defined in section 638 and the regulations thereunder) the lesser of:
(i) The amount of the exploration expenditures paid or incurred with respect to such deposits during the taxable year, or
(ii) $400,000 minus the sum of the amount to be deducted under subparagraph (1) of this paragraph for the taxable year and all amounts deducted or treated as deferred expenses during all preceding taxable years under section 617 and section 615 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 and section 23(ff) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939. See paragraph (d) of this section for application of the limitation in the case of a transferee of a mining property.
(c)
Examples.
The application of the provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
A, a calendar-year taxpayer who has claimed the benefits of section 615, expended $100,000 for exploration expenditures during the year 1966. For each of the years 1967, 1968, 1969, and 1970 A had exploration costs of $80,000 all with respect to coal deposits located within the United States. A deducted or deferred the maximum amounts allowable for each of the years 1966 ($100,000), 1967 ($80,000), 1968 ($80,000), and 1969 ($80,000). The $80,000 of exploration expenditures for 1970 may be deducted under section 617 by A.

# Example 2.
B, a calendar-year taxpayer claimed deductions of $100,000 per year under section 615 for the years 1968 and 1969. In 1970, B deducted $150,000 under section 617 for exploration conducted with respect to coal
deposits in the United States. In 1971, B paid $150,000 with respect to exploration of tin deposits outside the United States. The maximum amount B may deduct with respect to the foreign exploration in 1971 is $50,000 computed as follows:
(a) Add all amounts deducted or deferred for exploration expenditures by B for all years:
Year
Expenditures
Deducted or deferred
1968
$100,000
$100,000
1969
100,000
100,000
1970
150,000
150,000
Total
350,000
(b) Subtract from $400,000 (the maximum amount allowable to B for deduction of foreign exploration expenditures) the sum of the amounts obtained in (a) $350,000:
Maximum amount allowable to taxpayer
$400,000
Sum of amounts obtained in (a)
350,000
50,000

# Example 3.
Assume the same facts as in example 2 except that in 1971 in addition to the $150,000 paid with respect to exploration outside the United States, B paid $100,000 with respect to exploration within the United States. As the following computation indicates, B may not deduct any amount with respect to the foreign exploration:
(a) Add all amounts deducted or deferred for exploration expenditures in prior years and the exploration expenditures with respect to exploration in the United States to be deducted in 1971:
Year
Expenditures
Deducted or deferred
1968
$100,000
$100,000
1969
100,000
100,000
1970
150,000
150,000
1971
250,000
1
100,000
Total
450,000
1
Domestic.
(b) Because the sum of the amounts obtained in (a), $450,000, exceeds $400,000 no deduction would be allowable to B with respect to foreign exploration expenditures for 1971.
(d)
Transferee of mineral property.
(1) Where an individual or corporation transfers any mining property to the taxpayer, the taxpayer shall take into account for purposes of the $400,000 limitation described in paragraph (b)(ii) of this section all amounts deducted and amounts treated as deferred expenses by the transferor if:
(i) The taxpayer acquired any mineral property from the transferor in a transaction described in section 23(ff)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, excluding the reference therein to section 113(a)(13),
(ii) The taxpayer acquired any mineral property by reason of the acquisition of assets of a corporation in a transaction described in section 381(a) as a result of which the taxpayer succeeds to and takes into account the items described in section 381(c),
(iii) The taxpayer acquired any mineral property under circumstances which make applicable any of the following sections of the Internal Revenue Code:
(
a
) Section 334(b)(1), relating to the liquidation of a subsidiary where the basis of the property in the hands of the distributee is the same as it would be in the hands of the transferor.
(
b
) Section 362 (a) and (b), relating to property acquired by a corporation as paid-in surplus or as a contribution to capital, or in connection with a transaction to which section 351 applies.
(
c
) Section 372(a), relating to reorganization in certain receiverships and bankruptcy proceedings.
(
d
) Section 373(b)(1), relating to property of a railroad corporation acquired in certain bankruptcy or receivership proceedings.
(
e
) Section 1051, relating to property acquired by a corporation that is a member of an affiliated group.
(
f
) Section 1082, relating to property acquired pursuant to a Securities Exchange Commission order.
(2) For purposes of applying the limitations imposed by section 617(h):
(i) The partner, and not the partnership, shall be considered as the taxpayer (see paragraph (a)(8)(iii) of § 1.702-1), and
(ii) An electing small business corporation, as defined in section 1371(b), and not its shareholders, shall be considered as the taxpayer.
(3) For purposes of subparagraph (1)(iii) (
b
) of this paragraph, relating to a transaction to which section 362 (a) and (b) applies or to which section 351 applies:
(i) If mineral property is acquired from a partnership, the transfer shall be considered as having been made by
the individual partners, so that the amounts which each partner has deducted or deferred under sections 615 and 617 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 and section 23(ff) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 shall be taken into account, or
(ii) If an interest in a partnership having mineral property is transferred, the transfer shall be considered as a transfer of mineral property by the partner or partners relinquishing an interest, so that the amounts which each such partner has deducted or deferred under sections 615 and 617 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 and section 23(ff) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 shall be taken into account.
(e)
Examples.
The application of the provisions of this section may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example 1.
A calendar year taxpayer (who has never claimed the benefits of section 617) received in 1970 a mineral deposit from X Corporation upon a distribution in complete liquidation of the latter under conditions which make the provisions of section 334(b)(1) applicable in determining the basis of the property in the hands of the taxpayer. During the year 1969, X Corporation expended $60,000 for exploration expenditures which it elected to treat under section 615(b) as deferred expenses. Subsequent to the transfer the taxpayer made similar expenditures for domestic exploration of $250,000 and $140,000, for the years 1970, and 1971, respectively, which the taxpayer elected to deduct. In 1972, the taxpayer made expenditures for domestic exploration of $100,000 and for foreign exploration of $50,000. The taxpayer may deduct the $100,000 domestic exploration expenditures but may not deduct any portion of the $50,000 of foreign exploration expenditures because the $400,000 limitation of section 617(h) applies.

# Example 2.
In 1971, A and B transfer assets to a corporation in a transfer to which section 351 applied. Among the assets transferred by A is a mineral lease with respect to certain coal lands. A has deducted exploration expenditures under section 615 for the years 1968 and 1969 in the amounts of $50,000 and $100,000, respectively, made with respect to other deposits not included in the transfer to the corporation. The corporation is required to take into account the deductions previously made by A for purpose of applying the $400,000 limitation on deduction of foreign exploration expenditures. Thus, if in 1970 the corporation incurred $400,000 of foreign exploration expenditures, the maximum which it could deduct under section 617(a) is $250,000.
[T.D. 7192, 37 FR 12944, June 30, 1972]
§ 1.617-3
Recapture of exploration expenditures.
(a)
In general.
(1)(i) Except as provided in subparagraphs (2) and (3) of this paragraph, if in any taxable year any mine (as defined in paragraph (c) of this section) with respect to which deductions have been allowed under section 617(a) reaches the producing stage (as defined in paragraph (c) of this section) the deduction for depletion under section 611 (whether determined under § 1.611-2 or under section 613) with respect to the property shall be disallowed for the taxable year and each subsequent taxable year until the aggregate amount of depletion which would be allowable but for section 617(b)(1)(B) and this subparagraph equals the amount of the adjusted exploration expenditures (determined under section 617(f)(1) and paragraph (d) of this section) attributable to the mine. The preceding sentence shall apply notwithstanding the fact that such mine is not in the producing stage at the close of such taxable year. In the case of a taxpayer who owns more than one property in a mine with respect to which he has been allowed deductions under section 617(a), the depletion deduction described in the second preceding sentence shall be disallowed with respect to all of the properties until the aggregate amount of depletion disallowed under section 617(b)(1)(B) is equal to the adjusted exploration expenditures with respect to the mine. In the case of a taxpayer who elects under section 614(c)(1) to aggregate a mine, with respect to which he has been allowed deductions under section 617(a), with another mine, no deduction for depletion will be allowable under section 611 with respect to the aggregated property until the amount of depletion disallowed under section 617(b)(1)(B) equals the adjusted exploration expenditures attributable to all of the producing mines included in the aggregated property.
(ii) If a taxpayer who has made an election under section 617(a) receives or accrues a bonus or royalty with respect to a mining property with respect
to which deductions have been allowed under section 617(a), the deduction for depletion under section 611 with respect to such bonus or royalty (whether determined under § 1.611-2 or under section 613) shall be disallowed for the taxable year of receipt or accrual and each subsequent taxable year until the aggregate amount of the depletion disallowed under section 617(c) and this section equals the amount of the adjusted exploration expenditures with respect to the property to which the bonus or royalty relates. The preceding sentence shall not apply if the bonus or royalty is paid with respect to a mineral for which a deduction is not allowable under section 617(a). In the case of the disposal of coal or domestic iron ore with a retained economic interest, see paragraph (a)(2) of § 1.617-4.
(2) If the taxpayer so elects with respect to all mines as to which deductions have been allowed under section 617(a) and which reach the producing stage during the taxable year, he shall include in gross income (but not
gross income from the property
for purposes of section 613) for such taxable year an amount equal to the adjusted exploration expenditures (determined under section 617(f)(1) and paragraph (d) of this section) with respect to all of such mines. The amount so included in income shall be treated for purposes of subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code as expenditures which are paid or incurred on the respective dates on which the mines reach the producing stage and which are properly chargeable to capital account. The fact that a taxpayer does not make the election described in this subparagraph for a taxable year during which mines with respect to which deductions have been allowed under section 617(a) reach the producing stage shall not preclude the taxpayer from making the election with respect to other mines which reach the producing stage during subsequent taxable years. However, the election described in this subparagraph may not be made for any taxable year with respect to any mines which reached the producing stage during a preceding taxable year.
(3) The provisions of section 617(b)(1) and subparagraphs (1) and (2) of this paragraph do not apply in the case of any deposit of oil or gas. For example, A in exploring for sulphur incurred $500,000 of exploration expenditures which he deducted under section 617(a). In the following year, A did not find sulphur but on the same mineral property located commercially marketable quantities of oil and gas. In computing the depletion allowance with respect to the oil and gas, no depletion would be disallowed because of section 617(b)(1).
(4) In the case of exploration expenditures which are paid or incurred with respect to a mining property which contains more than one mine, the provisions of subparagraphs (1) and (2) of this paragraph shall apply only to the amount of the adjusted exploration expenditures properly chargeable to the mine or mines which reach the producing stage during the taxable year. For example, A owns a mining property which contains mines X, Y, and Z. For 1970, A deducted under section 617(a), $250,000 with respect to X, $100,000 with respect to Y and $70,000 with respect to Z. In 1971, mine X reaches the producing stage. At that time, A will only have to recapture the $250,000 attributable to mine X.
(b)
Manner and time for making election.
(1) A taxpayer will be deemed not to have elected pursuant to section 617(b)(1)(A) and paragraph (a)(2) of this section unless he clearly indicates such election on his income tax return for the taxable year in which the mine with respect to which deductions were allowed under section 617(a) reaches the producing stage.
(2) The election described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section may be made (or changed) not later than the time prescribed by law for filing the return (including extensions thereof) for the taxable year in which the mine with respect to which deductions were allowed under section 617(a) reaches the producing stage.
(c)
Definitions
—(1)
Mine.
The term
mine
includes all quarries, pits, shafts, and wells, and any other excavations or workings for the purpose of extracting any known deposit of ore or other mineral.
(2)
Producing stage.
A mine will be considered to have reached the producing stage when (i) the major portion of the mineral production is obtained
from workings other than those opened for the purpose of development, or (ii) the principal activity of the mine is the production of developed ores or minerals rather than the development of additional ores or minerals for mining.
(3)
Mining property.
The term
mining property
means any property (as the term is defined in section 614(a) after the application of subsections (c) and (e) thereof) with respect to which any expenditures allowed as deductions under section 617(a) are properly chargeable.
(d)
Adjusted exploration expenditures
—(1)
In general.
The term
adjusted exploration expenditures
means, with respect to any property or mine:
(i) The aggregate amount of the expenditures allowed as deductions under section 617(a) for the taxable year and all preceding taxable years to the taxpayer or any other person which are properly chargeable to such property or mine and which (but for the election under section 617(a)) would be reflected in the adjusted basis of such property or mine, reduced by
(ii) The excess, if any, of the amount which would have been allowable for all taxable years under section 613 but for the deduction of such expenditures over the amount allowable for depletion under section 611 (determined without regard to section 617(b)(1)(B)). The amount determined under the preceding sentence shall be reduced by the aggregate of the amounts included in gross income for the taxable year and all preceding taxable years under section 617(b) or (c) and the amount treated under section 617(d) as gain from the sale or exchange of the property which is neither a capital asset nor property described in section 1231.
(iii) If a taxpayer pays or incurs exploration expenditures on a property which contains a producing mine and if such taxpayer deducts any portion of such expenditures under section 617(a), an amount equal to the amount so deducted shall be taken into account in computing the taxpayer's
taxable income from the property
for the purposes of the limitation on the percentage depletion deduction under section 613(a) and the regulations thereunder. The amount of the adjusted exploration expenditures with respect to the producing mine shall be reduced by an amount equal to the amount by which the taxpayer's deduction under 617(a) (described in the preceding sentence) reduces the taxpayer's deduction for depletion for the taxable year. See example 1 in subparagraph (6) of this paragraph.
(iv) For purposes of § 1.617-4, the aggregate amount of adjusted exploration expenditures with respect to a mining property includes the aggregate amount of adjusted exploration expenditures properly allocable to all mines on such property.
(v) (
a
) For purposes of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the aggregate amount of the adjusted exploration expenditures is determined as of the close of the taxpayer's taxable year.
(
b
) For purposes of § 1.617-4, the aggregate amount of the adjusted exploration expenditures is determined as of the date of the disposition of the mining property or portion thereof.
(2)
Adjustments for certain expenditures of other taxpayers or in respect of other property.
(i) For purposes of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, the exploration expenditures which must be taken into account in determining the adjusted exploration expenditures with respect to any property or mine are not limited to those expenditures with respect to the property disposed of or which entered the production stage nor are such expenditures limited to those deducted by the taxpayer. For the manner of determining the amount of adjusted exploration expenditures immediately after certain dispositions, see subparagraph (4) of this paragraph.
(ii) If a transferee who at the time of the transfer has not made an election under section 617(a) (including a transferee who has made an election under section 615(e)) receives mineral property in a transaction in which the basis of such property in his hands is determined in whole or in part by reference to its basis in the hands of the transferor and with respect to such property the transferor has deducted exploration expenditures under section 617(a), the adjusted exploration expenditures immediately after such transfer shall be
treated as exploration expenditures allowed as deductions under section 617(a) to the transferee.
(iii) If a transferee who makes an election under section 617(a) receives mineral property in a transaction in which the basis of such property in his hands is determined in whole or in part by reference to the basis of such property in the hands of the transferor and the transferor had in effect at the time of the transfer an election under section 615(e), an amount equal to the total of the amounts allowed as deductions to the transferor under section 615 with respect to the transferred property shall be treated as expenditures allowed as deductions under section 617(a) to the transferee. The preceding sentence shall not apply to expenditures which could not have been reflected in the basis of the property in the hands of the transferee had the transferor not made the section 615(e) election.
(iv) The provisions of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
On July 14, 1969, A purchased mineral property Z for $10,000. After deducting exploration expenditures of $20,000 under section 617(a), A transferred the property to his son as a gift on July 9, 1970. Since the exception for gifts in section 617(d)(3) (by incorporation by reference of the provisions of section 1245(b)(1)) applies, A does not recognize gain under section 617(d). On September 30, 1972 after deducting exploration expenditures of $150,000 under section 617(a), the son transfers the mineral property to corporation X in a transaction under which no gain is recognized by the son under section 351. Since the exception of section 617(d)(3) (by incorporation by reference of the provisions of section 1245(b)(3)) applies, the son does not recognize gain under section 617(d). On November 14, 1972, corporation X sells the mineral property. No deductions for exploration expenditures were taken by corporation X. The amount of the adjusted exploration expenditures with respect to mineral property Z to be recaptured by corporation X upon such sale is $170,000 (the total amount deducted by A and the son).

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in example 1 except that A deducted the $20,000 of exploration expenditures under section 615(a). The amount of the adjusted exploration expenditures with respect to mineral property Z in corporation X's hands is $170,000 (the $20,000 deducted under section 615(a) by A plus the $150,000 deducted under section 617(a) by the son).
(3)
Allocation of certain expenditures.
A project area consists of that territory which the taxpayer has determined by analysis of certain variables (the size and topography of the area to be explored, existing information with respect to that area and nearby areas, and the quantity of equipment, men, and money available) can be explored advantageously as a single integrated operation. If exploration expenditures are paid or incurred with respect to a project area and one or more areas of interest are identified within such project area, the entire amount of such expenditures shall be allocated equally to each such area of interest. If an area of interest contains one or more mines or deposits the expenditures allocable to such area of interest shall be allocated (i) if only one mine or deposit is located or identified, entirely to such mine or deposit, or (ii) if more than one mine or deposit is located or identified, equally among the various mines or deposits located. For purposes of this subparagraph, the term
area of interest
means each separable, noncontiguous portion of the project area which is identified as possessing sufficient mineral-producing potential to merit further exploration. The provisions of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following example: A pays $100,000 for the exploration of a project area which results in the identification of two areas of interest. A pays an additional $60,000 for the exploration of one of the areas of interest in which he locates mineral deposit X and mineral deposit Y. With respect to the exploration of deposit X he incurs an additional $100,000 of expenses and with respect to deposit Y he incurs an additional $200,000 of expenses. The exploration expenditures properly attributable to deposit X would be $155,000 ($100,000 plus one-half of $50,000 plus one-half of $60,000) and the exploration expenditures properly attributable to deposit Y would be $255,000 ($200,000 plus one-half of $50,000 plus one-half of $60,000).
(4)
Partnership distributions.
The adjusted exploration expenditures with respect to any property or mine received by a taxpayer in a distribution with respect to all or part of his interest in a partnership (i) include the adjusted exploration expenditures (not
otherwise included under section 617(f)(1)) with respect to such property or mine immediately prior to such distribution and (ii) shall be reduced by the amount of gain to which section 751(b) applies realized by the partnership (as constituted after the distribution) on the distribution of such property or mine. In the case of any property or mine held by a partnership after a distribution to a partner to which section 751(b) applies, the adjusted exploration expenditures with respect to such property or mine shall be reduced by the amount of gain (if any) to which section 751(b) applies realized by such partner with respect to such distribution on account of such property or mine.
(5)
Amount of transferee's adjusted exploration expenditures immediately after certain acquisitions
—(i)
Transactions in which basis is determined by reference to the cost or fair market value of the property transferred.
(
a
) If on the date a person acquires mining property his basis for the property is determined solely by reference to its cost (within the meaning of section 1012), then on such date the amount of the adjusted exploration expenditures for the mining property in such person's hands is zero.
(
b
) If on the date a person acquires mining property his basis for the property is determined solely by reason of the application of section 301(d) (relating to basis of property received in corporate distribution) or section 334(a) (relating to basis of property received in a liquidation in which gain or loss is recognized), then on such date the amount of the adjusted exploration expenditures for the mining property in such person's hands is zero.
(
c
) If on the date a person acquires mining property his basis for the property is determined solely under the provisions of section 334(b)(2) or (c) (relating to basis of property received in certain corporate liquidations), then on such date the amount of the adjusted exploration expenditures for the mining property in such person's hands is zero.
(
d
) If on the date a person acquires mining property from a decedent such person's basis is determined, by reason of the application of section 1014(a), solely by reference to the fair market value of the property on the date of the decedent's death or on the applicable date provided in section 2032 (relating to alternate valuation date), then on the date of acquisition the amount of the adjusted exploration expenditures for the mining property in such person's hands is zero.
(ii)
Gifts and certain tax-free transactions.
(
a
) If mining property is disposed of in a transaction described in (
b
) of this subdivision (ii), then the amount of the adjusted exploration expenditures for the mining property in the hands of a transferee immediately after the disposition shall be an amount equal to:
(
1
) The amount of the adjusted exploration expenditures with respect to the mining property in the hands of the transferor immediately before the disposition, minus
(
2
) The amount of any gain taken into account under section 617(d) by the transferor upon the disposition.
(
b
) The transactions referred to in paragraph (d)(5)(ii)(
a
) of this section are:
(
1
) A disposition that is in part a sale or exchange and in part a gift;
(
2
) A disposition that is described in section 617(d) through the incorporation by reference of the provisions of section 1245(b)(3) (relating to certain tax free transactions); or
(
3
) A transfer at death where basis of property in the hands of the transferee is determined under section 1022.
(iii)
Property acquired from a decedent.
If mining property is acquired in a transfer at death to which section 617(d) applies through incorporation by reference of the provisions of section 1245(b)(2), the amount of the adjusted exploration expenditures with respect to the mining property in the hands of the transferee immediately after the transfer shall include the amount, if any, of the exploration expenditures deducted by the transferee before the decedent's death, to the extent that the basis of the mining property (determined under section 1014(a)) is required to be reduced under the second sentence of section 1014(b)(9) (relating to adjustments to basis where the property is acquired from a decedent prior to his death).
(6)
Examples.
The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
A owns the working interest in a large tract of land located in the United States. A's interest in the entire tract of land constitutes one property for purposes of section 614. In the northwest corner of this tract is an operating mine, X, producing an ore of beryllium, which is entitled to a percentage depletion rate of 22 percent under section 613(b)(2)(B). During 1971, A conducts an exploration program in the southeast corner of this same tract of land, and he incurs $400,000 of expenditures to which section 617(a)(1) applies in connection with this exploration program. A elects to deduct this amount as expenses under section 617(a). During 1971, A's
gross income from the property
computed under section 613 was $1 million, with respect to the property encompassing mine X and the area in which exploration was conducted. A's
taxable income from the property
computed under section 613, before adjustment to reflect the deductions taken with respect to the property during the year under section 617, was $400,000. The cost depletion deduction allowable and deducted with respect to the property during 1971 was $50,000. The amount of adjusted exploration expenditures chargeable to the exploratory mine (hereinafter referred to as mine Y) at the close of 1971 is $250,000, computed as follows:
Expenditures allowed as deductions under sec. 617(a)
$400,000
Gross income from the property
$1,000,000
22 percent thereof
220,000
Taxable income from the property, before adjustment to reflect deductions allowed under sec. 617 during year
400,000
50 percent thereof—tentative deduction
200,000
Taxable income from the property after adjustment to reflect deductions allowed under sec. 617 during year ($400,000 minus $400,000)
0
Cost depletion allowed for year
50,000
Amount by which allowance for depletion under sec. 611 was reduced on account of deductions under sec. 617 ($200,000 minus $50,000)
150,000
Adjusted exploration expenditures at end of 1971
250,000

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in example 1. Assume further that mine Y, with respect to which exploration expenditures were deducted in 1971, enters the producing stage in 1972, and that no deductions were taken under section 617 with respect to that mine after 1971. A does not make an election under section 617(b)(1)(A) during 1972. Assume that the depletion deduction which would be allowable for 1972 with respect to the property (which includes both mines) but for the application of section 617(b)(1)(B) is $100,000. Pursuant to section 617(b)(1)(B), this depletion deduction is disallowed. Therefore, the amount of adjusted exploration expenditures with respect to mine Y at the end of 1972 is $150,000 ($250,000 less $100,000).
[T.D. 7192, 37 FR 12945, June 30, 1972, as amended by T.D. 9811, 82 FR 6238, Jan. 19, 2017]
§ 1.617-4
Treatment of gain from disposition of certain mining property.
(a)
In general.
(1) In general, section 617(d)(1) provides, that, upon a disposition of mining property, the lower of (i) the
adjusted exploration expenditures
(as defined in section 617(f)(1) and paragraph (d) of § 1.617-3) with respect to the property, or (ii) the amount, if any, by which the amount realized on the sale, exchange, or involuntary conversion (or the fair market value of the property on any other disposition, exceeds the adjusted basis of the property, shall be treated as gain from the sale of exchange of property which is neither a capital asset nor property described in section 1231 (that is, shall be recognized as ordinary income). However, any amount recognized under the preceding sentence shall not be included by the taxpayer in his
gross income from the property
for purposes of section 613. Generally, the ordinary income treatment applies even though in the absence of section 617(d) no gain would be recognized under any other provision of the Code. For example, if a corporation distributes mining property as a dividend, gain may be recognized as ordinary income to the corporation even though, in the absence of section 617, section 311(a) would preclude any recognition of gain to the corporation. For an exception to the recognition of gain with respect to dispositions which involve mineral production payments, see section 636 and the regulations thereunder. For the definition of the term
mining property,
see section 617(f)(2) and paragraph (c)(3), of § 1.617-3. For exceptions and limitations to the application of section 617(d)(1), see section 617(d)(3) and paragraph (c) of this section.
(2) In the case of a sale, exchange, or involuntary conversion of mining property, the gain to which section 617(d)(1) applies is the lower of the adjusted exploration expenditures with respect to such property or the excess of the amount realized upon the disposition of the property over the adjusted basis of the property. In the case of a disposition of mining property other than by a manner described in the preceding sentence, the gain to which section 617(d)(1) applies is the lower of the adjusted exploration expenditures with respect to such property or the excess of the fair market value of the property on the date of disposition over the adjusted basis of the property. In the case of a disposal of coal or domestic iron ore subject to a retained economic interest to which section 631(c) applies, the excess of the amount realized over the adjusted basis of the mining property shall be treated as equal to the gain, if any, referred to in section 631(c). For determination of the amount realized upon a disposition of mining property and nonmining property, see paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section.
(3) The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
On July 14, 1970, A purchased undeveloped mining property for $100,000. During 1970, A incurred with respect to the property, $50,000 of exploration expenditures which he deducts under section 617(a). In 1971, A incurred $150,000 of exploration expenditures with respect to the property which he deducts on his income tax return. On January 2, 1972, A sells the mining property to B for $250,000. A's gain on the sale is $150,000 ($250,000 amount realized minus $100,000 basis). Since the excess of the amount realized over the adjusted basis of the mining property is less than the adjusted exploration expenditures with respect to the property ($200,000), the entire gain is treated as ordinary income under section 617(d)(1).

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in example 1 except that A sells the mining property to B for $400,000, thereby realizing gain of $300,000 ($400,000 minus $100,000 basis). Since the amount of adjusted exploration expenditures with respect to the mining property ($200,000) is less than the amount realized upon its disposition ($300,000), an amount equal to the amount of adjusted exploration expenditures is treated as ordinary income under section 617(d)(1). The remaining $100,000 is treated by A without regard to section 617(d)(1).
(4) Section 617(d) does not apply to losses. Thus, section 617(d) does not apply if a loss is realized upon a sale, exchange, or involuntary conversion of mining property, nor does section 617(d) apply to a disposition of mining property other than by way of sale, exchange, or involuntary conversion if at the time of the disposition the fair market value of such property is not greater than its adjusted basis.
(b)
Disposition of portion of mining property.
(1) For purposes of section 617(d)(1) and paragraph (a) of this section, except as provided in subparagraph (3) of this paragraph, in the case of the disposition of a portion of a mining property (other than an undivided interest), the entire amount of the adjusted exploration expenditures with respect to such property shall be treated as attributable to such portion to the extent of the amount of the gain to which section 617(d)(1) applies. If the amount of the gain to which section 617(d)(1) applies is less than the amount of the adjusted exploration expenditures with respect to the property, the balance of the adjusted exploration expenditures shall remain subject to recapture in the hands of the taxpayer under the provisions of section 617 (b), (c), and (d). The disposition of a portion of a mining property (other than an undivided interest) includes the disposition of a geographical portion of a mining property. For example, assume that A owns an 80-acre tract of land with respect to which he has deducted exploration expenditures under section 617(a). If A were to sell the north 40 acres, the entire amount of the adjusted exploration expenditures with respect to the 80-acre tract would be treated as attributable to the 40-acre portion sold (to the extent of the amount of the gain to which section 617(d)(1) applies).
(2) For purposes of section 617(d)(1), except as provided in subparagraph (3) of this paragraph, in the case of the disposition of an undivided interest in a mining property (or portion thereof) a proportionate part of the adjusted exploration expenditures with respect to such property shall be treated as attributable to such undivided interest to
the extent of the amount of the gain to which section 617(d)(1) applies. For example, assume that A owns an 80-acre tract of land with respect to which he has deducted exploration expenditures under section 617(a). If A were to sell an undivided 40 percent interest in such tract, 40 percent of the adjusted exploration expenditures with respect to the 80-acre tract would be treated as attributable to the 40 percent of the 80-acre tract disposed of (to the extent of the amount of the gain to which section 617(d)(1) applies).
(3) Section 617(d)(2) and subparagraphs (1) and (2) of this paragraph shall not apply to any expenditure to the extent that such expenditure relates neither to the portion (or interest therein) disposed of nor to any mine, in the property held by the taxpayer before the disposition, which has reached the producing stage. In any case where a taxpayer disposes of a mining property (or interest therein) and treats adjusted exploration expenditures with respect to the mining property as if they relate neither to the portion (or interest therein) disposed of nor to any mine, in the property held by the taxpayer before the disposition, which has reached the producing stage, the taxpayer shall attach to its return for the taxable year in which the disposition occurred, a statement which includes:
(i) A description of the portion (or interest therein) disposed of;
(ii) A description of the mineral property which included the portion (or interest therein) disposed of;
(iii) An itemization of all expenditures deducted under sections 617 and 615 with respect to such mineral property; and
(iv) A description of the location of all producing mines on such mineral property.
(c)
Exceptions.
(1)(i) Section 617(d)(3) provides, through incorporation by reference of the provisions of section 1245(b)(1), that no gain shall be recognized under section 617(d) upon a disposition by gift of mining property. For purposes of this paragraph (c), the term
gift
means, except to the extent that paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section applies, a transfer of mining property that, in the hands of the transferee, has a basis determined under the provisions of section 1015(a) or 1015(d) (relating to basis of property acquired by gift) or section 1022 (relating to the basis of property acquired from certain decedents who died in 2010). For reduction in amount of the charitable contribution in case of a gift of section 617 property, see section 170(e) and paragraph (c)(3) of § 1.170-1.
(ii) Where a disposition of mining property is in part a sale or exchange and in part a gift, the gain to which section 617(d) applies is the lower of the adjusted exploration expenditures with respect to such property or the excess of the amount realized upon the disposition of the property over the adjusted basis of such property.
(2) Section 617(d)(3) provides, through incorporation by reference of the provisions of section 1245(b)(2), that, except as provided in section 691 (relating to income in respect to a decedent), no gain shall be recognized under section 617(d) upon a transfer at death. For purposes of this paragraph, the term
transfer at death
means a transfer of mining property which property, in the hands of the transferee, has a basis determined under the provisions of section 1014(a) (relating to basis of property acquired from a decedent) because of the death of the transferor.
(3)(i) Section 617(d) provides, through incorporation by reference of the provisions of section 1245(b)(3), that upon a transfer of property described in subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph, the amount of gain taken into account by the transferor under section 617(d) shall not exceed the amount of gain recognized to the transferor on the transfer (determined without regard to section 617). For purposes of this subdivision, in case of a transfer of mining property and nonmining property in one transaction, the amount realized from the disposition of the mining property shall be deemed to be equal to the amount which bears the same ratio to the total amount realized as the fair market value of the mining property bears to the aggregate fair market value of all of the property transferred. The preceding sentence shall be applied solely for purposes of computing the portion of the total gain (determined without regard to section 617) which shall be recognized as ordinary income
under section 617(d). Section 617(d)(3) does not apply to a disposition of mining property to an organization (other than a cooperative described in section 521) which is exempt from the tax imposed by chapter 1 of the Code.
(ii) The transfers referred to in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph are transfers of mining property in which the basis of the mining property in the hands of the transferee is determined by reference to its basis in the hands of the transferor by reason of the application of any of the following provisions:
(
a
) Section 332 (relating to distributions in complete liquidation of an 80-percent-or-more controlled subsidiary corporation). See subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph.
(
b
) Section 351 (relating to transfer to a corporation controlled by transferor).
(
c
) Section 361 (relating to exchanges pursuant to certain corporate reorganizations).
(
d
) Section 371(a) (relating to exchanges pursuant to certain receivership and bankruptcy proceedings).
(
e
) Section 374(a) (relating to exchanges pursuant to certain railroad reorganizations).
(
f
) Section 721 (relating to transfers to a partnership in exchange for a partnership interest).
(
g
) Section 731 (relating to distributions by a partnership to a partner).
(iii) In the case of a distribution in complete liquidation of an 80-percent-or-more controlled subsidiary to which section 332 applies, the limitation provided in section 617(d)(3), through incorporation by reference of the provisions of section 1245(b)(3), is confined to instances in which the basis of the mining property in the hands of the transferee is determined under section 334(b)(1), by reference to its basis in the hands of the transferor. Thus, for example, the limitation may apply in respect of a liquidating distribution of mining property by an 80-percent-or-more controlled corporation to the parent corporation, but does not apply in respect of a liquidating distribution of mining property to a minority shareholder. Section 617(d)(3) does not apply to a liquidating distribution of property by an 80-percent-or-more controlled subsidiary to its parent if the parent's basis for the property is determined, under section 334(b)(2), by reference to its basis in the stock of the subsidiary.

# Sales and Exchanges
§ 1.631-1
Election to consider cutting as sale or exchange.
(a)
Effect of election.
(1) Section 631 (a) provides an election to certain taxpayers to treat the difference between the actual cost or other basis of certain timber cut during the taxable year and its fair market value as standing timber on the first day of such year as gain or loss from a sale or exchange under section 1231. Thereafter, any subsequent gain or loss shall be determined in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section.
(2) For the purposes of section 631(a) and this section, timber shall be considered cut at the time when in the ordinary course of business the quantity of timber felled is first definitely determined.
(3) The election may be made with respect to any taxable year even though such election was not made with respect to a previous taxable year. If an election has been made under the provisions of section 631(a), or corresponding provisions of prior internal revenue laws, such election shall be binding upon the taxpayer not only for the taxable year for which the election is made but also for all subsequent taxable years, unless the Commissioner on showing by the taxpayer of undue hardship permits the taxpayer to revoke his election for such subsequent taxable years. If the taxpayer has revoked a previous election, such revocation shall preclude any further elections unless the taxpayer obtains the consent of the Commissioner.
(4) Such election shall apply with respect to all timber which the taxpayer
has owned, or has had a contract right to cut, for a period of more than 1 year (6 months for taxable years beginning before 1977; 9 months for taxable years beginning in 1977) prior to when such timber is cut for sale or for use in the taxpayer's trade or business, irrespective of whether such timber or contract right was acquired before or after the election. (For purposes of the preceding sentence, the rules with respect to the holding period of property contained in section 1223 shall be applicable.) However, timber which is not cut for sale or for use in the taxpayer's trade or business (for example, firewood cut for the taxpayer's own household consumption) shall not be considered to have been sold or exchanged upon the cutting thereof.
(b)
Who may make election.
(1) A taxpayer who has owned, or has held a contract right to cut, timber for a period of more than 1 year (6 months for taxable years beginning before 1977; 9 months for taxable years beginning in 1977) prior to when the timber is cut may elect under section 631(a) to consider the cutting of such timber during such year for sale or for use in the taxpayer's trade or business as a sale or exchange of the timber so cut. In order to have a
contract right to cut timber
within the meaning of section 631(a) and this section, a taxpayer must have a right to sell the timber cut under the contract on his own account or to use such cut timber in his trade or business.
(2) For purposes of section 631(a) and this section, the term
timber
includes evergreen trees which are more than six years old at the time severed from their roots and are sold for ornamental purposes, such as Christmas decorations. Section 631(a) is not applicable to evergreen trees which are sold in a live state, whether or not for ornamental purposes. Tops and other parts of standing timber are not considered as evergreen trees within the meaning of section 631(a). The term
evergreen trees
is used in its commonly accepted sense and includes pine, spruce, fir, hemlock, cedar, and other coniferous trees.
(c)
Manner of making election.
The election under section 631(a) must be made by the taxpayer in his income tax return for the taxable year for which the election is applicable, and such election cannot be made in an amended return for such year. The election in the return shall take the form of a computation under the provisions of section 631(a) and section 1231.
(d)
Computation of gain or loss under the election.
(1) If the cutting of timber is considered as a sale or exchange pursuant to an election made under section 631(a), gain or loss shall be recognized to the taxpayer in an amount equal to the difference between the adjusted basis for depletion in the hands of the taxpayer of the timber which has been cut during the taxable year and the fair market value of such timber as of the first day of the taxable year in which such timber is cut. The adjusted basis for depletion of the cut timber shall be based upon the number of units of timber cut during the taxable year which are considered to be sold or exchanged and upon the depletion unit of the timber in the timber account or accounts pertaining to the timber cut, and shall be computed in the same manner as is provided in section 611 and the regulations thereunder with respect to the computation of the allowance for depletion.
(2) The fair market value of the timber as of the first day of the taxable year in which such timber is cut shall be determined, subject to approval or revision by the district director upon examination of the taxpayer's return, by the taxpayer in the light of the most reliable and accurate information available with reference to the condition of the property as it existed at that date, regardless of all subsequent changes, such as changes in surrounding circumstances, methods of exploitation, degree of utilization, etc. The value sought will be the selling price, assuming a transfer between a willing seller and a willing buyer as of that particular day. Due consideration will be given to the factors and the principles involved in the determination of the fair market value of timber as described in the regulations under section 611.
(3) The fair market value as of the beginning of the taxable year of the standing timber cut during the year shall be considered to be the cost of
such timber, in lieu of the actual cost or other basis of such timber, for all purposes for which such cost is a necessary factor. See paragraph (e) of this section.
(4) For any taxable year for which the cutting of timber is considered to be a sale or exchange of such timber under section 631(a), the timber so cut shall be considered as property used in the trade or business for the purposes of section 1231, along with other property of the taxpayer used in the trade or business as defined in section 1231(b), regardless of whether such timber is property of a kind which would properly be includible in the inventory of the taxpayer if on hand at the close of the taxable year or property held by the taxpayer primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of his trade or business. Whether the gain or loss considered to have resulted from the cutting of the timber will be considered to be gain or loss resulting from the sale or exchange of capital assets held for more than 1 year (6 months for taxable years beginning before 1977; 9 months for taxable years beginning in 1977) depends upon the application of section 1231 to the taxpayer for the taxable year. See section 1231 and the regulations thereunder.
(e)
Computation of subsequent gain or loss.
(1) In case the products of the timber are sold after cutting, either in the form of logs or lumber or in the form of manufactured products, the income from such actual sales shall be considered ordinary income. When the election under section 631(a) is in effect, the cost of standing timber cut during the taxable year is determined as if the taxpayer had purchased such timber on the first day of the taxable year. Thus, in determining the cost of the products so sold, the cost of the timber shall be the fair market value on the first day of the taxable year in which the standing timber was cut, in lieu of the actual cost or other basis of such timber.
(2) This is also the rule in case the products of the timber cut during one taxable year, with respect to which an election has been made under section 631(a), are sold during a subsequent taxable year, whether or not the election provided in section 631(a) is applicable with respect to such subsequent year. If the products of the timber cut during a taxable year with respect to which an election under section 631(a) was made were not sold during such year and are included in inventory at the close of such year, the fair market value as of the beginning of the year of the timber cut during the year shall be used in lieu of the actual cost of such timber in computing the closing inventory for such year and the opening inventory for the succeeding year. With respect to the costs applicable in the determination of the amount of such inventories, there shall be included the fair market value of the timber cut, the costs of cutting, logging, and all other expenses incident to the cost of converting the standing timber into the products in inventory. See section 471 and the regulations thereunder. The fact that the fair market value as of the first day of the taxable year in which the timber is cut is deemed to be the cost of such timber shall not preclude the taxpayer from computing its inventories upon the basis of cost or market, whichever is lower, if such is the method used by the taxpayer. Nor shall it preclude the taxpayer from computing its inventories under the last-in, first-out inventory method provided by section 472 if such section is applicable to, and has been elected by, the taxpayer.

§ 1.631-2
Gain or loss upon the disposal of timber under cutting contract.
(a)
In general.
(1) If an owner disposes of timber held for more than 1 year (6 months for taxable years beginning before 1977; 9 months for taxable years beginning in 1977) before such disposal, under any form or type of contract whereby he retains an economic interest in such timber, the disposal shall be considered to be a sale of such timber. The difference between the amounts realized from disposal of such timber in any taxable year and the adjusted basis for depletion thereof shall be considered to be a gain or loss upon the sale of such timber for such year. Such adjusted basis shall be computed in the same manner as provided in section 611
and the regulations thereunder with respect to the allowance for depletion. See paragraph (e)(2) of this section for definition of
owner.
For the purpose of determining whether or not the timber disposed of was held for more than 1 year (6 months for taxable years beginning before 1977; 9 months for taxable years beginning in 1977) before such disposal the rules with respect to the holding period of property contained in section 1223 shall be applicable.
(2) In the case of such a disposal, the provisions of section 1231 apply and such timber shall be considered to be property used in the trade or business for the taxable year in which it is considered to have been sold, along with other property of the taxpayer used in the trade or business as defined in section 1231(b), regardless of whether such timber is property held by the taxpayer primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of his trade or business. Whether gain or loss resulting from the disposition of the timber which is considered to have been sold will be deemed to be gain or loss resulting from a sale of a capital asset held for more than 1 year (6 months for taxable years beginning before 1977; 9 months for taxable years beginning in 1977) will depend upon the application of section 1231 to the taxpayer for the taxable year.
(b)
Determination of date of disposal.
(1) For purposes of section 631(b) and this section, the date of disposal of timber shall be deemed to be the date such timber is cut. However, if payment is made to the owner under the contract for timber before such timber is cut the owner may elect to treat the date of payment as the date of disposal of such timber. Such election shall be effective only for purposes of determining the holding period of such timber. Neither section 631(b) nor the election thereunder has any effect on the time of reporting gain or loss. See subchapter E, chapter 1 of the Code and the regulations thereunder. See paragraph (c)(2) of this section for the effect of exercising the election with respect to the payment for timber held for 1 year (6 months for taxable years beginning before 1977; 9 months for taxable years beginning in 1977) or less. See paragraph (d) of this section for the treatment of payments received in advance of cutting.
(2) For purposes of section 631(b) and this section, the
date such timber is cut
means the date when in the ordinary course of business the quantity of timber felled is first definitely determined.
(c)
Manner and effect of election to treat date of payment as the date of disposal.
(1) The election to treat the date of payment as the date of disposal of timber shall be evidenced by a statement attached to the taxpayer's income tax return filed on or before the due date (including extensions thereof) for the taxable year in which the payment is received. The statement shall specify the advance payments which are subject to the election and shall identify the contract under which the payments are made. However, in no case shall the time for making the election under section 631(b) expire before the close of March 21, 1958.
(2) Where the election to treat the date of payment as the date of disposal is made with respect to a payment made in advance of cutting, and such payment is made 1 year (6 months for taxable years beginning before 1977; 9 months for taxable years beginning in 1977) or less from the date the timber disposed of was acquired, section 631(b) shall not apply to such payment irrespective of the date such timber is cut, since the timber was not held for more than six months prior to disposal.
(d)
Payments received in advance of cutting.
(1) Where the conditions of paragraph (a) of this section are met, amounts received or accrued prior to cutting (such as advance royalty payments or minimum royalty payments) shall be treated under section 631(b) as realized from the sale of timber if the contract of disposal provides that such amounts are to be applied as payment for timber subsequently cut. Such amounts will be so treated irrespective of whether or not an election has been made under paragraph (c) of this section to treat the date of payment as the date of disposal. For example, if no election has been made under paragraph (c) of this section, amounts received or accrued prior to cutting will be treated as realized from the sale of timber, provided the timber paid for is
cut more than 1 year (6 months for taxable years beginning before 1977; 9 months for taxable years beginning in 1977) after the date of acquisition of such timber.
(2) However, if the right to cut timber under the contract expires, terminates, or is abandoned before the timber which has been paid for is cut, the taxpayer shall treat payments attributable to the uncut timber as ordinary income and not as received from the sale of timber under section 631(b). Accordingly, the taxpayer shall recompute his tax liability for the taxable year in which such payments were received or accrued. The recomputation shall be made in the form of an amended return where necessary.
(3)(i) Bonuses received or accrued by an owner in connection with the grant of a contract of disposal shall be treated under section 631(b) as amounts realized from the sale of timber to the extent attributable to timber held for more than 1 year (6 months for taxable years beginning before 1977; 9 months for taxable years beginning in 1977).
(ii) The adjusted depletion basis attributable to the bonus shall be determined under the provisions of section 612 and the regulations thereunder. This subdivision may be illustrated as follows:

# Example.
Taxpayer A has held timber having a depletion basis of $90,000 for two months when he enters into a contract of disposal with B. B pays A a bonus of $5,000 upon the execution of the contract and agrees to pay X dollars per unit of timber to A as the timber is cut. A does not exercise the election to treat the date of payment as the date of disposal. It is estimated that there are 50,000 units of timber subject to the contract and that the total estimated royalties to be paid to A will be $95,000. A must report the bonus in the taxable year it is received or accrued by him. The portion of the basis of the timber attributable to the bonus is determined by the following formula:
EC08OC91.028
(iii) To the extent attributable to timber not held for more than 1 year (6 months for taxable years beginning before 1977; 9 months for taxable years beginning in 1977), such bonuses shall be treated as ordinary income subject to depletion. In order to determine the amount of the bonus allocable to timber not held for more than 1 year (6 months for taxable years beginning before 1977; 9 months for taxable years beginning in 1977), the bonus shall be apportioned ratably over the estimated number of units of timber covered by the contract of disposal. This subdivision may be illustrated as follows:

# Example.
Assume under the facts stated in the example in subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph that B cuts 10,000 units of timber that have been held by A for 1 year (6 months for taxable years beginning before 1977; 9 months for taxable years beginning in 1977), or less. The amount of the bonus (as well as the royalties) attributable to these units must be reported as ordinary income subject to depletion. The amount of the bonus attributable to these units is determined by the following formula:
EC08OC91.029
The amount of the depletion attributable to the portion of the bonus received for timber held for six months or less is determined by the following formula:
EC08OC91.030
EC08OC91.031
The amount of the bonus attributable to timber held for more than 1 year (6 months for taxable years beginning before 1977; 9 months for taxable years beginning in 1977), and which is treated under section 631 (b) as realized from the sale of timber would be $4,000. The gain on such amount is $400 ($4,000−$3,600).
(iv) If the right to cut timber under the contract of disposal expires, terminates, or is abandoned before any timber is cut, the taxpayer shall treat the bonus received under such contract as ordinary income, not subject to depletion. Accordingly, the taxpayer shall recompute his tax liability for the taxable year in which such bonus was received. The recomputation shall be made in the form of an amended return where necessary.
(e)
Other rules for application of section.
(1) Amounts paid by the lessee for timber or the acquisition of timber cutting rights, whether designated as such or as a rental, royalty, or bonus, shall be treated as the cost of timber and constitute part of the lessee's depletable basis of the timber, irrespective of the treatment accorded such payments in the hands of the lessor.
(2) The provisions of section 631(b) apply only to an owner of timber. An owner of timber means any person who owns an interest in timber, including a sublessor and a holder of a contract to cut timber. Such owner of timber must have a right to cut timber for sale on his own account or for use in his trade or business in order to own an interest in timber within the meaning of section 631(b).
(3) For purposes of section 631(b) and this section, the term
timber
includes evergreen trees which are more than 6 years old at the time severed from their roots and are sold for ornamental purposes such as Christmas decorations. Tops and other parts of standing timber are not considered as evergreen trees within the meaning of section 631(b). The term
evergreen trees
is used in its commonly accepted sense and includes pine, spruce, fir, hemlock, cedar, and other coniferous trees.
[T.D. 6500, 25 FR 11737, Nov. 26, 1960; 25 FR 14021, Dec. 31, 1960, as amended by T.D. 7728, 45 FR 72650, Nov. 3, 1980]
§ 1.631-3
Gain or loss upon the disposal of coal or domestic iron ore with a retained economic interest.
(a)
In general.
(1) The provisions of section 631(c) apply to an owner who disposes of coal (including lignite), or iron ore mined in the United States, held for more than 1 year (6 months for taxable years beginning before 1977; 9 months for taxable years beginning in
1977) before such disposal under any form or type of contract whereby he retains an economic interest in such coal or iron ore. The difference between the amount realized from disposal of the coal or iron ore in any taxable year, and the adjusted depletion basis thereof plus the deductions disallowed for the taxable year under section 272, shall be gain or loss upon the sale of the coal or iron ore. See paragraph (b)(4) of this section for the definition of
owner.
See paragraph (e) of this section for special rules relating to iron ore.
(2) In the case of such a disposal, the provisions of section 1231 apply, and the coal or iron ore shall be considered to be property used in the trade or business for the taxable year in which it is considered to have been sold, along with other property of the taxpayer used in the trade or business as defined in section 1231(b), regardless of whether the coal or iron ore is property held by the taxpayer primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of his trade or business. Whether gain or loss resulting from the disposition of the coal or iron ore which is considered to have been sold will be deemed to be gain or loss resulting from a sale of a capital asset held for more than 1 year (6 months for taxable years beginning before 1977; 9 months for taxable years beginning in 1977) will depend on the application of section 1231 to the taxpayer for the taxable year;
i.e.,
if the gains do not exceed the losses, they shall not be considered as gains and losses from sales or exchanges of capital assets but shall be treated as ordinary gains and losses.
(b)
Rules for application of section.
(1) For purposes of section 631(c) and this section, the date of disposal of the coal or iron ore shall be deemed to be the date the coal or iron ore is mined. If the coal or iron ore has been held for more than 1 year (6 months for taxable years beginning before 1977; 9 months for taxable years beginning in 1977) on the date it is mined, it is immaterial that it had not been held for more than 1 year (6 months for taxable years beginning before 1977; 9 months for taxable years beginning in 1977) on the date of the contract. There shall be no allowance for percentage depletion provided in section 613 with respect to amounts which are considered to be realized from the sale of coal or iron ore under section 631(c).
(2) The term
adjusted depletion basis
as used in section 631(c) and this section means the basis for allowance of cost depletion provided in section 612 and the regulations thereunder. Such
adjusted depletion basis
shall include exploration or development expenditures treated as deferred expenses under section 615(b) or 616(b), or corresponding provisions of prior income tax laws, and be reduced by adjustments under section 1016(a) (9) and (10), or corresponding provisions of prior income tax laws, relating to deductions of deferred expenses for exploration or development expenditures in the taxable year or any prior taxable years. The depletion unit of the coal or iron ore disposed of shall be determined under the rules provided in the regulations under section 611, relating to cost depletion.
(3)(i) In determining the gross income, the adjusted gross income, or the taxable income of the lessee, the deductions allowable with respect to rents and royalties (except rents and royalties paid by a lessee with respect to coal or iron ore disposed of by the lessee as an
owner
under section 631(c)) shall be determined without regard to the provisions of section 631(c). Thus, the amounts of rents and royalties paid or incurred by a lessee with respect to coal or iron ore shall be excluded from the lessee's gross income from the property for the purpose of determining his percentage depletion without regard to the treatment of such rents or royalties in the hands of the recipient under this section. See section 613 and the regulations thereunder.
(ii)(
a
) However, a lessee who is also a sublessor may dispose of coal or iron ore as an
owner
under section 631(c). Rents and royalties paid with respect to coal or iron ore disposed of by such a lessee under section 631(c) shall increase the adjusted depletion basis of the coal or iron ore and are not otherwise deductible.
(
b
) The provisions of this subdivision may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
B is a sublessor of a coal lease; A is the lessor; and C is the sublessee. B pays A a royalty of 50 cents per ton. C pays B a royalty of 60 cents per ton. The amount realized by B under section 631(c) is 60 cents per ton and will be reduced by the adjusted depletion basis of 50 cents per ton, leaving a gain of 10 cents per ton taxable under section 631(c).
(4)(i) The provision of this section apply only to an owner who has disposed of coal or iron ore and retained an economic interest. For the purposes of section 631(c) and this section, the word
owner
means any person who owns an economic interest in coal or iron ore in place, including a sublessor thereof. A person who merely acquires an economic interest and has not disposed of coal or iron ore under a contract retaining an economic interest does not qualify under section 631(c). A successor to the interest of a person who has disposed of coal or iron ore under a contract by virtue of which he retained an economic interest in such coal or iron ore is also entitled to the benefits of this section. Section 631(c) and this section shall not apply with respect to any income realized by any owner as co-adventurer, partner, or principal in the mining of such coal or iron ore.
(ii) The provisions of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
A owns a tract of coal land in fee. A leases to B the right to mine all the coal in this tract in return for a royalty of 30 cents per ton. B subleases his right to mine coal in this tract to C, who agrees to pay A 30 cents per ton and to pay to B an additional royalty of 10 cents per ton. Section 631(c) applies to the royalties of both A and B, if the other requisites of the section have been met.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in example 1, except that A dies leaving his royalty interest to D. D has an economic interest in the coal in place and qualifies for section 631(c) treatment with respect to his share of the royalties since he is a successor in title to A.

# Example.
Assume the same facts as in example 1, except that E agrees to pay a sum of money to C in return for 10 cents per ton on the coal mined by C. E has an economic interest, since he must look solely to the extraction of the coal for the return of his investment. However, E has not made a disposal of coal under a contract wherein he retains an economic interest, and, therefore does not qualify under section 631(c). E is entitled to depletion on his royalties.
(c)
Payments received in advance of mining.
(1)(i) Where the conditions of paragraph (a) of this section are met, amounts received or accrued prior to mining shall be treated under section 631(c) as received from the sale of coal or iron ore if the contract of disposal provides that such amounts are to be applied as payment for coal or iron ore subsequently mined. For example, advance royalty payments or minimum royalty payments received by an owner of coal or iron ore qualify under section 631(c) where the contract of disposal grants the lessee the right to apply such royalties in payment of coal or iron ore mined at a later time.
(ii) The provisions of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
A acquires coal rights on January 1. On January 30, A enters into a contract of disposal providing that mining shall begin July 2, and mining actually begins no earlier. Any advance payments which A receives qualify under section 631(c).
(2) However, if the right to mine coal or iron ore under the contract expires, terminates, or is abandoned before the coal or iron ore which had been paid for is mined, the taxpayer shall treat payments attributable to the unmined coal or iron ore as ordinary income and not as received from the sale of coal or iron ore under section 631(c). Accordingly, the taxpayer shall recompute his tax liability for the taxable year in which such payments were received. The recomputation shall be made in the form of an amended return where necessary.
(3) Bonuses received or accrued by an owner in connection with the grant of a contract of disposal shall be treated under section 631(c) as received from the sale of coal or iron ore to the extent attributable to coal or iron ore held for more than 1 year (6 months for taxable years beginning before 1977; 9 months for taxable years beginning in 1977). The rules contained in paragraph (d) of § 1.631-2 relating to bonuses in the case of contracts for the disposal of timber shall be equally applicable in the case of bonuses received for the grant of a contract of disposal of coal or iron ore under this section.
(d)
Nonapplication of section.
Section 631(c) shall not affect the application of the provisions of subchapter G, chapter 1 of the Code, relating to corporations used to avoid income tax on shareholders. For example, for the purposes of applying section 543 (relating to personal holding companies), the amounts received from a disposal of coal or iron ore subject to section 631(c) shall be considered as mineral royalties. The determination of whether an amount received under a contract to which section 631(c) applies is
personal holding company income
shall be made in accordance with section 543 and the regulations thereunder, without regard to section 631(c) or this section. See also paragraph (e) of § 1.272-1.
(e)
Special rules with regard to iron ore.
(1) With regard to iron ore, section 631(c) and this section apply only to amounts received or accrued in taxable years beginning after December 31, 1963, attributable to iron ore mined in such taxable years.
(2) Section 631(c) and this section apply only to disposals of iron ore mined in the United States.
(3) For the purposes of section 631(c) and this section, iron ore is any ore which is used as a source of iron, including but not limited to taconite and jaspilite.
(4) Section 631(c) shall not apply to any disposal of iron ore to a person whose relationship to the person disposing of such iron ore would result in the disallowance of losses under section 267 or 707(b).
(5) Section 631(c)(2) results in the denial of section 631(c) treatment in the case of a contract for disposal of iron ore entered into with a person owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by the same interests which own or control the person disposing of the iron ore, even though section 631(c) treatment would not be denied under the provisions of section 631(c)(1). For example, section 631(c) treatment is denied in the case of a contract for disposal of iron ore entered into between two
brother and sister
corporations, or a parent corporation and its subsidiary. The presence or absence of control shall be determined by applying the same standards as are applied under section 482 (relating to the allocation of income and deductions between taxpayers).
[T.D. 6841, 30 FR 9307, July 27, 1965, as amended by T.D. 7730, 45 FR 72650, Nov. 3, 1980]
§ 1.632-1
Tax on sale of oil or gas properties.
(a) If the taxpayer, by prospecting and locating claims or by exploring or discovering undeveloped claims, has demonstrated the principal value of oil or gas property, which prior to his efforts had a relatively minor value, the portion of the tax (or, in the case of taxable years beginning before Jan. 1, 1971, the surtax) imposed by section 1 attributable to a sale of such property, or of any interest of the taxpayer therein, shall not exceed 33 percent (or, in the case of taxable year beginning before Jan. 1, 1971, 30 percent) of the selling price of such property or such interest. Shares of stock in a corporation owning oil or gas property do not constitute an interest in such property. To determine the application of section 632 to a particular case, the taxpayer should first compute the tax (or surtax) imposed by section 1 upon his entire taxable income, including the taxable income from any sale of such property or interest therein, without regard to section 632. The proportion of the tax (or surtax) so computed, indicated by the ratio which the taxpayer's taxable income from the sale of the property or interest therein, computed as prescribed in this section, bears to his total taxable income is the portion of the tax attributable to such sale and, if it exceeds 33 percent (or 30 percent) of the selling price of such property or interest, such portion of the tax (or surtax) shall be reduced to that amount.
(b) In determining the portion of the taxable income attributable to the sale of such oil or gas property or interest therein, the taxpayer shall allocate to the gross income derived from such sale, and to the gross income derived from all other sources, the expenses, losses, and other deductions properly appertaining thereto and shall apply any general expenses, losses, and deductions (which cannot properly be otherwise allocated) ratably to the gross income from all sources. The gross income derived from the sale of such oil or gas property or interest
therein, less the deductions properly appertaining thereto and less its proportion of any general deductions, shall be the taxable income attributable to such sale. The taxpayer shall submit with his return a statement fully explaining the manner in which such expenses, losses, and deductions are allocated or apportioned.
[T.D. 6500, 25 FR 11737, Nov. 26, 1960, as amended by T.D. 7117, 36 FR 9421, May 25, 1971]

# Mineral Production Payments
§ 1.636-1
Treatment of production payments as loans.
(a)
In general.
(1)(i) For purposes of subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, a production payment (as defined in paragraph (a) of § 1.636-3) to which this section applies shall be treated as a loan on the mineral property (or properties) burdened thereby and not as an economic interest in mineral in place, except to the extent that § 1.636-2 or paragraph (b) of this section applies. See paragraph (b) of § 1.611-1. A production payment carved out of mineral property which remains in the hands of the person carving out the production payment immediately after the transfer of such production payment shall be treated as a mortgage loan on the mineral property burdened thereby. A production payment created and retained upon the transfer of the mineral property burdened by such production payment shall be treated as a purchase money mortgage loan on the mineral property burdened thereby. Such production payments will be referred to hereinafter in the regulations under section 636 as carved-out production payments and retained production payments, respectively. Moreover, in the case of a transaction involving a production payment treated as a loan pursuant to this section, the production payment shall constitute an item of income (not subject to depletion), consideration for a sale or exchange, a contribution to capital, or a gift if in the transaction a debt obligation used in lieu of the production payment would constitute such an item of income, consideration, contribution to capital, or gift, as the case may be. For the definition of the term
transfer
see paragraph (c) of § 1.636-3.
(ii) The payer of a production payment treated as a loan pursuant to this section shall include the proceeds from (or, if paid in kind, the value of) the mineral produced and applied to the satisfaction of the production payment in his gross income and
gross income from the property
(see section 613(a)) for the taxable year so applied. The payee shall include in his gross income (but not
gross income from the property
) amounts received with respect to such production payment to the extent that such amounts would be includible in gross income if such production payment were a loan. The payer and payee shall determine their allowable deductions as if such production payment were a loan. See section 483, relating to interest on certain deferred payments in the case of a production payment created and retained upon the transfer of the mineral property burdened thereby, or in the case of a production payment transferred in exchange for property. See section 1232 in the case of a production payment which is originally transferred by a corporation at a discount and is a capital asset in the hands of the payee. In the case of a carved-out production payment treated as a mortgage loan pursuant to this section, the consideration received for such production payment by the taxpayer who created it is not included in either gross income or
gross income from the property
by such taxpayer.
(2) If a production payment is treated as a loan pursuant to this section, no transfer of such production payment or any property burdened thereby (other than a transfer between the payer and payee of the production payment which, if the production payment were a loan, would extinguish the loan) shall cause it to cease to be so treated. For example, A sells operating mineral interest X to B for $100,000, subject to a $500,000 retained production payment payable out of X. Subsequently, A sells the production payment to C, and B sells X to D. C and D must treat the production payment as a purchase money mortgage loan.
(3) The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
On December 22, 1972, A, a cash-basis calendar-year taxpayer who owns operating mineral interest X, carves out of X a production payment in favor of B for $300,000 plus interest, payable out of 50 percent of the first oil produced and sold from X. In 1972, A treats the $300,000 received from B for the production payment as the proceeds of a mortgage loan on X. In 1973, A produces and sells 125,000 barrels of oil for $373,500. A pays B $186,750 with respect to the production payment, $168,750 being principal and $18,000 being interest. In computing his gross income and
gross income from the property
for the year 1973, A includes the $373,500 and takes as deductions the allowable expenses paid in production of such mineral. A also takes a deduction under section 163 for the $18,000 interest paid with respect to the production payment. For 1973, B would treat $18,000 as ordinary income not subject to the allowance for depletion under section 611.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in example 1 except that the principal amount of the production payment is to be increased by the amount of the ad valorem tax on the mineral attributable to the production payment which is paid by B. Under State law, the ad valorem tax with respect to the mineral attributable to the production payment is a liability of the owner of the production payment. For 1973, B inlcudes the amount received with respect to such taxes as income and takes a deduction under section 164 for the taxes paid by him. Since the ad valorem taxes paid by B are his liability under State law, A may not take a deduction under section 164 for such taxes.

# Example 3.
On December 31, 1974, C, a calendar-year taxpayer and owner of the operating mineral interest Y, sells Y to D for $10,000 cash and retains a $40,000 production payment payable out of Y. At the time D acquires the property, it is estimated that 500,000 tons of mineral are recoverable from the property. In 1975, D produces a total of 50,000 tons from the property. D's cost depletion for 1975 is $5,000 determined as follows:
Basis in property: $50,000
Total recoverable units: 500,000
Rate of depletion per ton: $0.10 ($50,000 ÷ 500,000)
Cost depletion for year: $5,000
($0.10 × 50,000)
(b)
Exception.
(1) A production payment carved out of a mineral property (or properties) for exploration or development of such property (or properties) shall not be treated as a mortgage loan under section 636(a) and this section to the extent
gross income from the property
(for purposes of section 613) would not be realized by the taxpayer creating such production payment, under the law existing at the time of the creation of such production payment, in the absence of section 636(a). See section 83 and the regulations thereunder, relating to property transferred in connection with the performance of services. For purposes of section 636(a) and this paragraph, an expenditure is for exploration or development to the extent that it is necessary for ascertaining the existence, location, extent, or quality of any deposit of mineral or is incident to and necessary for the preparation of a deposit for the production of mineral. However, an expenditure which relates primarily to the production of mineral (as, for example, in the case of a pilot water flood program with respect to the secondary recovery of oil) is not for exploration or development as those terms are used in section 636(a) and this paragraph. Whether or not a production payment is carved out for exploration or development shall be determined in light of all relevant facts and circumstances, including any prior production of mineral from the mineral deposit burdened by the production payment. However, a production payment shall not be treated as carved out for exploration or development to the extent that the consideration for the production payment:
(i) Is not pledged for use in the future exploration or development of the mineral property (or properties) which is burdened by the production payment;
(ii) May be used for the exploration or development of any other property, or for any other purpose than that described in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph;
(iii) Does not consist of a binding obligation of the payee of the production payment to pay expenses of the exploration or development described in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph; or
(iv) Does not consist of a binding obligation of the payee of the production payment to provide services, materials, supplies, or equipment for the exploration or development described in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph.
(2) In the case of a carved-out production payment only a portion of which is subject to the exception provided in this paragraph, the rules contained in paragraph (a) of this section with respect to the treatment of income and
deductions where a production payment is treated as a loan shall apply to the portion of the taxpayer's income or expenses attributable to the production payment which bears the same ratio to the total amount of such income or expenses, as the case may be, as the amount of the consideration for the production payment which would have been realized as income in the absence of section 636(a), by the taxpayer creating such production payment, bears to the total consideration to the taxpayer for the production payment. For example, A, owner of a mineral property, carves out a production payment in favor of B for $600,000 plus interest in return for $600,000 cash. A pledges to use $400,000 for the development of the burdened mineral property. In each of the payout years loan treatment applies to one-third of the income and expenses of A and B attributable to the production payment.
(c)
Treatment upon disposition or termination of mineral property burdened by production payment.
(1)(i) In the case of a sale or other disposition of the mineral property burdened by a production payment treated as a loan pursuant to this section, there shall be included in determining the amount realized upon such disposition an amount equal to the outstanding principal balance of such production payment on the date of such disposition. However, if such a production payment is created in connection with the disposition, the amount to be so included shall be the fair market value of the production payment, rather than its principal amount, if the fair market value is established by clear and convincing evidence to be an amount which differs from the principal amount. See section 1001 and the regulations thereunder. In determining the cost of the transferred mineral property to the transferee for purposes of section 1012, the outstanding principal balance of the production payment shall be included in the cost.
(ii) The provisions of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
A, the owner of mineral property X which is burdened by a carved-out production payment to which section 636(a) applies having an outstanding principal balance of $10,000, sells property X to B, an individual, for $100,000 cash. The amount realized by A on the sale of property X is $110,000. B's basis in property X for cost depletion and other purposes is also $110,000.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in example 1 except that the production payment is retained by A in connection with the sale of property X to B, that section 636(b) applies to the production payment, that the production payment includes, in addition to the $10,000 principal amount, an additional amount equivalent to interest at a rate which precludes application of section 483, and that the fair market value of the production payment is $9,000. The amount realized by A on the sale of property X is $109,000. B's basis in property X for cost depletion and other purposes is $110,000. A's basis in the retained production payment is $9,000. If the production payment is paid in full, A realizes income of $1,000 plus the amount equivalent to interest, which income is includible in A's gross income at the time when such amounts would be so includible if such production payment were a loan.

# Example 3.
C, the owner of mineral property Y, sells the mineral property to D for $500,000 cash. Property Y is burdened by a carved-out production payment with an outstanding principal balance of $600,000, 40 percent of the consideration for which was pledged for the development of property Y. The amount realized by C on the sale is $860,000 ($500,000 plus $600,000 × .60). D's basis in property Y for cost depletion and other purposes is $860,000.
(2) In the case of the expiration, termination, or abandonment of a mineral property burdened by a production payment treated as a loan pursuant to this section, for purposes of determining the amount of any loss under section 165 with respect to the burdened mineral property the adjusted basis of such property shall be reduced (but not below zero) by an amount equal to the outstanding principal balance of such production payment on the date of such expiration, termination, or abandonment. Thus, in example 2 in subparagraph (1)(ii) of this paragraph, if B abandons the mineral property at a time when $5,000 of the principal amount of the production payment remains unsatisfied, B's adjusted basis immediately before the abandonment would be reduced by $5,000 for determining his loss on abandonment under section 165.
(3) In the case of a transfer of a portion of the mineral property burdened by a production payment treated as a
loan pursuant to this section, such production payment shall be apportioned between the transferred portion and the retained portion by allocating to such transferred portion that part of the outstanding principal balance of the production payment which bears the same ratio to such balance as the value of such transferred portion (exclusive of any value not related to the burdened mineral) bears to the total value of the burdened mineral property (exclusive of any value not related to the burdened mineral).
(4) In general, the entire amount of gain or loss realized pursuant to this paragraph shall be recognized in the taxable year of such realization. See section 1211 for limitation on capital losses. This subparagraph shall not affect the applicability of rules providing exceptions to the recognition of gain or loss which has been realized (e.g., a transfer to which section 351 or 1031 applies). However, see section 357(c) with respect to the assumption of liabilities in excess of basis in certain tax-free exchanges. Furthermore, in the case of a transaction which otherwise qualifies, gain realized on a transfer of a mineral property to which section 636(b) applies may be returned on the installment method under section 453.

§ 1.636-2
Production payments retained in leasing transactions.
(a)
Treatment by lessee.
In the case of a production payment (as defined in paragraph (a) of § 1.636-3) which is retained by the lessor in a leasing transaction (including a sublease or the exercise of an option to acquire a lease or sublease), the lessee (or his successors in interest) shall treat the retained production payment for purposes of subtitle A of the Code as if it were a bonus granted by the lessee to the lessor payable in installments. Accordingly, the lessee shall include the proceeds from (or, if paid in kind, the value of) the mineral produced and applied to the satisfaction of the production payment in his gross income for the taxable year so applied. The lessee shall capitalize each payment (including any interest and any amounts added on to the production payment other than amounts for which the lessee would be liable in the absence of the production payment) paid or incurred with respect to such production payment. See paragraph (c)(5)(ii) of § 1.613-2 for rules relating to computation of percentage depletion with respect to a mineral property burdened by a production payment treated as a bonus under section 636(c) and this section.
(b)
Treatment by lessor.
The lessor who retains a production payment in a leasing transaction (or his successors in interest) shall treat the production payment without regard to the provisions of section 636 and § 1.636-1. Thus, the production payment will be treated as an economic interest in the mineral in place in the hands of the lessor (or his successors in interest) and the receipts in discharge of the production payment will constitute ordinary income subject to depletion.
(c)
Example.
The provisions of this section may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
In 1971, A leases a mineral property to B reserving a one-eighth royalty and a production payment (as defined in § 1.636-3(a)) with a principal amount of $300,000 plus an amount equivalent to interest. In 1972, B pays to A $60,000 with respect to the principal amount of the production payment plus $16,350 equivalent to interest. The adjusted basis of the property in the hands of B for cost depletion and other purposes for 1972 and subsequent years will include (subject to proper adjustment under section 1016) the $76,350 paid to A. In 1973, B pays to A $60,000 with respect to the principal amount of the production payment plus $12,750 equivalent to interest. The adjusted basis of the property in the hands of B for cost depletion and other purposes for 1973 and subsequent years will include (subject to proper adjustment under section 1016) the $72,750 paid to A. The $76,350 received by A in 1972, and the $72,750 received by A in 1973, will constitute ordinary income subject to depletion in the hands of A in the years of receipt of such amounts by A.
[T.D. 7261, 38 FR 5465, Mar. 1, 1973]
§ 1.636-3
Definitions.
For purposes of section 636 and the regulations thereunder:
(a)
Production payment.
(1) The term
production payment
means, in general, a right to a specified share of the production from mineral in place (if, as, and when produced), or the proceeds from
such production. Such right must be an economic interest in such mineral in place. It may burden more than one mineral property, and the burdened mineral property need not be an operating mineral interest. Such right must have an expected economic life (at the time of its creation) of shorter duration than the economic life of one or more of the mineral properties burdened thereby. A right to mineral in place which can be required to be satisfied by other than the production of mineral from the burdened mineral property is not an economic interest in mineral in place. A production payment may be limited by a dollar amount, a quantum of mineral, or a period of time. A right to mineral in place has an economic life of shorter duration than the economic life of a mineral property burdened thereby only if such right may not reasonably be expected to extend in substantial amounts over the entire productive life of such mineral property. The term
production payment
includes payments which are commonly referred to as
in-oil payments, gas payments,
or
mineral payments.
(2) A right which is in substance economically equivalent to a production payment shall be treated as a production payment for purposes of section 636 and the regulations thereunder, regardless of the language used to describe such right, the method of creation of such right, or the form in which such right is cast (even though such form is that of an operating mineral interest). Whether or not a right is in substance economically equivalent to a production payment shall be determined from all the facts and circumstances. An example of an interest which is to be treated as a production payment under this subparagraph is that portion of a
royalty
which is attributable to so much of the rate of the royalty which exceeds the lowest possible rate of the royalty at any subsequent time (disregarding any reductions in the rate of the royalty which are based solely upon changes in volume of production within a specified period of no more than 1 year). For example, assume that A creates a royalty with respect to a mineral property owned by A equal to 5 percent for 5 years and thereafter equal to 4 percent for the balance of the life of the property. An amount equal to 1 percent for 5 years shall be treated as a production payment. On the other hand, if A leases a coal mine to B in return for a royalty of 30 cents per ton on the first 500,000 tons of coal produced from the mine in each year and 20 cents per ton on all coal in excess of 500,000 tons produced from the mine in each year, the fact that the royalty may decline to 20 cents per ton on some of the coal in each year does not result in a production payment of 10 cents per ton of coal on the first 500,000 tons in any year. Another example of an interest which is to be treated as a production payment under this subparagraph is the interest in a partnership engaged in operating oil properties of a partner who provides capital for the partnership if such interest is subject to a right of another person or persons to acquire or terminate it upon terms which merely provide for such partner's recovery of his capital investment and a reasonable return thereon.
(b)
Property.
The term
property
has the meaning assigned to it in section 614(a), without the application of section 614 (b), (c), or (e).
(c)
Transfer.
The term
transfer
means any sale, exchange, gift, bequest, devise, or other disposition (including a distribution by an estate or a contribution to or distribution by a corporation, partnership, or trust).
[T.D. 7261, 38 FR 5465, Mar. 1, 1973]
§ 1.636-4
Effective dates of section 636.
(a)
In general.
Except as provided hereinafter in this section, section 636 and §§ 1.636-1, 1.636-2, and 1.636-3 apply to production payments created on or after August 7, 1969, other than production payments created before January 1, 1971, pursuant to a binding contract entered into before August 7, 1969.
(b)
Election.
Under section 503(c)(2) of the Tax Reform Act of 1969, if the taxpayer so elects, section 636(a) of the Code and §§ 1.636-1 and 1.636-3 apply to all production payments carved out by him after the beginning of his last taxable year ending before August 7, 1969, including such production payments created after such date pursuant to a binding contract entered into before
such date. No interest shall be allowed on any refund or credit of any overpayment of tax resulting from an election under section 503(c)(2) for any taxable year ending before August 7, 1969. The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following example:

# Example.
A, a fiscal-year taxpayer whose taxable year ends on October 31, carved out and sold (from a producing property) production payments on October 1, 1967, and on July 9, 1969. On August 1, 1969, A entered into a binding contract to create another carved-out production payment (from a different producing property) and the production payment was carved out on December 22, 1969. If A elects under section 503(c)(2), the production payments carved out on July 9, 1969, and December 22, 1969, are treated as mortgage loans under section 636(a). The production payment carved out on October 1, 1967, is not treated as a mortgage loan under section 636(a) because it was carved out before the beginning of A's last taxable year ending before August 7, 1969.
(c)
Time and manner of making election.
(1) Any election under section 503(c)(2) of the Tax Reform Act of 1969 must be made not later than May 30, 1973.
(2) An election under section 503(c)(2) shall be made by a statement attached to the taxpayer's income tax return (or amended return) for the first taxable year in which the taxpayer created a production payment (i) to which the election applies, and (ii) which, in the absence of section 636, would not have been treated as a loan. A statement shall also be attached to an amended return for each subsequent taxable year for which he has filed his income tax return before making the election, but only if his tax liability for such year is affected by the election. Each such statement shall indicate the taxpayer's election under section 503(c)(2), and shall identify by date, amount, parties, and burdened mineral properties all production payments described in subdivisions (i) and (ii) of this subparagraph which have been created by the date on which the statement is filed. However, a taxpayer who, prior to the date on which permanent regulations under this section are published in the
Federal Register,
made a valid election under section 503(c)(2) pursuant to §§ 301.9100-17T and 301.9100-18T of this chapter are not required to amend statements previously furnished which meet the requirements of § 301.9100-17T(b)(1)(ii) of this chapter unless requested to do so by the district director. In applying the election to the taxable years affected, there shall be taken into account the effect that any adjustments resulting therefrom have on other items affected thereby and the effect that adjustments of any such items have on other taxable years. In the case of a member of a consolidated return group (as defined in paragraph (a) of § 1.1502-1), section 503(c)(2) and paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section shall be applied as if such member filed a separate return.
(d)
Revocation of election.
A valid election under section 503(c)(2) shall be binding upon the taxpayer unless consent to revoke the election is obtained from the Commissioner. The application to revoke such election must be made in writing to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, Washington, D.C. 20224, not later than May 30, 1973. Such application must set forth the reasons therefor and a recomputation of the tax reflecting such revocation for each prior taxable year affected by the revocation, whether or not the period of limitations for credit or refund or assessment and collection has expired with respect to such taxable year. Consent shall not be given in any case in which the revocation would result in an increase in the taxpayer's tax liability for a taxable year for which such period of limitations has expired unless the taxpayer waives his right to assert the statute of limitations.
(e)
Special rule.
(1) Except as provided in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, in the case of a taxpayer who does not make the election provided in section 503(c)(2) of the Tax Reform Act of 1969, section 636 of the Code applies to production payments carved out during the taxable year which includes August 7, 1969, as provided in paragraph (a) of this section, only to the extent that the aggregate amount of such production payments exceeds the lesser of:
(i) The excess of:
(
a
) The aggregate amount of production payments carved out and sold by the taxpayer during the 12-month period immediately preceding his taxable
year which includes August 7, 1969, over
(
b
) The aggregate amount of production payments carved out and sold before August 7, 1969, by the taxpayer during his taxable year which includes such date, or
(ii) The amount necessary to increase the amount of the taxpayer's gross income within the meaning of chapter 1 of subtitle A of the Code, for his taxable year which includes August 7, 1969, to an amount equal to the amount of his deductions (other than any deduction under section 172) allowable for such year under such chapter
In applying the preceding sentence, production payments carved out for exploration or development are to be taken into account only to the extent, if any, that
gross income from the property
(for purposes of section 613) would have been realized by the taxpayer creating such production payment under the law existing at the time of the creation of such production payment, in the absence of section 636(a).
(2) Subparagraph (1) of this paragraph shall not apply for any taxable year for purposes of determining the amount of any deduction for cost or percentage depletion allowable under section 611 or the limitation on any foreign tax credit under section 904.
(3) The application of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
(a) A, a calendar-year taxpayer who does not make the election provided in section 503(c)(2) of the Tax Reform Act of 1969, carves out and sells on December 31, 1968, a $500,000 production payment. Further, A carves out and sells on March 4, 1969, a $300,000 production payment, and on November 14, 1969, a $150,000 production payment. None of the production payments are carved out for exploration or development. During 1969, A has gross income of $600,000 (determined initially for this purpose by treating the $150,000 production payment carved out on November 14, 1969, as a loan) and allowable deductions of $700,000.
(b) The provisions of section 636 do not apply to a portion of the November 14, 1969, production payment for purposes other than section 611 and section 904 of the Code, determined as follows:
(1) Amount of production payment carved out in 1969 on or after August 7, 1969
$150,000
(2) Amount of production payment carved out during 1968
500,000
(3) Amount of production payment carved out during 1969 taxable year before August 7, 1969
300,000
(4) Item (2) minus item (3)
200,000
(5) Excess of allowable deductions over gross income for 1969
100,000
(6) Amount of production payment carved out in 1969 on or after August 7, 1969, to which section 636 does not apply (lesser of items (1), (4), and (5))
100,000
Thus, A will not treat $100,000 of the consideration received for the production payment carved out on November 14, 1969, as a loan and as a result his gross income for 1969 will be $700,000. However, in computing percentage depletion, A will not include the $100,000 in
gross income from property
and in computing cost depletion A will not include the mineral units attributable thereto. Nor, will A include the $100,000 in determining the limitation on foreign tax credit under section 904.

# Example 2.
Assume the same facts as in example 1 except that for taxable year 1969 A's gross income (determined initially for this purpose by treating the November 14, 1969, production payment as a loan) exceeds the amount of his allowable deductions under chapter 1 of subtitle A of the Code. The entire amount of the November 14, 1969, production payment is treated as a mortgage loan under section 636(a).
[T.D. 7261, 38 FR 5465, Mar. 1, 1973, as amended by T.D. 8435, 57 FR 43896, Sept. 23, 1992]

# Continental Shelf Areas
§ 1.638-1
Continental Shelf areas.
(a)
General rule.
For purposes of applying any provision of chapter 1, 2, 3, or 24 (including section 861(a)(3), 862(a)(3), 1441, 3402, or other provisions dealing with the performance of personal services), with respect to mines, oil and gas wells, and other natural deposits:
(1)
United States and possession of the United States.
The terms
United States
and
possession of the United States
when used in a geographical sense include the seabed and subsoil of those submarine areas which are adjacent to the territorial waters of the United States or such possession and over which the United States has exclusive rights, in accordance with international law, with respect to the exploration for, and exploitation of, natural resources. The terms
Continental Shelf of the United States
and
Continental Shelf of a possession of the United States,
as used in this section, refer to the seabed and subsoil
included, respectively, in the terms
United States
and
possession of the United States,
as provided in the preceding sentence.
(2)
Foreign country.
The term
foreign country
when used in a geographical sense includes the seabed and subsoil of those submarine areas which are adjacent to the territorial waters of the foreign country and over which such foreign country has exclusive rights, in accordance with international law, with respect to the exploration for, and exploitation of, natural resources, but this sentence applies only if such foreign country exercises, directly or indirectly, taxing jurisdiction with respect to such exploration or exploitation. The term
foreign continental shelf,
as used in this section, refers to the seabed and subsoil described in the preceding sentence. A foreign country is not to be treated as a country contiguous to the United States by reason of the application of section 638 and this section.
(b)
Exercise of taxing jurisdiction.
For purposes of paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the exercise, directly or indirectly, of taxing jurisdiction with respect to the exploration for, or exploitation of, natural resources is deemed to include (but is not limited to) those cases in which a foreign country:
(1) Imposes a tax upon assets, equipment, or other property connected with or income derived from such exploration or exploitation, or
(2) Requires natural resources referred to in paragraph (a)(2) of this section to be transported to points within its landward boundaries and then levies a tax upon such natural resources or upon the income derived from the sale thereof
A foreign country which, for purposes of paragraph (a)(2) of this section, exercises taxing jurisdiction by the imposition of tax upon any person, property, or activity engaged in or related to the exploration for, or exploitation of, natural resources in the seabed or subsoil referred to in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, or the income therefrom of any taxpayer, is deemed to exercise taxing jurisdiction over all such persons, property, and activities and over all income therefrom of all such taxpayers; thus, for example, a foreign country which imposes tax upon a person engaged in exploitation of oil and gas wells in its seabed and subsoil referred to in paragraph (a)(2) of this section is deemed to exercise taxing jurisdiction over property related to exploration for other natural deposits in such seabed and subsoil. A foreign country is deemed to be imposing tax upon a person, property, activity, or income described in the preceding sentence if such foreign country exempts such person, property, activity, or income from tax for a period not in excess of 10 years from the commencement of such exploration or exploitation. Except in the case of a foreign country which is deemed under the preceding sentence to impose tax by virtue of an exemption for a period not in excess of 10 years, a foreign country which exempts all persons, property, and activities engaged in or related to the exploration for, or exploitation of, natural resources in the seabed or subsoil referred to in paragraph (a)(2) of this section and the income therefrom, from taxation is deemed not to be exercising, directly or indirectly, taxing jurisdiction for purposes of paragraph (a)(2) of this section. For purposes of paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the exercise of taxing jurisdiction with respect to any type of tax constitutes the exercise of taxing jurisdiction with respect to all types of taxes. However, a royalty or other charge (whether payable in a lump sum or over a period of time or in amounts dependent upon the volume of production of natural resources) for the right to explore for or exploit natural resources does not constitute a tax.
(c)
Scope.
(1) For purposes of applying this section, persons, property, or activities which are engaged in or related to the exploration for, or exploitation of, mines, oil and gas wells, or other natural deposits need not be physically upon, connected, or attached to the seabed or subsoil referred to in subparagraph (1) or (2) of paragraph (a) of this section to be deemed to be within the United States, a possession of the United States, or a foreign country, as the case may be, to the extent provided in subparagraph (2) or (3) and subparagraph (4) of this paragraph.
(2) Persons, property, or activities which are not in a foreign country (determined without regard to section 638 or this section), and which are engaged in or related to the exploration for, or exploitation of, mines, oil and gas wells, or other natural deposits of the seabed or subsoil referred to in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, are generally within the United States or a possession of the United States, as the case may be, unless such persons, property, or activities are solely involved in or constitute transportation to (or from) the site of exploration or exploitation from (or to) a foreign country, other than transportation on a regular basis from (or to) a base of operations.
(3) Persons, property, or activities which are not in the United States or in a third country (determined in each case without regard to section 638 or this section), and which are engaged in or related to the exploration for, or exploitation of, mines, oil and gas wells, or other natural deposits of the seabed or subsoil of a foreign country referred to in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, are generally within such foreign country, unless such persons, property, or activities are solely involved in or constitute transportation to (or from) the site of exploration or exploitation from (or to) the United States or a possession of the United States or a third country, as the case may be, other than transportation on a regular basis from (or to) a base of operations.
(4) Persons, property, or activities are within the United States, a possession of the United States, or a foreign country, as the case may be, pursuant to this paragraph, only to the extent such persons, property, or activities are engaged in or related to the exploration for or exploitation of, mines, oil and gas wells, or other natural deposits.
(d)
Natural deposits and natural resources.
For purposes of this section, the terms
natural deposits
and
natural resources
mean nonliving resources to which section 611(a) applies. Such terms do not include sedentary species (organisms which, at the harvestable stage, either are immovable on or under the seabed or are unable to move except in constant physical contact with the seabed or subsoil), fish or other animal or plant life.
(e)
Rights under international law.
Nothing in this section shall prejudice or affect the freedoms of the high seas and other rights under international law, or the exercise of such freedoms and rights by the United States or foreign countries.
(f)
Examples.
The application of the provisions of section 638 and this section may be illustrated by the following examples:

# Example 1.
A, a citizen of the United States employed as an engineer, is engaged in the exploitation of oil and is physically present on an offshore oil drilling platform operated by employees of L Corporation. Such platform is affixed to the foreign continental shelf of foreign country X. Assuming that foreign country X exercises taxing jurisdiction as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, A is to be treated as being employed in foreign country X with respect to compensation for his employment for purposes of chapters 1 and 24.

# Example 2.
The facts are the same as in example 1 except that B, a citizen of the United States engaged in the private practice of law, is physically present on such platform for the sole purpose of interviewing his client, A, whom he represents in a domestic relations matter. Since B is not engaged in activities related to the exploration for, or exploitation of, natural deposits, he is not to be treated as being in foreign country X for purposes of chapters 1 and 2.

# Example 3.
The facts are the same as in example 1 except that C, a citizen of the United States engaged in the private practice of medicine, is physically present on such platform for the purpose of making routine physical examinations of L Corporation's employees who are engaged in the exploitation of oil on the platform. C is paid by L Corporation to give such examinations on the platform at regular intervals in order to determine whether the state of any employee's health is such that he should not continue work on the platform. The balance of C's medical practice is conducted at his office on the U.S. mainland. Since C is engaged in activities related to the exploitation of oil, he is treated as being in foreign country X under section 638 and this section while making physical examinations on L Corporation's platform, provided that foreign country X exercise taxing jurisdiction as provided in paragraph (b) of this section. For purposes of chapters 1 and 2, amounts paid by L Corporation to C are treated as derived from sources within foreign country X.

# Example 4.
C, a nonresident alien individual employed as an engineer in a foreign country, designs equipment for use on oil drilling
platforms affixed to the continental shelf of the United States and engaged in the exploitation of oil. Although C's activities in this respect are related to the exploitation of oil, C is not treated as being in the United States under section 638 and this section by reason of such activities.

# Example 5.
M Corporation, a domestic corporation, chartered a ship from N Corporation, also a domestic corporation, under a time charter under which N Corporation's personnel continued to navigate and manage the shop. M Corporation equipped the ship with special oil exploration equipment and furnished its personnel to operate the equipment. The ship then commenced to explore for oil in the foreign Continental Shelf of foreign country Y. Foreign country Y exercises taxing jurisdiction as provided in paragraph (b) of this section. The ship is treated as being within foreign country Y under section 638 and this section for the period it was engaged in the exploration for oil in such foreign Continental Shelf. Thus, the entire income derived during such period by N Corporation from the charter is income derived from sources within foreign country Y, since N Corporation had property and employees engaged in the exploration for oil in such foreign Continental Shelf.

# Example 6.
The facts are the same as in example 5 except that C, a citizen of the United States, was employed by N Corporation as a cook and was physically present on the ship. C's sole duties consisted of cooking meals for personnel aboard such ship. In such case, as C's activities are related to the exploration for oil, C is to be treated as being in foreign country Y under section 638 and this section for the period he was aboard such ship while it was engaged in activities relating to the exploration for oil in the foreign Continental Shelf referred to in example 5. For purposes of chapters 1 and 24, C's compensation as a cook for such period is treated as derived from sources without the United States.

# Example 7.
Z Corporation, a foreign corporation, entered into a contract with Y Corporation, a United States corporation, to engage in exploratory oil drilling activities on a leasehold held by Y Corporation. Such leasehold was located in the Continental Shelf of the United States. Since Z Corporation is engaged in and has property and activities which are engaged in the exploration for oil, such property and activities are to be treated as being in the United States under section 638 and this section for the period such property and activities were engaged in or related to the exploration for oil in the Continental Shelf of the United States and were not in a foreign country. For purposes of chapters 1 and 3, amounts paid to Z Corporation pursuant to the contract are treated as derived from sources within the United States.

# Example 8.
M Corporation is a controlled foreign corporation (within the meaning of section 957(b)) for its entire taxable year beginning in 1972. During such taxable year, M Corporation issues a policy of insurance relating to fire damage to an offshore oil drilling platform, owned by N Corporation (a foreign corporation), which is attached to the Continental Shelf of the United States. The income attributable to the issuing of such policy would be taxed under subchapter L, chapter 1, subtitle A of the Code (as modified, for this purpose, by section 953(b) (1), (2), and (3)) if such income were the income of a domestic insurance corporation. Since N Corporation's oil drilling platform is located within the United States under section 638 and this section, M Corporation's income attributable to the issuing of the insurance in connection with such platform is income derived from the insurance of United States risks, within the meaning of section 953(a)(1)(A).
