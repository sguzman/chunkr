(1) Lake Tahoe Basin for CO.
(2) EPA approves the CO plan for the Lake Tahoe Basin as meeting the requirements of Part D. This approval includes the resolution of the Lake Tahoe Regional Planning Agency banning new source construction pending the adoption of a new regional plan and ordinances. However, EPA disapproves the plan for any future time during which the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency may remove its construction ban prior to EPA approval of the new regional plan and ordinances.
(e) The Administrator approves the following portions of the 1999 Ozone Attainment Plan for the San Francisco Bay Area submitted by the California Air Resources Board on August 13, 1999: the 1995 baseline emissions inventory, the reasonable further progress demonstration, and the deletion of transportation control measures #6 and #16.
(f)(1) Insofar as the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) provisions found in North Coast Unified Air Quality Management District's approved plan apply to stationary sources of greenhouse gas (GHGs) emissions, the Administrator approves that application only to the extent that GHGs are “subject to regulation”, as provided in this paragraph (b), and the Administrator takes no action on that application to the extent that GHGs are not “subject to regulation.”
(2) Beginning January 2, 2011, the pollutant GHGs is subject to regulation if:
(i) The stationary source is a new major stationary source for a regulated NSR pollutant that is not GHGs, and also will emit or will have the potential to emit 75,000 tpy CO
2
e or more; or
(ii) The stationary source is an existing major stationary source for a regulated NSR pollutant that is not GHGs, and also will have an emissions increase of a regulated NSR pollutant, and an emissions increase of 75,000 tpy CO
2
e or more; and
(3) Beginning July 1, 2011, in addition to the provisions in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the pollutant GHGs shall also be subject to regulation:
(i) At a new stationary source that will emit or have the potential to emit 100,000 tpy CO
2
e; or
(ii) At an existing stationary source that emits or has the potential to emit 100,000 tpy CO
2
e, when such stationary source undertakes a physical change or change in the method of operation that will result in an emissions increase of 75,000 tpy CO
2
e or more.
(4) For purposes of this paragraph (b)—
(i) The term greenhouse gas shall mean the air pollutant defined in 40 CFR 86.1818-12(a) as the aggregate group of six greenhouse gases: Carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, methane, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, and sulfur hexafluoride.
(ii) The term tpy CO
2
equivalent emissions (CO
2
e) shall represent an amount of GHGs emitted, and shall be computed as follows:
(A) Multiplying the mass amount of emissions (tpy), for each of the six greenhouse gases in the pollutant GHGs, by the gas's associated global warming potential published at Table A-1 to subpart A of 40 CFR part 98—Global Warming Potentials.
(B) Sum the resultant value from paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(A) of this section for each gas to compute a tpy CO
2
e.
(iii) The term emissions increase shall mean that both a significant emissions increase (as calculated using the procedures in the EPA-approved North Coast Unified Air Quality Management District rules at R1-1-130(s2)) and a significant net emissions increase (as defined in the North Coast Unified Air Quality Management District rules at R1-1-130(n1)) occur. For the pollutant GHGs, an emissions increase shall be based on tpy CO
2
e, and shall be calculated assuming the pollutant GHGs is a regulated NSR pollutant, and “significant” is defined as 75,000 tpy CO
2
e instead of applying the value in the EPA-approved North Coast Unified Air Quality Management District rules at R1-1-130(s2).
(g)(1) Insofar as the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) provisions found in Northern Sonoma County Air Pollution Control District's approved plan apply to stationary sources of greenhouse gas (GHGs) emissions, the Administrator approves that application only to the extent that GHGs are “subject to regulation”, as provided in this paragraph (b), and the Administrator takes no action on that application to the extent that GHGs are not “subject to regulation.”

§ 52.272
Research operations exemptions.
(a) The requirements of § 51.281 of this chapter are not met because the following regulations allow exemptions to be granted from the applicable emission limitations, thereby potentially rendering the applicable limitations unenforceable. Furthermore, the regulations are inconsistent with the Clean Air Act, because the regulations could permit violations of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards under some circumstances. Therefore, the following regulations are disapproved:

§ 52.282
Control strategy and regulations: Ozone.
(a)
Attainment determination.
EPA has determined that the Ventura County severe 1-hour ozone nonattainment area attained the 1-hour ozone NAAQS by the applicable attainment date of November 15, 2005. EPA also has determined that the Ventura County severe 1-hour ozone nonattainment area is not subject to the requirements of section 185 of the Clean Air Act (CAA) for the 1-hour standard and that the State is not required to submit a SIP under Section 182(d)(3) of the CAA to implement a section 185 program for the 1-hour standard in this area. In addition, the requirements of section 172(c)(9)
(contingency measures) for the 1-hour standard do not apply to the area.
(b)
Approval.
On December 19, 2007, the California Air Resources Board submitted a maintenance plan for the 1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS for the Monterey Bay Area as required by section 110(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990, and 40 CFR 51.905(a)(4). Elements of the section 110(a)(1) maintenance plan for ozone include a base year (2002) attainment emissions inventory for ozone, a demonstration of maintenance of the ozone NAAQS with projected emissions inventories through the year 2014 for ozone, a plan to verify continued attainment, and a contingency plan. The maintenance plan meets the Federal requirements of Clean Air Act section 110(a)(1) and 40 CFR 51.905(a)(4) and is approved as a revision to the California State Implementation Plan for the above mentioned area.
(c)
Determination of attainment.
Effective January 4, 2010, EPA is determining that the Imperial County, California 8-hour ozone nonattainment area has attained the 1997 8-hour ozone standard. Under the provisions of EPA's ozone implementation rule (see 40 CFR 51.918), this determination suspends the reasonable further progress and attainment demonstration requirements of section 182(b)(1) and related requirements of section 172(c)(9) of the Clean Air Act for as long as the area does not monitor any violations of the 8-hour ozone standard. If a violation of the 1997 ozone NAAQS is monitored in the Imperial County, California 8-hour ozone nonattainment area, this determination shall no longer apply.
(d)
Determinations that Certain Areas Did Not Attain the 1-Hour Ozone NAAQS.
EPA has determined that the Los Angeles-South Coast Air Basin Area and the San Joaquin Valley Area extreme 1-hour ozone nonattainment areas did not attain the 1-hour ozone NAAQS by the applicable attainment date of November 15, 2010 and that the Southeast Desert Modified Air Quality Maintenance Area severe-17 1-hour ozone nonattainment area did not attain the 1-hour ozone NAAQS by the applicable attainment date of November 15, 2007. These determinations bear on the areas' obligations with respect to the one-hour ozone standard anti-backsliding requirements whose implementation is triggered by a determination of failure to attain by the applicable attainment date: section 172(c)(9) contingency measures for failure to attain and sections 182(d)(3) and 185 major stationary source fee programs.
(e)
Determinations of attainment.
Effective June 3, 2016.
(1)
Approval of applications for extensions of applicable attainment dates.
Under section 181(a)(5) of the Clean Air Act, the EPA is approving the applications submitted by the California Air Resources Board dated June 1, 2015, referencing the District's letter of May 19, 2015, for extensions of the applicable attainment date for the San Luis Obispo (Eastern San Luis Obispo), CA 2008 8-hour ozone nonattainment areas from July 20, 2015 to July 20, 2016.
(2)
Determinations of attainment.
The EPA has determined that the Calaveras County, Chico (Butte County), San Francisco Bay Area and Tuscan Buttes 2008 8-hour ozone nonattainment areas in California have attained the 2008 8-hour ozone standard by the July 20, 2015 applicable attainment date, based upon complete quality-assured data for 2012-2014. Therefore, the EPA has met its obligation pursuant to CAA section 181(b)(2)(A) to determine, based on the area's air quality data as of the attainment date, whether the area attained the standard. As a result of these determinations, the Calaveras County, Chico (Butte County), San Francisco Bay Area and Tuscan Buttes 2008 8-hour ozone nonattainment areas in California will not be reclassified for failure to attain by their July 20, 2015, applicable attainment date under section 181(b)(2)(A).
(3)
Determinations of attainment.
EPA is determining that the Amador and Calaveras Counties, Chico, Kern County, Mariposa and Tuolumne Counties, Nevada County, Sutter County and Ventura County 8-hour ozone nonattainment areas have attained the 1997 8-hour ozone standard, based upon complete quality-assured data for 2009-2011. Under the provisions of EPA's ozone implementation rule (see 40 CFR 51.918), these determinations suspend the attainment demonstrations and associated reasonably available control
measures, reasonable further progress plans, contingency measures, and other planning SIPs related to attainment for as long as the areas continue to attain the 1997 8-hour ozone standard. If EPA determines, after notice-and-comment rulemaking, that any of these areas no longer meets the 1997 ozone NAAQS, the corresponding determination of attainment for that area shall be withdrawn.
(f)
Determination of attainment.
EPA has determined that, as of November 19, 2012, the Sacramento Metro 1-hour ozone nonattainment area has attained the 1-hour ozone standard, based upon complete, quality-assured and certified ambient air quality monitoring data for 2007-2009.
(g)

(h)
Determination of attainment.
EPA has determined that, as of August 17, 2016, the San Joaquin Valley 1-hour ozone nonattainment area has attained the 1-hour ozone standard, based upon sufficient, quality-assured and certified ambient air quality monitoring data for 2012-2014.
(i)
Determination of attainment.
The EPA has determined that, as of January 20, 2017, the San Luis Obispo (Eastern San Luis Obispo) 2008 8-hour ozone nonattainment area in California has attained the 2008 ozone standard by the July 20, 2016 applicable attainment date, based upon complete, quality-assured and certified data for 2013-2015. Therefore, the EPA has met its obligation pursuant to CAA section 181(b)(2)(A) to determine, based on the area's air quality data as of the attainment date, whether the area attained the standard. As a result of this determination, the San Luis Obispo (Eastern San Luis Obispo) 2008 ozone nonattainment area in California will not be reclassified for failure to attain by the July 20, 2016 applicable attainment date under section 181(b)(2)(A).
(j)
Determination of attainment.
The EPA has determined that, as of February 21, 2017, the Mariposa County 2008 8-hour ozone nonattainment area in California has attained the 2008 ozone standard, based upon complete, quality-assured and certified data for 2013-2015. Under the provisions of the EPA's ozone implementation rule (see 40 CFR 51.1118), this determination suspends the requirements for the area to submit attainment demonstrations and associated reasonably available control measures, reasonable further progress plans, contingency measures for failure to attain or make reasonable further progress and other planning SIPs related to attainment of the 2008 ozone standard for as long as the area continues to attain the 2008 ozone standard. If the EPA determines, after notice-and-comment rulemaking, that the Mariposa County ozone nonattainment area no longer meets the 2008 ozone standard, the corresponding determination of attainment for this area shall be withdrawn.
(k)
Determination of attainment by the attainment date.
Effective September 23, 2019. The EPA has determined that the Mariposa County Moderate nonattainment area in California attained the 2008 8-hour ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) by the applicable attainment date of July 20, 2018, based upon complete quality-assured and certified data for the calendar years 2015-2017.

§ 52.285
Review of new sources and modifications—Mojave Desert Air Quality Management District.
(a)
Plan overview
—(1)
What is the purpose of the Federal Implementation Plan (FIP or “plan”)?
(i) The FIP has the following purposes: It establishes the Federal preconstruction permitting requirements for new major sources and major modifications located in nonattainment areas within the Mojave Desert Air Quality Management District (MDAQMD or “District”) that are major for a nonattainment pollutant.
(ii) The plan serves as the Federal nonattainment new source review (NNSR or “nonattainment major NSR”) plan for the area described in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, which the EPA has determined does not meet all of the Clean Air Act (CAA or “Act”) title I part D requirements for NNSR programs. Sources subject to the plan must comply with the provisions and requirements of 40 CFR part 51, appendix S. The FIP also sets forth the criteria and procedures that the reviewing authority (as defined in paragraph (b)(1)(v) of this section) must use to issue permits under the plan. For the purposes of the plan, the term
SIP
means any EPA-approved implementation plan for the area administered by the MDAQMD.
(iii) Paragraph (f)(3) of this section sets forth procedures for appealing a permit decision issued under the plan.
(iv) The plan does not apply in Indian country, as defined in 18 U.S.C. 1151 and 40 CFR 49.167, located within the MDAQMD.
(2)
Where does the plan apply?
(i) The provisions of the plan apply to the proposed construction of any new major stationary source or major modification in the MDAQMD that is major for a nonattainment pollutant, if the stationary source or modification is located anywhere in the designated nonattainment area.
(3)
What general provisions apply under the plan?
The following general provisions apply to you as an owner or operator of a source:
(i) If you propose to construct a new major source or a major modification in a nonattainment area in the MDAQMD, you must obtain a Federal NNSR permit (“permit”) under the plan before beginning actual construction. You may not begin actual construction after the effective date of the plan without applying for and receiving a Federal NNSR permit that authorizes construction pursuant to the plan.
(ii) You must construct and operate your source or modification in accordance with the terms of your permit issued under the plan.
(iii) Issuance of a permit under the plan does not relieve you of the responsibility to fully comply with applicable provisions of any EPA-approved implementation plan or FIP, and any other requirements under applicable law. This includes obligations to comply with any EPA-approved SIP provisions that satisfy Federal new source review (NSR) requirements.
(b)
Definitions.
For the purposes of the plan, the definitions in 40 CFR part 51, appendix S, paragraph II.A, and 40 CFR 51.100 apply, except for paragraphs (b)(1) through (6) of this section, which replace the corresponding definitions found in part 51, appendix S:
(1)
Actual emissions
means the actual rate of emissions of a regulated NSR pollutant from an emissions unit, as determined in accordance with paragraphs (b)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section, except that this paragraph (b)(1) shall not apply for calculating whether a significant emissions increase has occurred, or for establishing a PAL under
paragraph IV.K of 40 CFR part 51, appendix S. Instead, 40 CFR part 51, appendix S, paragraphs II.A.24 and 30, shall apply for those purposes.
(i) In general, actual emissions as of a particular date shall equal the average rate, in tons per year, at which the unit actually emitted the pollutant during a consecutive 24-month period that precedes the particular date and that is representative of normal source operation. The reviewing authority shall allow the use of a different time period upon a determination that it is more representative of normal source operation. Actual emissions shall be calculated using the unit's actual operating hours, production rates, and types of materials processed, stored, or combusted during the selected time period.
(ii) For any emissions unit that has not begun normal operations on the particular date, actual emissions shall equal the potential to emit of the unit on that date.
(2)
Enforceable as a practical matter
means that an emission limitation or other standard is both legally and practicably enforceable as follows:
(i) An emission limitation or other standard is legally enforceable if the reviewing authority has the legal power to enforce it.
(ii) Practical enforceability for an emission limitation or for other standards (design standards, equipment standards, work practices, operational standards, pollution prevention techniques) in a permit for a source is achieved if the permit's provisions specify:
(A) A limitation or standard and the emissions units or activities at the source subject to the limitation or standard;
(B) The time period for the limitation or standard (
e.g.,
hourly, daily, monthly and/or annual limits such as rolling annual limits); and
(C) The method to determine compliance, including appropriate monitoring, recordkeeping, reporting, and testing.
(3)
Environmental Appeals Board
means the Board within the EPA described in 40 CFR 1.25(e).
(4)
Nonattainment pollutant
means any regulated NSR pollutant for which the MDAQMD, or portion of the MDAQMD, has been designated as nonattainment, as codified in 40 CFR 81.305, as well as any precursor of such regulated NSR pollutant specified in 40 CFR part 51, appendix S, paragraph II.A.31.(ii)(b).
(5)
Reviewing authority
means the Administrator of EPA Region IX, but it may include the MDAQMD if the Administrator delegates the power to administer the FIP under paragraph (g) of this section.
(6)
Significant
means, in reference to an emissions increase or a net emissions increase, and notwithstanding the definition of “significant” in 40 CFR part 51, appendix S, paragraph II.A.10, any increase in actual emissions of volatile organic compounds or oxides of nitrogen that would result from any physical change in, or change in the method of operation of, a major stationary source locating in a serious or severe ozone nonattainment area if such emissions increase of volatile organic compounds or oxides of nitrogen exceeds 25 tons per year when aggregated with all other net emissions increases from the source over any period of 5 consecutive calendar years that includes the calendar year in which such increase occurred.
(c)
Does the plan apply to me?
(1) In any MDAQMD nonattainment area, the requirements of the plan apply to you under the following circumstances:
(i) If you propose to construct a new major stationary source and your source is a major source of nonattainment pollutant(s).
(ii) If you own or operate a major stationary source and propose to construct a major modification, where your source is a major source of nonattainment pollutant(s) and the proposed modification is a major modification for the nonattainment pollutant.
(2) At such time that a particular source or modification becomes a major stationary source or major modification solely by virtue of a relaxation in any enforceable limitation that was established after August 7, 1980, on the capacity of the source or modification otherwise to emit a pollutant, such as a restriction on hours of operation, then the requirements of the plan shall apply to the source or modification as though construction
had not yet commenced on the source or modification.
(d)
Permit approval criteria
—(1)
What are the general criteria for permit approval?
The criteria for approval of applications for permits submitted pursuant to the plan are provided in part D of title I of the Act and in 40 CFR 51.160 through 51.165 and 40 CFR part 51, appendix S.
(2)
What are the plan-specific criteria for permit approval?
Consistent with the requirements in 40 CFR part 51, appendix S, the reviewing authority shall not approve a permit application unless it meets the following criteria:
(i) The lowest achievable emission rate (LAER) requirement for any NSR pollutant subject to the plan and monitoring, recordkeeping, reporting, and testing as necessary to assure compliance with LAER.
(ii) Certification that all existing major sources owned or operated by the applicant in California are in compliance or, on a schedule for compliance, with all applicable emission limitations and standards under the Act.
(iii) Any source or modification subject to the plan must obtain emission reductions (offsets) from existing sources in the area of the proposed source (whether or not under the same ownership) such that there will be reasonable progress toward attainment of the applicable NAAQS. Notwithstanding 40 CFR part 51, appendix S, paragraph IV.G.5, interprecursor offsetting is not permitted between precursors of ozone. A demonstration of reasonable progress toward attainment shall include:
(A) A demonstration that the emission offsets will provide a net air quality benefit in the affected area, as required under 40 CFR part 51, appendix S, paragraph IV.A, Condition 4.
(B) A demonstration that emissions reductions otherwise required by the Act are not credited for purposes of satisfying the offset requirements in this paragraph (d)(2)(iii) and part D of title I of the Act.
(iv) An analysis of alternative sites, sizes, production processes and environmental control techniques for such proposed major source or major modification that demonstrates that the benefits of the proposed major source or major modification significantly outweigh the environmental and social costs imposed as a result of its location, construction, or modification.
(3)
What are the application requirements?
The owner or operator of any proposed new major stationary source or major modification shall submit a complete application using EPA Region IX's electronic system, which is described in paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section. The application must include the information listed in this paragraph (d)(3) as well as the demonstrations to show compliance with paragraphs (d)(2)(i) through (iv) of this section. The reviewing authority's designation that an application is complete for purposes of permit processing does not preclude the reviewing authority from requesting or accepting any additional information.
(i)

(F) A projected operating schedule for each emissions unit included in the new source or modification.
(G) A determination as to whether the new source or modification will result in any secondary emissions.
(H) The emission rates of all regulated NSR pollutants, including fugitive and secondary emission rates, if applicable. The emission rates must be described in tons per year (tpy). If necessary, shorter-term rates must be described to allow for compliance using the applicable standard reference test method or other methodology specified
(
i.e.,
grams/liter, parts per million volume (ppmv) or parts per million weight (ppmw), lbs/MMBtu).
(I) The calculations on which the emission rate information is based, including fuel specifications, if applicable, and any other assumptions used to determine the emission rates (
e.g.,
higher heating value (HHV), sulfur content of natural gas, VOC content).
(J) The calculations, pursuant to 40 CFR part 51, appendix S, paragraph IV.I and IV.J, that are used to determine applicability of the plan, including the emission calculations (increases or decreases) for each project that occurred during the contemporaneous period, as applicable.
(K) The calculations, pursuant to 40 CFR part 51, appendix S, paragraph IV.A, used to determine the quantity of offsets required for the new source or modification.
(L) Identification of actual emission reductions that meet the offset integrity criteria of being real, surplus, quantifiable, permanent and federally enforceable.
(M) If applicable, a description of how performance testing will be conducted, including test methods and a general description of testing protocols.

What is the administrative record for each final permit?
(i) The reviewing authority must base final permit decisions on an administrative record consisting of:
(A) All comments received during any public comment period, including any extension or reopening;
(B) The tape or transcript of any hearing(s) held;
(C) Any written material submitted at such a hearing;
(D) Any new materials placed in the record as a result of the reviewing authority's evaluation of public comments;
(E) Other documents in the supporting files for the permit that were relied upon in the decision-making;
(F) The final Federal NNSR permit;
(G) The application and any supporting data furnished by you, the permit applicant;
(H) The draft permit or notice of intent to deny the application or to terminate the permit; and
(I) Other documents in the supporting files for the draft permit that were relied upon in the decision-making.
(ii) The additional documents required under paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section should be added to the record as soon as possible after their receipt or publication by the reviewing authority. The record must be complete on the date the final permit is issued.
(iii) Material readily available or published materials that are generally available and that are included in the administrative record under the standards of paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section need not be physically included in the same file as the rest of the record as long as it is specifically referred to in that file.
(3)
Can permit decisions be appealed?
(i) Permit decisions may be appealed under the permit appeal procedures of 40 CFR 124.19, and the provisions of that section applicable to prevention of significant deterioration (PSD) permits shall apply to permit decisions under the FIP. A petition for review must be filed with the Clerk of the Environmental Appeals Board within 30 days after the reviewing authority serves notice of the issuance of a final permit decision under the plan, in accordance with 40 CFR 124.19.
(ii) An appeal under paragraph (f)(3)(i) of this section is, under section 307(b) of the Act, a prerequisite to seeking judicial review of the final agency action.
(4)
Can my permit be reopened?
The reviewing authority may reopen an existing, currently-in-effect permit for cause on its own initiative, such as if it contains a material mistake or fails to assure compliance with requirements in this section. However, except for those permit reopenings that do not increase the emission limitations in the permit, such as permit reopenings that correct typographical, calculation and other errors, all other permit reopenings shall be carried out after the
opportunity for public notice and comment and in accordance with one or more of the public participation requirements under paragraph (e)(2) of this section.
(5)
Can my permit be rescinded?
(i) Any permit issued under this section, or a prior version of this section, shall remain in effect until it is rescinded under this paragraph (f)(5).
(ii) An owner or operator of a stationary source or modification who holds a permit issued under this section for the construction of a new source or modification that meets the requirement in paragraph (f)(5)(iii) of this section may request that the reviewing authority rescind the permit or a particular portion of the permit.
(iii) The reviewing authority may grant an application for rescission if the application shows that the provisions of the plan would not apply to the source or modification.
(iv) If the reviewing authority rescinds a permit under this paragraph (f), the public shall be given adequate notice of the rescission determination in accordance with paragraph (e)(2)(i)(B) of this section.

Administration and delegation of the Federal nonattainment major NSR plan in the MDAQMD
—(1)
Who administers the FIP in the MDAQMD?
(i) The Administrator is the reviewing authority and will directly administer all aspects of the FIP in the MDAQMD under Federal authority.
(ii) The Administrator may delegate Federal authority to administer specific portions of the FIP to the MDAQMD upon request, in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (g)(2) of this section. If the MDAQMD has been granted such delegation, it will be the reviewing authority for purposes of the provisions for which it has been granted delegation.
(2)
Delegation of administration of the FIP to the MDAQMD.
This paragraph (g)(2) establishes the process by which the Administrator may delegate authority to the MDAQMD in accordance with the provisions in paragraphs (g)(2)(i) through (iv) of this section. Any Federal requirements under the plan that are administered by the delegate MDAQMD are enforceable by the EPA under Federal law.
(i)
Information to be included in the Administrative Delegation Request.
To be delegated authority to administer the FIP or specific portions of it, the MDAQMD must submit a request to the Administrator.
(ii)
Delegation Agreement.
A Delegation Agreement will set forth the terms and conditions of the delegation, will specify the provisions that the delegate MDAQMD will be authorized to implement on behalf of the EPA and will be entered into by the Administrator and the MDAQMD. The Agreement will become effective upon the date that both the Administrator and the MDAQMD have signed the Agreement or as otherwise stated in the Agreement. Once the delegation becomes effective, the MDAQMD will be responsible, to the extent specified in the Agreement, for administration of the provisions of the FIP that are subject to the Agreement.
(iii)
Publication of notice of the Agreement.
The Administrator will publish a notice in the
Federal Register
informing the public of any Delegation Agreement. The Administrator also will publish the notice in a newspaper of general circulation in the MDAQMD. In addition, the Administrator will mail a copy of the notice to persons on a mailing list developed by the Administrator consisting of those persons who have requested to be placed on such a mailing list.
(iv)
Revision or revocation of an Agreement.
A Delegation Agreement may be modified, amended or revoked, in part or in whole, by the Administrator after consultation with the MDAQMD.

# Subpart G—Colorado
§ 52.319
Conditional approval.
(a) The EPA is making a limited conditional approval and limited disapproval of revisions committed to correcting deficiencies identified with submissions made on May 31, 2017, and May 10, 2019. The conditional approval is based upon the October 13, 2022 commitment from the State to submit a SIP revision consisting of rule revisions that will cure the identified deficiencies within twelve months after
the EPA's conditional approval. If the State fails to meet its commitment, the conditional approval will be treated as a disapproval with respect to the rules and CTG category for which the corrections are not met. The following rules are conditionally approved, except as they relate to periodic reporting requirements to the state for which we are disapproving, because we have determined that the rules strengthen the SIP and are largely consistent with the relevant CAA requirements:
(1) Regulation number 7 (Reg. 7), Part C, section I.P. and Reg. 7, Part E, section II.A.4. RACT requirements for the Colorado ozone SIP for the “Control Techniques Guidelines for Miscellaneous Metal and Plastic Parts Coatings,” Tables 5 and 7, EPA453/R08003, September 2008 and glass melting furnaces.
(2) [Reserved]
(b) [Reserved]

§ 52.322
Extensions.
The Administrator, by authority delegated under section 188(d) of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990, extends for one year (until December 31, 1995) the attainment date for the Denver, Colorado, PM-10 nonattainment area.
[60 FR 52315, Oct. 6, 1995]
§ 52.323
Approval status.
(a) With the exceptions set forth in this subpart, the Administrator approves Colorado's plan for the attainment and maintenance of the national standards under section 110 of the Clean Air Act. Furthermore, the Administrator finds that the plan satisfies all requirements of Part D, Title 1, of the Clean Air Act as amended in 1977, except as noted below.
(b)(1) Insofar as the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) provisions found in this subpart apply to stationary sources of greenhouse gas (GHGs) emissions, the Administrator approves that application only to the extent that GHGs are “subject to regulation”, as provided in this paragraph
(b), and the Administrator takes no action on that application to the extent that GHGs are not “subject to regulation.”
(2) Beginning January 2, 2011, the pollutant GHGs is subject to regulation if:
(i) The stationary source is a new major stationary source for a regulated NSR pollutant that is not GHGs, and also will emit or will have the potential to emit 75,000 tpy CO
2
e or more; or
(ii) The stationary source is an existing major stationary source for a regulated NSR pollutant that is not GHGs, and also will have an emissions increase of a regulated NSR pollutant, and an emissions increase of 75,000 tpy CO
2
e or more; and
(3) Beginning July 1, 2011, in addition to the provisions in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the pollutant GHGs shall also be subject to regulation:
(i) At a new stationary source that will emit or have the potential to emit 100,000 tpy CO
2
e; or
(ii) At an existing stationary source that emits or has the potential to emit 100,000 tpy CO
2
e, when such stationary source undertakes a physical change or change in the method of operation that will result in an emissions increase of 75,000 tpy CO
2
e or more.
(4) For purposes of this paragraph (b)—
(i) the term greenhouse gas shall mean the air pollutant defined in 40 CFR 86.1818-12(a) as the aggregate group of six greenhouse gases: Carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, methane, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, and sulfur hexafluoride.
(ii) the term tpy CO
2
equivalent emissions (CO
2
e) shall represent an amount of GHGs emitted, and shall be computed as follows:
(A) Multiplying the mass amount of emissions (tpy), for each of the six greenhouse gases in the pollutant GHGs, by the gas's associated global warming potential published at Table A-1 to subpart A of 40 CFR part 98—Global Warming Potentials.
(B) Sum the resultant value from paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(A) of this section for each gas to compute a tpy CO
2
e.
(iii) the term emissions increase shall mean that both a significant emissions increase (as calculated using the procedures in paragraphs I.A.2. through I.A.3, and I.B of Part D of Colorado's Air Quality Commission's Regulation Number 3) and a significant net emissions increase (as defined in paragraphs II.A.26 and II.A.42.a of Part D of Colorado's Air Quality Commission's Regulation Number 3) occur. For the pollutant GHGs, an emissions increase shall be based on tpy CO
2
e, and shall be calculated assuming the pollutant GHGs is a regulated NSR pollutant, and “significant” is defined as 75,000 tpy CO
2
e instead of applying the value in paragraph II.A.42.b of Part D of Colorado's Air Quality Commission's Regulation Number 3.
[75 FR 82553, Dec. 30, 2010]
§ 52.324
Legal authority.
(a) The requirements of § 51.230(f) of this chapter are not met since the State lacks the authority to require owners or operators of stationary sources to install, maintain, and use emission monitoring devices and to make periodic reports to the State on the nature and amounts of emissions from such stationary sources.
(b) Delegation of authority: Pursuant to section 114 of the Act, Colorado requested a delegation of authority to enable it to require sources to install and maintain monitoring equipment and to report periodically on the nature and amount of their emissions. The Administrator has determined that Colorado is qualified to receive a delegation of the authority it requested. Accordingly, the Administrator delegates to Colorado his authority under section 114(a)(1)(B) and (C) of the Act, i.e., authority to require sources within the State of Colorado to install and maintain monitoring equipment and to report periodically on the nature and amount of their emissions.

) exemptions.
The Denver Regional Council of Governments (DRCOG) submitted a NO
X
exemption petition to the EPA on May 25, 1994 and submitted supporting documentation via a letter dated August 1,
1994. This petition requested that the Denver metropolitan area, a transitional ozone nonattainment area, be exempted from the requirement to meet the NO
X
provisions of the Federal transportation and general conformity rule with respect to ozone. The exemption request was based on monitoring data which demonstrated that the National Ambient Air Quality Standard for ozone had been attained in this area for the 3 years prior to the petition. The EPA approved this exemption request on July 28, 1995.

(118) On June 20, 2003, the State of Colorado submitted revisions to Colorado's Common Provisions Regulation, 5 CCR 1001-2, that revised the definitions of continuous monitoring system, emergency power generator, enforceable, federally enforceable, manufacturing process or process equipment, and volatile organic compounds. Deleted definitions included but were not limited to actual emissions, Best Available Control Technology (BACT), Lowest Achievable Emission Rate (LAER), and what conditions determine the modification of a source. These definitions were deleted in the Common Provisions because they appear in Colorado's Regulation 3. The State clarified that fuel burning equipment emissions are considered a part of the manufacturing process emissions when the emissions are vented through a common stack.
However, fuel burning equipment emissions vented from a separate stack are subject to regulations unique to fuel burning equipment. In addition, the State deleted and reserved Section III of the Common Provisions regarding smoking gasoline powered motor vehicles. The provisions regarding smoking gasoline powered motor vehicles were considered by the State to be obsolete. The revisions to the Common Provisions also included minor changes designed to fix ambiguous language, to make the definitions more readable or to delete obsolete or duplicative definitions.

(121) On August 8, 2006, the State of Colorado submitted revisions to Colorado's 5 CCR 1001-3, Regulation 1, that allows for the use of obscurants during
military exercises at the Fort Carson Military Base and Pinón Canyon Maneuver Site in Colorado while precautionary steps are taken during the exercise to maintain air quality. The State modified the equipment requirements and work practices (abatement and control measures) in Regulation 1 intended to control the emissions of particulates, smokes and SO
2
from new and existing stationary sources. Consistent with its use of the term elsewhere, the State added the attainment/maintenance nomenclature. The revision also provides a new numbering scheme for each section of the regulation.
The State adopted EPA test method 9 (part 60 of this title, Appendix A-4) as it is applied to Standards of Performance for Steel Plants (§ 60.275a of this title). The State revised manufacturing process emission rates, to clarify that the applicability of the section is to process equipment with a design rate of 30 tons per hour or less. The averaging time for emission standards of all existing sources of SO
2
shall be a three hour rolling average. New sources of SO
2
not specifically regulated within Regulation 1 are limited to two tons per day and are subject to BACT.

(h) Approval—On June 28, 2004, the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection (CT DEP) submitted a request to establish limited maintenance plans for the Hartford-New Britain-Middletown Connecticut carbon monoxide attainment area, the New Haven-Meriden-Waterbury Connecticut carbon monoxide attainment area, and the Connecticut portion of the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island carbon monoxide attainment area for the remainder of the individual area's initial ten-year maintenance plan. As part of the maintenance plan request, CT DEP also requested approval of a second follow-on ten-year carbon monoxide maintenance plan for the Hartford-New Britain-Middletown carbon monoxide attainment area (period 2006 to 2015), for the New Haven-Meriden-Waterbury carbon monoxide attainment area (period 2009 to 2018), and for the Connecticut portion of the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island carbon monoxide attainment area (period 2011 to 2020). The State of Connecticut has committed to: maintain a continuous carbon monoxide monitoring network in each carbon monoxide maintenance area; implement contingency measures in the event of an exceedance of the carbon monoxide
National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) in any of the three maintenance areas; coordinate with EPA in the event the carbon monoxide design value(s) in any maintenance area(s) exceed 7.65 ppm, to verify the validity of the data and, if warranted based on the data review, develop a full maintenance plan(s) for the affected maintenance area(s); and, ensure that project-level carbon monoxide evaluations of transportation projects in each area are carried out as part of environmental reviews or Connecticut's indirect source permitting program. The limited maintenance plans satisfy all applicable requirements of section 175A of the Clean Air Act. Approval of a Limited Maintenance Plan is conditioned on maintaining levels of ambient carbon monoxide levels below the required limited maintenance plan 8-hour carbon monoxide design value criterion of 7.65 parts per million. If the Limited Maintenance Plan criterion is no longer satisfied, Connecticut must develop a full maintenance plan to meet Clean Air Act requirements.

40 CFR 51.918), this determination suspends the reasonable further progress and attainment demonstration requirements of section 182(b)(1) and related requirements of section 172(c)(9) of the Clean Air Act for as long as the area does not monitor any violations of the 1997 8-hour ozone standard. If a violation of the 1997 ozone NAAQS is monitored in the Greater Connecticut 8-hour ozone nonattainment area, this determination shall no longer apply. In addition, this area met its June 15, 2010 attainment deadline for the 1997 ozone standard.
(g) Approval—Submittal from the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection, dated December 28, 2007, to address the Clean Air Act (CAA) infrastructure requirements for the 1997 ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS). This submittal satisfies the requirements of CAA sections 110(a)(2)(A), (B), (C), (E), (F), (G), (H), (J), (K), (L), and (M).
(h) Conditional Approval—Submittal from the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection, dated December 28, 2007, to address the Clean Air Act (CAA) infrastructure requirements for the 1997 ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS). On May 2, 2011, the State of Connecticut supplemented this submittal with a commitment to address the requirements of section 110(a)(2)(D)(ii) of the CAA that requires notification of affected states for Prevention of Significant Deterioration purposes. EPA is conditionally approving Connecticut's submittal with respect to CAA section 110(a)(2)(D)(ii).
(i) Determination of Attainment for the One-Hour Ozone Standard. Effective April 16, 2012, EPA is determining that the Greater Connecticut one-hour ozone nonattainment area did not meet its applicable one-hour ozone attainment date of November 15, 2007, based on 2005-2007 complete, quality-assured ozone monitoring data. Separate from and independent of this determination, EPA is determining that the Greater Connecticut one-hour ozone nonattainment area met the one-hour ozone standard, based on 2008-2010 complete, quality-assured ozone monitoring data at all monitoring sites in the area. EPA's review of the ozone data shows that the area began attaining the one-hour ozone standard during the 2006-2008 monitoring period, and has continued attaining the one-hour standard through the 2007-2009 and 2008-2010 monitoring periods.
(j) Determination of Attainment for the One-Hour Ozone Standard. Effective July 18, 2012, EPA is determining that the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island (NY-NJ-CT) one-hour ozone nonattainment area did not meet its applicable one-hour ozone attainment date of November 15, 2007, based on 2005-2007 complete, quality-assured and certified ozone monitoring data. Separate from and independent of this determination, EPA is determining
that the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island (NY-NJ-CT) one-hour ozone nonattainment area has attained the one-hour ozone standard, based on 2008-2010 complete, quality-assured and certified ozone monitoring data at all monitoring sites in the area and data showing the area continued to attain through 2011.
(k) Determination of Attainment for the Eight-Hour Ozone Standard. Effective July 18, 2012 EPA is determining, that complete, quality-assured and certified ozone monitoring data for 2007-2009 show the NY-NJ-CT eight-hour ozone nonattainment area attained the 1997 eight-hour ozone standard by its June 15, 2010 attainment deadline. Therefore, EPA has met the requirement pursuant to CAA section 181(b)(2)(A) to determine, based on the area's air quality data as of the attainment date, whether the area attained the standard. EPA also determined that the NY-NJ-CT nonattainment area will not be reclassified for failure to attain by its applicable attainment date under section 181(b)(2)(A). EPA is also determining that the NY-NJ-CT eight-hour ozone nonattainment area currently continues to attain the eight-hour ozone NAAQS, based on complete, quality-assured and certified data for 2008-2010 and data through 2011. This determination, in accordance with 40 CFR 51.918, suspends the requirements for this area to submit an attainment demonstration, associated reasonably available control measures, a reasonable further progress plan, contingency measures, and other planning SIPs related to attainment of the standard for as long as this area continues to meet the 1997 annual eight-hour ozone NAAQS.
(l) Approval—Revisions to the Connecticut State Implementation Plan (SIP) submitted on December 8, 2006. The SIP revision satisfies the requirement to implement reasonably available control technology (RACT) for sources of volatile organic compounds (VOC) and oxides of nitrogen (NO
X
) for purposes of the 1997 8-hour ozone standard. Specifically, the following sections of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies are approved for this purpose: For VOC RACT, 22a-174-20, Control of Organic Compound Emissions, 22a-174-30, Dispensing of Gasoline/Stage I and Stage II Vapor Recovery, and 22a-174-32, RACT for Organic Compounds; for NO
X
RACT, 22a-174-22, Control of Nitrogen Oxide Emissions, and 22a-174-38, Municipal Waste Combustors.

(n) Approval—An attainment demonstration for the 1997 8-hour ozone standard to satisfy requirements of section 182(c)(2)(A) of the Clean Air Act, and a Reasonably Available Control Measure (RACM) analysis to satisfy requirements of section 172(c)(1) of the Clean Air Act for the Greater Connecticut ozone nonattainment area, submitted by the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection on February 1, 2008.
(o) Revisions to the State Implementation Plan submitted by the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection on February 1, 2008. These revisions are for the purpose of satisfying the rate of progress requirement of section 182(b)(1) from 2002 through 2008, and the contingency measure requirement of sections 172(c)(9) and of the Clean Air Act, for the Greater Connecticut moderate 8-hour ozone nonattainment area, and the Connecticut portion of the New York-New Jersey-Long Island moderate 8-hour ozone nonattainment area. These revisions establish motor vehicle emission budgets for 2008 of 29.7 tons per day of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and 60.5 tons per day of nitrogen oxides (NOx) to be used in transportation conformity in the Connecticut portion of the New York-New Jersey-Long Island moderate 8-hour ozone nonattainment area. These revisions also establish motor vehicle emission budgets for 2008 for the Greater Connecticut moderate 8-hour ozone nonattainment area of 28.5 tons per day for VOCs, and 54.3 tons per day for NOx.
(p)
Rescission of clean data determination for the 1997 eight-hour ozone standard.
Effective June 3, 2016, the EPA is
determining that complete quality-assured and certified ozone monitoring data for 2012-2014 show the NY-NJ-CT 1997 eight-hour ozone nonattainment area did not meet 1997 eight-hour ozone standard. Therefore, the EPA is rescinding the clean data determination for the 1997 eight-hour ozone standard only. The prior determination (
see
paragraph k of this section) is in accordance with 40 CFR 51.918. The prior determination suspended the requirements for this area to submit an attainment demonstration, associated reasonably available control measures, a reasonable further progress plan, contingency measures, and other planning SIPs related to attainment of the standard for as long as this area continues to meet the 1997 annual eight-hour ozone NAAQS. This rescission of the clean data determination will result in a SIP Call for a new ozone attainment demonstration, associated reasonably available control measures, a reasonable further progress plan, contingency measures, and other planning SIPs related to attainment of the standard, for this area only. If the revised plan is approved by the EPA as demonstrating reasonable further progress and attainment for the more stringent 2008 NAAQS by the Moderate area attainment date, and is approved by the EPA as containing adequate contingency measures for the 2008 NAAQS, then the plan would be deemed to have also satisfied requirements of the SIP Call associated with violations for the 1997 NAAQS.
(q) Approval—Revisions to the Connecticut State Implementation Plan (SIP) submitted on July 18, 2014. The SIP revision satisfies the requirement to implement reasonably available control technology (RACT) for sources of volatile organic compounds (VOC) and oxides of nitrogen (NO
X
) for purposes of the 2008 ozone standard. Specifically, the following sections of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies are approved for this purpose: For VOC RACT, 22a-174-20, Control of Organic Compound Emissions, 22a-174-30, Dispensing of Gasoline/Stage I and Stage II Vapor Recovery, and 22a-174-32, RACT for Organic Compounds; for NO
X
RACT, 22a-174-22, Control of nitrogen oxide emissions, 22a-174-22e, Control of nitrogen oxide emissions from fuel burning equipment at major sources, 22a-174-22f, High daily NO
X
emitting units at non-major sources of nitrogen oxides, and 22a-174-38, Municipal Waste Combustors.
(r)
Approval
—Submittal from the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection dated March 9, 2017, to address the nonattainment new source review requirements for the 2008 8-hour ozone NAAQS for the Greater Connecticut and the New York-N. New Jersey-Long Island, NY-NJ-CT ozone nonattainment areas, as it meets the requirements for both the State's marginal and moderate classifications.
(s)
Approval
—An attainment demonstration for the 1997 8-hour ozone standard to satisfy requirements of section 182(c)(2)(A) of the Clean Air Act, and a Reasonably Available Control Measure (RACM) analysis to satisfy requirements of section 172(c)(1) of the Clean Air Act for the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island (NY-NJ-CT) ozone nonattainment area, submitted by the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection. This rulemaking addresses the EPA's obligations to act on Connecticut's February 1, 2008 SIP revision for the 1997 ozone NAAQS, as well as the attainment demonstration and RACM analysis portion of the August 8, 2017 SIP submittal for the 1997 ozone NAAQS for the Connecticut portion of the NY-NJ-CT area.
(t)
Approval.
Revisions to the State Implementation Plan submitted by the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection on January 17, 2017, September 5, 2017, and August 8, 2017, to meet, in part, requirements of the 2008 ozone NAAQS. These revisions satisfy the rate of progress requirement of section 182(b) through 2017, the contingency measure requirements of section 172(c)(9), the emission statement requirements of section 182(a)(3)(B), and the reasonably available control measure requirement of section 172(c)(1) for the Connecticut portion of the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island, NY-NJ-CT area, and the Greater Connecticut moderate ozone nonattainment areas. The January 17, 2017 revision establishes motor vehicle emissions budgets for 2017 of
15.9 tons per day of VOC and 22.2 tons per day of NO
X
to be used in transportation conformity in the Greater Connecticut moderate ozone nonattainment area. The August 8, 2017 revision establishes motor vehicle emissions budgets for 2017 of 17.6 tons per day of VOC and 24.6 tons per day of NO
X
to be used in transportation conformity in the Connecticut portion of the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island, NY-NJ-CT moderate ozone nonattainment area.
(u)
Determination of attainment for the 2008 ozone standard.
Effective November 7, 2022 EPA is determining that complete, quality-assured and certified ozone monitoring data for 2018-2020 show the Greater Connecticut, CT ozone nonattainment area attained the 2008 ozone NAAQS by its July 20, 2021, attainment deadline. Therefore, EPA has met the requirement pursuant to CAA section 181(b)(2)(A) to determine, based on the area's air quality data as of the attainment date, whether the area attained the standard.
(v)
Approval
—Submittal from the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection dated December 21, 2020, to address the nonattainment new source review (NNSR) requirements as a serious nonattainment area for the 2008 8-hour ozone standard for the Greater Connecticut and the New York-N. New Jersey-Long Island, NY-NJ-CT ozone nonattainment areas, and also approves NNSR for Connecticut for the 2015 ozone standard as a state containing a moderate and a marginal nonattainment area and being located within the Ozone Transport Region as it meets the requirements for both the state's marginal and moderate classifications.
(w)

Revisions to the State Implementation Plan submitted by the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection on June 23, 2022, November 17, 2022, and December 12, 2022, to meet, in part, requirements of the 2008 ozone NAAQS. These revisions satisfy the rate of progress requirement of section 182(b) through 2020 for the Connecticut portion of the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island, NY-NJ-CT area. The revisions also establish motor vehicle emissions budgets for 2020 of 17.6 tons per day of VOC and 23.3 tons per day of NO
X
to be used in transportation conformity in the Connecticut portion of the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island, NY-NJ-CT moderate ozone nonattainment area. Additionally, we are concurring with the State's determination that its I/M program meets the performance standard and requirements for Enhanced I/M, and determining that Connecticut meets the clean-fuel vehicle program of section 182(c)(4) of the Clean Air Act.
(x)
Approval.
Revisions to the State Implementation Plan (SIP) submitted from the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection dated May 22, 2023, to meet, in part, the requirements of the 2015 ozone NAAQS. These revisions:

.
(a) Approval—On June 23, 2005, the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection submitted a request to redesignate the City of New Haven PM
10
nonattainment area to attainment for PM
10
. The redesignation request and the initial ten-year maintenance plan (2006-2015) meet the redesignation requirements in sections 107(d)(3)(E) and 175A of the Act as amended in 1990, respectively.
(b) Approval—On June 23, 2005, the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection (CT DEP) submitted a request to establish a Limited Maintenance Plan (LMP) for the City of New Haven PM
10
attainment area for the area's initial ten-year maintenance
plan (2006-2015). The State of Connecticut has committed to: maintain a PM
10
monitoring network in the New Haven PM
10
maintenance area; implement contingency measures in the event of an exceedance of the PM
10
National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) in the maintenance area; coordinate with EPA in the event the PM
10
design value in the maintenance area exceeds 98 µgm/m
3
for the 24-hour PM
10
NAAQS or 40 µgm/m
3
for the annual PM
10
NAAQS; and to verify the validity of the data and, if warranted based on the data review, develop a full maintenance plan for the maintenance area. The LMP satisfies all applicable requirements of section 175A of the Clean Air Act. Approval of the LMP is conditioned on maintaining levels of ambient PM
10
below a PM
10
design value criteria of 98 µgm/m
3
for the 24-hour PM
10
NAAQS and 40 µgm/m
3
for the annual PM
10
NAAQS. For the Criscuolo Park site, Connecticut still qualifies for the LMP option if, based on five years of site data, the average design values (ADVs) of the continuous PM
10
monitor are less than the site-specific critical design value (CDV). If the LMP criteria are no longer satisfied, Connecticut must develop a full maintenance plan to meet Clean Air Act requirements.

§ 52.387
Interstate Transport for the 1997 8-hour ozone and PM
2.5
NAAQS.
On March 13, 2007, the State of Connecticut submitted a State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision addressing the Section 110(a)(2)(D)(i) interstate transport requirements of the Clean Air Act for the 1997 8-hour ozone and PM

Nonattainment new source review.
(a)
Disapproval.
EPA is disapproving Delaware's October 15, 2013 submittal of revisions to 7 DNREC 1125, sections 2.5.5 and 2.5.6 because it does not meet Clean Air Act (CAA) requirements which establish the criteria under which the owner or operator of a new or modified major stationary source must obtain the required emission offsets for the nonattainment new source review (NSR) preconstruction permitting program and because Delaware exercises authorities that are reserved for EPA under section 107 of the CAA. Delaware's Federally-approved nonattainment NSR preconstruction program in 7 DNREC 1125, sections 1.0 through 3.16.4, effective in Delaware on February 11, 2012, was fully-approved by EPA on October 2, 2012 and continues to apply.
